<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Villagers Killed by Indian Border Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Indian border guards Tuesday once
again intruded into Bangladesh and shot dead two brothers at
frontier village Khalisa Kotal in Kurigram district, some 400
kilometers northwest of Dhaka, the United News of Bangladesh (UNB)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said tensions mounted in the area as India's Border
Security Force (BSF) equipped with heavy guns hoisted red flags in
their territory while Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) personnel were
reinforced to face any situation.
</P>
<P>
Locals said the BSF men crossed into Khalisa Kotal village near
No. 934 border demarcation pillar and gunned down Sagiruddin, 30,
and Ekramul, 26, who were working in the field at about 8:30 am.
</P>
<P>
"The BSF men intruded in the Bangladesh territory, ordered the
working brothers to quit. As they refused to follow the BSF
command, they were shot," said a spot report.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the deaths, a BDR source said, "The matter will be
strongly protested. We have also reinforced our troops to face any
situation."
</P>
<P>
Talking to the UNB, a villager said BSF's "aggression"
heightened recently. Last month, a Bangladeshi national was killed
by the BSF at Karla enclave, three kilometers off Khalisa Kotal
village.

WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
opened a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Tuesday at David Camp,
Maryland, hoping that his mediation could help solve the decades-
long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians and reach a
final status agreement between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at the
presidential retreat that Clinton already met Arafat outside of
his cabin shortly after noon and was to hold a similar private
session with Barak before bringing the two Middle East leaders
together for their first face-to-face talks at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for the Camp David, Clinton said that
Arafat and Barak now face "profound and wrenching" questions that
cannot be resolved without compromise.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "Both leaders feel the weight of history but both,
I believe, recognize this is a moment in history which they can
seize. We have an opportunity to bring about a just and enduring
end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This is the key to
lasting peace in the entire Middle East."
</P>
<P>
He said that both Barak and Arafat have demonstrated their
determination to reach an agreement. "In the process, they have
passed the point of no return. The only way forward now is forward.
Both sides must find a way to resolve competing claims, to give
their children the gift of peace."
</P>
<P>
"It will take patience, creativity and courage," he said. "I'll
do everything I can over the coming days to see that this moment
of promise is fulfilled."
</P>
<P>
Clinton admitted that his task to help solve the conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians was very difficult.
</P>
<P>
The remaining tough issues include the status of Jerusalem, the
final border between Israel and the future Palestinian state and
the return of refugees, who fled the first conflict between the
Israelis and the Arabs in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Barak who survived a no-confidence vote in the Israeli
parliament on Monday, has signaled his willingness to expand
considerably the 40 percent of the West Bank he has promised to
the Palestinians, and to extend Palestinians control in Jerusalem
to Arab-populated suburbs.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians demand the entire West Bank, captured by
Israel during the 1967 Middle East war, be returned to them and
Jerusalem be the capital of their future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Private Firms Urged to Fight AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Global Business Council (
GBC) on HIV and AIDS Tuesday made an impassioned appeal for
companies around the world to take action against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"This disease is the defining humanitarian crisis of our time,
and yet the corporate response to date has been inadequate given
the scale of the epidemic," said Bill Roedy, new chairman of GBC
and president of MTV Networks International at the 13th
International Aids Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The business community has a key role to play in the fight
against HIV/AIDS... We have no choice but to get involved," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Roedy, also a UNAIDS ambassador, launched a five-point plan to
specify the role business can play in the battle to curtail the
international scourge, including raising public awareness of AIDS,
supporting community education campaigns and encouraging
businesses to get involved in the fight against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
To boost the work of GBC, World Bank president James Wolfensohn
would become GBC's new honorary president, succeeding Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In a special statement, Wolfensohn echoed Roedy's call to
business, saying that the private sector has "a pivotal role to
play" given the vast human and material resources at its disposal.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Workers' Strike Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The 21-day wage strike by workers of
Nigeria' s economic capital, Lagos, has been suspended to allow
for further negotiations between the workers and the state
government, a top labor leader announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Adams Oshiomhole, president of the Nigeria Labor Congress, the
country's umbrella labor union, announced the decision while
addressing the workers after a four-hour meeting with Lagos
Governor Bola Tinubu.
</P>
<P>
After the federal government announced a new monthly minimum
wage of 7,500 naira for its workers and 5,500 naira for their
state counterparts on May 29, Lagos civil servants demanded the
same amount as the federal workers, a demand rejected by the
government, setting the stage for the strike.
</P>
<P>
A concession by the government to pay the demanded wage only to
junior workers and a graduated salary increase to senior civil
servants was also rejected by the workers.
</P>
<P>
The government later withdrew the offer and reverted to the 5,
500 naira which all the 36 state governors agreed to pay their
workers at a meeting in Abuja last week.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja meeting was called after workers in the states,
demanding a minimum wage of between 6,500 naira and 7,500 naira,
either went on strike or threatened to do so.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the suspension of the strike, Oshiomhole told the
workers that there is need for them to change their "tactics" and
to alleviate the problems being faced by the estimated 6 million
Lagos population.
</P>
<P>
The strike had paralyzed all government activities, closed
public schools, crippled health services, and halted public water
supply.

<HEADLINE> Liberia Gets New Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles Taylor
has endorsed Moses Z. Blah, a comrade of him in the former rebel
forces, the new vice president of the country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here on Tuesday from Liberia' s capital
Monrovia confirmed that Blah, Liberian ambassador to Libya and
Tunisia, is to replace late Vice President Enoch Dogolea who died
late June in a clinic in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
Blah was unanimously named for the post Monday by the executive
committee of the ruling National Patriotic Party.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian constitution requires the nominee to be confirmed
by parliament. Taylor has set Blah's inauguration for next Monday.
He said Blah would be confirmed because his party dominates the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Blah is little known among Liberians except for his role as a "
special forces" commando in Taylor's erstwhile National Patriotic
Front of Liberia that ignited the Liberian civil war.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Taylor threatened to "personally deal with anyone
spreading rumors" that the late vice president was murdered.
</P>
<P>
One version of rumors has it that the vice president was
poisoned, while another says he was severely flogged by Taylor's
bodyguards for his alleged involvement in a plot to depose the
president.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who had ordered a "comprehensive autopsy" apparently
based on the persistent rumors, said he would make public the
autopsy report and medical records of the deceased from hospitals
in Spain, France and Cote d'Ivoire for scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter, anyone caught spreading rumors about Dogolea's
death will face the law to prove it," Taylor said on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Venezuela Vow to Rebalance Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Venezuela on
Wednesday committed themselves to work with other major oil
producers to bring balance to the world oil market which has seen
prices hovering at about 30 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after a meeting between Saudi
Oil Minister Ali Bin Ibrahim al-N'aimi and his visiting Venezuelan
counterpart Ali Rodriguez Araque, the two countries pledged to
redress the shortages in the oil market to ease the high price.
</P>
<P>
Both countries agree that the world oil market is stable and
there is no need to raise the production of the Organization of
Petroleum Export Countries at present, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
However, "current situation and the near future outlook for
products point to an imbalanced market," it went on to say, adding
that the two countries would ensure "adequate and timely supplies."
</P>
<P>
Venezuela, along with another OPEC heavy-weight producer Iran,
has until now been opposed to a Saudi proposal to raise oil
production to bring down prices to OPEC's target of 25 dollars a
barrel, saying extra supplies agreed by OPEC in June should be
given time to reach the market.
</P>
<P>
OPEC members agreed at their June 21 meeting to raise daily
production by 708,000 barrels as of July 1. But the hike has so far
been unable to push down the soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez, who is also OPEC president, arrived in Saudi Arabia
on Wednesday from Kuwait, where he had met with Kuwaiti Oil
Minister Sheikh Saud Nasser Al-Sabah, who said later that OPEC
might raise oil production by the end of July if prices remain
high.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Approves Maritime Border Pact With Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti National Assembly
(parliament) on Wednesday approved the maritime border agreement
with Saudi Arabia signed earlier this month, the official KUNA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
All 53 parliamentarians and cabinet ministers present at the
ballot voted in favor of the agreement, which had already been
approved by the Kuwaiti cabinet on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia approved the pact earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed in the Kuwaiti capital by Kuwaiti Foreign
Minister Sabah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah and his Saudi counterpart Saud Al-
Faisal on July 2 during a visit to Kuwait by Saudi Crown Prince
Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The deal was designed to settle any border dispute between Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait over their land boundaries, demarcated about 80
years ago, and the sea lines including the Persian Gulf-located al-
Dorah oilfield which is disputed between Kuwait and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The pact gives Kuwait full sovereignty over the Gulf islands of
Karuh and Umm Al-Maradem, Kuwait's southernmost island, as well as
the island of Felka.
</P>
<P>
The pact stipulates that the new Kuwaiti-Saudi maritime border
will be 1.25 nautical miles south of Umm Al-Maradem.
</P>
<P>
The pact also involves common sharing of the rich natural
resources in the area.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia will conduce to a
similar settlement with Iran.

JERUSALEM -- U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Roed-Larsen said

In a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy here,
Larsen said it was hard to say exactly when the peacekeeping troops
would deploy in south Lebanon "because we are waiting for all

Israel pulled all its forces out of south Lebanon on May 24,
ending its 22-year occupation of the land there. However, the U.N.

<HEADLINE> A Minute of Silence in Greece for Victims of Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Greece Wednesday held a minute of
silence in all public and government services around the country
in memory of the victims of terrorism in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local television and radio channels
broadcasted a brief public awareness message condemning terrorism
and urged the Greek people to help wipe out such phenomena because
it was a threat for modern Greece.
</P>
<P>
The message said that terrorism constituted an insult for the
Greeks and the battle against terrorism was a priority, not only
for the state but also for the Greek people, its political culture.
</P>
<P>
The message stressed that it was a commitment undertaken by
the Greek government and the society's objective to continue the
effort aimed at uprooting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's one minute of silence came after the killing by
Greece's November 17 terrorist group of Britain's military attache
in Athens last month.
</P>
<P>
Greece is now cooperating closely with the Scotland Yard in a
bid to bring the killers to justice and Athens is also expected to
sign with the U.S. a police cooperation agreement in the next two
months to help fight terrorism.

<HEADLINE> IMF Says U.S. Needs Further Interest Rate Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve should
approve additional interest rate hikes to avert a surge in
inflation in a still buoyant U.S. economy, the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a statement released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While commending the Clinton administration for fiscal and
monetary policies that have contributed to the country's longest
expansion on record, IMF staff warned that questions remained
about its sustainability.
</P>
<P>
In particular, according to the statement released by the U.S.
Treasury Department, there is no way of knowing how much longer
technology-driven increases in productivity will continue to
support growth.
</P>
<P>
What is clear, the statement said, is that "continued domestic
demand growth at a pace well in excess of the productivity-driven
increases in potential output is not sustainable."
</P>
<P>
"If not reined in, such rapid demand growth threatens to
undermine the prospects for sustained non-inflationary growth," it
added.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, according to the IMF, "a further
tightening of monetary policy will be required to ensure that
inflation remains under control."
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve policy-makers in the 12 months to May 2000
raised short-term interest rates six times in the face of surging
growth, tight labor markets and prospects for upward pressure on
wages.
</P>
<P>
At their June meeting policy-makers reacted to evidence of a
slowdown in U.S. economic momentum by leaving rates unchanged. But
they too said the moderation might be of short duration and
stressed that further rate hikes might be necessary.
</P>
<P>
The statement also reflected IMF staff discomfort with
imbalances in global growth, with the United States serving as the
principal engine for economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Such persistent imbalances, notably in the face of sluggish
growth in Europe and Japan, increase "the risk of an abrupt
reversal with potentially adverse consequences worldwide,"
according to the staff.
</P>
<P>
The statement also urged Washington to resist protectionist
pressures and expressed concern at an increase in anti-dumping
actions by Washington.
</P>
<P>
It in addition called on the United States to increase its
overseas development assistance, noting that in 1999 such aid
accounted for only 0.1 percent of US gross national product.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Common European Residency Card for Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of European Parliament's Commission on
Public Freedom in Brussels, French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement said that a common residency card will be a progress
and ``an essential judicial instrument'' to integrate and protect
foreign residents in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
France, which issues a 10-year residency card to the foreign
residents employed by French companies or with professional
credits, proposes that EU countries issue a common residency card
of a duration from eight to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over the EU rotating presidency this month,
expects EU countries to obtain an agreement in two years instead
of during its presidency which ends on December 31, said
Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France hopes that all EU countries will also
adopt a law guaranteeing ``the right of soil'' which automatically
offers nationality to the children born in their countries as
France and the United States have been doing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Urged to Fund Debt Relief for Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers on Wednesday urged Congress to fund debt relief
for poor nations, saying the issue was "a defining moral,
diplomatic and economic choice" for the United States.
</P>
<P>
In this year's bill for foreign appropriations, House
Republican leaders have slashed to just 82 million U.S. dollars
the Clinton administration's request for 472 million dollars to
fund debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The move undermines Washington's ability to meet its
obligations under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) plan,
a scheme aimed at cutting the debt burden of the world's poorest
nations in half in return for pledges to use the savings on social
programs such as health and education.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for our country economically, morally and
diplomatically to provide this debt relief," Summers said at a new
conference.
</P>
<P>
Foot-dragging in Congress has already stalled debt relief in
Latin America and could likewise imperil debt relief to African
nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislation approved last year by Congress also failed to
provide money for the United States to pay its share of HIPC debt
relief costs.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers want to tie the aid to reforms at the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, the institutions that manage
the HIPC program.
</P>
<P>
Summers said President Bill Clinton would veto the current bill
before Congress, which he said left "grossly inadequate funds" to
help poor nations fight poverty and disease.
</P>
<P>
If Congress refuses to fund the U.S. obligations, other rich
nations that have signed on to the HIPC plan might renege on their
payments, White House chief economic adviser Gene Sperling warned.
</P>
<P>
Summers and Sperling were joined at the news conference by
members of Congress who support debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Castro Calls US Cuban Adjustment Act Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro called
Wednesday to fight the U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act, describing it
as infamous and killer.
</P>
<P>
Castro delivered a brief speech during a session of the
National Assembly, that emitted a proclamation against the Cuban
Adjustment Act, a U.S. disposition that grants automatic residence
to Cuban illegal emigrants.
</P>
<P>
"I want to give a brief information that will be useful to
understand the need of presenting a hard combat against that
infamous law," said Castro.
</P>
<P>
The president described four cases of operations of emigrants
illegal traffic that involved more than one hundred Cubans,
occurred only one week after the return to the island of minor
Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
He said that in all the cases, occurred between July 5 and 7,
the groups of illegal emigrants, in which there were more than 20
children, were transported in boats that went to the island from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1994 and 1995 immigration accords, 20,000 Cubans are
allowed to immigrate to the United States legally.
</P>
<P>
In line with those accords, Cubans trying to enter the United
States illegally who are intercepted at sea must be returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
But unlike other illegal immigrants, Cubans who manage to evade
the Coast Guard and reach US shores are allowed to seek legal
residency and work permits under the U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act
passed in 1966.

BUENOS AIRES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Argentina accumulated a 643
million U.S. dollar trade surplus in the first five months of this
year, said Wednesday the National Statistics and Census Institute
(INDEC).
</P>
<P>
Exports amounted to 10.563 billion dollars and imports to 9.92
billion dollars in the first five months of this year, rising by 1.

The country had a trade surplus with the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur), Chile, the Latin American Integration Association (

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Non-Traditional Exports Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan non-traditional exports
amounted to 1.632 billion dollars during the first semester of
2000, surging by 18.31 percent over the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The country's non-oil exports started the year with a 60.58
percent recovery in January, going to 264 million dollars,
according to data supplied by the Foreign Trade Bank published
Wednesday by the local press.
</P>
<P>
Non-traditional exports continued increasing in February, but
at a lesser amount, at a rate of 26.4 percent, while March and
April's recorded drops of 5.6 percent and 0.03 percent,
respectively, before recovering.
</P>
<P>
The 43.5 percent increase recorded in May is attributed to the
drawback payments (the devolution of custom duties paid for raw
materials used in export products) by stages, a process started by
the government by the end of April, according to the Foreign Trade
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The intermitency in the payment of the drawback to exporters by
the government caused a deceleration in the amount of non-
traditional exports, that amounted to 276 million dollars in June,
with an inter-annual growth of 11.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> IDB Supports Labor Market Modernization in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars
to continue financing the second phase of Mexico's comprehensive
labor market modernization.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of both phases of the program is 850 million
dollars. The IDB supported the first phase of the program with a
loan of 250 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The program includes training support for microenterprise and
small-and medium-sized enterprises, retraining and internships. It
is designed to upgrade labor market skills, reduce unemployment
and promote private sector growth.
</P>
<P>
Under the second phase of the program, elements and mechanisms
to decentralize training extension units will be introduced and
tested, and a job skills certification system will be promoted.
</P>
<P>
The IDB loan is for a 20-year term, with a two-year grace
period, at the variable interest rate, now 6.77 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Hold Meeting on Iraq's Humanitarian Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly Speaker
Saadoun Hamadi has sent a letter to United Nations Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, calling for a meeting to discuss Iraq's
humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported Wednesday that in
the letter, Hamadi said that all representatives of U.N.
organizations in Iraq should be invited to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi proposed that the meeting be held in New York, where the
U.N. is headquartered, to enable the world to better understand the
humanitarian situation of Iraq 10 years after stringent sanctions
were imposed.
</P>
<P>
"I am waiting for your positive answer," said Hamadi in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
Annan has called on the U.N. Security Council to find consensus
on the aim of the sanctions it imposed soon after Iraq invaded
Kuwait in 1990 and to refine them to avoid human sufferings.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is battling growing scepticisms on the effectiveness of
sanctions amid its decade-long restrictions against Iraq that have
been blamed for the country's humanitarian crisis. The boycott also
remains one of the most controversial, with members of the Security
Council deeply divided in their policy.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says as many as 1.3 million people have died of curable
diseases as a direct result of the sanctions in what was called a
humanitarian crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food program, launched in December 1996, allows
Iraq to export crude in return for U.N.-supervised imports of food,
medicine and other humanitarian goods to help alleviate the
crippling impacts of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
However, the humanitarian program was impeded by the U.S. and
Britain who tried hard to block contracts Iraq signed with foreign
countries to import humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British members on the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of shelving a total of 1,989 contracts,
worsening the humanitarian crisis in the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Amend Election Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
Wednesday called for extraordinary meetings of the People's
Assembly (Parliament) and the Shura (Consultative) Council to amend
the election law.
</P>
<P>
The current election law, in force since 1956, has been ruled by
the Constitutional Court as "unconstitutional" because it failed to
provide judicial supervision of the entire election process.
</P>
<P>
The two chambers of Parliament will meet on Saturday and Sunday
respectively to discuss amendments to the law, Information Minister
Safwat el-Sherif said after a ministerial meeting chaired by
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Article 88 of Egypt's constitution requires members of the
judiciary to oversee ballot casting, but the election law passed in
1956 allows civil servants to oversee the polling.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's tiny opposition has long been charging that the
government has relentlessly rigged parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Kamal el-Shazli said
the amendments endorsed by Mubarak would require all voting centers
to be overseen by members of the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
They would also require elections scheduled for November this
year to take place "over several days" in order for the judiciary
to be able to monitor around 30,000 voting centers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has some 9,000 members of the judiciary.

<HEADLINE> Iran Dismisses U.S. Court Ruling on Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday dismissed as
unfounded and politically-motivated a U.S. court ruling that
requires Iran to pay more than 325 million U.S. dollars in
compensation to the families of two Americans killed in a bus
bombing in Israel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ruling against Iran is invalid, as the U.S. federal court
lacks the jurisdiction to issue rulings on such issues, according
to
the international law, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the ruling is solely based on allegations by the
plaintiffs' lawyers, so it lacks judiciary validity. This "
unfounded" and "politically-motivated" verdict is only catering to
certain anti-Iran groups in the United States, he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. federal judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling on Tuesday
that Iran had provided support and resources for the militant
Palestinian group Hamas, who claimed responsibility for the 1996
attack in Tel Aviv. The bombing killed 23 people, including the two
Jewish American students.

<HEADLINE> Israel to End Border Violations Soon: U.N. Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Middle East envoy Terje
Roed-Larsen said Wednesday that the U.N. peacekeepers can be
deployed throughout south Lebanon at the end of this month once
Israel has made required changes of its troops' deployment on the
border.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy here,
Larsen said it was hard to say exactly when the peacekeeping troops
would deploy in south Lebanon "because we are waiting for all
Israeli violations to come to an end."
</P>
<P>
Israel pulled all its forces out of south Lebanon on May 24,
ending its 22-year occupation of the land there. However, the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) has not deployed in the vacated
areas as Beirut still claims that Israel is violating its
sovereignty at nine points on the border.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached an agreement with the government of Israel on
how to handle that, and we have taken note that the government of
Israel has committed itself to rectify everything by the end of the
month, and I do hope that that will immediately trigger UNIFIL to
deploy throughout the south," Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 4,500 U.N. peacekeepers currently stationed in
Lebanon. UNIFIL has expected to expand its forces following
Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen arrived Wednesday for talks with Levy on the border
violations and the dispute seems to be drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said Israel has given its full commitment to make
required changes to the deployment on its border and UNIFIL is
working everyday to establish a line which is clean of any
violations.
</P>
<P>
Levy said that Israel is working in full cooperation with the
United Nations both on the political and military levels and will
make all border adjustments required.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the current list of demands from
Lebanon will be the last one and Beirut will also fulfil its
commitment under U.N. Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister stressed that Israel wants the border to
remain quiet and backs the rehabilitation of south Lebanon helped
by international aid.
</P>
<P>
Levy also emphasized the importance of creating a joint Israel-
Lebanese UNIFIL mechanism for dealing with border related issues.
</P>
<P>
Larsen said work on creating such a mechanism is underway.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the ongoing Camp David summit between Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.
S. President Bill Clinton, Levy said it is still too early to say
whether there will be an agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians as both sides remain far apart on their positions.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who refused to accompany Barak to the summit, said both
the Israelis and Palestinians must be ready to compromise.

Political analysts said this is going to be a vibrant session
since the opposition Movement for Democratic Change got
significant seats compared with previous ones which were largely
dominated by lawmakers from the ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf).
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mandela Wants Stronger Black Economic Empowerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president Nelson Mandela said on Wednesday that long-term
stability in South Africa was dependent on black economic
empowerment.
</P>
<P>
"Long-term stability also in our political system is dependent
on the success of black economic empowerment through which all
South Africans will feel that they have a stake in the economy,"
Mandela said at a New Economy Investment conference in Sandton in
northern Johannesburg, which was attended by a wide selection of
companies.
</P>
<P>
He said local financial institutions, like all other agencies
of the economy, should work towards greater equity.
</P>
<P>
"Too often we still find that those traditionally excluded from
the fruits of our progress continue to be marginalized," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the development of small, medium and micro
enterprises was generally recognized to be crucial to job creation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said too often small entrepreneurs complained that their
contribution to economic development and job creation was being
stifled by their lack of access to financing.
</P>
<P>
"Similarly, one hears the comment that black economic
empowerment is being impeded by the absence of financing, and the
growing reluctance of the financial sector -- which is still
traditionally dominated and controlled -- to continue investment
in empowerment," he said.
</P>
<P>
While it could be argued that charity began at home, Mandela
added, the call for domestic solidarity would have a far greater
impact, especially when it came to international markets.
</P>
<P>
"If we can harness our domestic energies towards equity, we
shall stand so much stronger as members of the developing world to
argue for equity goals in global affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Asian financial crisis revealed how inter-dependent
world markets were, but it also proved that the vulnerable and the
poor were most hard hit by such global tremors.

<HEADLINE> OAU Leaders Sign Draft Treaty of African Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- African leaders attending the closing
ceremony of the 36th annual summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) signed here on Wednesday the draft treaty on the
establishment of a closer African Union, taking a decisive step
towards integration.
</P>
<P>
The leaders urged all member states of the OAU to take the
necessary measures for its ratification as soon as possible in
order to ensure its speedy implementation.
</P>
<P>
The Draft Constitutional Act of the African Union will enter
into force after two-thirds of the OAU's 53 member states ratify
it.
</P>
<P>
The African Union will replace the OAU, which was established
on May 25, 1963 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, one year after the
document comes into force, according to the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Declaration adopted at the fourth extraordinary summit of
the OAU in Sirte, Libya, on September 9,1999 decided to establish
an African Union to take up the new challenges that confront the
African continent in the light of the social, economic and
political changes taking place in the world, especially the
growing trend of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the African Union are to achieve greater
unity and solidarity among the African countries, defend the
sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of its member
states, accelerate the political and socio-economic integration of
the continent and promote peace, security and stability in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Assembly of the heads of state and government is the
supreme organ of the African Union and it shall meet at least once
a year.
</P>
<P>
Other organs include the Executive Council of Ministers, the
Pan-African Parliament, the Court of Justice and the financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Governments which come to power through unconstitutional means
shall not be allowed to participate in the activities of the
African Union.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muamar Gaddafi, who has been advocating the idea
of the United States of Africa, made an emotional speech at the
closing ceremony amidst loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a historic day, and the creation of the African Union
will be one of the most important incidents in this century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the African Union would unite the African
peoples as one despite of their racial, cultural, language and
religious differences.
</P>
<P>
Togolese President and OAU's Chairman Gnassingbe Eyadema
declared that the continental organization will hold a special
summit next March in Sirte and the 37th annual summit in Lusaka,
Zambia.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Calls for State of Emergency to Combat AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Wednesday
called on the world to declare a state of emergency in the face of
the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"For what is at stake is nothing less than the very survival of
entire country," she said at the launch of UNICEF's "Progress of
Nations 2000" report in Durban, South Africa, where an
international AIDS conference is underway.
</P>
<P>
Describing the pervasive reach of the Human Immuno-deficiency
Virus, Bellamy said: "In parts of Eastern and Southern Africa
whole population groups are being wiped out -- government
officials, professionals, farmers and humanitarian aid workers as
well."
</P>
<P>
UNICEF's 2000 report showed that in 1999 alone an estimated 860,
000 primary school children in sub-Saharan Africa lost their
teachers to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The virus was threatening the implementation of the Convention
on the Rights of the Child and was an obstacle to achieving the
goals of the World Summit for Children, the report claimed.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said almost 3.2 million children under the age of 15
had died since the onset of the pandemic, and at current rates
infant mortality would jump 75 percent in the worst affected
countries within a decade.
</P>
<P>
The under-five mortality rate would rise by over 100 percent,
and in addition, nearly 10 million children had lost one or both
parents to AIDS, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The number of AIDS orphans was expected to rise to over 40
million by 2010, with more than 90 percent of them in sub-Saharan
Africa, it said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said six people under the age of 24 were infected every
minute -- amounting to 7,000 young people and 1,000 infants daily.
</P>
<P>
She also called on the world to adopt a multi-sectoral approach
in coping with the disease.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that what is required here is the largest
mobilization of resources in history," she said.
</P>
<P>
Governments, world bodies, scientists, civil society and
business have repeatedly been challenged at the conference to join
forces in the battle to curtail the virus, which has infected
about 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
Professor Hoosen Coovadia, AIDS conference chairman and
internationally renowned AIDS expert, agreed with Bellamy's stance.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa's own leaders had declared war on
apartheid, but had not tackled AIDS with the same energy.
</P>
<P>
The picture was bleak, but there were signs of hope that people,
especially the youth, were changing their sexual behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
A government study conducted recently found that people between
the ages of 15 and 30 were showing signs for the first time that
they were using condoms regularly.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States National
Institute for Health on Wednesday granted the Medical Research
Council (MRC) of South Africa 19 million U.S. dollars to establish
two new research units to study HIV/AIDS prevention strategies.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest grant from the U.S. to a South African
research institution, which will contribute to establishing a HIV
vaccine trial unit and a HIV prevention trial unit.
</P>
<P>
The vaccine project is one of the two trials -- the other in
Kenya -- which will concentrate on finding a vaccine suitable for
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Abdool Karim, director of HIV prevention and vaccine
research at the MRC, said: "Both units will ensure that South
Africa stays at the forefront of the global effort to devise and
test HIV vaccines and prevention strategies."
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the University of Natal and Columbia University
in the U.S. will collaborate in the HIV prevention trial unit.
</P>
<P>
So far most of the vaccines have been tested in the U.S. and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The MRC is the only non-American organization to receive such a
grant.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister for
Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Jakaya Kikwete on
Tuesday urged African countries to stop endless and senseless wars
and put more efforts on economic development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the National Assembly, the foreign minister said
the conflicts in the African continent are "a big shame and
disgracing."
</P>
<P>
He said there is nobody else to blame for the wars except the
nations themselves, particularly their leaders.
</P>
<P>
"They should sober up and face economic problems rather than
engage in the conflicts," said Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that there are some conflicts that are foreign-
influenced, but he insisted that the leaders of those countries
should refuse to "be used for the benefit of other nations".
</P>
<P>
He cited the conflicts in Sierra Leone and Angola and said they
are being "fueled from outside due to the nations' richness in
diamonds."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also appealed to African leaders to desist from
using force to enter into leadership, saying they are, through
this way, "killing" democracy.
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament that the current conflicts in the
continent and those still being brewed are a big challenge to the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), which held a summit in Lome,
Togo.

Security Service (FSB)'s Military Counterintelligence Department.
The Moscow District Military Court has sentenced him to four years
in a high-security prison on charges of state treason stipulated
in Article 275 of the Criminal Code," the FSB Public Relations
Center announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It has been established that Avramenko, motivated by selfish
goals and making use of his official position, had collected
secret materials about the latest developments in aircraft
building and the future of the Russian air force and made
photocopies of these materials," said the center.
</P>
<P>
"While abroad in May 1996, Avramenko tried to sell those
materials to representatives of a foreign state for a large reward,
" it said.
</P>
<P>
"The materials about the Russian air force collected by
Avramenko were of great interest to the foreign special services
and their leak might have seriously damaged Russia's state
security," noted the center.

<HEADLINE> Putin Urges Keeping Strategic Balance by Keeping ABM Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Tuesday urged the United States to maintain the balance of
strategic offensive weapons in the world by giving up the planned
creation of a national missile shield and to pool efforts with
Russia against possible threats.
</P>
<P>
Russia proposes to advance from a common initial position,
stands for retaining the level of confidence and the balance of
strategic offensive weapons, reached under the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM)treaty, Putin told an interview with Russia's ORT
television, Japan's NHK television and the Reuters news agency.
</P>
<P>
He called on Washington to work together with Moscow to "
localize possible threats that could theoretically appear in the
world some day."
</P>
<P>
Russia's proposals have been outlined in statements by the
president "and a number of statements from the Foreign Ministry,"
Putin said. These concern "the creation of a global security
system and a lower level of confrontation between the leading
nuclear powers."
</P>
<P>
He said he is prepared "to begin negotiations (with the U.S.)
on further mutual arms reduction to 1,500 warheads even today."
</P>

"What can be better for mankind than a lower level of nuclear
threat? We propose to take this path, it is clear and
understandable for everyone, even those who are not experts,"

<HEADLINE> Greek, Luxembourg FMs Urge Turkey to Make Constructive Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of Greece
and Luxembourg Wednesday called for constructive efforts by Turkey
to help itself to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Speaking after their talks focusing on bilateral ties, the
Cyprus issue and Greek-Turkish relations as well as EU-Turkish
relations, George Papandreou of Greece and Lydie Polfer of
Luxembourg said that there must be constructive efforts on behalf
of Turkey in order to proceed with the necessary reforms that
would contribute to Ankara's European course.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou said that Greece wanted a more European vocation
for Turkey and any progress to be made during the currently Geneva
talks between Cyprus' two communities would definitely assist
Turkey's European course within the framework of the Helsinki
decisions.
</P>
<P>
Describing the relations between the two countries as"
excellent," Polfer, who is on a visit to Greece, said that Greece
and Luxembourg shared almost the same views over the issues of
Cyprus and Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Helsinki EU summit decisions and the
Copenhagen criteria should serve as a basis for Turkey to proceed
with the necessary steps towards reform and good-neighborly
relations with its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
she called the recent Strovilia incident within the cease-fire
line on Cyprus an "unexpected" development, saying that it was a "
wrong move at the wrong time."

<HEADLINE> Romanian Beer Market Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The estimated beer consumption
this year in Romania will be 12 million hectoliters, the official
Rompres news agency informed on Wednesday citing sources in
Romania's Brewers Association.
</P>
<P>
Although the beer consumption in Romania is one third of the
consumption that is registered in the European developed countries,
however the Romanian brewers say the domestic beer market is
continuously developing. They estimate a consumption of 14.5
million hectoliters of beer in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Sales in 2000 were influenced by the European Soccer
Championship in June, when beer consumption in Romania increased
by 24 percent as against the previous month.
</P>
<P>
There are over 70 breweries in Romania, of which 52 have a
small capacity and they belong to local brewers. After 1990,
Romanian breweries attracted investments worth 575 million U.S.
dollars. Some well-known international companies such as Brau
Union, Pilsener, Tuborg Stella Artois, Keiser have penetrated the
Romanian market.
</P>
<P>
These companies supply about 50 percent of the beer production
in Romania.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the total consumption of alcoholic drinks in Romania
was 92 liters per capita, the beer being 58.76 percent of this
quantity. The consumption of wine, a traditional drink in Romania,
was 28.2 percent only last year, statistics show.

<HEADLINE> German War Reparations Issue Must Be Solved at Political Level, Says Reppas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The issue of the German war
reparations must be solved at a political level because of its
sensitiveness, said Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas said that the Greek
government was opposed to the decision made by the relatives of
the victims of the massacred Distomo villagers whom Germany
refuses to compensate.
</P>
<P>
The issue was a sensitive one and such issues were being dealt
with taking under consideration the national interest without
ignoring the interests of the people based on the decision reached
by the Greek court, he said.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the German government made protest demarches
in response to the confiscation of German property procedure that
is underway in Athens for the compensation of the victims'
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that the approval of the justice
minister was needed in order to proceed with the confiscation of a
foreign state property.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Greek government's opposition, some court
officials Tuesday started recording the German Goethe Institute's
property in Athens as part of their efforts to confiscate the
three German cultural institutions in Athens in order to raise a
sum of 9.5 billion drachmas (about 27 million U.S. dollars) to pay
for the relatives of the 218 villagers of Distomo, near Delphi,
massacred by German occupations forces on June 10, 1944.

<HEADLINE> New UNICEF Report Details Enormous Impact of AIDS on Youth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
's Fund(UNICEF) on Wednesday released a major report detailing the
enormous impact of HIV/AIDS among young people, and said their
efforts would be key to fighting the disease.
</P>
<P>
Released simultaneously in New York, Geneva and Durban, South
Africa, where the 13rd International AIDS Conference is taking
place this week, the Progress of Nations 2000 shows that almost a
third of all people with HIV/AIDS are between the ages of 15 and
24.
</P>
<P>
Every minute, six people under the age of 25 catch HIV, with
girls being more than 50 percent more likely to contract the virus
than boys, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Of particular concern is the fact that young people are not
clear on how to protect themselves from the disease, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
In a number of countries where AIDS is epidemic, nearly half
of sexually active girls believe they face no risk of contracting
the disease, said the report.
</P>
<P>
 In surveys in 17 countries, over half of adolescents could
not name a single method of protecting themselves against
infection, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that young people must be involved in tackling
the AIDS crisis and urged governments to commit to the largest
mobilization of resources in their history and to organized
themselves as if they were fighting a full-blown war of liberation,
with young people in the forefront.

<HEADLINE> Russian Duma Chairman Visits Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seleznev said at the meeting that the two countries have good
political relations and must however improve their economic ties.
He also said that the Russian Federation was opened for developing
joint ventures that best guarantee mutual profits.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu stressed the importance of the Russian
Federation in preserving the European security and the necessity
for cooperation between the two states in achieving regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
A major role is played by the relaunch of the economic
cooperation links, the joint businesses, and the improvement of
the legislative environment and economic incentives, the Romanian
head of state said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that all these are necessary in order to put into
use the whole potential and recoup what was of value in the
bilateral economic relations, given the juridical frame on the
making in the investment domain, namely the investment guarantee
and the avoidance of the double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Resuming negotiations to make the basic Treaty complete is
still a priority on the bilateral agenda, but this Treaty must be
attuned to the sentiment of the two Parliaments, Constantinescu
said.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev heading a delegation of Russian parliamentarians is on
an official visit to Bucharest after having participated in the
9th annual meeting of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest
over July 6-10. On Tuesday, he met several Romanian officials:
Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu, Foreign Minister Petre Roman,
Senate Chairman Mircea Ionescu Quintus and Chamber of Deputies
Chairman Ion Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on Wednesday, Seleznev said that the
Russian party wants the basic Treaty with Romania to be ratified
and signed without saying anything about the treasure and the
Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact. "All the differences of opinion existing
between Russia and other countries can be solved by various acts
but not by the basic Treaty," he added.
</P>
<P>
In relation with Romania's intention to join NATO, Seleznev
said that his country was against the enlargement of this
organization,but Romania had the right to opt for the bloc in
which it wishes to be. "We should not want Romania's accession to
NATO to be detrimental to our relations. We don't want to regard
NATO as a rival, but we should really enjoy to have no rival at
our borders.If the Warsaw Treaty expired, NATO should have expired
too," Duma Chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Seleznev also stressed that NATO's intervention in Yugoslavia
was not a good omen and "when the aggression was over" no end was
put to the problems existing over there.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) on Wednesday said it needed 23
million U.S. dollars to deal with the humanitarian cost of the
most recent war between Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The war has driven nearly 100,000 Eritreans into Sudan,
Djibouti and Yemen and caused massive displacement within Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the agency said it was asking for 13.2 million
to care for internally displaced persons inside Eritrea and to
help those who may initially return to Eritrea from neighboring
countries over the coming months.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 8.6 million is needed for up to 94,000 Eritreans
living in extremely harsh conditions in makeshift camps in
neighboring Sudan since May of this year, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's mobile emergency teams operating in Eritrea and other
relief agencies are braving considerable logistical and
operational odds to help internally displaced persons scattered
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
 Broad swaths of southern and southwestern Eritrea are
occupied by Ethiopian forces which are unlikely to pull back until
the deployment of peacekeepers from the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity, in accordance with the agreement
signed by the two countries on June 18, UNHCR said.

WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
spoke at the annual convention of the National Association for the

from black voters.
</P>
<P>
"I have come here not just in an election year, but year after

</P>
<P>
"I don't want to offer you generalities," Gore said."I want to

<P>
Gore was expected to receive the Democrats' presidential
nomination next month at the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Bill Easing Computer Export Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted Wednesday
to ease export controls on high-performance computers in a bid to
help American companies keep their competitive advantage in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
By a vote of 86-11, the Senate adopted an amendment to the
defense authorization bill that would decrease to 60 days the 180
days Congress has to review changes in administration export rules
on such computers.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the easing say current controls are ineffective
because they are much stricter than those of foreign competitors.
</P>
<P>
"Today's vote is a big victory for the U.S. high technology
industry and for the jobs and economic growth that this important
industry has generated," said Harry Reid, a Democratic Senator
from Nevada who is one of the sponsors of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
The Senate last March put aside legislation to create a new
process for determining what items with dual commercial and
military uses would come under export controls.
</P>
<P>
The basic export law has not been renewed since 1994, and since
then President Bill Clinton has had to grant export waivers on a
case-by-case basis. Since 1993, Clinton has revised control
requirements for high-performance computers four times, the latest
in January.
</P>
<P>
The House, as part of its Defense Department authorization bill,
has approved the same 60-day review. The Clinton administration
supports a 30-day review period.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Labor Union, Political Groups Hold Anti-Government Demonstration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The General Workers Confederation
(GWC) of Lebanon and 10 political groups of the country launched a
demonstration in Beirut Wednesday afternoon to protest against the
government's financial and social policies.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration would be the biggest against the current
government since it was installed 20 months ago, local Al Mustaqbal
newspaper said before the start of the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
The GWC, which groups Lebanon's 350,000-strong labor force, had
called on the demonstrators to assemble at 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) to
converge on the cabinet headquarters when the 16-member cabinet
under Prime Minister Salim Hoss would hold its regular weekly
session.
</P>
<P>
The GWC statement said the peaceful protest was aimed at
demanding sweeping changes to the government's financial and social
policies, a re-adjustment of salaries, a ban on further indirect
taxes and a considerable slash on telephone, water and electricity
bills.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 political groups also taking part in the protest
are Hezbollah (Party of God) and Amal, the main Shiite Muslim
groups that had spearheaded the resistance against Israel's
occupation of south Lebanon, the Communist Party, the National
Liberal Party and the Lebanese branch of Syria's ruling Baath
party, three right-wing Christian factions -- the Phalange Party,
the National Bloc Party and the National Liberal Party, as well as
Al Jamaa and Al Ahbash, Lebanon's two biggest Sunni Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Salim Hoss said the government would make no move
to stop the demonstration, local newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was focusing on encouraging foreign
investment in Lebanon "because only investment will get the economy
moving anew."
</P>
<P>
The chambers of commerce, industry and agriculture issued a
statement after its joint meeting Tuesday, warning of an "impending
economic collapse."
</P>
<P>
"Emergency measures have to be taken by the government to check
the breakdown of business outfits before it is too late. Otherwise,
the nation's economy may collapse entirely," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the government to ensure liquidity
to pump cash into the stagnant markets to revive wholesale demand
as well as commercial, industrial and agricultural businesses.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 Lebanese workers joined the unemployment list from
January 1, 1999 to the middle of this year, as compared to a total
of 4,000 workers laid off in 1997 and 1998, As Safir newspaper

<HEADLINE> South Asian Meeting on Urban Governance Concludes in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The three-day South Asian
Conference on Urbanization and Good Urban Governance concluded
here Wednesday with the participants vowing to promote and
facilitate good urban governance by mobilizing optimal
participation of all-level governments and civil society.
</P>
<P>
The South Asian nations "must pay urgent attention to improve
their institutional and managerial capabilities to meet the future
challenges of rapid urbanization", said the Kathmandu Declaration
issued at the conclusion of the conference.
</P>
<P>
The rapid urbanization process has created problems such as
dilapidation of infrastructure, degradation of the environment,
deterioration of the quality and coverage of urban basic services,
exploitation of women and children and the weakening of personal
security", the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that while one fifth of the population of South
Asian countries lived in urban areas in 1975, the percentage has
increased to 30 percent now and will reach 40 percent in the next
15 years. The growth is among the fastest in the world.
</P>
<P>
To promote good governance and solve these problems, the
declaration urged national governments to give local governments
adequate power and resources to make their governance systems and
mechanisms more participatory, responsive and accountable.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also stressed the importance of regional
cooperation in promoting good urban governance. It called for the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to
include the issue in its agenda and set up a regional urban
observatory to help SAARC countries achieve the objective.
</P>
<P>
The conference, co-organized by Nepali Ministry of Physical
Planning and Works and the U.N. Development Program, explored new
avenues and experiences for capacity building of the local
governments in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Participating in the conference were about 100 representatives
from the governmental and non-governmental organizations of SAARC
countries including Bhutan, Nepal, the Maldives, Pakistan, India,
Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Servicemen, Policemen Involved with Deviationist Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Nine servicemen and two
policemen in Malaysia are said to be involved with the
deviationist group Al-Ma'unah, which is responsible for the arms
heist at two army camps in Grik in the northern state of Perak on
July 2.
</P>
<P>
Nine servicemen comprising officers and other ranks found to be
involved with the group are being questioned, Defense Minister
Najib Tun Razak said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister however did not say whether all of them are from
the army or other branches of the Malaysian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The nine servicemen are not among the 27 cult members who
surrendered on July 6, he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Najib said he believed other armed forces personnel are also
involved. "We will identify them right to the rank and file," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bernama news agency quoted Deputy Inspector-General
of Police Mohamad Jamil Johari as saying Wednesday that two police
personnel, one, an officer, are believed to be members of the Al-
Ma'unah group said to have deviated from the true teachings of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Jamil said that an investigation is being conducted to
ascertain the extent of their involvement in the group.
</P>
<P>
"They have not been suspended and no action has yet been taken
against them as we have to investigate whether they have joined
the group just to learn the silat (fight with swords) or have been
deceived into pursuing for the setting up of an unlawful Islamic
state," he was quoted as saying after a function in Serdang.
</P>
<P>
Mohamad Jamil said that the police view such activities
seriously and would take preventive measures before they pose
threats to the country.
</P>
<P>
The police would monitor groups found to display unhealthy
trends, he said, adding, "As such, we will take action if we know

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls For "War of Liberation" Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children
's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday that if nations hope to defeat the
AIDS they must commit to the "largest mobilization of resources in
their history" and organize themselves as if they were fighting a
"full-blown war of liberation."
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS constitutes the greatest threat many societies have
ever faced," said Carol Bellamy, Executive Director of UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, in many ways it has been a hidden enemy, aided
and abetted by a general reluctance to acknowledge its strength
and our own vulnerability. Thus we have not confronted AIDS with
the full force we are capable of," Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every society understand what it means to wage a
struggle for liberation," Bellamy said, noting that the concept
has particular resonance in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It means mobilizing every available resource. It means
involving men and women on an equal basis. It means accepting the
vital role to be played by young people and it means sparing no
effort and brooking no diversions until all of society is
liberated," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy's comments came as UNICEF unveiled a new report
detailing the enormous impact of HIV/AIDS among young people, whom
UNICEF said "hold the key to breaking the transmission rate and
ultimately defeating AIDS."

<HEADLINE> Russia Strives for Normalizing Korean Peninsula Situation: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia supports the normalization
of relations between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea(
DPRK) and the Republic of Korea (RK) and will do everything to
promote this process, said Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Russia has traditionally friendly relations with the DPRK. I
regret that no leader of either Russia or the former Soviet Union
ever paid an official visit to this country," Putin told an
interview with Russia's ORT television, Japan's NHK television and
the Reuters news agency on the eve of his departure for Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
"First, we have many bilateral issues. Second, we want to
discuss a number of international issues, including those related
to security, with the leader of the DPRK," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president also noted that he had recently spoken by
phone with the president of the Republic of Korea. "We agreed that
I will pay a visit to South Korea as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is our neighbor, we
have a common border. We are very interested in the restoration of
peace and accord on the Korean Peninsula, as this directly
reflects on Russia," Putin stressed.
</P>
<P>
"This is the third complex of issues that we are going to
discuss with the DPRK leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have no doubt that this will give a good impulse to the
development of bilateral relations," Putin predicted.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Adjourned Again After Witness Refusal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lockerbie
trial was adjourned again on Wednesday after a group of witnesses
refused to testify against the two Libyans accused of blowing the
Pan Am flight in December 1988.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Scottish court on Dutch soil said that the
witnesses from the Mediterranean island state of Malta had refused
to come after quite lengthy negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The court was adjourned until Friday, the spokesman said. The
court was just resumed on Monday after being adjourned for 12 days
to give the prosecution extra time to examine the statements given
by the witnesses listed by the defense team prior to the beginning
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese witnesses were summoned to discuss the events
happened at the Luqa airport on Malta, but they refused to give
their names or elaborate in court, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution allege that Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and
Lamen Khalifa Fhimah placed a bomb in a suitcase which was then
placed on an Air Malta jet departing from Luqa on the morning of
December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day the suitcase was transferred onto the New York-
bound Pan Am Flight 103 that was blown out of the sky over
Lockerbie, killing all 259 people on board and 11 others on the
ground in the Scottish town.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans went on trial on May 3 before the Scottish
court at Camp Zeist, a former United States air force base in
central Netherlands. They are charged with conspiracy of murder,
and breach of international aircraft safety laws.
</P>
<P>
Al-Megrahi and Fhimah both pleaded innocent to the charges
which carry a maximum life sentence in a Scottish jail.
</P>
<P>
One of the prosecution's principal witnesses is a Libyan
defector who allegedly saw one of the defendants introduce the
suitcase onto the Air Malta flight at Luqa.
</P>
<P>
The trial, that got underway after almost 12 years of
investigation and preparation, was adjourned several times for
both technical and witness reasons.

<HEADLINE> EU Relaunches Euro Publicity Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union on Wednesday
relaunched its publicity campaign about the single currency to
facilitate the transition to physical circulation.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, European Union finance commissioner, said while
kicking off the publicity campaign in Brussels that the campaign
was relaunched due to the fact that the preparation for the
transition to the physical circulation of the single currency is
not adequate.
</P>
<P>
He said that the publicity campaign has two major tasks, one
being to prepare the euro itself and the other being to prepare
the general public.
</P>
<P>
The euro will come out into physical circulation on January 1,
2002, and the citizens in the euro zone countries have to be fully
prepared for the new currency that will replace their national
currencies in the end.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is aiming at preparing the public with
publicity campaigns aimed at both a pre-circulation and dual
circulation periods.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, on Wednesday published for the first time a comprehensive
report on the arrangements of the cash changeovers in the euro
zone countries.
</P>
<P>
The report covered such issues as the end date of the national
currencies and the offer of euro banknotes by ATM teller-machines
in each euro zone member state.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that it had stepped up monitoring the cash
changeover arrangements, was pushing for solutions on any
unresolved issues and was promoting best practices among member
states.
</P>
<P>
Solbes said: "Eighteen months before the euro-day, preparations
for the cash changeover are at a critical stage. Member states
have to reinforce their efforts to ensure that all necessary
decisions and preparations are being made in time in order to
provide certainty to all companies and consumers across the union
and to give them enough time to prepare."
</P>
<P>
Practical aspects of the introduction of euro coins and
banknotes will be discussed on September 8 and 9 during an
informal EU finance ministers council.
</P>
<P>
The single currency was launched in January last year to be
used as accounting units among 11 EU member states that include
Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Finland. Greece joined the
group at the EU summit at Feira, Portugal, last month.
</P>
<P>
Euro coins and banknotes will enter physical circulation
starting on January 1, 2002, while national currencies of the euro
zone member states are to be withdrawn within a period of between
zero day and two months after the euro-day.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 12 (Xinhua) -- An Ukrainian government delegation
will pay a visit on July 22-24 to the headquarters of the
International Monetary Fund in Washington for talks on the
resumption of financing for the country, an official said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation to be led by First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri
Yekhanurov will include many top officials of the government and
the National Bank of Ukraine NBU), in particular, Finance Minister
Igor Mityukov and NBU Chairman Volodymyr Stelmakh, Press Secretary
of the first vice-premier Hennadii Harmash told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the delegation will hold talks with managers
and directors of the IMF on the resumption of crediting under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program, halted in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The government expects this visit to help solve a number of
unsettled questions in Ukraine-IMF relations, which have been
impeding Ukraine from obtaining foreign credits for almost 10
months.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government considered that Ukraine has met all
the principle demands of the EFF program, and that the reason
behind delay in the funding is bureaucracy of IMF middle-branch
officials.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission, which worked in Kiev in June, did not advise
the IMF board of directors to resume funding for Ukraine. They
made a list of 11 preliminary measures the Ukrainian side should
meet first, so that its question would be discussed at the meeting
of the IMF board of directors.

<HEADLINE> Hacker Brought to Justice in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A former employee of an
insurance company in this capital city of central China's Henan
Province has been charged with hacking into the company database
and deleting and revising company data.
</P>
<P>
The defendant, Wang Bo, said he was taking revenge against his
former employer, the Zhengzhou Branch of the China Pacific
Insurance Co. Ltd, when he deleted 1,510 policy records in the
company database, altered the premium and benefit payment
schedules of more than 10,000 policy records, and changed the
company's service telephone number, for he was very unhappy with
his company.
</P>
<P>
As a result of Wang's alterations, the insurance company issued
480 policies containing errors, which "seriously disrupted normal
business order," according to a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The district court in Zhengzhou city will hear Wang's case.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Develop E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce will be a new engine
for the development of trade in Shanghai, vice-mayor Feng Guoqin
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, e-commerce volume is expected to reach 20
billion yuan (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars), compared with
present 500 million yuan, Feng said.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce, an entirely new method of doing business via the
Internet, is experiencing rapid growth worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Many websites in Shanghai have been actively engaged in e-
commerce, seeking customers who are learning to shop via the
Internet, said Feng, who is in charge of the city's business
affairs.
</P>
<P>
One Shanghai company is sending bottles of mineral water to
customers who send in e-mail orders for the product.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Cigarettes and Sugar Group Co. has more than 1,300
pieces of merchandise on its website.
</P>
<P>
The M18.com, a comprehensive website, has millions of clients
across the country. The site was launched by a Shanghai-based
international company with millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Major department stores in the metropolis have joined hands in
developing B2B websites. Banks and airline companies have helped
passengers to order tickets on-line using credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The official said e-commerce can reduce investments in building
shopping centers and increase Shanghai businessmen's
competitiveness with their rivals in other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Feng acknowledged that e-commerce is facing problems, such as a
lack of regulations and law.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Achieves Grain Self-sufficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Tibet Autonomous Region on the "roof
of the world" has achieved self-sufficiency in grain production
through decades of effort, a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official of the statistics department of the region said
that the annual grain output in Tibet has exceeded 900,000 tons
and the annual grain per capita has been 360 kg last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the production of grain, edible
oil and meat in Tibet is in balance and the targets for grain,
edible oil and meat production set by the Third Conference on the
Work in Tibet have been reached.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 2.5 million, the Tibet Autonomous Region
mainly produces wheat and highland barley. In 1999, it turned out
922,000 tons of grain and 147,000 tons of meat. The annual meat
per capita reached 60 kg.
</P>
<P>
Due to the unfavorable climate and oxygen deficiency on the
highland, agriculture in Tibet is backward, and in past decades
Tibet has mainly depended on grain shipped from inland areas of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Gyabo, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that
in the late 1980s, Tibet needed 170 million kg of grain shipped
from the inland areas annually.
</P>
<P>
The yearly grain load accounted for more than half of the
freight shipping from inland areas to Tibet, and the state had to
allocate more than 300 million yuan for the Tibet-bound grain
shipping expenditure.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate grain production, the region adopted a series of
preferential policies in agriculture tax.
</P>
<P>
A number of grain, edible oil and meat production bases were
established with the development of water conservation projects in
the valleys of the Lhasa River, Nyangqu River and Yarlung Zangbo
River.
</P>
<P>
Of Tibet's 62 projects completed with the aid of the central
government and inland provinces and municipalities, nine involving
agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry and water conservation
have gone into operation, laying a sound foundation for the
sustainable and stable agricultural growth in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tibet invested more than 3 billion yuan in farming
development and construction projects and improved irrigation
conditions for about 60,000 ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
Now the irrigation conditions for more than 70 percent of the
farmland in the region have improved.
</P>
<P>
Tibet also popularized science and technology in agricultural
production, including technology for high-yield grain production,
improving cattle breeding and fine seed cultivation.

<HEADLINE> 15.8 Tons of Narcotics Seized in Southeastern Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Wednesday that its
security forces have confiscated 15.8 tons of illicit drugs in the
southeastern province of Sistan and Baluchestan since the beginning
of the current Iranian calendar year (starting March 20).
</P>
<P>
Commander of the provincial security forces Brigadier General
Nasser Shabani said that seven tons of the drugs were discovered in
Zahedan district, the provincial capital, the official Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shabani said that 34 drug-traffickers were arrested and 14
killed in operations during the period, while 22 out of 43 border
routes that could be used for drug shipment in the province have
been sealed off.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 tons of narcotics were seized in the province in 1999,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the main transit of drugs from the "Golden Crescent"
overlapping parts of Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan, to the Gulf
and European countries, despite its effort to crack down on drug
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
It closed down its 725-kilometer borders with Afghanistan on
Tuesday as part of the measures to fight threats to its security,
according to IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken during a visit by Interior Minister
Abdolvahed Musavi Lari to the eastern parts of the country,
following a sharp rise in criminal cases of robbery, kidnapping,
murder and drug trafficking in the border regions.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 25 Injured in Iranian Bus Accident in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian-registered passenger bus
Wednesday veered off the road and plunged into a ditch in Patnos
town of Agri Province in eastern Turkey bordering Iran, killing one
passenger and injuring 25 others.
</P>
<P>
The passenger bus was on its way back to Iran when the accident
happened, Head Official of Patnos town Ahmet Yurtseven was quoted
by the country's Anatolia News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 injured, 14 were taken to Agri State Hospital while
11 in critical conditions were sent to neighboring Van Province for
treatment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said investigation was still under way and the
cause of the accident was not available right now, Anatolia
reported.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has lost more people to traffic accidents than to wars
and devastating earthquakes. The last decade has witnessed an
alarmingly high number of fatal traffic accidents that have claimed
60,000 lives and seriously injured or disabled 1 million people.
</P>
<P>
The main causes are overspeed, carelessness and drivers' lack of
training.
</P>
<P>
The number of traffic accidents usually skyrockets in summertime
and religious holidays as millions of Turks travel around the
country by car.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish parliament recently established a special
commission, aiming to pass a bill reforming traffic laws to curb
traffic accidents.

The merger is believed to be in line with the economic strategy
adopted by Singapore's government to create world-class companies
to enhance the country's economic competitiveness in the region as
well as in the world.

<HEADLINE> Angola Vows to Stem Illegal Diamond Mining by Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has decided
to reinforce its army in the diamond-rich northeastern provinces
as part of its efforts to crack down on illegal diamond mining by
the rebels of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
"After the re-capture of almost all the districts in the
northeastern Lunda-norte and Lunda-Sul provinces, the main target
of the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) is to fight the guerrilla
actions and the illegal prospecting of diamonds in the region,"
General Sa Miranda, commander of the Angolan Northeastern Military
Front, was quoted as saying by the official news agency Angop here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government forces are now intensifying its operations in
Saurimo, capital city of Lunda-Sul Province to tighten siege on
rebels to impede them from getting support from inside and outside
of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, the UNITA rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi grabbed resources in the above-mentioned provinces to
sustain their troops and the civil conflicts against the
government troops during the past 26 years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Angolan rebels led by Savimbi have
accumulated some 4,000 million U.S.dollars from diamond
trafficking during the country's civil war which broke out soon
after the independence of the southwestern African country from
Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Russian Space Module Goes Into Smooth Work, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-made service module for
the International Space Station (ISS) launched Wednesday morning
has begun functioning normally in its first orbits around the
earth, said a top Russian expert on the ISS program.
</P>
<P>
All the unfolding elements of the module named "Zvezda" (Star),
such as radio and television antennas and solar batteries, are
operating smoothly, General Designer of the Energiya Aerospace
Corporation Yuri Semyonov told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Telemetric data received confirmed that the module's
transmitters and receivers are functioning normally, Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
Russia successfully launched the module into the desired orbit
with a Proton-K rocket from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan
Wednesday morning. The rocket-booster fired off at 8:56 a.m.
Moscow time (0456 GMT) and put the module into the scheduled orbit
at 9:06 a.m. Moscow time, said an Interfax report.
</P>
<P>
The cargo of the module worth 320 million U.S. dollars will
constitute the living quarters of the ISS. "The launch is crucial
because without this module the further development of the ISS is
impossible," said Alexander Kuznetsov, Deputy Director of the
Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Zvezda, a key element of the 60-billion dollar ISS program,
is scheduled to dock by computer on July 26 with two other space
station components, Zarya and Unity, which were launched in 1998.
A three-man team called "zero crew" is on standby in Baikonur to
race into space and make the connection manually in case the
automatic docking fails.
</P>
<P>
Before the July 26 docking, space officials on the ground will
test the control systems and will adjust the orbits of Zarya-Unity
tandem.
</P>
<P>
At the first stage of building the station, a project which
space officials have dubbed one of the most important events in
the history of Russian-U.S. space cooperation, the Russian service
module will make it possible for the crew to operate and control
all the station's systems.
</P>
<P>
Both Russia and the United States have a lot riding on the
success of Zvezda, which will be the heart of the 16-nation space
station project. As well as containing flight controls and the
sewage system, the Zvezda will be a hub for future modules and is
where the crew will sleep.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the 22-ton, 43-foot-long module after over two
years of delays due to Russia's economic woes is a big leap
forward for the ISS project, which also unites the U.S., Canada,
Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Crews will finally have a place to live on board the largest
and costliest space ship ever built. A joint Russian-U.S. crew
could move in as early as October.
</P>
<P>
It will take about 35 space missions before the ISS complex is
complete in 2005. It will then weigh 418 tons, loom seven stories
high and spread over almost an acre of space.
</P>
<P>
It will be visible at night with the naked eye and have about
as much living and working space as a Boeing 747 jumbo jet, said
experts.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Peace Treaty With Japan Under Prior Pacts, Says Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
said Wednesday that Moscow is ready to overcome difficulties in
developing ties with Japan and conclude a peace treaty with Tokyo
in the framework of existing bilateral accords.
</P>
<P>
"Russia and Japan should work together on a peace treaty on
the basis of prior accords," said Putin during an interview with
Russia's ORT television, Japan's NHK television and Reuters.
</P>
<P>
If Russia and Japan develop all-encompassing cooperation, the
problems on which the peace treaty depends will stop being a major
factor and straining our relations," the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should work hard on the basis of reached
agreements, he said, noting that he has established "very good
personal relations" with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me that it is most important to be tolerant of
each other, not to rush but, as I have already said, to proceed
from the lawful interests of both sides," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Russia are interested in "developing economy,
developing relations in culture and education, using what Japan
has and can share with Russia, using what Russia has and can offer
to Japan," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we take this path together, the problems that now
seem so complex and difficult to solve will stop being of
paramount importance in our relations. They will simply become
secondary matters and certainly be solved," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Russian Foreign Ministry announced
that Russian and Japanese leaders will hold a summit meeting in
early September, just before the U.N. Millennium Summit.
</P>
<P>
This agreement was reached at a meeting of Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov and his Japanese counterpart Wednesday in
Miyazaki, Japan.
</P>
<P>
The exact date for the summit will be decided during the Group-
8 summit slated for late July in Japan's Okinawa, said the
ministry.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers both emphasized that the summit will
become a major step toward building a creative partnership between
Russia and Japan, thus "provide tangible content to the
understanding of the strategic nature of the Russian-Japanese
relations in the modern world," it said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Results of three small experiments in Africa raised hopes
that new AIDS treatments now available only in the world's richest
countries might prove usable for larger, poorer AIDS-infected
populations in many cities of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Clinton opened high-stakes talks with
Palestinian and Israeli leaders aimed at settling what he
described as the profound and wrenching questions at the core of
their 52-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli and Palestinian leaders began a summit meeting
at Camp David Tuesday with the far-reaching goal of ending their
52-year-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
-- After 213 years of fighting for the civil rights of blacks,
the African Methodist Episcopal Church took a groundbreaking step
Tuesday night, electing a woman as bishop of the church for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton pressed Senate leader Lott to set a vote on the
China trade bill, fearing that a delay could push the debate into
the fall campaign season. Separately, the House voted 339-82 to
pass a 75.3-billion-U.S.-dollar farm-spending bill that cuts
Clinton initiatives and drew a veto threat.
</P>
<P>
-- Painwebber agreed to be bought by Swiss banking giant UBS in
a half-cash, half-stock transaction for about 12 billion U.S.
dollars, or 73.50 U.S. dollars a share.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Send 20 Athletes to Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' hope of putting an
end to 64 long years of Olympic gold medal drought lies on 20
Sydney-bound national athletes, Philippine Olympic Committee (POC)
President Celso Dayrit said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is actually sending a 40-member delegation --
composed of 20 athletes and 20 officials -- to the sports meet to
be held in Sydney, Australia this September.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Olympic batch is considered as one of the
smallest delegations the country has ever produced in the world's
biggest sports spectacle.
</P>
<P>
According to Dayrit, 17 athletes have so far qualified and two
or three more are likely to make the list prior to the final
submission of lineups to the Sydney Olympics Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy and very confident that all our athletes are
raring to go," Dayrit told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But while the athletes' numbers may not be enough to actually
reflect the high hopes of local Olympic offcials, there's no
stopping the POC from talking big-time as far as the Philippines'
gold medal output is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Dayrit, for instance, is optimistic of the delegation's gold
medal chances in boxing and taekwondo where the Philippines is
sending world-caliber bets.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the POC chief predicted a four gold medal haul a
couple of months ago from two sports disciplines alone, a
statement which prompted critics to raise more howlers and
eyebrows on Dayrit.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Discuss Principles for Choosing World Cup Host </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The executive committee of the
International Football Federation (FIFA) will discuss new rules
for designating the FIFA World Cup organizer at its next meeting
in August, according to a FIFA press release received here today.
</P>
<P>
Following up on the vote to determine the host association of
the 2006 FIFA World Cup, FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter has
elaborated in a letter to the FIFA Executive Committee on his
suggestions in last month's FIFA News that the system for awarding
the FIFA World Cup needs to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the FIFA President also referred to his remarks
at the media conference on 6 July following the announcement of
the results of the vote and stressed the importance that FIFA
should not repeatedly grant the World Cup to the same continents
but, on the contrary, should be entrusting its flagship
competition to different confederations in compliance with a
method that has yet to be defined. In particular, he listed
several options:
</P>
<P>
-- By rotating from continent to continent;
</P>
<P>
-- By limiting the number of candidates per continent;
</P>
<P>
-- By simultaneously designating the organizers of two
consecutive World Cups;
</P>
<P>
-- Either by combining all three principles or by adopting
other principles that would lead to the same goal.
</P>
<P>
A letter from the African Football Confederation (CAF) echoing
the same sentiments has been received by FIFA in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the next meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee
on August 3 will therefore include an item under which there is to
be an open discussion of a variety of options enabling FIFA to
adopt a new policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The minimum income level of
Shanghai residents this year has risen to 280 yuan (about 33.7 U.S.
dollars) from 120 yuan a month in 1993, according to mayor Xu
Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
"The Shanghai municipal government's primary goal is to improve

finding jobs get re-employed, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to guarantee people's education and medical care
rights, Xu said, Shanghai has provided medical aid to more than 10,
000 people over the past three years and 105 million yuan to cash-
strapped students in 1999.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a large-scale
modern sapling breeding base began today in Beijing's northern
suburb of Changping, in an effort to provide more green in the
areas surrounding the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
The state-level 60.79-million-yuan (7.32 million US dollars)
breeding base is believed the largest in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is made up of 30,000 square meters of air-conditioned rooms,
23 hectares of seedling nursery and storage, and 100 hectares of
irrigated planting area.
</P>
<P>
After completion, the base is likely to provide 16 million
saplings, which will give a big boost to environmental protection
work near Beijing and in northern China.
</P>
<P>
This spring Beijing was besieged by sandstorms and now
sweltering temperatures are the norm.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the problems to the lack of plants and poor
soil and water conservation in the areas around the capital.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese State Council has
decided to immediately hold a nationwide check on production
safety to curb the surging number of accidents here, vice-premier
Wu Bangguo said here today.
</P>
<P>
In a televised national conference, Wu said enterprises failing
to pass the examination would face stern sanctions, including
suspension or even closure of business.

China, saying that some agencies did not fulfill their duties.
</P>
<P>
Wu stressed that authorities must not be lenient in dealing
with serious accidents.

Penalties must be imposed not only on those who are directly
responsible, but also on the leaders of institutions and
supervising authorities, he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Frequent Accidents Cause Concern in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The frequent occurrence of fatal
traffic and industrial accidents in China in the first half of
this year has alarmed top leaders and the public.
</P>
<P>
The tragic shipwreck off the coast of eastern Yantai City last
November, in which 280 people were killed or remain missing, did
little to prevent the increase of major accidents in the country
this year, despite repeated instructions from the Chinese
leadership and great efforts made by governments at different
levels to stress safety in transportation and production.
</P>
<P>
On March 11, an explosion at a private fireworks plant left 33
dead, while on June 30, a blast at a Hong Kong-funded fireworks
factory killed 38 workers.
</P>
<P>
On June 22 alone, 130 people died when their passenger vessel
capsized on the Hejiang River in southwestern Sichuan Province,
and in a separate incident and 47 passengers and crew members were
killed in an aircraft accident in Wuhan, the provincial capital of
central Hubei.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 42 major industrial
accidents were reported, each costing 10 or more lives, and ending
in the deaths of 699 people, according to Zhang Junjiu, a vice-
chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China reported 180,000 fires, killing over 2,700
people, statistics that went up 40 percent and 15 percent
respectively over the figures of 1998. In the first four months of
this year, fires resulted in a death toll of 142 and injured 105,
up 97 percent and 50 percent over the previous year.

<P>
Official figures also show that in recent years, accidents of
various kinds led to a death toll of almost 100,000 people
annually. Between 1996-99, industrial units across the country
experienced 388 serious accidents that took 356 lives.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that most of the accidents took place in
overseas-funded, private or collectively-funded factories, and
most were caused by negligence, such as overloading of vehicles/
vessels by transporters, violations of rules, lack of preventive
measures, and poor management.
</P>
<P>
China loses tens of billions of yuan due to accidents of
various kinds every year, most of which are cause by mismanagement
of authorities, the statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some enterprises have overlooked official rules and
regulations and the importance of safety; others are derelict in
their duty or are ignoring the possibility of legal punishment.
</P>
<P>
The central leadership has ordered that those who are directly
or indirectly responsible for the occurrence of accidents be dealt
with severely.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: MILF's Declaration of Jihad Unwarranted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
called Wednesday the declaration of jihad by Chairman Hashim
Salamat of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) as unwarranted,
saying that the government has not declared war against the Muslim
people.
</P>
<P>
the president said he had only ordered government troops to
step up efforts in running after MILF rebels "who have violated
the ceasefire agreement or committed other criminal or illegal
acts."
</P>
<P>
The president was reacting to the call by Salamat for his
people to rise in jihad or armed struggle against the government,
after the fall of Camp Abubakar, MILF's main headquarters in
Mindanao, to government hands last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said he regretted that the military's decisive victory
against the Muslim separatist rebels has prompted the MILF
leadership to declare a war against the people.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he had hoped that after the fall of Camp Abubakar
and all other MILF camps, the government and the people in
Mindanao could now focus on the more urgent task ahead, which is
to speed up Mindanao's transformation into a regional trade hub
and food-basket of the country.
</P>
<P>
"With the end of hostilities, we had hoped that our Christian
and Muslim brothers alike could now put on fast track our program
to turn the South from a 'land of promise' into a 'land of
fulfillment,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also warned rebels who persist in taking up arms
against the government in pursuit of their secessionist cause that
the government "is ready and fully capable of crushing them." To
those who want peace, he said, the government will give them peace.

<HEADLINE> UK's Jobless Figure Hits 20-year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The jobless total in Britain has
fallen to a 20-year low as the Government celebrates a huge
increase in employment levels.
</P>
<P>
Employment has grown by more than a million since the Labor
government came to power in 1997 to reach a new rate of 74.6
percent, the best figure recorded. The unemployment rate was 3.8
percent, the lowest rate since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Employment has increased by 126,000 over the three months to
May, by 346,000 over the year and by over a million since Spring
1997, according to the figures that the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The broader measure of unemployment, the International Labor
Organization (ILO) unemployment, fell even faster, by 47,000, in
the period from March to May to 1.67 million, a rate of 5.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible for the first time in a generation to talk
about full employment in Britain," said UK's prime minister Tony
Blair.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the healthy set of figures, the data also
revealed the fall in manufacturing jobs, down by 95,000 over the
past year to fall below 4 million.
</P>
<P>
The figures from ONS also show average earnings increased by 4.
6 percent in the year to May, down by 0.5 percent on April's
figure, largely because of falling bonus payments in a number of
industries including finance, recreation and retail.

<HEADLINE> Three Wise Men Nominated to Scrutinize Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Three men including a former
Finnish president were nominated Wednesday as the wise men to
scrutinize the human rights record of Austria.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of former Finnish president Martti Ahtisaari,
former Spanish Foreign Minister Marcelino Oreja and German
professor Jochen Frowein was pronounced in Brussels by Romano
Prodi, president of the European Commission, the executive body of
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The nomination of the three wise men, made by the European
Court of Human Rights, was seen as an outlet for lifting the
political sanctions imposed by 14 EU member states on Austria
after the country incorporated the far-right Freedom Party into
the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
The court named the three wise men in alphabetical order,
suggesting that it had not nominated any of the trio to chair the
panel.
</P>
<P>
The Strasbourg-based court issued a written statement saying
that the trio would report directly to the nation that is holding
the six-month rotating presidency of the 15-nation bloc, which is
now France.
</P>
<P>
The court did not set any deadline as for when the trio has to
complete their scrutiny and hand in their report, though some
expected their report to come out before the planned Austrian
plebiscite so as to shun a further political row within the union.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed that no deadline was set for the handing-in of the
wise men's report, the Austrian coalition parties agreed last week
to hold a non-binding referendum on its relations with the
European Union and the plebiscite is scheduled to be held either
on October 29 or November 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner said in
Brussels on Monday that the referendum might never happen and the
European Union should deflect the plebiscite by lifting the
sanctions before any vote takes place.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said in Brussels
on Wednesday that his country would cooperate with the wise men in
their scrutinization and that he believed their report would turn
out to be a clean sheet of human rights records on the country.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Department-Store Operator Seeks Court-Mandated Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sogo Co., a financially troubled
Japanese department store chain, on Wednesday filed with the Tokyo
District Court for protection from creditors, aiming to seek
rehabilitation, said Sogo President Kyoichi Yamada.
</P>
<P>
The court accepted the chain's request and issued an order for
protection of Sogo's assets so the company can proceed with
restructuring under a new law designed to let firms facing an
imminent collapse jump-start rehabilitation, Yamada told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Sogo has debts totaling some 1.87 trillion yen (17.4 billion U.
S. dollars), one of the largest amounts shouldered by a company
seeking court protection from creditors, financial sources said.
</P>
<P>
In line with its management restructuring plan drawn up in
April, Sogo has been calling on creditor banks to give up claims
on loans worth a total of 630 billion yen, (5.9 billion dollars),
an amount necessary to enable the company to seek restructuring on
its own.
</P>
<P>
The amount includes 97 billion yen (902 million dollars) in
loans held by Japan's state-run Deposit Insurance Corp. (DIC).
</P>
<P>
The DIC, along with other creditor banks, decided in June to
forgive the loans, a decision that has sparked public criticism
that the move represents an effective bailout of a private company
by the government.
</P>
<P>
Yamada said the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on
Tuesday asked his company to seriously reconsider its request to
the DIC.
</P>
<P>
Sogo's executive board decided to meet the request and give up
restructuring on its own, instead opting for the court-mandated
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Sogo, with outlets in Japan, as well as in major Asian cities,
actively expanded its department store network in recent years.
The expansion, however, entailed massive interest-bearing debts,
which, coupled with sluggish consumer spending, troubled the
retailer financially.

<HEADLINE> Thaw Seen in Belgium-Austrian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A slight thaw was seen here in
Brussels on Wednesday when Belgium invited the Austrian ambassador
to participate in the country's national celebration.
</P>
<P>
It was a tentative move by Belgium, one of the hard-line
opponents toward Austria's incorporation of its far-right Freedom
Party into the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
Belgium joined 13 other European Union member states in the
political isolation imposed on Austria after the coalition was
sworn in on February 4.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the joint sanction moves, even Belgian school
children called off their planned skiing vacations in the Austrian
mountains and the then Freedom Party chief Joerg Haider, the man
in the center of the political dispute, called off his trip to
Brussels to attend the European Union's regional committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman of the Belgian foreign minister, however, said
that the invitation was not a loosen-up on the front of the joint
sanctions, according to a local television report.
</P>
<P>
He explained that all the other EU member states had invited
Austrian ambassadors to their respective national holiday
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian National Day falls on July 21.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Allowed in West-East Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors will be allowed
to control the main stake in West-East Natural Gas Transportation
Pipeline Project and to contribute funding to other urban gas
pipeline construction.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Guobao, vice-minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission (SDPC), told a press conference today that the
new policy fully demonstrates the central government's
determination to open wider to the outside and to push its entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The state will not approve solely state-owned investment in the
pipeline project, which is estimated to cost 40 billion yuan, in a
bid to make foreign-controlled investment possible, with no
ceiling set for their share-holding percentage, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The West-East Natural Gas Transportation Pipeline Project is
the most ambitious ever undertaken by the central government in
its effort to developing the vast western areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition to favorable policies given to infrastructure
construction, the pipeline project also enjoys favorable policies
earmarked for the westward strategy, including fee cuts and
exemptions in mineral exploration and mining, tax-free imports of
related equipment, and land-use.
</P>
<P>
The Tarim Basin of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is
estimated to have 8.39 trillion cubic meters of natural gas
resources, 494.1 billion of which have been verified, sufficient
for 12 billion cubic meters of annual gas transportation in the
early stage of the project.
</P>
<P>
Proven gas reserves are expected to reach one trillion in the
next decade, a guarantee for gas supply for 30 years and a
precondition for 20 billion cubic meters of gas transportation in
the future, said Ma Fucai, general manager of China Petroleum (
Group) Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline is scheduled to start next year
and be completed in 2003, he added.

HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
stressed Wednesday the importance of life-long education for local
residents from all walks of life during his visit to the Open
University of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"As our society becomes more knowledge-based, continued
education plays an important part in helping us to make progress,"
Tung said. "We will do our best to let everyone have a chance to

<HEADLINE> Traditional, Dotcom Media in Court War Over Infringement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Traditional media, mainly
newspapers and magazines, angered by frequent infringement of
copyrighted material by dot-coms, are waging a legal war against
their newborn but thriving competitors.
</P>
<P>
"Why do these network media steal others' articles while
spending so heavily on building up their own image?" asked Cheng
Chibing, editor-in-chief of the Life Info magazine, at a news
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The briefing was hosted by the magazine to expose a lawsuit
against a well-known dot-com company, chinaren.com, run by the
Beijing Shaling Information Technology Company, which is charged
with heisting 36 articles and 13 photographs from the magazine
without its approval.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court will hear the case,
according to Cheng.
</P>
<P>
This case isn't the first and it won't be the last: Traditional
media outlets have sent warnings to their ambitious young
competitors in various forms.
</P>
<P>
Some new media companies are taking into account the issue of
intellectual property rights, but many others still ignore the
legal and ethical implications of stealing original material.
</P>
<P>
The district court of Haidian in western Beijing, home of China
's "Silicon Valley" Zhongguancun, has more copyright infringement
cases on its docket than any court in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the court handled 17 IPR cases.

<HEADLINE> Philippines, DPRK Establishes Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) signed a joint communique here
Wednesday, formally establishing diplomatic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The document was signed Wednesday afternoon at the Department
of Foreign Affairs by Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
and DPRK Ambassador to Thailand Jo In Chol.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint communique, the governments of the two
countries, guided by the principles of the United Nations Charter
and the generally accepted principles of international law, have
agreed to establish diplomatic relations between the two countries
at the ambassadorial level as from the date of signing of the
communique.
</P>
<P>
These principles include respect for domestic laws, national
sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual respect for
international agreements to which both countries are parties, non-
interference in the internal affairs of states, and equality and
mutual respect, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking following the signing ceremony, Siazon said that the
path towards the normalization of the relations "has not been easy
", but "the fulfillment of expectations makes this occasion all
the more auspicious..."
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries have decided to establish formal diplomatic
ties to manifest a mutual commitment to develop friendly and
cooperative relations," said Siazon.
</P>
<P>
He said the Philippine government believes the normalization of
relations between Manila and Pyongyang will significantly
contribute to the economic growth and progress of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said this move will not only complement efforts towards
peace but also contribute, through exchanges and cooperation, to "
a climate of friendship, openness, and mutual understanding
between and among the countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
Jo In Chol, on his part, said the two sides signed the joint
communique with agreement on the principles of "respect for
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and non-interference in
internal affairs and mutual respect."
</P>
<P>
"Independence, peace and friendship is a constant idea and
principles of our government in terms of promoting friendly
relationship among the nations," Jo said.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document, the DPRK ambassador said, will
bring the relations between the two countries "closer and closer."
</P>
<P>
In the years to come, Jo noted, the DPRK will make greater
cooperation with the Philippines either in international arena or
in the international organizations in the semi-region.
</P>
<P>
Jo, who arrived here Tuesday night for Wednesday's signing
ceremony, will also act as non-resident ambassador to Manila while
the Philippine ambassador to China will also work as the envoy to
Pyongyang.

<HEADLINE> Manila Refuses to Intervene in Peso Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the peso's continued slide,
the Philippine government said Wednesday that it will maintain its
stand not to interfere in the market, as it remains confident that
the currency can recover soon.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Buenaventura, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, issued this statement after several sectors called
for government intervention when the peso's value fell to a 30-
month low on Tuesday, nearing the 45 pesos to one U.S. dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
"If we see speculative plays we'll intervene. So far we haven't
seen any need to intervene," Buenaventura said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government is eyeing a plan to tap the long-
term peso market for debt servicing instead of using dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I suggested to the Secretary of Finance that if there is
liquidity in the system we should not borrow everything in dollars
but go to the long-term peso market. The central bank holds 160
billion pesos (4 billion dollars) in overnight money from banks,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also laughed off claims that the peso dive is a
sign that the country will plunge into a crisis similar to the one
it experienced during the 1997 Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he noted, interest rates jumped up to 16 percent,
while inflation was at 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
Citing economic indicators for this year, Buenaventura said
interest rates are now at nine percent, while inflation is less
than four percent
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura also said the central bank now has ample dollar
reserves of 16 billion dollar, compared to much less when
President Joseph Estrada took over in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The peso will correct itself. We only have to keep up with
other currencies," he said.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura warned traders against engaging in currency
speculation, which may only backfire on them, as what happened to
speculators three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Speculators in 1997 got burned when they bought dollars at 47
pesos to one dollar but the peso strengthened to 41 pesos to one
dollar," he said.

<P>
LOME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- African leaders attending the closing
ceremony of the 36th annual summit of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) signed one-by-one here on Wednesday the draft treaty
on the establishment of the African Union.
</P>
<P>
They approved unanimously the legal text of the union late on
Tuesday, the second day of the 36th OAU summit held in the
Togolese capital, so as to implement an important decision to
create the African Union which was made at the extraordinary
summit in September 1999 in Syrte, Libya.
</P>
<P>
But the formal creation of the new union, which will
effectively replace the OAU, will not take into force until two
thirds of the Pan-African organization's 53 members have ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has been pushing for a closer
union of Africa as soon as possible to confront the great
challenge of globalization, but other countries like South Africa
and Nigeria prefer a slow speed.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The China International Travel
Service (CITS) Head Office, the China Travel Service (CTS) and the

tourism Internet company, was set up in 1997 with the CITS taking
part of the stakes.

Li Lu'an, president of the CITS Head Office, said the number of
hotel rooms booked through the network increased by three to four
times on a yearly basis in the first half of this year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wrap-up: China Urges U.S. to Abandon NMD (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian today urged the United States to treat seriously the
strong appeal of the international community and abandon the
National Missile Defense (NMD) at the earliest time.
</P>
<P>
Chi reiterated the stance of the Chinese government in a
meeting with U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the trend of the time, and the world
is moving toward ease, Chi said.
</P>
<P>
However, the NMD system will have a negative impact on the
efforts for global strategic equilibrium and stability,
international arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Chi said evasion of the One-China
principle has no way out, and Taiwan issue can not and will not be
delayed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
"China-U.S. relationship is facing opportunities and problems
as well, and the most important and sensitive of the problems is
the Taiwan issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the U.S. side has promised for many times
its adherence to the One-China policy, observance of the three
China-U.S. joint communiques and the "three-no" commitment, Chi
urged the U.S. to honor its commitment and not to give the Taiwan
authorities a wrong signal.
</P>
<P>
Reunification of China and to oppose splitting activities have
been an irreversible trend and common aspiration of the entire
Chinese people, which has also been favored by people all over the
world, Chi stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. side has fully realized the importance and
sensitivity of the Taiwan issue, and it will adhere to the One-
China policy and abide by the three joint communiques between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between two armed forces, Chi Haotian voiced
the hope that the U.S. would make efforts in maintaining a healthy
and stable China-U.S. relations so as to create favorable
condition for the development of the military relations of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi said military relations is an important component of China-
U.S. relations. Since early this year, senior officers of the two
armed forces have restored exchanges, and the China-U.S. military
relations have maintained a good momentum of improvement.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. side is pleased to see the restoration of
the military relations between the U.S. and China this year, and
the exchanges between senior officers of the two armed forces have
developed smoothly.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build more
information expressways to facilitate its burgeoning distance
education, an official with the Ministry of Education said here.
</P>
<P>
Most municipalities and provinces will open high-speed
transmission portals by the end of this year, said Zhang Yaoxue,
director of the Science and Technology Department of the Education
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
China Education and Research Network (CERNET) has already
linked over 70 cities involving three million users in some 700
universities and science and research units, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
To raise the speed of the network, five 155-megabyte-per-second
information highways linking Beijing and other five cities have
been put in use on a trial basis.

<HEADLINE> China Monitors Land Use with Satellite Remote Sensing Tech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The land use situation in China's
large cities is being monitored by watchful eyes in the sky.
</P>
<P>
China is employing satellite remote sensing technology to
effectively check the occupation of arable land and help
strengthen the administration of land resources, according to the
Ministry of Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition held by the ministry here today revealed that the
land use situations in 66 large cities with populations over 500,
000, including Beijing and Shanghai, were watched over by
satellite between Oct. 1998 through Oct. 1999.
</P>
<P>
Data based on monitoring from satellites developed by the
United States and France showed that 348,000 mu (25,600 hectares)
of cultivated land in the 66 cities were occupied by mines,
factories, railways, highways and other urban construction
projects last year.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring results also showed that some cities were making
false land use reports last year, and they subsequently were
forced to shut down the illegal land use projects according to
land use laws.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will set up a nationwide land use remote sensing
monitoring network in the coming three years, with monitoring of
key cities to be an annual event, and will publish yearly reports
on urban land use.
</P>
<P>
In addition, radar technology will be introduced to monitor
south and southwest China where optical satellite data cannot meet
monitoring requirements because of harsh weather conditions.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Qian Qichen
met here today with a delegation, headed by Feng Hu-hsiang, from
Taiwan's New Party.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Qian said he appreciated the New Party's
agreement with the consensus made in 1992 between the mainland's
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) that "both sides of the
straits stick to the One-China principle."
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said the resumption of contact and talks
between the ARATS and the SEF will be beneficial to the
development of cross-Straits relations, the objection to "Taiwan
Independence", and the protection of rights and interests of
Chinese people on both sides of the Straits.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said the
resumption of dialogue along with exchanges of mail service, trade

are the common wishes of Chinese people on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.

<HEADLINE> Chinese and U.S. DMs on International Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China will stick to her
independent foreign policy of peace and make joint efforts with
the other countries in developing friendly relations and creating
a peaceful and stable security environment on the basis of five
principles of peaceful co-existence.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian made the remarks here
today in a meeting with his counterpart of the United States
William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Chi said fundamental changes have taken place in the current
international situation after the cold war ended. China was, is
and will be an important strength to safeguard world and regional
peace and stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said with the common efforts of China and the U.S.,
especially with the support of the leaders of the two counties,
China-U.S. relations, which underwent up and down last year, have
been improved. It is not easy to achieve the current situation and
both sides should value it, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the U.S. and China have shared common interest and
shoulder the responsibility in safeguarding world peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government holds that it should not contain China, he
said, adding that the U.S. should continue to develop its
relationship with China and commit to furthering the cooperation
and mutual understanding with China, so as to safeguard peace and
development of the Asian-Pacific region, and bring happiness to
people of the two countries and the world as well.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. government supports China's accession to the
World Trade Organization, and will make the congress to pass China
's Permanent Normal Trade Relations resolution as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on the regional security of
common concern.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Chi and Cohen signed an agreement between the
U.S. Department of Defense and the Chinese Ministry of National
Defense of China concerning exchange of environmental protection

<HEADLINE> Scientists Issue Alarm of Intensified Solar Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers who observed
on Tuesday the most severe outbreak of solar activity in four
years have issued alarm of disastrous space weather in the coming
12 days.
</P>
<P>
 Yan Yihua, chief scientist with the Beijing Observatory under
the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said they recorded the peak value
of solar activity as massive solar energy was released at 6:13 a.m.
(Beijing Time), which was about 3,000 billion times of the
explosion of atomic bomb over Hiroshima, Japan by the United
States during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Massive geomagnetic storms and high-energy particles from the
solar activity interrupt satellites, telecommunications facilities,
power transmission, and oil transmission through pipelines, Yan
said.
</P>
<P>
"We spotted Tuesday sunspots moving from the eastern part of
the Sun, indicating big solar activity, or release of huge energy
in succession in the coming 13 days," Yan told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Sun has entered its 23rd 11-year cycle of solar activity
recorded by astronomers, experts said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China Intellectual Property
Society (CIPS) today began its third national conference and the
2000 academic symposium in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 scholars, experts and lawyers are participating
the high-profile meeting which is organized every five years.
</P>
<P>
In a written speech to the conference, Ren Jianxin, vice-
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's

progress in developing the intellectual property system in the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
More than one million patent applications have been made in
China since the country's first patent law was approved in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The intellectual property system has been proved suitable to
China's conditions and greatly promoted scientific and
technological development in the country, Ren said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the CIPS to organize more quality academic
research and exchanges in intellectual property protection against
the backdrop of rapid development in high technology.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Ying, commissioner of the State Intellectual Property
Office (SIPO), said that the protection of intellectual property
rights is increasingly important to a state's technological
advancement as well as the security of its national economy. (

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Reopen Border Oil Trade with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will reopen its Habur border
gate across Iraq to allow border trade of commodities, oil in
particular, in the upcoming weeks.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the government issued a decree to curb border
oil trade with Iraq, allegedly for fear of the fuel money flowing
into the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been
engaged in an armed struggle since 1984 for self-rule in the
Kurdish-populated southeastern Turkey bordering north Iraq, Turkish
Daily News quoted officials as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the issuance of the decree, the amount of cheap oil being
brought into Turkey at various border crossings including Habur has
been halved.
</P>
<P>
The move dismayed local civilian and military officials, who
complained it will instead further hurt the ailing economy of the
region and encourage smuggling that will only benefit Kurdish
separatist militants.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed officials said the government will be able to solve
the problem within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The issue was discussed during last National Security Council
(MGK) meeting. the MGK advised the government to change the
decree," they said.
</P>
<P>
The Habur gate, which was closed down due to the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990, is important for southeastern Turkey since
it links the country to the Middle East and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
With its unofficial opening by Turkey in recent years, economy
in the southeast flourished.
</P>
<P>
Fuel trade is the major border trade between Turkey and Iraq in
the region, where the sanctions-stricken country sells crude oil
and fuel to Turkey in return for food and other vital commodities.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the decree, more than 1,000 lorries crossed the border
every day as part of the border trade which has boosted economy of
the southeast.
</P>
<P>
The local officials were not only urging the government to
reconsider the decree, but also calling for enhancing the border
trade with Iraq by opening up at least two new border gates into
the Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They said that limiting the border trade and fuel imports is "
needless" and serves only to paralyze the region's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
With the border trade restrictions, the fuel coming into Turkey
via Habur will become the target of smugglers who will still manage
to bring the fuel into Turkey, they argued.
</P>
<P>
They warned that money earned from smuggling will go to the PKK,
adding that only boosting the border trade can enhance Turkey's
influence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Iraqi Kurds have been cooperating with
the Turkish military to fight against PKK separatists who are
trying to find a foothold in the region after being uprooted in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi Kurds rely on the income from Iraq's fuel trade
with Turkey. Thus, any restrictions in border trade will hurt their
revenue and negatively affect Turkey's ability to influence them.
</P>
<P>
Local officials complained that Ankara authorities did not
consult them before making such decisions, saying that businessmen
and thousands of truck drivers were outraged because the latest
restrictions virtually brought the border trade they had benefited
from to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Under the present decree, trucks are able to bring 75,000 tons
of oil via Habur and 15,000 tons via another border gate Igdir each
month. Before the ruling, the figures were 150,000 tons at Habur
and 30,000 tons at Igdir.
</P>
<P>
It was speculated that major foreign oil companies operating in
Turkey are instrumental in the limit decree because they feel the
cheap fuel entering Turkey through the border trade is creating
unfair competition.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Population to Hit 25 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's population is expected to
hit 25 million by 2005, a sharp increase from 16.7 million in 1991,
Population Secretariat of Ugandan Finance and Economic Planning
Ministry told Xinhua Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's population now registering at 22.5 million grows at a
rate of 2.9 percent annually, one of the highest growth rate in
sub-Saharan Africa, said the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Finance Gerald Ssendaula, a big
population is not a problem, what cause a problem is the quality
of the people that make up the population.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, however, that a high population growth rate
would undermine economic growth rate.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the population will have grown to 32.5
million by the year of 2015, almost double what it was in 1991,
not withstanding the impact of HIV/AIDS and malaria which are the
biggest killer diseases in the east Africa country, according to
the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Uganda family planning policy allows couples to decide on how
many children to have and when to have them, according to
Ssendaula.
</P>
<P>
However, Acting Director Population secretariat Charles
Zirarema called upon Ugandans to strategically plan for their
families.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Experiences Erratic Economic Growth in Past Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has
said the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has been
highly erratic over the past decade due to drought, macro-economic
imbalances and falling investment and export performance.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in its economic highlights released here
Wednesday that macro-economic imbalances had been manifested in
high inflation and interest rates which had affected investment
and savings.
</P>
<P>
It said per capita growth had been declining over the past
decade as a result. The trends in per capita income showed a
steady decline in living standards.
</P>
<P>
Investment fell from a peak of 22.6 percent of GDP in 1993 to
14.5 percent by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Low economic activity has been evidenced by marked decline in
manufacturing. Agriculture has managed to maintain steady growth
though at low levels," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The contribution of manufacturing to GDP has declined
consistently from 20.5 percent in 1990 to 15 percent by 1999," the
bank said. "Contributions from agriculture rose from 14.8 percent
to 16.3 percent during the same period."
</P>
<P>
The contribution from mining to GDP had declined from about 4
percent in 1990 to 3 percent in 1999 against the background of
falling international mineral prices.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for "War of Liberation" Against HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Nations must commit to the "largest
mobilization of resources in their history" as if they were
fighting "a full-blown war of liberation," if they hope to defeat
AIDS, the disease with young people in the forefront, the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
HIV/AIDS infects six people under the age of 24 every minute,
according to a new UNICEF report, the Progress of Nations 2000,
detailing the enormous impact of HIV/AIDS among young people.
</P>
<P>
"HIV/AIDS constitutes the greatest threat many societies have
ever faced," said UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy on the
occasion of the publication of the report.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, in many ways it has been a hidden enemy, aided
and abetted by a general reluctance to acknowledge its strength
and our own vulnerability. Thus we have not confronted AIDS with
the full force we are capable of," she said.
</P>
<P>
Major findings from the UNICEF report include:
</P>
<P>
-- Almost a third of all people with HIV/AIDS are between the
ages of 15 and 24, a total of some 10 million young people;
</P>
<P>
-- Girls and young women are more than 50 percent more likely
to contract HIV than boys and young men;
</P>
<P>
-- And in 1999 alone, an estimated 860,000 primary school
children in sub-Saharan Africa lost their teachers to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The report also finds that in several countries, almost half of
all girls aged 15-19 do not know that a person who looks healthy
can be infected with HIV and transmit it to others; in a number of
countries where AIDS is epidemic, nearly half of sexually active
girls aged 15-19 believe they face no risk of contracting the
disease; and in surveys in 17 countries, over half of adolescents
could not name a single method of protecting themselves against
HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Virtually every society understands what it means to wage a
struggle for liberation," the UNICEF chief said, noting that the
concept has particular resonance in Africa. "It means mobilizing
every available resource; it means involving men and women on an
equal basis; it means accepting the vital role to be played by
young people; and it means sparing no effort and brooking no
diversions until all of society is liberated."

<HEADLINE> Switzerland, EU to Begin New Round of Bilateral Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland and the European Union
(EU) will start a new round of negotiations on further bilateral
agreements later this year, Swiss Foreign Minister Joseph Deiss
announced Tuesday after a visit to Brussels.
</P>
<P>
He and EU Commissioner for Foreign Relations Chris Patten said
expert-level talks would begin in fall. Patten restated that tax
evasion would be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, for its part, is seeking new areas for bilateral
agreements such as the media, statistics and education, following
the ratification of seven accords which are due to come into
effect next January.
</P>
<P>
Patten said the European Commission would give the go-ahead to
negotiations this week. One of the most controversial issues is
likely to be the EU's demand for non-member countries, including
Switzerland, to signal their willingness to cooperate with an
agreement compelling them to report the assets of non-residents.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the need for balance in bilateral talks, Deiss said
Switzerland had no desire to be seen as a haven for tax exiles,
but wanted to retain banking secrecy.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed Switzerland's interest in broadening
negotiations to include security and asylum policies.
</P>
<P>
At their 45-minute meeting on Tuesday, they reviewed the
ratification process for the seven accords between Switzerland and
the EU, which Swiss voters approved in a referendum on May 21.
Patten said the accords were beneficial to both sides, and urged
individual EU states to accept them as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral agreements are supposed to come into force on
January 1, 2001, once they have been approved by the parliaments
of all 15 EU member states.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Fake Cigarettes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China is increasing its efforts to
stub out production and sale of fake cigarettes to secure tax
income and protect the consumers' interests, according to the
State Tobacco Monopoly Administration (STMA).
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the STMA show that in the first half of this
year, the country's law enforcement officers dealt with 100,000
cigarette counterfeit cases, closing down 1,500 illegal cigarette
factories and confiscated 3.1 billion counterfeited cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
In March and April, the STMA and several other departments
jointly launched a large-scale campaign in Henan and Guangdong.
Three large illegal factories in Shaanxi, Heilongjiang and Guizhou
were closed down.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the state tightened control over the production and
use of cigarette paper and closed down 26 mills that turned out
substandard cigarette paper during the first half of this year.

BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market inched
up 0.20 points, or 0.18 percent, to 110.99 at the close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover was 29.78 million HK dollars, 10.58 million HK dollars
or 26.21 percent more than Tuesday's total, according to Beijing-
based online financial advisory company Homeway.
</P>
<P>
There was little change in today's positive bias as the market
took a modest gain in early morning before resuming its upward
correction pattern. There was little enthusiasm among investors as
they showed caution without knowing exactly if the earnings season
might create a negative stir.
</P>
<P>
Gainers beat losers by 31 to 18, with 6 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
ST Lionda Hold rose 2.29 percent to 1.38 HK dollars, while
Health Mineral added 2.64 percent to 3.50 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
ST Great Ocean dropped 2.15 percent to 0.91 HK dollars, while
Sez Real Estate slipped 1.94 percent to 2.53 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The market is trying to recover, but is still challenged by
sellers. Overall it persists in mixed trading while some minor
gains are likely to be scored amid prolonged cautious sentiment,
Homeway analysts said.

<HEADLINE> China's T-bond Market Fluctuates Narrowly on Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond trade kept
fluctuating narrowly on Wednesday, with the total trading value
expanding by 150 million yuan to 1.4 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that 009704, a 9.78 percent bond due 2007, lost
most to 143.50 yuan, a little below its five-day and ten-day
average prices and pushing the yield up 0.03 percentage points to
4.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bond 010004, the only bond with floating interest rate on the
market, picked up by 0.09 percent to 102.00 yuan with turnover
totaling 401 million yuan. The bond may withstand more selling
pressure to go up further, said Beijing-based financial advisory
company Homeway.
</P>
<P>
The remaining four bonds were flat during the trading day. The
quiet T-bond market is mainly due to the bullish stock markets,
Homeway analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day
repo transactions contracted by 826 million yuan to 1.51 billion
yuan. Meanwhile, the interest rate on the three-day product rose 0.
13 percentage points to 4.02 percent.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Under the threat of Knesset (Parliament) legislation, the
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Tuesday it is cutting the 36-
month mandatory military service for men by four months, beginning
with those drafted in August 2001.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, IDF Manpower Chief Yehuda Segev said
conscription for women will be lengthened by three months to 24
months.
</P>
<P>
The IDF began considering the cuts after the Knesset notified it
last summer that it must reassess its manpower needs, as the region
moves away from the era of large conventional armies.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's two chief rabbis, Yisrael Lau and Eliahu Bakshi-
Doran, had told Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak before his
departure to Camp David that they will not oppose transfer of
control over Rachel's Tomb, Joseph's Tomb, and even the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, to the Palestinians, as long as appropriate measures
are taken to guarantee access, prayer rights and security for Jews
at the holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Neither the halakah (Jewish Law) nor tradition, they said,
requires Jewish sovereignty over graves, including the graves of
the religious pantheon.
</P>
<P>
This is substantial support for the expected IDF withdrawal from
the remaining territories in Hebron, Bethlehem and Nablus in an
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton opened a three-way summit with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at Camp David, Maryland on Tuesday. They are to strive for
an agreement on all of the tough final-status issues, including
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The two leaders face profound and wrenching questions," Clinton
had told reporters on the White House lawn before leaving for the
summit. "Both leaders feel the weight of history but both, I
believe, recognize this is a moment in history which they can
seize."
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton's bilateral
meetings with Arafat and Barak lasted an hour and 50 minutes
respectively. The three then held a 30-minute trilateral meeting.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's Supreme Court is to hand down a dramatic reading of
the verdict in the appeal of former Shas leader Aryeh Deri
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Deri appealed his conviction by the lower court on charges of
accepting a bribe, breach of faith, and aggravated fraud, and his
sentence of four years in jail and a NIS 250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was heard by a three-judge panel over a period of 18
days from the end of January to the middle of February.

<HEADLINE> Former Israeli Minister Sentenced to Three Years in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Supreme Court decided
Wednesday to uphold the bribery conviction of former Interior
Minister Arye Deri of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, and to
sentence him to a three-year prison term starting on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was handed down after the Supreme Court partially
accepted Deri's appeal against the four-year sentence imposed on
him last March by the Jerusalem District Court.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court canceled a number of the clauses of which Deri
was convicted, but upheld the bribery conviction.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem District Court convicted Deri, the country's
youngest interior minister in history and former Shas party leader,
of taking bribes totalling 155,000 U.S. dollars from three friends
and co-defendants - Moshe and Aryeh Weinberg and Yom Tov Rubin, as
well as fraud and breach of trust.
</P>
<P>
The conviction was delivered on March 17, 1999 following a trial
that lasted five years. A three-judge panel ruled unanimously that
Deri pocketed the money over a period of five years from 1985 to
1989 in return for channelling state funds to the Weinberg-Rubin
yeshiva.
</P>
<P>
On April 14, 1999, Deri was sentenced to four years in prison
and fined 250,000 shekels (about 62,500 U.S. dollars) or another 10
months in prison in lieu of the fine.
</P>
<P>
The court also ruled that the count of bribery constituted moral
turpitude, meaning that if Deri's appeal is rejected, he will not
be able to run for public office for 10 years after completing his
prison term.
</P>
<P>
The sentence caused a furor in Shas's constituency, which
revered the charismatic young politician and one of the country's
most powerful people. Six weeks later, Shas won 17 seats in the
Knesset (Parliament) elections, up from 10 three years earlier. The
party thus rose to the status of the third largest parliamentary
grouping after the Labor Party and the Likud.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court decided to reduce the prison term for two
reasons: the suffering caused to Deri's family due to the prolonged
legal proceedings and the extended investigation, which lasted 10
years.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Shas supporters gathered around the Supreme Court in
Jerusalem on Wednesday morning, waiting for the court decision on
Deri's appeal. The police reinforced their presence in the area.
</P>
<P>
Deri said, upon leaving the Supreme Court after the decision was
read, that he receives the ruling with love.
</P>
<P>
Under the Israeli Basic Law, Deri will not be barred from
running for the Knesset if he chooses to do so. The law bans only
someone convicted of a crime against state security from running
for office.

<HEADLINE> Death Count Reaches 123 in Manila Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The death count in the Payatas
garbage dump landslide that occurred Monday morning in Quezon City,
Metro Manila has risen to 123 as of 5:00 p.m. Wednesday, said the
Philippine government.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said 300
families or 998 persons have been evacuated to safe places from
the dumpsite.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-eight people were pulled out of the rubble alive after
the tragedy happened. The last survivor was found at 9:00 a.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 personnel from the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, the Philippine National Police and some non-
governmental organizations are still undertaking the retrieval
operations.
</P>
<P>
Retrieval operations were hampered by rain and aggravated by
the combined stench of garbage and decomposing bodies still
entombed in the place. The operations were also hampered by lack
of lime and insecticides.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were placed in cadaver bags and taken to the
basketball court built in the dumpsite. Vehicles from two funeral
parlors bring the bodies to their morgues.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC refrained from issuing an official estimate of missing
persons for lack of accurate source. The authorities, however,
earlier put the figure between 400 and 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the search and rescue operations may last for
weeks and the death toll may continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Mathay, mayor of Quezon City, said earlier that more
than 100 shanties were buried in the landslide in Payatas dumpsite
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was also the day of the failed transport strike and classes
in Quezon city were suspended, accounted by Mathay as the reason
why many of the casualties were children of school age.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted in its erosion and eventually
became a landslide, said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Takes Tight Measures for Work Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
introduced strict procedures for applications seeking work permits
in the country to curb the influx of illegal foreigners, Principal
Immigration Officer H. T. Ndiema has said.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper Kenya Times Wednesday quoted Ndiema as
saying his department has unearthed a syndicate that presented
false information to get work permits for foreigners without any
academic or technical qualification.
</P>
<P>
Ndiena has directed the members of the Federation of Kenya
Employers to first verify qualifications of employees before
making any moves to assist them acquire the permits.
</P>
<P>
He warned that any employer or employee found to have given
false information or documents would be prosecuted and deported in
accordance with the provisions of the law.
</P>
<P>
Ndiena noted that his government's policy encourages employers
to give priority to Kenya citizens when employment opportunities
arise, saying the hiring of foreign employees should be restricted
to areas where the skills are not available locally.
</P>
<P>
As the country's economic growth is declining, Kenya registers
an unemployment rate of 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Jet Deliveries Back On Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest aircraft maker, announced Tuesday it delivered 167
commercial jets in the second quarter, more than double its output
in the first quarter when it suffered through a 40-day engineers'
strike, according to a news release of the aircraft giant.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, it delivered just 75 jets, compared to
125 planned and 148 delivered in the same period of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's total delivery of 242 planes as of June 30 put it in a
position to meet its goal of 490 deliveries by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"As promised, by the end of the second quarter, we have
essentially recovered from the strike," Chief Executive Phil
Condit said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The 167 second-quarter deliveries included 102 of Boeing's best-
selling 737 narrowbodies, plus 18 narrowbody 757s, 13 widebody 767
s and 17 widebody 777s.
</P>
<P>
Boeing Tuesday rose 1 3/4 to 44 1/2 U.S. dollars a share on the
New York Stock Exchange, their best level since February 3.
</P>
<P>
The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace
(SPEEA), representing Boeing's engineers and technical workers,
rejected a Boeing contract on February 9, triggering a walkout by
18,000 workers. Boeing and the workers eventually reached an
agreement and the workers came back on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The rapid production recovery underscored the strength of
Boeing's assembly lines, even as it continues to cut jobs and
dispose of non-core businesses including some parts-making
operations, Wall Street analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Clearly the company did a good job getting its act together on
deliveries in the second quarter," said Joe Nadol, an analyst at
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. "But I'm sure it still has a way to
go before it completely recovers from the strike in more
qualitative ways, including employee morale."
</P>
<P>
Last year, European rival Airbus Industrie surpassed Boeing in
commercial aircraft orders with 476 to the American company's 391.
As of June 30 this year, Boeing had announced orders for 322
passenger jets, compared with 234 for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
Airbus delivered 145 jets in the first six months of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg Tops World Per-Capita GDP List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg topped the 1999 world'
s list for per-capita gross domestic product in terms of
purchasing power standards, a local journal reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The journal European Report quoted the statistical bureau of
the European Union (EU) as listing Luxembourg with 38,840 U.S.
dollars per person, up from 35,500 dollars a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States came second on the list with 32,710 dollars
per person while Switzerland was third with 27,190 dollars per
person.
</P>
<P>
Norway ranked fourth, compared with the developed countries and
the EU member states, with 26,560 dollars, followed by Canada (
with 25,200 dollars), Denmark (25,000 dollars), the Netherlands (
23,830 dollars), Ireland (23,630 dollars), Austria (23,580 dollars)
, Belgium (23,440 dollars), Australia (23,180 dollars), Japan (22,
870 dollars), Germany (22,710 dollars), Sweden (21,600 dollars),
Britain (21,570 dollars), Finland and Italy (both with 21,160
dollars) and France (20,860 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Spain, Portugal and Greece ended up at the lower end of the
list with 17,320, 15,940 and 14,200 dollars per person
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation European Union averaged a per-capita GDP in 1999
at 21,110 dollars while the 11-nation euro zone was 70 dollars
more at 21,180 per person.
</P>
<P>
The gross domestic product growth in volume terms in the EU
rose by 2.3 percent last year, slightly less than the 2.7-percent
growth posted in 1998. Yet 10 of the EU member states exceeded the
average growth of 2.3 percent. Ireland, for six years on end,
produced the highest GDP growth inside the union with 8.3 percent
compared with 8.9 percent in 1998.

MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. Suspend Talks on NTT Row Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Japan and the
United States again suspended talks over the interconnection fees
charged by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) shortly
after they resumed the negotiations Wednesday morning as the U.S.
side rejected a compromise proposal submitted by Japan.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. failed to narrow differences on the NTT
charges during their two-day working-level talks, which first
bogged down on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Although Tokyo expected its compromise proposal would lead to
the settlement of the long-standing bilateral dispute with
Washington, it was compelled to consider an additional proposal,
Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
It may take some time for the two sides to resume the talks as
Japanese negotiators are facing strong opposition from the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party against making a further compromise, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Washington on Tuesday rejected a concession by Tokyo to shorten
the period required to achieve a 22.5-percent reduction in the
phone hook-up charges NTT levies on other carriers from the
earlier proposed four years.
</P>
<P>
Japanese officials said that the U.S. side apparently did not
budge from its demand made in previous talks in late March that
the NTT reduce the interconnection rates by 22.5 percent in two
years and then swiftly reduce them further by a total of 41.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. resumed working-level talks Monday in a bid
to solve the biggest trade row before the Group of Eight (G-8)
summit, which will be held July 21-23 in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan.

Zvezda is a key element of the ISS. At the first stage of
building the station it will make it possible for the crew to
operate and control all the station's systems, notably those
responsible for altitude control, stabilization, orbit correction
and other functions needed for a manned mission and for the
continued construction of the station.
</P>
<P>
If everything goes as planned, the first long-term crew will

<HEADLINE> China's First Airport Built by Farmers Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's first airport built with
investments from farmers was recently put into operation in Pinggu
County of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Rongdong Airport, 80 kilometers northeast of downtown
Beijing, was built with a total investment of 3.5 million yuan (
some 420,000 US dollars) from 700 households in Heidouyu Village
of Pinggu.
</P>
<P>
According to local civil aviation administration officials, the
airport's runway, 500 meters long and 19 meters wide, is capable
of handling takeoffs and landings of Yun-5, a small-sized cargo
plane made in China for agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
The airport has been given permit to operate by the North China
Branch of the Civil Aviation Administration of China in early June,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
As agricultural production developed rapidly in recent years,
local farmers used to lease small planes for spraying pesticide
and air sowing. However, this cost them expensively.
</P>
<P>
So, they reached consensus in 1998 to build an airport of their
own to provide better services in agricultural production.

<HEADLINE> China-U.S. Joint Promotion of High-Tech SMEs Discussed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. government
officials, businessmen and personnel from venture capital
organizations gathered here today to probe partnering and
investing opportunities for promotion of high-tech small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
China is to establish soon a high-tech stock market for high-
tech SMEs, said Chinese Vice-Minister of Science and Technology Xu
Guanhua told a symposium jointly sponsored by the Ministry of
Science and Technology and the U.S. Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Xu said China and U.S. should increase exchange and cooperation
in the development of high-tech SMEs and the field of venture
capital.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, entitled "Partnering and Investing Opportunities:
Practical Tools to Promote High-Tech SMEs," is focused on the
environment for invention, conditions for the smooth growth of
high-tech SMEs and the establishment of a venture capital system.
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Shavers, U.S. Under Secretary of Commerce for Technology,
said at the symposium that high-tech SMEs have been playing a very
important role in promoting economic growth, creating new jobs,
and boosting export and sales.
</P>
<P>
She also expected more exchanges and cooperation between the
two countries in the development of high-tech SMEs.
</P>
<P>
China registered a total of more than 70,000 technology-based
SMEs at the end of 1998 with 3.3 million of employees.
</P>
<P>
China has established 53 high-tech development zones, over 30
university science parks and over 100 incubation centers for high-
tech SMEs.
</P>
<P>
To support the growth of high-tech SMEs, the Chinese government
established an invention fund last year, when funding was
allocated to back more than 1,000 projects undertaken by these
SMEs.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Expects Record Temperatures in Store </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish State Meteorology Office
has rung a warning bell against extraordinary record-breaking
temperatures throughout the country on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State responsible for the State Meteorology
Office, Ramazan Mirzaoglu, cautioned earlier this week that
temperatures will start rising again from July 12 and reach the
hottest levels across Turkey on July 13.
</P>
<P>
The highest temperatures on July 13 will be 40 Celsius in the
capital of Ankara; 41 Celsius in Antalya, on the southern coast of
the Mediterranean Sea; and 43 Celsius in Diyarbakir, in the
country's southeast.
</P>
<P>
He added the unusual high temperatures will start to go down on
July 14, giving way to rainy weather over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Health Minister, Osman Durmus,
Tuesday sent a circular note to governors of 81 provinces to
enforce an afternoon siesta, which is aimed at avoiding the edge of
the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
He asked government offices to shut down from 1100 a.m. to 0400
p.m. local time when the sun is at its most ferocious period.
</P>
<P>
Hot weather alarm has been sounded one after another since an

fighting center, a total of 9,094 hectares of land has been burned

<HEADLINE> Camp David Summit Unlikely to Make Miracle: UAE Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing U.S.-hosted peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israel at Camp David is unlikely
to make any breakthrough after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
announced his five "NOs" in the talks, commented newspapers in the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Camp David summit started yesterday (Tuesday) amid
pessimism from the Palestinians following Barak's five 'NOs' and
after the Israeli opposition threatened to topple him if he offers
what they see as concessions," the Abu Dhabi-based Al Ittihad
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"The summit," it added, "will not reach a positive outcome
unless it tackles the declaration of a Palestinian state with its
capital in Jerusalem, besides finding a suitable solution for the
problem of (Palestinian) refugees."
</P>
<P>
The paper urged all parties involved to avoid applying pressure
in order to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
At Camp David, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
mediations, are expected to seek agreements on issues such as the
status of Jerusalem, the Jewish settlements, the fate of
Palestinian refugees and borders.
</P>
<P>
Camp David is a secluded U.S. presidential retreat near
Washington where Egyptian and Israeli leaders clinched their
historic peace deal in the 1970s, the first one between the Jewish
state and an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based Arabic-language daily Al Bayan also cast doubts
on the chances of success for the summit.
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinians are left with no other choice but to stand
firm in the face of pressure they will meet from both American and
Israeli sides," stressed the paper.
</P>
<P>
Any concessions made by the Palestinians will be considered as
legitimate rights of the Israelis and they will ask more, it added.
The Sharjah-based Al Khaleej daily called on the Palestinians not
to budge an inch from their demands, reminding them that other Arab
countries fully reclaim their territories occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt (was) returned the whole Sinai following Camp David
(summit) in 1978, Jordan succeeded in demarcating its borders with
Israel following the Wadi Araba accord, Lebanon (was) returned its
territories in the south thanks to its heroic resistance and Syria
insists on returning the whole Golan heights," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Based on such facts, the Palestinians should stress in the
negotiations that Palestine should be returned to the Palestinians
at least on the basis of borders recognized before the 1967 Arab-
Israeli war, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
"Red lines respect those who draw them and prevent any one from
crossing them. Palestinians should make it clear that no further
concessions are to be made."

<HEADLINE> Iran Closes down Borders with Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran has closed down its 725-
kilometer borders with eastern neighbor Afghanistan as part of the
measures to combat threats to its security.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken on Tuesday during a visit by Interior
Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari to the eastern parts of the
country in northeastern province of Khorasan following a sharp rise
in criminal cases of robbery, kidnaps, murders and drug trafficking
in the border regions.
</P>
<P>
"With the eastern borders fully controlled, the residents will
enjoy full tranquility and security," Lari told the Islamic
Republic News Agency during his inspection tour.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that 100 kilometers of Iran's eastern borders
will be made impenetrable by barbed wire fencing and 200 kilometers
of security areas will be equipped with electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
He said that radar, ground fortifications and watchtowers have
also been installed in the area after the Majlis (parliament)
earmarked 200 billion rials (about 66.7 million U.S. dollars) in
credits to strengthen security in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the main transit route for drugs from the "Golden
Crescent" in Afghanistan to destinations in the Persian Gulf and
European countries.
</P>
<P>
Iran launched serious crackdowns on drug smuggling in 1989. Last
year, 740 drug traffickers and 174 Iranian police officers were
killed in narcotics-related confrontations, according to government
reports.

MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in the Philippine

<HEADLINE> Essential Medicines to Deplete in Major Hospitals in Zimbabwe: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Essential medicines in all major
Zimbabwean hospitals are expected to run out in the coming month
unless the government secures foreign currency to buy drugs, The
Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"In all the major hospitals, we are only left with a month's
supply of medicine, a situation that could become critical if we
do not get foreign currency within the next few weeks," Timothy
Stamps, Minister for Health and Child Welfare was quoted as saying
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Drugs that are in short supply include all vaccines, morphine
and quinine. Basics such as bandages, gloves and syringes are also
running short, making the operations of the hospitals very
difficult.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said while hospitals could purchase medicine from any
supplier, they were failing to do so because they had no foreign
currency either.
</P>
<P>
In the affected hospitals the situation is now desperate, with
patients in some cases being asked to pay for their own drugs, the
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Since last November, Zimbabwe's foreign currency reserves have
been severely depleted, resulting in the current fuel, power and
imported raw materials shortages, which have negatively impacted
on production.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Curbs Sugar Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government is
trying hard to stabilize sugar prices after the adjustment of fuel
price one week ago.
</P>
<P>
The measures taken by the government include distributing sugar
in rations through district authorities in Addis Ababa and through
the Whole Sale and Retail Trade Enterprise in the states.
</P>
<P>
Recent sugar hoarding by a few businessmen engaged in sugar
distribution has resulted in a drastic sugar price hike, said an
official with the state-owned Ethiopian Sugar Industry Support
Center Company on Monday.
</P>

The state sugar price has not changed with the lowest price
remaining at 400 birr (about 48.7 U.S. dollars) for 100 kilograms,
he said.
</P>
<P>
But, sugar is sold in the market of the capital city at six

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The famine situation in
Ethiopia remains tense despite donations from the international
communities, a senior U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn McAskie, visiting Emergency Relief Coordinator of the
UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, on Tuesday
called on donor nations to continue making contribution to drought-
affected Ethiopians.
</P>
<P>
The number of famine victims in Ethiopia has come up to some 10
million from 8 million, according to the UN official.
</P>
<P>
Except for the drought-affected people, the needy people also
include hundreds of thousands of displaced people who became
homeless since the start of Ethio-Eritrean border conflict in May
1998.
</P>
<P>
McAskie indicated that transportation work has become a key to
help famine victims in Ethiopia, saying 140 additional vehicles to
transport relief food will be made available.
</P>
<P>
About 800,000 tons of relief food have been pledged by donor
countries so far, said Manuel Aranda da Silva, UN Regional
Humanitarian Coordinator for the Drought in the Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> G-8 Foreign Ministers Kick off Meeting in Southwestern Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers from the Group of
Eight (G-8) began their two-day meeting in the southwestern
Japanese city of Miyazaki Wednesday afternoon in preparation for
the G-8 summit in Okinawa Prefecture later this month, the Kyodo
News reported.
</P>
<P>
The eight ministers are expected to issue a joint statement and
a comprehensive action plan for preventing conflicts early
Thursday afternoon to wrap up their discussions.
</P>
<P>
The statement will also focus on disarmament and nuclear
nonproliferation, U.N. reforms, fight against international
organized crime and terrorism, the environment and regional
security issues.
</P>
<P>
The two documents will serve as a blueprint for political and
security discussions at the Okinawa summit, slated for July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The statement will commit the G-8 ministers to following up on
the action plan to comprehensively deal with a "full spectrum" of
problems with regard to conflicts, Kyodo quoted a senior G-8
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan will cover states or areas vulnerable to conflict as
well as those in the midst of conflict and those dealing with its
aftermath.
</P>
<P>
It will include five key measures: tightening controls on
diamond trading to stem arms purchases in such war-torn African
countries as Sierra Leone, pressing countries to stop recruiting
children as soldiers, promoting measures to eradicate poverty,
helping nations establish and train civilian police, and
strengthening regulations on exports of small arms to strife-torn
areas.
</P>
<P>
The statement outlines calls for maximizing efforts to realize
U.N. reforms, including an overhaul of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It also contains commitments from Moscow and Washington to
quickly implement the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (
START II) and conclude START III. The foreign ministers will
promise to seek an early implementation of the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
On regional security issues, the statement underlines G-8
support for dialogue between the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and South Korea in the wake of the first-ever inter-
Korean summit, which was held last month in Pyongyang, the capital
of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are expected to spell out a special statement
supporting the Mideast peace summit when they hold a joint
conference Thursday after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is absent from the
meeting to focus on the U.S.-hosted Middle East peace summit which
opened Tuesday. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott is
attending the G-8 gathering in Albright's place.
</P>
<P>
The G-8 countries are Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, the United States and Russia.

Xi'an is one of the Chinese cities suffering from serious water
shortages. The city's daily water demand stands at 900,000 cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project has provided 1.02 billion cubic
meters of water for Xi'an since it became operational in 1987.

<HEADLINE> 27 Websites Licensed to Pilot E-advertising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven out of the
approximately 15,000 registered websites in China have been chosen
to pilot on-line advertising, an official with the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce (SAIC) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The lucky websites, including www.sohu.com, www.netease.net
and etang.com, are selected for being "well-established" and all
of them are registered in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Electronic advertising has become a "magnet" for advertisers
seeking market opportunities for its low cost, rapid distribution
and extensive dissemination, said Wang Jinjie, vice director of
SAIC's Advertisement Supervision and Management Department.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that none of China's current websites that
post advertisements online has obtained government approval, and
problems have occurred from time to time in Internet advertising.
</P>
<P>
To protect the rights and interests of consumers, and
standardize the e-advertising market, SAIC plans to put on-line
advertising under a licence system as advertising on other media,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"There should be market access conditions for Internet
advertising firms, and advertisement content should be regulated
accordingly," he added.
</P>
<P>
SAIC has granted Internet ad permits to websites hoping that
they could help explore an effective management and supervision
mechanism for domestic e-advertising.
</P>
<P>
"This doesn't mean that we have given them any privileges.
Instead, we require them to abide by the advertisement rules and
regulations and have their content examined when posting ad for
special commodities, " Wang stressed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Accelerate Land Redistribution Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The land redistribution and
resettlement program in Zimbabwe is set to resume on a full scale
this Friday, with 160 farms having been set aside for the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Nathan Shamuyarira, Secretary for Information and Publicity of
the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-
pf), said Tuesday nigh that at least 20 farms in each of the eight
provinces had been acquired for resettlement and some war veterans
and land-hungry villagers occupying farms will be moved to the
newly acquired farms in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The acquisition notices are being served on the occupants of
each of the designated farms that have not been contested by the
owners," he said.
</P>
<P>
In all, 804 farms have been designated and all the ex-
combatants and peasants who have occupied certain farms will be
required to move from those farms to the newly acquired farms,
where they will be given land and settled permanently, said
Shamuyarira.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has said that the land redistribution
program has been very slow and time had come for the national
problem to be solved once and for all.
</P>
<P>
War veterans have said they will not leave the farms they
occupied unless the government provides them with land. The
government envisages to transfer more than 5 million hectares of
land over the next five years to resettle some 150,000 families.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Launches Oil Exploration  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
contracted a British company to explore oil in three of the 19
zones curved for the search in the country, the East African
Standard newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia and three
representatives of the British Star Petroleum signed an agreement
on the exploration here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Star Petroleum is granted eight years to
carry out the studies and drill six wells in the zones covering an
area of 34,893 square kilometers in Lamu and Kwale districts in
southeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allows Star Petroleum to use its own capital to
carry out the survey and recover the money upon discovering the
oil products.
</P>
<P>
Peter Taylor, director of the British company, said Star
Petroleum would spend more than 300 million U.S. dollars on the
project for the first two years.
</P>
<P>
According to Masakhalia, more than 40 percent of Kenya's
foreign exchange earnings was being spent on importing petroleum
products.

<HEADLINE> EU Launches War on Rebels in Northern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union parliament has
passed a resolution calling on EU member states to ban the
operations of a rebel group based in southern Sudan fighting
against the Ugandan government.
</P>
<P>
The resolution called on individual EU member states to condemn
and ban operations of Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and travel of
its representatives within the EU and between the EU and non-EU
nations, the New Vision daily reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It condemned the LRA's continued abduction of children in
northern Uganda and the use of the children in armed combat,
saying it is a violation of UN conventions and the international
humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has been asked to stop supporting the LRA and to
cooperate in the immediate and unconditional release of all
abducted children as stipulated in the Nairobi Peace Accord signed
by leaders of Sudan and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
It said Sudan should consider the abduction of children as a
humanitarian issue and separate it from the larger political
issues in the region.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said Sudan should allow free access by
humanitarian organizations such as the United Nations Children's
Funds to the LRA camps to ascertain the identities of the abducted
children and ensure their safe return to home.
</P>
<P>
The parliament said 14,000 children, some as young as seven
years old, in northern Uganda, particularly in Gulu and Kitgum
districts, had been abducted to Sudan since 1986. It said about 5,
000 children had since returned or escaped and thousands remain
unaccounted for.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Airlines to Cut Fares in Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Most U.S. airlines said
Tuesday they will cut fares by about 25 percent into December to
ensure that the strong traffic levels seen in recent months will
continue into what is typically a slower fall travel season,
according to reports reaching here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Discount carrier Southwest Airlines cut round-trip fares to a
maximum of 218 U.S. dollars, with even lower fares for flights on
Tuesday, Wednesday and Saturday, intra-California travel or
flights between Florida and many of its locations. The Southwest
sale is for travel between August 14 and December 9, and tickets
must be purchased by July 27.
</P>
<P>
US Airways Group Inc., the nation's sixth-largest airline,
announced a fare cut of about 25 percent on travel during off-peak
hours through December 15 in the United States, Canada and the
Caribbean. Tickets would have to be purchased by July 21 and at
least 14 days prior to departure.
</P>
<P>
Other airlines, including the world's largest carrier the
United Airlines, No. 4 U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines Corp. and
No. 5 Continental Airlines Inc., said they would match the US
Airways fare sale.
</P>
<P>
Airlines typically have instituted fare sales in the fall, to
attract travelers during the slow season between Labor Day and the
end of year holidays.
</P>
<P>
But airline analysts said they are not terribly worried about
overall revenue drop because the deadline for ticket purchase
rules out many business passengers who pay the top dollar for
seats.
</P>
<P>
"It's not as if the entire airplane is for sale," said Jim
Higgins, analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette Securities. He
pointed out that airfares have risen steadily this year in the
face of rising fuel prices and strong demand for seats.
</P>
<P>
Higgins and other analysts said these kinds of seasonal sales
were bound to happen and were fully factored into revenue and
earnings forecasts.

Those who study at the Tibet classes in the hinterland
provinces of the country are asked to take part in examinations on
Tibetan language if they want to continue studies in senior middle
schools, colleges or universities.
</P>
<P>
Lhapa Cering, Debai's elder brother, who has just finished his

1.78 million books printed annually.
</P>
<P>
In teaching the Tibetan language, Qoizim stressed the necessity
of adding more natural science vocabulary to the language while
standardizing its use so as to meet the requirements of the
development in modern society.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM May Miss South Pacific Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark may avoid this year's South Pacific Forum meeting
rather than having to shake hands with Fijian coup leader George
Speight.
</P>
<P>
The latest reports indicate Speight may be appointed Fiji's
prime minister Thursday and it's likely he would attend the forum
meeting in Kiribati from October 28 to 31.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper quoted the New Zealand prime
minister as saying Wednesday that she is reserving all her options,
including not going to the meeting if it is likely Speight or one
of his cohorts would be there.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post also quoted her as saying that it is
extraordinary that Speight seems likely to be appointed Fiji's
prime minister by Fiji's Great Council of Chiefs Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"How can Fiji expect to have any credibility in the eyes of the
international community when a man who commits criminal and
terrorist acts ... ends up getting into a position of influence
like that," Clark said.
</P>
<P>
She said it would be too unpleasant to have to meet Speight at
the forum meeting. She also signaled New Zealand now needs to
completely rethink its foreign policy in the South Pacific as a
response to the Fiji coup, violence in the Solomon Islands,
political assassination in Samoa and other events.

<P>
The mothballing will result in a redundancy of 155 people.

LHASA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Eleven-year-old Tibetan girl Debai
loves to read "King Gesser" written in Tibetan in her spare time.
She says, "Gesser is a legendary hero in Tibetan history."
</P>
<P>
It is really not an easy thing for a primary school pupil to
read and understand this more than 10 million-word Tibetan folk
epic.
</P>
<P>
Debai says that she studies Tibetan language at school every
day and reads some Tibetan language books when she comes back home.
She is confident that she can basically grasp the Tibetan language
in several years as the language learning is the compulsory course
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan language is widely used in Tibet Autonomous Region,
southwest China. Like Debai, many Tibetan youngsters understand
quite well how important it is to grasp their own language.
</P>
<P>
Qoizim, deputy director of Tibet Autonomous Region's Education
Bureau said that local educational departments have always pushed
forward the development of Tibetan language teaching and learning
at schools.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans are required to learn the letters of the language at
kindergartens, its spelling at primary schools, and logic and

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus fell
in May by 18.2 percent from a year earlier to 840.2 billion yen (7.
8 billion U.S. dollars), down for the first time in four months,
the Japanese Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the surplus came as a surge in imports exceeded
a rise in exports of the country, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 8.1 percent to 3,703 billion yen (34.3
billion dollars) while imports expanded 20.5 percent to 2,979.6
billion yen (27.6 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the surplus in goods and services trade
slided 36 percent to 318 billion yen (2.9 billion dollars), adding
that the merchandise trade surplus also slowed 24.1 percent to 723.
4 billion yen (6.7 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> British Power Company Leases Canadian Nuclear Power Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Ontario Power Generation Tuesday
unveiled a deal of 625 million Canadian dollars (about 422 million
U.S. dollars) for Britain's largest power generator to lease
Canada's largest nuclear facility.
</P>
<P>
Under the 18-year deal, British Energy will operate Canada's
Bruce nuclear power station in southwestern Ontario through a new
entity called Bruce Power Partnership.
</P>
<P>
The deal is aimed to be the first step toward privatization of
Ontario's debt-laden energy sector by the Canadian side. Ontario
Power Generation has agreed to reduce its share of power
generating capacity in the province to no more than 35 percent
within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
To gain the legal status of operating Canada's Bruce nuclear
power station, British Energy has yet to apply for an operating
license from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and must
subject the deal to Canada's Nuclear Safety and Control Act.
</P>
<P>
"The safe operation of the Bruce nuclear generating station is
our top priority," Ontario Energy Minister Jim wilson has once
said.
</P>
<P>
Located 250 kilometers northwest of Toronto on the shore of
Lake Huron, the aging Bruce facility includes eight CANDU nuclear
reactors, of which only four are producing electricity by using
uranium fuel and heavy water.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 108 in Manila Landslide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of casualties in the
Payatas garbage dump landslide that occurred Monday morning in
Quezon City, Metro Manila has climbed up to 108, the National
Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said in a report that as of 8:00 a.m. Wednesday, 297
families or 847 persons have been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 600 personnel from the Armed Forces of the
Philippines, the Philippine National Police and some non-
governmental organizations are still undertaking the rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC refrained from issuing an official estimate of missing
persons for lack of accurate source. The authorities, however,
earlier put the figure between 400 and 3,000.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers said it may take three to four days for them to pick
through the collapsed area of the dump and the death toll may
continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
Ismael Mathay, mayor of Quezon City, said earlier that more
than 500 families were affected and 100 shanties were buried in
the landslide in Payatas dumpsite.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted in its erosion and eventually
became a landslide, said Mathay.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in October 1999, but the
closure was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for
Quezon City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Slides to 9-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht dipped to a nine-
month low Tuesday, breaking 40 baht to the U.S. dollar in the
afternoon trade before gaining ground to end 39.95 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the baht followed other regional currencies lower
against the dollar, with the Philippine peso and the Indonesian
rupiah both failing sharply.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda said Tuesday that the
baht was moving in line with market forces and other regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand, the central bank, has maintained that its
intervention into the currency market would be made only to smooth
out volatility.
</P>
<P>
Anusorn, an economist at Citibank Thailand, said the baht was
expected to continue to show weakness over the next three or four
months.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, trends would improve afterwards, with the
baht showing strength in early 2001 as U.S. interest rates were
expected to stabilize and local interest rates were expected to
climb starting in the second quarter next year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said one major factor affecting the baht's recent drop
is the recalculation of Thailand's foreign debt held by the
private sector to 18 billion dollars from previous 12 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The weakening baht is unlikely to have a significant impact on
Thai firms, given the lessons learned by local firms about the
importance of risk management, they said.
</P>
<P>
But they also cautioned that if the baht drops below 42 to the
dollar, the result will be higher inflation and an adverse impact
on the trade account and foreign debt holdings.
</P>
<P>
A trading range between 38 and 42 baht to the dollars is
suitable for the economy and will balance the needs of exporters
against those carrying foreign debts, according to the analysts.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in U.S. National Guard Helicopter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers aboard a U.S. Army
National Guard helicopter were killed as it crashed Monday night
near Gila Bend in Arizona State, the United States, said reports
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Captain Eileen Bienz of the Arizona Army
National Guard as saying that the AH-64 Apache helicopter crashed
on the Barry M. Goldwater Range at about 8 p.m. local time Monday
during night exercises.
</P>
<P>
There have been at least 50 other severe crashes of Apaches
reported since the first delivery of the helicopter to the Army in
1985, among which there have been 14 fatalities, including two
deaths in Albania during a NATO training mission.
</P>
<P>
The Apache, which costs 14.5 million U.S. dollars each, is a
twin- engine army attack helicopter developed by McDonnell Douglas
(now part of Boeing).
</P>
<P>
The Apache carries a mix of three weapons systems: aerial
rockets, a cannon that fires high-explosive ammunition, and
Hellfire missiles. It has been claimed to be the best attack
helicopter in the U.S. Army and is deployed both in the United
States and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Laos Formally Seeks Extradition of 28 Raiders from Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Laos has officially requested the
extradition of 28 armed rebels who were involved in last Monday's
raid on a Lao border checkpoint and are now detained in Thailand,
according to the Thai Foreign Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The request, which made in a letter sent from the Lao
government recently, asked Thailand to consider sending back "
those robbers who staged the terrorist act" at the border
checkpoint, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesman Don Pramudwinai said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the letter did not formally identify the
charges against the 28 persons.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government said these men will be prosecuted for
illegal entry and possession of illegal weapons according to Thai
laws, before any Lao request is considered, he said, adding it has
urged Laos to present evidence to back up its claims that the 28
were robbers.
</P>
<P>
The letter was conveyed through the Thai embassy in Laos and
received by the foreign ministry Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 28 men were among over 100 Lao rebels who attacked a Lao
checkpoint last Monday, across Thailand's Sirindhorn border
district in Ubon Rachathani province, 629 kilometers northwest of
Bangkok, and clashed with Lao troops, leading to several injuries
and deaths.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji: Chinese Government Implements Right Economic Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Tuesday that China's economy has overcome the difficulties
and unfavorable effects arising from the Asian financial crisis
since the government has carried out a right policy.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at Club De Gaulois in Brussels to more than
250 European business leaders, Zhu said that the Chinese
government has implemented an active fiscal policy, a steady
monetary policy and a policy to restructure its industry.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, China's economy has shown
a major favorable turn, which proved that the government's
economic policy is right, said Zhu, who is visiting Belgium and
the European Union headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that China is mapping out its 10th five-year plan,
Zhu said that China, in the next five years, will continue to
adjust its economic structure, revitalize the country through
developing science and technology, deepen the reform of the
economic system, and further open to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
As a result, it will be certain for the Chinese economy to
realize sustainable, speedy and healthy development, he told the
members of the Union of Industrial and Employers' Confederations
of Europe (UNICE), the representative of the European business
community.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that China's opening to the outside world will
enter a new phase after the country joins the World Trade
Organization (WTO). China will stick to its commitments to WTO
obligations while enjoying equal rights with the other 135 WTO
members.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, China will gradually open its domestic
markets, relax limitations on foreign investment in some regions,
improve its legal system, increase transparency in its regulations
and laws, government policies and management, improve environment
for foreign investment, protect intellectual property and the
rights of foreign businessmen under the law.
</P>
<P>
Noting the WTO entry would affect certain sectors and
enterprises in China, Zhu said that the Chinese people will have
the courage and wisdom to deal with various difficulties in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The government is making preparations for such difficulties,
including deepening reforms in state-owned enterprises, improving
their capability in technological innovation and management,
increasing their market competitiveness and ability against risks,
creating more jobs and promoting re-employment in various forms,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said, the government is speeding up the
establishment of a well-founded social security system to ensure
social stability and national security.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident that we can turn the pressure into a
motive force of social development, and turn challenges into
opportunities," he added.

<HEADLINE> Duncan to Stay in San Antonio Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Tim Duncan declined an offer
from Orlando Magic to stay with the San Antonio Spurs as he
believed his squad can challenge the Los Angles Lakers for next
year's NBA title.
</P>
<P>
Duncan, who spearheaded the Spurs to win the 1998-99 NBA title,
said on Tuesday that "We have a great opportunity with myself, and
David (Robinson) at the core of the whole thing and the fact that
we have won it before."
</P>
<P>
The Magic offered Duncan a six-year contract worth 67.5 million
U.S. dollars, the biggest under the NBA collective agreement.
However, he could sign a seven-year deal worth 86.5 million U.S.
dollars if he re-signs with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
Under the NBA rule, no free agents are allowed to sign any
contract until August 1, and Duncan said he felt relieved because
"the process is over and people will stop following me."
</P>
<P>
Duncan was the Most Valuable Player for the championship series
in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Duncan is the key to San Antonio's future.
Without him, the Spurs would be left with a brand-new 175 million
U.S. dollars arena for the 2002-2003 season without one of the
game's superstars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Taufik Haunted by Back Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia Open defending champion
Taufik Hidayat may lose his chance to retain his title as he is
suffering from a back injury.
</P>
<P>
Michael Triangel, the official doctor of the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI), said that Taufuk had an X ray but
the results "were not very good".
</P>
<P>
"I recommended him to have another X ray tomorrow (Wednesday)
and there should be a result in the afternoon. Taufik has been
complaining about the injury and I think it is the old one that
reoccurs from time to time," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Michael said Taufik's injury was most likely muscle strain.
</P>
<P>
"But we should wait first and look at tomorrow's X ray to
decided if it really is muscle strain or if the injury has got
something to do with his bones," he added.
</P>
<P>
Taufik visited orthopedic specialist Dr. Chaehab on Tuesday
morning as the doctor was unavailable the day before.
</P>
<P>
Michael said if Taufik injured his back, he would have to take
a month's rest and would not be able to compete in the Indonesia
Open.
</P>
<P>
Separately, PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata said he
hoped Taufik was not suffering from a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
"I saw his practice this morning (Tuesday) at the Indonesian
Badminton Center in Cipayung, East Jakarta, and I didn't see
anything wrong with the way he was playing. I hope his complaint
was not about anything serious. After practice, Taufik went to
visit Dr. Chaehab. Maybe we will need to have a second opinion on
his injury," he said.
</P>
<P>
Leo said if Taufik was injured, PBSI would not force him to
compete in the Indonesia Open as the organization prefers the 19-
year-old shuttler to concentrate on the Olympic Games in Sydney in
September.
</P>
<P>
"He's one of our backbone players in the Olympics and he has a
great chance to reach the finals. Let's hope he's fine," he said.
</P>
<P>
Taufik, who is a recipient of the Olympics Solidarity
scholarship, won the Indonesia Open title in Bali last year after
beating senior Budi Santoso in the all Indonesian final.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up experiment with
venture investment and get more high-tech businesses listed, a
high-ranking Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Along with economic globalization and China's accession into
the World Trade Organization, the country is facing both
opportunities and challenges to develop its high-tech industry, "
said Xu Guanhua, deputy minister of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
"Huge input is needed to develop the high-tech industry," said
the deputy minister while attending a forum on industry of high
and new technologies and capital market in China.
</P>
<P>
The forum, attended by more than 800 officials, experts and
entrepreneurs, was held in Wuhan, the capital city of central
China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
"However, government could not help much as far as investment
is concerned," Xu added. He hopes that enterprises and
corporations will rely mainly on market or themselves for fund-
raising.
</P>
<P>
At present, China has more than 90 registered venture
investment organizations, which have raised approximately eight
billion yuan so far.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, businesses involving software and net
technology, integrated circuit designing, bio-engineering and new
medicine, clean coal technology, automobiles, high-speed rails, e-
commerce and knowledge-based services will be the priority to get
listed at home and abroad, according to the deputy minister.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Locust Campaign Succeeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The severe plague of summer
locusts, which has affected six million hectares of land and
beaches in China, has now been brought under control, officials
with the Ministry of Agriculture announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that it is still too early to be too
optimistic, since combating autumn locusts could be an even
tougher task as many insects could have survived the summer's
eradication program, and foreign locusts may invade at any time,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have swarmed beaches and mostly uncultivated land
across half of China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions, including Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Tianjin and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Officials revealed that the density of locusts reached 5,000
per square meter in some badly hit regions. In Xinjiang, locusts
devoured 666,000 hectares of grassland and 433,000 hectares of
crops by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed this year's severe locust disaster to
chronic droughts, which left beaches almost uncovered and caused
the water level in reservoirs and lakes to drop. Moreover the
immigration of immense numbers of locusts from foreign countries
has exacerbated the insect infestation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The pest control campaign began in early May. Governments at
all levels have allocated more than 60 million yuan (about 7.23
million U.S. dollars) for pest-control chemicals and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various ecological control technologies have also
been adopted to combat the insects. For instance, in Xinjiang of
northwest China, over 700,000 trained chickens and ducks chow down
on locusts at the foot of Tianshan Mountain.

<HEADLINE> Culture Websites to Be Better Regulated: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to encourage
the development of cultural websites while drafting a set of
regulations to address problems raised by a survey .
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the Ministry of Culture Tuesday, found
that Chinese Internet users go on the Internet to search for
information, send e-mail and read new rather than appreciate works
of art and literature, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu Wenbo, an official in charge of the survey,
most cultural websites on civilization, books and art have very
simple structures and are updated infrequently.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 percent of the 768 investigated websites are updated
daily, and nearly half updated once a month, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
More than half of those surveyed said they are willing to pay
114 yuan (about 17 U.S. dollars) to browse cultural websites.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that poor content of the cultural websites is
another factor alienating them from the surfers.
</P>
<P>
Some websites simply stick governmental documents on line, some
others tend to only provide entertainment information on movie, TV,
music and pop literature for younger Internet users. In some
extreme cases, however, pornographic materials or materials
infringing upon others' copyrights are flooding in some websites
due to slack regulations on the website.
</P>
<P>
"We should take measures to regulate the industry and establish
more well-designed, influential websites to spread genuine Chinese
culture to the world", said Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng.

WELLINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Basketball New Zealand is to
ask its Australian counterpart to give up its home-court advantage
for the men's and women's Oceania world championship qualifying
tournaments next year, a Wellington-based newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>

The Dominion said General Manager David Crocker of BNZ wants
the qualifying event played in New Zealand.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crespo Moves To Lazio for 52 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An over 50 million U.S. Dollars
transfer deal to bring Argentinean striker Hernan Crespo from
Parma to Italy's defending soccer champions, SS Lazio, announced
by Lazio's chairman Sergio Cragnotti on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Crespo is being exchanged with two Lazio players, Mathias
Almeyda and Sergio Conceicao and 35 billion lire (about 16 million
U.S. dollars) in cash over three years, valuing Crespo at 110
billion lire, at current exchange rates over 52 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Crespo deal is expected to be the biggest of the transfer
season in Italy, even though AC Milan, smarting from its poor
performance last season, has been dropping broad hints about a
major purchase in the pipeline and Inter is trying to decide what
to do about the injury-hit Brazilian, Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of Crespo, there is also speculation that
Lazio's expensive Chilean striker, Marcelo Salas, may be headed
for another club, possibly Inter.
</P>
<P>
The deal is a new world record for soccer transfers. The
previous record was the 90 billion lire paid to Lazio by Inter for
Christian Vieri last year.
</P>
<P>
Crespo is expected to get 3.8 million U.S.dollars net under the
5-year contract.
</P>
<P>
Lazio said all the proposed movements are conditional on being
okayed by the players and clubs.
</P>
<P>
Lazio insiders said Conceicao, who shone in Portugal's national
team in the Euro2000 tournament, was put into the deal at the last
minute because Salas refused to go to Parma. "I'm
disappointed about how Lazio has behaved," he told a Roman radio
later. "I sincerely think I deserved more respect for what I have
given to this club."
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti was saying that he would never let the player go
until a few days ago. The first hint of later developments may
have come as Euro2000 closed with France's victory over Italy in
the final.
</P>
<P>
"I felt very bitter because, during the European championship,
everyone telephoned me with their congratulations for how I played,
especially after my three goals against  Germany, but there was
no call from Lazio," Conceicao told the interviewer.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 11 (Xinhua) -- African leaders Tuesday expressed
their wish that the tripartite talks currently being held in
Washington on the Palestinian-Israeli peace process would be a
success.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), who are meeting here at the 36th session of
the Assembly on July 10-12, said that they hope the talks will put
the Middle East peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the participation of Chairman Yasser Arafat and
Prime Minister Ehud Barak in these direct talks and hope that
their efforts will create the environment for success," the
leaders said in a statement released while they are in a closed-
door plenary session.
</P>
<P>
The leaders hope the talks will lead to a comprehensive
agreement between the Palestinians and the Israelis covering all
pending issues, in particular Jerusalem and the refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We therefore call upon the three leaders (Arafat, Barak and
Bill Clinton) to spare no effort in bringing the talks to a
successful conclusion and the establishment of a just and lasting
peace in the Middle East and the realization of the right to self-
determination by the Palestinians and the establishment of their
own state in Palestine," they said.
</P>
<P>
The African leaders, 33 of them, are considering the Draft
Constitutive Act of the African Union initiated during an
extraordinary summit on September 9, 1999 in Sirte, Libya and the
Draft Protocol to the Treaty Establishing the African Economic
Community relating to the Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
They also debated the Decisions and Recommendations of the 71st
and 72nd Ordinary sessions of the Council of Ministers and
Regulations of the 6th and 7th Ordinary sessions of the African
Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
Other items include the reviewing of reports on human rights,
malaria, the Africa-Europe Summit which was held in April in Egypt
among others.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the summit, they will adopt declarations and
resolutions and set the date and venue for their next summit, the
37th ordinary session of the assembly of heads of State and
government of OAU.

<HEADLINE> Relief Supplies to Arrive at Kenyan Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 29,000 tons of wheat, sorghum,
wheat and yellow maize are expected to arrive at the Indian
Oceanic port of Mombasa in southeastern Kenya this week, the Kenya
Ports Authority said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is part of international relief agencies' supplies to help
alleviate famine in the eastern Africa. More than 25,000 tons of
yellow maize arrived Tuesday in transit to Uganda.
</P>
<P>
According to the Kenya Ports Authority, the vessel "Hope Well",
which is expected at the port this week, will discharge 1,002 tons
of wheat, 2,505 tons of sorghum and 913 tons of yellow maize for
Somalia and 1,780 bags of yellow maize for Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, millers and commodity dealers in Kenya have imported
more than 28,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, the World Food Program launched an urgent appeal for
aid food for Kenya, saying the country needs 88 million U. S.
dollars to feed an estimated 3.3 million hungry people.
</P>
<P>
In mid-June, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced a duty
waiver on maize imports and encouraged local millers to import
more maize to combat the famine in the country.
</P>
<P>
More maize imports are expected following reports that the
Kenyan government's famine relief program stocks dwindled to less
than 60,000 bags of maize (90 kilograms per bag) at the beginning
of June.
</P>
<P>
President Moi warned in June that 23 million Kenyans, about 80
percent of the country's population, will face the threat of
famine if the prolonged drought persists.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Refugee Agency Urges to End War in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata Tuesday strongly appealed to
African leaders to ensure that conflicts in the continent come to
an end and people are protected to live a much more stable and
peaceful life.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Lome where she is attending
the 36th annual summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Ogata said Africa has always been a very large area of refugee
operation in her almost ten years as chief of the U.N. refugee
agency.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very worried about the increase of numbers of refugees
fleeing conflicts and serious violation of human rights," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata will complete her term of office at the end of this year
after spending 10 years as the head of the U.N. refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the OAU summit on Monday, the heads
of state and government paid tribute to her outstanding
contribution to the cause of African refugees.
</P>
<P>
"I hope my successor to pay a lot of attention to Africa," she
said.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua that her greatest achievement as high
commissioner is that "we were always open to trying out new ways
to solve problems and devising new methods of doing better in
protection of refugees."
</P>
<P>
"We kept on being very responsive and innovative," she added.
</P>
<P>
"But the failure is that I can not solve more problems than I
have had. The problem is really not just protection of refugees,
but has to do with political solution to the military conflict,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
She complained that "I cannot stop war, I cannot stop serious
violation of human rights, and very often I cannot separate armed
elements from refugees and civilians."
</P>
<P>
According to Ogata, the UNHCR is doing its best to help and
protect refugees fleeing conflicts in Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, Eritrea and Somalia as well
as displaced persons inside war-torn countries.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has distributed 300 million U.S. dollars in this
financial year for African refugees estimated at about 5 million,
she said.

<HEADLINE> France Proposes Common European Residency Card for Foreigners EDS-Rpt With Correction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France proposed Wednesday that the
15 European Union (EU) countries adopt a common residency card for
foreigners who legally live in EU countries for relatively long
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the European Parliament's Commission on
Public Freedom in Brussels, French Interior Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement said that a common residency card will be a progress
and "an essential judicial instrument" to integrate and protect
foreign residents in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
France, which issues a 10-year residency card to the foreign
residents employed by French companies or with professional
credits, proposes that EU countries issue a common residency card
of a duration from eight to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over the EU rotating presidency this month,
expects EU countries to obtain an agreement in two years instead
of during its presidency which ends on December 31, said
Chevenement.
</P>
<P>
He also said that France hopes that all EU countries will also
adopt a law guaranteeing "the right of soil" which automatically
offers nationality to the children born in their countries as
France and the United States have been doing.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Rejects Honduran Maritime Demarcation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Guatemalan government has
described as "damaging" to the sovereign interests and rights of
the country the unilateral demarcation of maritime limits made by
Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Gabriel Orellana said Wednesday
that the Honduran demarcation reduces his country's rights to the
exploitation of maritime regions, according to reports reaching
here from Guatemala City.
</P>
<P>
Honduras did not abide by the standards established by the Sea
Rights Convention for the delimitation of its maritime space in
the Caribbean Sea, said Orellana before the Congress Foreign
Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran Congress approved in March a decree on the
demarcation of the limits with Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
A Guatemalan Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Honduras
demarcation is similar to the disposition that caused a
territorial controversy between that country and Nicaragua.
Nicaragua says that the ratification of a treaty of maritime
limits between Honduras and Colombia deprives it of 130,000 square
kilometers of its sea platform in the Caribbean. Nicaragua set in
retaliation customs duties of 35 percent to goods imported from
those two countries.

<HEADLINE> British MPs' Anger Over British Support for Turkish Dam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A cross-party committee of
parliament members (MPs) in the House of Commons Wednesday
strongly criticized the Foreign Office for helping fund the
building of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The International Development Select Committee said in a report
that the government had failed to consider the plight of the
thousands of people, mainly Kurds, who will be displaced by the
flooding caused by the dam's construction on the Tigris river.
</P>
<P>
In a blow to Foreign Secretary Robin Cook's stated aim to
maintain an "ethical dimension" in all foreign policy, the report
said they were "astonished" that the government had failed to
consider the human rights implications of the dam.
</P>
<P>
The political repercussions for the region of displacing
thousands of Kurds and cutting the flow of water into Syria and
Iraq had also not been given proper consideration, the MPs said.
</P>
<P>
They strongly indicated that as far as they were concerned,
indicating willingness to back a project before getting such
guarantees was the wrong way round.
</P>
<P>
"There is good reason for the expectation that relevant
international criteria should be met before a proposal is agreed
and cover sought," they said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office said the criticism was "unfounded,
" and insisted the human rights impact had been the subject of
correspondence at both official and ministerial levels.
</P>
<P>
It insisted Britain would stand by its demands to the Turkish
government for reassurances.
</P>
<P>
"It is because the government takes human rights so seriously
that it will agree to provide export credit support for the
project only if tough conditions are met," a Foreign Office
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government says the dam is vital for the generation
power for urbanization and industrial and commercial development.
</P>
<P>
Work on the seven-year long project in the southeast of the
country is due to begin at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Protestants Parade after Night of Rioting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The climax to Northern Ireland's
marching season passed off peacefully Wednesday as thousands of
members of the Protestant Orange Order paraded to province-wide
rallies.
</P>
<P>
The parades, by more than 1,500 lodges, mark the most important
date in the Orange calendar -- the 1690 defeat of Catholic King
James by Protestant Prince William of Orange at the Battle of the
Boyne.
</P>
<P>
They followed another night of loyalist violence over the Order
's controversial Drumcree parade which has been banned from the
mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road in Portadown, County Armagh.
</P>
<P>
A man was shot dead in Larne, County Antrim. He was said to
have had links with the loyalist paramilitary Ulster Volunteer
Force and there are suggestions that the killing could be linked
to a dispute between rival loyalist groups.
</P>
<P>
In Portadown, 21 police officers and several soldiers were
injured during rioting Tuesday night, and in Belfast, masked
loyalist paramilitaries fired shots during the bonfires which
traditionally precede July 12 celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The security forces were attacked with petrol and blast bombs
and fireworks. Two explosive devices were found in County Antrim
and there were arson attacks on two churches and an Orange hall.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland appealed Tuesday for the
violence to be curbed.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's parades have seen Orangemen parading to 18
demonstration sites.
</P>
<P>
The most contentious march took place in Belfast, where
Ballynafeigh District Lodge was barred by the Parades Commission
from marching down the lower Ormeau Road, because of fears of
public disorder and damage to community relations.
</P>
<P>
Early Wednesday, the army and police sealed off the area with a
steel barrier to block the Orangemen's route down the contentious
part of the road.
</P>
<P>
Army sniffer dogs were used to carry out checks on Ormeau
bridge, which divides the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The lodge held a protest at the security forces' barrier on the
bridge, before joining the main Belfast demonstration at Ormeau
Park.

<HEADLINE> UK House of Commons Speaker to Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain's House of Commons Speaker
Betty Boothroyd is to retire at the end of the summer after eight
years in the role.
</P>
<P>
Miss Boothroyd, who celebrated her 70th birthday last year,
announced her decision in a short but emotional statement to the
House of Commons Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She also announced that she would step down as MP for West
Bromwich West. She had a 15,423 majority at the last election,
when she was not opposed by the Conservatives or Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Miss Boothroyd explained to MPs that she was standing down
after the summer recess this year to give her successor a "good
run-in" before the general election.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a great honor to serve the House as speaker for
more than eight years," she told MPs.
</P>
<P>
Miss Boothroyd was elected speaker in 1992 at the age of 62,
after serving for five years as a deputy. She was the first woman
to take the office.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the House Margaret Beckett responded to the
announcement by saying MPs had heard Miss Boothroyd's statement
with "deep regret," but told her the whole House "took pride and
pleasure in your speakership."
</P>
<P>
Ms Beckett explained that Ms Boothroyd would remain as speaker
during the summer recess, fulfilling outstanding engagements, but
would stand down on October 20 just before parliament resumed.
</P>
<P>
The first day of business will then be given over to electing a
successor.

<P>
LIMA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori
opened Wednesday in Lima the Third Amazonian Parliament
Extraordinary Assembly with the attendance of delegates from its
eight member countries.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said in his opening speech that the strengthening of
the Amazonian cooperation is necessary because it is "the most
indicated vehicle" for the defense and conservation of the
Amazonia.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guayana,
Peru, Surinam and Venezuela are attending the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian president said that respect for national
sovereignty must be established "very clearly" in the development
of cooperation for the exploitation of the Amazonian region.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to make compatible the national interest of
our countries with the interests of the developed countries in the
protection of this resource (the Amazonia), which all of us
consider of world transcendence," said Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori said that there are four topics that must be
considered about the Amazonia use: rational economic exploitation,
conservation of the biodiversity, development of the human
surroundings, and cooperation among the Amazonian countries.
</P>
<P>
The assembled delegates of the eight countries will discuss
issues related to actions directed to the progress and
preservation of the Amazonian natural resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's biggest opposition party,
the newly formed Canadian Alliance, stressed its election
readiness in the party's first caucus meeting held Wednesday at
Parliament Hill.
</P>
<P>
Stockwell Day, the party's new leader, stood with three other
former candidates for the Alliance leadership, calling for the
party to "focus for the election which is coming soon."
</P>
<P>
Former opposition leader Preston Manning, Ontarion Tory
strategist Tom Long and Alliance MP Keith Martin were all paying
tribute to Day on a grand show of unity at the gathering in a
reception hall.
</P>
<P>
"The greatest gift that you can give to your new leader is to
unite and pull together this summer," said Manning, who was the
former official opposition Reform Party in Parliament and was
credited for the founding of the 200,000-member Canadian Alliance
party.
</P>
<P>
"Let us enter into the election readiness like we've never
entered before, and then let the Liberal era come to an end, and
let the Alliance era begin," he told the party caucus.
</P>
<P>
Long and Martin also pledged their full support for the 49-year-
old former Alberta treasurer, who won the leadership of the
Canadian Alliance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest poll by Canada's National Post newspaper,
the Alliance has narrowed its gap with the ruling Liberals from a
previous 40 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The poll has found 44 percent in support for the Liberal Party
in a new federal election in contrast to 25 percent for the
Alliance under Day.

ATHENS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek veterinarians have found
cases of the foot and mouth disease in the country's northern
prefecture of Evros and more bovines are expected to be killed as
a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight herds of bovines in the Ainision Delta, near

Veterinarians believed that the foot and mouth disease was
transmitted from neighboring Turkey.
</P>
<P>
While great efforts were being made to restrict the disease to
the Delta region, intensive checks were being carried out with all
herds to detect any more outbreaks.
</P>

During 1994-1998, more than 150,000 animals were killed in

<HEADLINE> EU Speeds Up Opening Phone Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission Wednesday
announced that the European Union countries should open up their
phone markets by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The opening up is expected to be done through unbundling the
local loop, or the local phone networks monopolized by local
telecoms operators.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the European Union member states set in
March this year the end of 2001 as the deadline for dismantling
the local monopolies in order to spur competition, avoid
overlapping of backbone network buildup, lower tariff and speed
data transmission.
</P>
<P>
Erkki Liikanen, European Union information commissioner, said
Wednesday, "Local loop unbundling is the key to the break-through
of high-speed Internet in Europe and requires strong and urgent
measures."
</P>
<P>
"We need to provide a level playing field across Europe," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union decided in March during its Lisbon summit
that the 15-nation bloc should benefit more from the e-commerce so
as to create more jobs and boost economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Belgium have already said that they would not be
able to make the deadline. Only Germany and four other smaller EU
nations have opened up their local phone markets while France,
Spain, Italy and Sweden have planned to follow suit by the end of
this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congress Threatens to Withhold Aid to Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress Wednesday
threatened to withhold aid for Peru as it was displeased with
President Alberto Fujimori to enter his third term in office.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Paul Coverdell, the sponsor of the penalty,
said that he raised Congress' attention to the case because the
election of Fujimori "really rattles the premise of democracy" in
the Western hemisphere, meaning not in the interest of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori was re-elected on May 28, but the United States said
there was fraud and unfairness in the election with the withdrawal
of Fujimori's rival from the poll, and asked Fujimori to fix flaws
in the election system.
</P>
<P>
Coverdell's proposal would give President Bill Clinton 90 days
to certify whether Peru has made significant "progress toward
restoring democracy." If not, sanctions would be applied and 10
million dollar aid would be at stake. And the United States would
also be required to oppose aid to Peru in votes of international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian Embassy in Washington issued a statement
criticizing the proposal, calling it a "rash" action conducted
unilaterally by the United States.

<HEADLINE> French, German, Finnish FMs to Go to Manila on Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine will to go Manila on Thursday with German and Finnish
foreign ministers to seek a solution to the hostage crisis in
which 40 people, including five French nationals, are held by
Muslim rebels in the southern island of Jolo, said the French
Foreign Ministry Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
``The Minister Hubert Vedrine has announced that he will go to
Manila with his German and Finnish counterparts. The three
ministers will make a point of the situation of the hostages
directly with the Philippine authorities on the site,'' said the
foreign ministry in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The three ministers will urge the Philippine authorities to
intensify negotiations with the hostage-takers in order to obtain
the release of all hostages safe and sound as soon as possible, it
said.
</P>
<P>
They will also ask the Philippine authorities to keep open the``
humanitarian corridor'' allowing the transport of food and
medicines to the hostages, it added.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement made earlier Wednesday with German Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer in Miyazaki, Japan, where they was
attending a meeting of Group of Seven most industrialized
countries, Vedrine said that he will urge the Philippine
authorities not to do anything which could endanger the life of
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, Fischer and Finnish Foreign Minister Erkki Tuomioja
will meet with Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Foreign
Minister Domingo Siazon and will give a press conference before
leaving Manila.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry said on Monday that three
journalists of a four-member crew of the television channel France
2 were believed to have been kidnapped when they were reporting
news from Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Some local residents of Jolo said they saw two French
journalists riding in a jeep in the company of four gunmen
believed to be members of the Abu Sayyaf Muslim rebel group.
</P>
<P>
The other 37 other hostages, including two other French
nationals,were taken hostage 12 weeks ago and have been living in
captivity since then.

<HEADLINE> EU Should Lift Sanctions: Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Austria Wednesday stressed that
it would not block the function of the European Union but its EU
partners should lift the sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel told a joint
press conference together with European Commission President
Romano Prodi that his country wanted to have dialogue with its EU
partners and the institutions of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We stressed the fact that we want to have dialogue with our 14
partners and the institutions of the European Union because you
cannot make distinctions between bilateral relations and
multilateral relations," said the chancellor.
</P>
<P>
"We will never give up on our rights and are not going to
deliberately block or slow down the important process of the union.
We are very interested in ensuring that the enlargement process
goes ahead properly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 14 other European Union member states imposed political
sanctions against Austria after the country incorporated the far-
right Freedom Party into the governing coalition on February 4.
</P>
<P>
Austria asked the European Union and its EU partners to
consider lifting the sanctions at the EU summit held at Feira of
Portugal last month but was refused consideration.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, then holding the presidency of the 15-nation bloc,
worked out a plan to deal with the uncomfortable situation between
Austria and its EU partners. A panel of three wise men was
appointed by the European Court on Human Rights to monitor the
human rights status quo in Austria and then to report to the EU
nation holding the rotating presidency, that is now France.
</P>
<P>
The other EU member states will then decide whether to lift the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Austria, however, wants the sanctions lifted by October 13 and
14 when EU leaders meet for a summit in the French tourism resort
of Biarritz.
</P>
<P>
Schussel welcomed the appointment as the wise men -- former
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, former Spanish Foreign
Minister Marcelino Oreja and German law professor Jochen Frowein
who was former vice-president of the European Commission of Human
Rights.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian chancellor said that he was confident that the
three-man panel would give his nation a clean sheet of record on
human rights.
</P>
<P>
France, which took over from Portugal the six-month rotating EU
presidency on July 1, said that it would consider dropping the
political sanctions against Austria if the wise men find Austria
does not violate civil rights and abide by common European values.
</P>
<P>
The French have been one of the hard-line opponents in Austria'
s incorporation of extreme rightists into the country's government.

<HEADLINE> Unlicensed Drivers Involved in 20 Percent of Fatal Crashes in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 8,400 people die on average each year in crashes with
unlicensed drivers, said the report, "Unlicensed to Kill,"
sponsored by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
The report also found that 28 percent of the lawbreaking
drivers had received three or more license suspensions or
revocations in the three years prior to their fatal collision.
</P>
<P>
The researchers did not know the total number of unlicensed
drivers on U.S. roads today, but said they believe those drivers
are involved in an inordinate number of fatal crashes.
</P>
<P>
They studied five years of data from the Department of
Transportation's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, 1993 through
1997. They studied 278,078 drivers involved in 183,749 fatal
crashes.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
reduced its debt to the United Nations by some 135 million U.S.
dollars, but still owes more than 1.5 million dollars, a U.N.
spokeswoman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 135-million-dollar payment went to reduce arrears to a
number of U.N. peacekeeping operations, 30 percent of whose costs
are assessed against the United States according to the
universally accepted principle of "the capacity to pay."
</P>
<P>
But Washington still owes some 1.16 million dollars for
peacekeeping and about 460 million in arrears to the regular
budget, for which the U.S. assessment is 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United States is often under fire at the United Nations
for its reluctance to pay its back dues full, on time and without
conditions. However, Washington is seeking a review by the General
Assembly of the scale of assessment.

<HEADLINE> Internet Helps Americans Plan Wedding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of the engaged-to-
be-married couples in the United States with Web access are using
the Internet to help plan their wedding, according to a study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by U.S. marketing information company NPD
Group, found that 48 percent of engaged American couples gathered
information using the Internet and used it to help their wedding.
</P>
<P>
Of these soon-to-be-married couples using the Internet for
wedding planning purposes, 34 percent are engaged females, while
the remaining 14 percent are engaged males. However, the gender
split for the 52 percent who are not using the Internet for
wedding research is more evenly distributed with 28 percent of the
engaged females and 24 percent of the engaged males indicating
that they have not yet logged on to get wedding information.
</P>
<P>
NPD's study is based on data from more than 66,000 surveys
completed in April 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The report confirms the Internet's increasing role in helping
engaged couples plan their wedding," NPD said. "With today's busy
lifestyles, the Web has become a convenient way to get the
information they need to make their wedding a success."
</P>
<P>
Popular Web sites on wedding planning offer information from
wedding gowns, rings, gifts and photos to marriage license,
budgeting, honeymoons and event scheduling.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Washington said Wednesday that
it was ready to discuss a possible resumption of peace talks
between Israel and Syria after Bashar Assad is inaugurated as
president this week.
</P>
<P>
"We look forward to discussing the status of the peace process
once he has been inaugurated as president," U.S. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's meeting
with Bashar at his father Hafez Assad's funeral in Damascus last
month, Boucher said "she was impressed with his commitment to the
peace process and she observed that he seems poised and ready to
assume his duties."
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Bashar won an overwhelming 97.29 percent of the
vote in a presidential election held Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hafez Assad died of a heart attack on June 10 after he ruled
Syria for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace process broke down in January over
differences on the return of the Golan Heights seized by Israel in
the war in 1967.

<P>
The fishing industry collected 483.2 million U.S. dollars in
the first five months of this year, while the returns from salmon
and trout exports amounted to 397.2 million dollars. This increase
can be attributed to the fact that the volumes exported have risen
in the first six months of the year by 23.2 percent, to a total of
95,539 tons.
</P>
<P>
Japan occupies the biggest amount of the Chilean exports. Sixty-
two percent of the total revenue of the industry came from that
country, meaning 299.4 million dollars.
