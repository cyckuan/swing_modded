<HEADLINE> French Officer Suspected of Kosovo Leakage Brought Before Judge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mechain was brought to Judge Jean-Francois Ricard who is in
charge of anti-terrorist files of a Paris investigation court,
Agence France-Presse quoted judicial sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested last Friday by the anti-espionage police, the
Direction of Territorial Surveillance (DST), at the order of the
Paris public prosecutor's office and with the approval of Defense
Minister Alain Richard.
</P>
<P>
Mechain was recalled home this month from the headquarters of
the French troops serving in the NATO-led multinational force in
Kosovo,the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
A fist fight took place between Mechain and members of the
secret service of the Defense Ministry last Tuesday when he was
followed on the streets in Paris by the secret service.
</P>
<P>
Some French press reports quoted in February a confidential
military fax report as saying that senior French military officers
in KFOR were angry with the United Nations Civil Administrator
Bernard Kouchner for his pro-Albanian and anti-Serb stand.
</P>
<P>
The French judicial authorities have opened an inquiry against``
X'' for ``disclose of a secret concerning the national defense.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unblocks $111 Million Worth of Iraq Contracts, Holds up $1.67 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Washington, as promised,
has lifted objections to 111 million U.S. dollars worth of
contracts for Iraq, but is still holding up 1.67 billion U.S.
dollars worth of supplies for the Middle East country, a U.N.
spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference here
that among those released were 26 contracts worth 15 million U.S.
dollars for oil spare parts and equipment. Most of the remainder
were for supplies in the humanitarian sector, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
James Cunningham, the deputy U.S. permanent representative to
the United Nations, announced Friday that the United States would
unblock more than 100 million U.S. dollars worth of contracts as
part of its overall review of supplies reaching Iraq under the U.N.
"Oil-for-Food" agreement with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
However, Eckhard said that the United States had frozen
another seven contracts Friday worth 7.6 million U.S. dollars for
a total of 1.67 billion U.S. dollars in blocked contracts.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time the United Nations had released
precise figures on contracts Washington has frozen.
</P>
<P>
At a Friday U.N. Security Council debate on Iraq, both friends
and foes of the United States criticized the large number of
contracts Washington had frozen, calling them "unacceptable" and "
intolerable" and a danger to the humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been barred from selling oil on the open market since
the United Nations imposed sanctions on the country after its
troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. Most of its oil revenues are
placed in a U.N. escrow account, which pays supplies of goods
Baghdad has ordered.

<HEADLINE> Burundi to Reach Cease-Fire: Nujoma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Burundi President and other
leaders of political parties in the country will reach a
cease-fire in a week's time, said Namibian President Sam Nujoma
here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"In a week's time there will be an agreement on the cease-fire
and will start the political democratic process which will lead to
election and finally to a democratic government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Consultations with the parties to the conflict are continuing
with former South African President Nelson Mandela as the
facilitator, Nujoma told reporters during a brief stop-over at the
Harare International Airport from Tanzania where he participated
in the peace talks on the Burundi civil war.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma held an hour meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe during his stop-over, briefing him on the outcome of the
peace talks on the Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The general impression of the talks are good, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Fuel Prices Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A survey has shown that the prices of super petrol and diesel
were raised by 20 Tanzanian shillings (one U.S. dollar equals 802
Tanzanian shillings at present) up to 565 and 518 shillings per
liter respectively.
</P>
<P>
This increase, the ninth over the past few months, followed a
hiking last Friday which registered an increase by 20 shillings
per liter for petrol and 3 shillings for diesel countrywide.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals blamed the
frequent price increases of petroleum products on the unstable
prices of the commodities at the world market, a factor which
local marketing companies have no way to control.
</P>
<P>
"The prices of fuel at the world market could change within a
time frame of three days," said Commissioner for Energy and
Petroleum Affairs Bashir Mrindoko.
</P>
<P>
The prices went up following the recent arrival of 15,000 tons
of super petrol and 20,000 tons of diesel supplied by Total
International, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian transporters have complained bitterly over the
frequent fuel prices increases, urging the government to check
against the trend.
</P>
<P>
If not checked, the trend would cause untold sufferings to the
end-users as it would paralyze the sector, an engine for national
economic growth, they warned.
</P>
<P>
Secretary in the Ministry of Finance Peter Ngumbullu said over
the weekend that the treasury is contemplating to review petroleum
products price structure to ensure that fuel is sold to consumers
at realistic and affordable prices.

<HEADLINE> Police Probe Ordered against Shas Spiritual Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein Monday ordered a police investigation into a
powerful religious party spiritual leader for his remarks against
Education Minister Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein's decision to open a criminal probe against Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, spiritual mentor of the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas
party, was in accordance with the principle of equality that no one
is above the law, a statement issued by his office announced.
</P>
<P>
Yosef could be charged with three major offences, including
incitement to violence that may lead to death or injury of other
people, insulting public official and defamation, some legal
sources predicted.
</P>
<P>
The rabbi will be questioned at his home in the next few days,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The legal procedure was raised following a weekly end-of-Shabbat
sermon broadcast on local radio and television on March 18, in
which Yosef draw an analogy between Sarid and Satan and two other
condemned figures in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
Sarid has been at odds with Shas over its demands for more cash
for religious schools. As leader of the secular Meretz party, Sarid
has insisted Shas schools meet educational and administrative
standards of other schools.
</P>
<P>
Yosef said that like Haman, a Persian minister who according to
the Bible was hanged after an abortive plot to kill all Israelis,
Sarid's name should be wiped out of the world forever because of
his constant attacks on the Orthodox way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rabbi later clarified his stands by saying in a
statement that he had no intention of physical violence toward
Sarid, the position failed to satisfy Sarid and his angry left-wing
Meretz party members, who demanded a full and clear apology from
Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein sent a test balloon on Saturday by saying that he had
made up his mind about the case but he would keep the decision
unknown until Monday, hoping Yosef would make further apology for
his remarks during the period. 
</P>
<P>
His wish, however, was damped by Yosef, who went further
Saturday night to accuse Sarid of "sowing seeds of racist hatred"
during his traditional Torah lecture to his followers in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Not mentioning the name of Haman, the stubborn Shas spiritual
leader this time compared Sarid to an Egyptian Pharaoh who
persecuted the Jews according to the Bible, an analogy in keeping
with next month's Passover, which marks the Hebrews' liberation
from slavery in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Far from apologizing, Yosef noted he would not take back what he
said previously. His impenitent stance left Rubinstein no other
choice but to let the prosecution go ahead after consulting with
State Attorney Edna Arbel.
</P>
<P>
Shas members reacted strongly to Rubinstein's order, saying that
the attorney general made the Ashkenazi-Sephardi relations from bad
to worse.
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazi, Jews whose ancestors lived in Central or Eastern
Europe, are for a long time at odds with Sephardi, Jews whose
ancestors lived in the Arab countries of North Africa and the
Middle East. Yosef is a former Sephardi chief Rabbi.
</P>
<P>
Shas had accused that the current Israeli establishment treats
in favor of Ashkenazic Jews and prevents Sephardic Jews from
closing the economic and political gaps between the two Jewish
groups.
</P>
<P>
"The things he (Rubinstein) said are racist. His decision is
racist because we are Sephardic and ultra-Orthodox...They are
making us feel like second, third, fourth class citizens," Shas
leader and Health Minister Shlomo Benizri was quoted by Israel
Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some fervent Shas followers even painted slogans against
Rubinstein on the walls of the Justice Ministry Sunday night. To
guard against possible violence against the prosecutor, the police
decided to increase patrols around Rubinstein's home.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sarid, the victim of Yosef's outburst, called
Rubinstein's decision "a right one". He added some Shas supporters
had tried to intimidate the legal system by threatening a civil war
in case of Yosef's investigation, but the legal system did not
capitulate.
</P>
<P>
Knesset (Parliament) speaker Avraham Burg also praised
Rubinstein's braveness, saying he had no other choices but to order
an investigation. Some Knesset members from the opposition Likud
party joined in welcoming the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here pointed out that the probe could
constitute a catalyst whose effect is unpredictable, in which Prime
Minister Ehud Barak would have to face a possible Shas pullout from
the government.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yishai, Shas No.2 figure
under Yosef, had announced that the Shas faction would meet late
Monday to decide the party's future in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, Shas had threatened that if Rubinstein
finally ordered an investigation, it would quit the coalition and
join the anti-Barak forces, which would make Barak's already ailing
coalition more crumbled.
</P>
<P>
Without Shas' 17 votes in the 120-member coalition, the Barak
government would surely lose the simple majority of 69 it now
enjoys in the Knesset and would have to begin the risky business of
political horse-trading to attract new parties into his government.
</P>
<P>
So long as peace deals with Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinians
were mooted, Barak needed Shas more than ever. He had made
desperate attempts in recent days to mollify Shas ahead of the
furor that the attorney general's decision might unleash.
</P>
<P>
The first test whether Barak's efforts were effective would be
Monday's Knesset voting regarding five non-confidence motions
against Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
Shas earlier promised not to vote against the government,
however, it is now unclear whether the party would change its
stands to revenge Rubinstein's decision.

<HEADLINE> Door of Peace Not Closed: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The door of peace has not been
closed despite no breakthrough in the Sunday summit between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
Geneva, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to parliamentary members of the One Israel faction in
the Knesset (parliament), Barak said the outcome of the summit
between Clinton and Assad was expected, but his government is still
ready to restart peace talks with Syria if the Syrian side wants to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to give more detail on how Israel could like to
offer to the Syrian side for restarting the peace talks, which has
been stalled since January after two rounds in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Barak is meeting this hour at the Knesset with U.S. special
Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, who arrived here earlier in
the day to brief Barak on the Geneva summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Assad met for more than three hours in Geneva on
Sunday, but failed to narrow the gaps between Israel and Syria so
as to get their talks restarted.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the summit, Foreign Minister David Levy said
Monday that the failure of the summit showed that Syria has not
change its conditions for reviving peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The Geneva U.S.-Syrian summit shows that there has been no
change in Syrian President Hafez al-Assad's outlook and he still
expected Israel to meet all Syrian demands for moving the peace
talks forward," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Israel make prior commitment to return the
entire Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle East War,
whereas Israel demands the two sides to settle security arrangement
and normalization of ties first.
</P>
<P>
An official in Barak's office also said Monday that the prime
minister was not disappointed by the outcome of the summit, because
expectations of the meeting had been realistic.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans will continue looking into various options for
moving the Israeli-Syrian track forward," the official said, adding
that "the door to peace has not been closed."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the failed Geneva summit, Chief of General Staff
of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Lt-Gen. Shaul Mofaz said Monday
that the IDF will continue its preparations to withdraw from south
Lebanon, on the assumption that an agreement can still be reached
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon
by July this year, with or without an agreement with Syria. The
Israel cabinet has already approved the decision.
</P>
<P>
Barak called his key cabinet ministers to an urgent meeting
Sunday night to discuss the consequences of the failed Geneva
summit, but nothing has been announced.

<HEADLINE> Stance of Outgoing U.N. Aid Official Appreciated: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq appreciated the "objective
stance" of Hans von Sponeck, the outgoing U.N. humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq, said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the Iraq-based U.N. relief official, Aziz said Iraq
also appreciated the "positive efforts" made by von Sponeck in
trying to alleviate the sufferings of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz and von Sponeck exchanged views about
the humanitarian situation in Iraq, reported the official Iraqi
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, along with Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, met von Sponeck to praise his
critical stance on the sweeping U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi people are reeling under the crippling sanctions imposed
after Saddam ordered troops into neighboring Kuwait in 1990. Von
Sponeck said the U.N. oil-for-food program failed to meet the
minimum needs of the 22 million Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. program, an exception of the decade-long sanctions,
allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck's criticism of the sanctions as resulting in a
humanitarian tragedy angered the U.S. and Britain, who often tried
to stall U.N. approval of Iraqi contracts and preferred to keep
embargo against Iraq in place.
</P>
<P>
As the top U.N. relief official for Iraq, von Sponeck submitted
his resignation to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last
month. He is going to leave his post at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck said that he resigned as the U.N. humanitarian
program he heads has proven to be a failure, and he has lost hope
of an improvement in Iraq's humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
The veteran German diplomat, appointed to the post of U.N.
humanitarian coordinator for Iraq in October 1998, urged the U.N.
Security Council to treat Iraq's humanitarian needs separately from
the council's aim to monitor Baghdad's disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Israel Deploys Arrow-2 Missiles Along Israel- Lebanon Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel has deployed several
batteries of Arrow-2 anti-missile missiles along the Israeli-
Lebanese borders, the Lebanon News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced to be the first country in the world to have
the capacity to defend itself against ballistic missile attacks
with its newly developed Arrow-2 missile defense system in
operation on March 12.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 system, a U.S.-Israel joint venture including
missiles, launchers, radar and the control and command system, cost
1.3 billion U.S. dollars to develop.
</P>
<P>
The system is capable of dealing with Scud and Scud-derived
ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq. Its
early warning and fire-control system is designed to pick up and
track incoming missiles from a distance of 500 kilometers, while
its control and command system can guide the launches of the
interceptors and is capable of dealing with up to 14 intercepts at
a time.
</P>
<P>
The report of the missile deployment came when Israeli warplanes
bombed south Lebanon on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli fighter jets fired six air-to-ground missiles on the
outskirts of the Qabrikha village in the Iglem Tufaah region, south
of the port city of Tyre, without inflicting casualties, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Israeli jets fired four missiles in two
raids on the deserted region of Sujud at the edge of the central
sector of the Israeli-occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
There were no reports of casualties from the bombardment so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
spearheading a guerrilla war in the zone to oust the Israeli troops
and their ally South Lebanon Army from south Lebanon, the last
active Arab-Israeli battlefront.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Faces Two New Challenges in Peace-keeping Operations, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Monday said that the United Nations is facing two major
challenges in peace-keeping operations at the end of the Cold War -
- the changing nature of conflict and the decline of leverage of
major powers in bringing peace to conflict-revaged regions.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his speech at the ministerial meeting on the U.N.
Stand-by Arrangements for Peace-keeping Operations (SHIRBRIG),
Annan said he asked a U.N. panel "to take a broad look at the
entire spectrum of challenges, and I hope that it will serve as
the basis for discussion among Heads of State at the Millennium
Summit," to be held at the U.N. Headquarters in New York in
September.
</P>
<P>
The first challenge is that "the nature of conflict has
changed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are rarely faced with inter-state violence any more," he
said. "But, in truth, we are rarely dealing with purely internal
conflicts either."
</P>
<P>
"Rather, conflicts today are often a complex mix of the two:
their root may be essentially internal, but they are complicated
by cross-border involvement, either by state or non-state actors,"
he said. "And their consequences can quickly become international,
because of destabilizing refugee flows as well as the dangers
posed by factions pursuing each other across borders."
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 90 percent of conflicts in the world are
internal ones, and more than 90 percent of victims in the conflict
are innocent civilians, including women and children.
</P>
<P>
The second challenge is "the decline in the kinds of leverage
that peace-keepers could draw upon, not only to push parties to
abide by their commitments, but also to insist on respect for
themselves and their mandate," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Until the end of the Cold War, peace-keeping operations
rarely exercised leverage directly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Whenever negotiations and persuasions failed, the next step
was to report violations to New York, he said. "At that point,
after a quiet call from the Secretariat, the great powers could (
usually) be counted upon to exercise influence on their respective
client states in order to prevent themselves from being dragged
into the conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Their sources of leverage were usually economic and military
assistance programs, but with the end of the Cold War, these
programs dried up -- and the leverage in large part dried up with
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In response to these two big challenges, peace-keeping has
had to transform itself in important ways," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In response to the first -- the fact that conflicts had a
major internal dimension -- a new strategy of peace-keeping was
required," he said. "The strategy has to be tailored to each
individual case, but in very broad terms, our aim in every case
has been to channel conflict from the military to the political
arena."
</P>
<P>
"In other words, to ensure that differences are settled
peacefully and democratically," he said.
</P>
<P>
Insisting the limits to this strategy, Annan said, "Much of
our task, therefore, is to assist the parties in strengthening
existing institutions, or even in creating new ones. This is the
rationale behind multidimensional operations."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing-Home Sales Rebound in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes rose 6.
7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.75 million
units in February after having fallen a sharper than previously
reported 13.4 percent in January, the National Association of
Realtors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebound in existing-home sales comes despite the country's
mortgage rates kept rising. The average rate on the 30-year fixed-
rate mortgage rose to 8.33 percent in February from 8.21 percent
the month before. In February 1999 the average rate was 6.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
Americans have been feeling better off and in a buying mood
because of plentiful jobs, rising incomes, tame inflation and
stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that sales improved in the face of continuing
increases in mortgage interest rates demonstrates the very high
demand for housing in the United States," said Dennis Cronk,
president of the association.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect home sales to slow this year but still remain
at healthy levels. Compared with the same month a year ago,
February's sales are running 7.6 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
In February, the South posted the biggest gain, seeing existing-
home sales rise 10.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.97 million units.
</P>
<P>
Existing-home sales rose 8.7 percent in the West to a rate of 1.
12 million units in February, while sales in the Midwest rose 5.7
percent to a rate of 1.12 million units. Sales in the Northeast,
however, fell 6.9 percent to a rate of 540,000 units.
</P>
<P>
The median existing-home sales price, meaning half sold for
more and half for less, was 131,100 U.S. dollars, up 2.3 percent
from the median price for the same month a year ago.

<HEADLINE> 34 Greek Parties to Participate in April 9 Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four political parties in
Greece have decided to take part in the country's April 9
parliamentary elections, the 10th since the restoration of
democracy in Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Despite the five major parties represented in the Greek
Parliament, the Hellenic European Party, the Alternative
Ecologists , the Greek Laborers Party and some others will also
participate in the upcoming elections, the Macedonian Press Agency
(MPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
On March 14, Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos dissolved
the parliament, signaling the official start of the legislature
elections, which is expected to take place mainly between the
country's two largest political parties, the ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) and the main opposition New Democracy (
ND).
</P>
<P>
PASOK-led by incumbent Prime Minister Costas Simitis won the
1996 parliamentary elections by obtaining 41.49 percent of the
votes and getting 162 seats in the 300-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
ND had 108 seats by gaining 38.12 percent of the votes,
followed by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) with 11 seats, the
Coalition of the Left with 10 seats and the Democratic Socialist
Movement with 9 seats.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Political Spring has decided not to attend the
forthcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Simitis Monday showed his confidence that the Greek people
will once again bestow their trust on PASOk, which was formed in
1974.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of recent nationwide polls, the
ruling party is expected to win although the two major parties may
run neck-and-neck in the elections.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Draw up Peace, Security Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Erastus Mwencha, secretary-general
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
Monday stressed the importance of drawing up a program of action
and a protocol on peace and security among its member states.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha told a workshop here that political stability, peace
and security are fundamental pre-conditions for regional economic
development and integration because free movement of goods,
service, capital and persons can not be attained if countries are
at war or experience political instability.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision of the COMESA summit held in Nairobi,
Kenya, in May 1999 on the issue of peace and security arose from a
growing concern for the widespread and persistent armed conflicts
among more than half of 21 member states of the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
COMESA is keen to see peace return to those member states which
are involved in armed conflict so that the objectives set up by
the organization can be achieved, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is therefore an urgent need to come up with a legal
framework under which COMESA can deal with issues of peace and
security in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the workshop entitled "The Challenges of Peace and
Security in the COMESA Sub-Region", Zambian Minister of Foreign
Affairs Kellys Walubita said it was time for COMESA to play a role
in peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Without peace and security, there can be no development and
conversely, without development, peace and security cannot be
sustained, the minister stressed.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Calls on End of Military Rule in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo Monday warned Burundi's military rulers against holding
onto power for too long, reports reaching here from Tanzania said.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo who was elected to office last year after 15
years of continuous military rule in Nigeria was speaking at the
start of the latest round of talks aimed at finding a peaceful
solution to Burundi's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
"The longer the military are in power, the longer will the
society lose its vital habit of thinking creatively and
democratically and solving its problems accordingly," President
Obasanjo told the summit meeting held in the Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The summit, chaired by former South African President Nelson
Mandela, is seeking an end to the fighting between Hutu rebels and
the army, which is dominated by Burundi's Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the summit are Burundi's President Pierre
Buyoya, and Presidents Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of
Nambia, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, and Daniel arap Moi of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in Burundi has claimed 200,000 lives, most of them
 civilians.
</P>
<P>
Burundi civil was started after the assassination of the
country's first president Melchior Ndadaye by the Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the talks, President Buyoya said he did not
expect a settlement to be reached for several months. But he said
that "we will make progress".

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Seize Major Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels have seized the
northwest major town of Calulo, in the Kwanza-sul province, after
"intense combats", said here on Monday an Angolan military source
declining to be identified.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, the rebel troops have driven the army
and police forces out of the town located in the north part of the
Kwanza-sul Province, some 230 kilometers southeast to the Angolan
capital Luanda, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The officer declined to provide casualty figures but said that
fighting continued in the area, adding that the Armed Forces of
Angola (FAA) are determined to recover the town as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
This attack constitutes a surprise for the government troops
since the area around Calulo was considered as a sufficiently safe
region. The German ambassador to Angola has decided to visit the
zone recently to inaugurate a lumber mill built by a German
business.
</P>
<P>
After the four-month Restauro Operation launched by the
government troops in the central highland starting from last
September, during which the government troops had conquered most
rebel bastions including the rebels' political and military
headquarters Bailundo and Andulo, the government considered that
the rebels had scattered into small groups and had to resorted to
guerrilla warfare.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia had registered some
227,000 telephone subscribers throughout the country by last
February, more than double the number recorded in fiscal year
1986/87, official sources said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Worku Bogale, deputy chief of the strategic
planning division of the Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation
(ETC), the country has made remarkable progress in the development
of telecommunication as compared with 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the great efforts made by the state-owned ETC,
subscribers have become easier to have access to telephone
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past, many applicants, especially those in the
rural areas, had to wait for years before they got a telephone
line, but this process has been much shortened now.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the ETC has made a plan to install
at least 60,000 telephones annually throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdulahim Ahmed, chief of the public relation
section with the ETC, told Xinhua that his corporation has been
providing Internet services in the capital city of Addis Ababa and
other regional towns since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of subscribers for the services has reached more
than 3,000 to date, he said, adding the ETC will have a
one-megabit server with the capacity to provide Internet services
to 14,000 subscribers.

goods to the flood victims in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Among the humanitarian goods offered by the Fund of Angolan

<HEADLINE> African Leaders Discontent With Slow Burundian Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The one-day consultative
summit of six African leaders held in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha on Monday noted with dissatisfaction over the progress
achieved so far to end the bloodshed in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the meeting, the
participants urged the 19 negotiating parties of Burundi to accept
the principle of making concessions in order to speed up a peace
agreement in the country.
</P>
<P>
The leaders stated that some of the resolutions agreed in the
past have not been effected to date. "In this regard, the summit
urges the parties to the conflict and especially the government of
Burundi to seriously act on them," the two-page communique read.
</P>
<P>
The summit was chaired by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
attended by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Namibian
President Sam Nujoma, Kenyan President Daniel Moi, Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa and Burundian President Pierre Buyoya,
</P>
<P>
It was also attended by Ali Abdulsalaam Turaiky, a special
representative of Libyan President Muammar Gaddafi, Ambassador
Berhanu Dinka, who represented U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan,
and Aldo Ajello, the European Union's special envoy to the Great
Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, when briefing the leaders on the progress of the
Burundi peace talks, the peace mediator, former South African
President Nelson Mandela expressed his regret that even though the
all-party committee meetings were held in Arusha for two weeks in
February, "no discernible agreements or consensus emerged."
</P>
<P>
The facilitator, the communique said, has called on all the
parties to the conflict to show a sense of urgency, seriousness,
commitment and readiness to make compromises in the on-going
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The communique also expressed its appreciation to the OAU, the
United Nations and the international community for their support
to the Burundi peace process, and called for their continued
support towards the expeditious conclusion of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the summit, Burundian President Buyoya

democratically elected president Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Focus On Trade Rather Than Labor Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Industry and Commerce
Minister Nathan Shamuyarira Monday called on the World Trade
Organization (WTO) to focus more on issues related to trade
rather than on labor and environment.
</P>
<P>
He said the WTO should link trade issues to development matters
and desist from going into issues that involve labor and
environmental standards which are beyond the scope of many African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 30 senior trade negotiators from Eastern and
Southern African countries attending a five-day workshop on trade
in Southern Africa, the minister called on the participants to
come up with a common position which would enable African
countries to negotiate like what western countries did.
</P>
<P>
At the function, workshop co-ordinator Yash Tandon said that
African countries have made a lot of progress in furthering their
cause by adopting a common stance with the turning point coming
during the WTO ministerial conference in Seattle, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
"We want to create networks among the negotiators, academics
and non- governmental organizations to arrive at a common African
position and also link with other people from developing
countries," Tandon said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malawian Trade Ministry official Obedy Makhenjera
said that African countries should put aside their own positions
and work on coming up with a single position that would ensure
that the whole continent could get the best possible deal from the
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Slams Politic-Governed Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ethiopian official
Monday criticized some international assistance to the least
developed countries (LDCS) of Africa are governed by political
considerations rather than their development needs.
</P>
<P>
Mekonnen Manayazewal, Vice Minister of the Economic Development
and Cooperation Ministry of Ethiopia, said although many of the
LDCS have adopted national framework policies conducive to foreign
direct investment (FDI), they have not yet attracted significant
investment from abroad.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks while addressing an expert preparatory
meeting of Anglophone African LDCS for the Third United Nations
Conference on LDCS to be held in Belgium, Brussels from May 13 to
20, next year.
</P>
<P>
The vice minister pointed out that the development of LDCS has
been limited by their vulnerability to recurrent natural disasters
that cause diversion of resources as well as disruption of ongoing
development endeavors.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, LDCS should constantly push to the fore to establish
and sustain the principle of democratic rights and economic
justice in domestic affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the idea of economic justice and welfare of nations
must also form the core of the formulation and management of
international policy, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the agenda of the meeting, the participants will
deliberate, among other things, on financing the development
efforts by LDCS, access to and competitiveness in international
trade, the role of good governance for development as well as the
status of social service delivery in LDCS.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged for Joint Environmental Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Chen Qiaoyan
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has urged African countries
to adopt common trans-boundary strategies in combating
environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 13th Session of the African Forestry and
Wildlife Commission Conference here on Monday, Zambian Minister of
Environment and Natural Resources Ben Mwila said African countries
should make additional efforts to promote intra-regional trade of
timber and other forest products.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) intensify its
efforts to mobilize additional funds to facilitate the
implementation of conservation, sustainable management, use and
improvement of forest resources in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Africa possesses about 15 percent of
forests and five percent of forest plantations respectively in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Geographically, about 97 percent of Africa's forests cover is
found in tropical Africa, he said, adding that forests cover an
area of 520 million hectares, equivalent to almost 18 percent of
the total land area of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said these forest resources can significantly support social
and economic development in Africa, but so far various indicators
have shown that Africa have made modest progress in the
sustainable development of its forest resources.
</P>
<P>
Despite the huge area of forest cover, Africa's forests face
considerable threats such as rapid conversion into agricultural
land, overgrazing, wildfires, timber over-exploitation, fuel-wood
and charcoal production, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also aware that pressure on forest and woody vegetation
has been exacerbated by high population growth rate in Africa,
averaging 2.8 percent, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said the situation of food security in
the region is still critical and is as serious to the affected
countries as it is threatening to peace, stability and human
survival in the region.
</P>
<P>
These emergency situations require the FAO to assess the food
and agriculture situation and food aid needs as well as to revive
the agricultural production in the framework of consolidated
appeals for humanitarian assistance, particularly by providing
direct assistance to farmers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that sustainable forest management and development
require substantial financing which the poor economies of African
countries can hardly afford, particularly since funding from both
domestic and international public sources has been declining.
</P>
<P>
African Forestry and Wildlife Commission is one of the most
important regional forestry commissions established by the FAO.
</P>
<P>
This conference attracted forestry experts from 29 countries
and four international organizations in the region.
</P>
<P>
It ended the first phase of the meeting for wildlife
conservation last Friday and started the second one on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It will discuss criteria and indicators for sustainable forest
management and implications in the implementation for
certification and trade in Africa, as well as report on the
progress in the implementation of the Forestry Outlook Study for
Africa.

Under an agreement signed here by Turkish Minister of Culture
Istemihan Talay and his Mongolian counterpart Avirmediin Battur,
the two countries will cooperate in the preservation of the 8th
century Orkhon Inscriptions, the first appearance of Turkish

</P>
<P>
The lace-like inscriptions, located near the Orkhon River,
northwest of the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, are of great
importance for the illumination of the Turkish history.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military
intelligence on Monday started verifying reports about an alleged
plot to kill President Joseph Estrada, a senior military official
said.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces Deputy Chief of Staff Jose Calimlim told reporters
that the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines (ISAFP) has launched a search for Alexander Hernandez,
who was reportedly tasked to assassinate the president.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez is distinguishing himself as a print journalist to
gain access to activities of the president, according to a report
by the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We are conducting some background investigation. We are
looking for this guy," Calimlim said.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said it is the duty of the intelligence community to
verify and validate all reports pertaining to the threats on the
life of the president.
</P>
<P>
"We are verifying a lot of these things. This is normal, we
receive a lot of things like this. This is not the first time, but
we have to go through the process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, there were also similar reports about a plot to kill
the president.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim, who is also ISAFP chief, said he has not talked to
the president about the assassination plot. "Unless we are sure
about it, we do not discuss it," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi GDP Revised Down to 5.5 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The average growth rate of Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in the current fiscal year (1999-2000) was
revised down to 5.5 percent, compared to 6 percent in the old
estimates, Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah A.M.S. Kibria Monday
told a press conference here to mark the release of New National
Accounts Estimates.
</P>
<P>
The lower growth rate in the revised methodology is primarily
attributed to the relatively higher level of GDP and the use of a
more current base year.
</P>
<P>
However, the revised annual average level of GDP has increased
by about 30 percent compared with the old estimates. The GDP in
current prices is 2,413 billion taka (46.4 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1999-2000 in the revised estimation against the old estimation
of 1,898 billion taka (36.5 billion dollars) in the same fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income has increased by about 28 percent with 386
dollars in 1999-2000 against the old estimation of 307 dollars in
the same period.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the newly-adopted revised and expanded system of
national accounts, the Kibria said the revised accounts estimates
reflect the expansion and structural changes undergone by the
economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Data should be placed neutrally and there must not be any
politics behind compilation and presentation of data, Kibria said,
adding that the revised methodology of compilation was recommended
by the United Nations and also advocated by related donor agencies.

<HEADLINE> 26 Killed in Heavy Fighting in Northern S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 26 combatants were
killed on Monday as heavy fighting was raging in northern Sri
Lanka between government forces and separatist rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman J.D.A. Gunasekara said 11 soldiers were killed and 23
others injured by the mortars fired by LTTE rebels at Pallai,
north of the Elephant Pass, the entrance to the northernmost
Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He said more than 15 rebels had been killed in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The death toll is expected to rise as the clearing operation
was continuing.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from its London office on Monday, the
LTTE rebels claimed that they had inflicted heavy casualties on
government troops by launching an overnight "massive sea and land
assault in the Jaffna peninsula."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the rebels had overrun the army's artillery
base at Pallai and cut off the main land route to two strategic
army bases.
</P>
<P>
However, Spokesman Gunasekara said the rebels' sea-borne attack
on the eastern coast of the Jaffna peninsula had been repulsed by
the Sri Lankan navy who had sunk at least two rebel boats and
badly damaged a third.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to seize
control of the military base at Elephant Pass, the first step to
retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
There was heavy fighting in the area in February, overshadowing
a brief peace mission to Sri Lanka by Norway which is attempting
to mediate between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga is seeking to
introduce a devolution package which would give Tamil concentrated
areas of the island more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
More than 55,000 people have been killed in the 17-year-old
civil war between government troops and the LTTE rebels, who are
seeking independence in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) - E-commerce and the internet are
expected to boost Britain's rate of growth, according to a report
published Monday by the Center for Economics and Business Research.
</P>
<P>
The report, called e-conomics of e-business, says that
currently the effect of internet-related companies is negligible -
0.1 percent at most - because many are loss-making and have yet to
enter the statistical net.
</P>
<P>
However, as e-business enters the mainstream it is likely to
boost Britain's GDP growth on average over the next 20 years by 0.
6 percent a year, the Center expects.
</P>
<P>
If the Bank of England does not take account of this, interest
rates could be kept higher than necessary to control inflation,
the report says.
</P>
<P>
E-business is boosting investment in intangibles such as
marketing and advertising, the report says, adding that some of
this does not enter into GDP but still adds to economic activity.

LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Senegal's Abdou Diame will replace
Chinese center Yao Ming in the International Select Team that will
meet the USA Junior Basketball Team at the 2000 NABC/ Nike Hoop
Summit on April 2.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old forward, standing 2.06 (6-9 feet) tall, has
only been playing organized basketball for three years, but
impressed experts with his shot blocking, shooting touch and range.
</P>
<P>
Yao Ming, standing at 2.25-meter (7-5 feet) tall, skipped the
Hoop Summit after the 19-year-old is required to practice in a pre-
Olympics training camp of the Chinese national side starting from
April 1. Yao helped China win last August's Asian Championship and
gained the solo spot in Asia to compete at the Sydney Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
Yao, with the Shanghai Sharks of the CBA Chinese Basketball
Association league, is considered one of the top centers in China
and a potential pick for the NBA draft. He averaged 5.3 blocks and
14.9 rebounds to capture the blocking and rebounding titles of the
CBA, the best pro-league in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Diame, who is currently playing at Oak Hill Academy, in
Virginia of the United States, rose to national prominence during
the 1998-1999 season when he helped Oak Hill become the top-ranked
high school basketball team in the USA Today ratings.
</P>
<P>
The sixth annual Hoop Summit benefits the Naismith Memorial
Basketball Hall of Fame, located in Springfield, Mass, the
birthplace of basketball.
</P>
<P>
It is the only international game of its kind and brings
together 12 of the top junior players in the world to compete
against the USA Basketball Junior National Select Team, a squad
comprised of the top high school senior boy hoopsters in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
USA basketball team leads the Hoop Summit series 3-2 that began
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Sandstorm Attacks Beijing the Fourth Time of This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Sandstorms today hit Beijing for
the fourth time this year. Houses and streets were covered in
thick layers of dust.
</P>
<P>
The other three sandstorms hit the capital on March 8, 18 and
for two days on the 22 and 23. Strong winds destroyed some
advertising bill boards and sent bicycles crashing to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather has caused great inconvenience to pedestrians.
Many women covered their head with gauzes to protect their eyes
and skin.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorm was mainly caused by a moderate northerly gale
which picked up the sand and dust from the city's numerous
construction sites, said meteorological observatory officials.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that such sandstorms are not rare in
Beijing. Lack of rainfall in spring usually produce a great amount
of sand and dust and windy weather does not help.
</P>
<P>
The only way to alleviate these sandstorms is to plant more
trees and grass, they said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Launch Govt E-Delivery System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An electronic delivery system
is expected to be set up in Hong Kong on April 7 to provide a
secured means for handling the government's tenders through
Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
The Electronic Tendering System (ETS) will begin in the new
millennium with a wide range of government services to be
available at the click of a button to every company or household
connected to the Internet, the Director of Government Supplies
Nigel Shipman said.
</P>
<P>
Launched by the Government Supplies Department (GSD), the new
system will issue notification of GSD's tenders, specifications
and documents to potential suppliers, receive submission of tender
offers, and display contract award notices.
</P>
<P>
To protect against unauthorized access, the most advanced
encryption technology will be used, the spokesman said. So far,
representatives from about 1,700 companies have shown an interest
in the system by taking part in ETS seminars to familiarize
themselves with the technical and subscription issues.
</P>
<P>
"I think we are one of the leaders in using electronic means
for the receipt of tender bids as well as for the distribution of
tender documentation on such a large scale," Shipman said.
</P>
<P>
The service will not only bring in new tender bidders, but also
achieve savings in time and expenses for the government as well as
tender bidders. It will allow open access to the government
procurement opportunities on GSD's ETS homepage for all small,
medium- and large-sized enterprises from anywhere in the world,
Shipman said.
</P>
<P>
"This is very important as 90 percent of the products we buy
are manufactured overseas," Shipman said. "So potential suppliers
in the global village can have access to our requirements and
consider whether they can meet them."
</P>
<P>
As for the government, the announcement of tender opportunities
and results electronically will also reduce paper work and costs
related to distributing the information.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the department replaced its stores management system
for common user items by an on-line system. Since then, government
departments requisitioning for their stores could do this on-line.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto to be Summoned Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- After receiving a medical report
from an independent medical team, Indonesia's Attorney General's
Office has set a new date for summoning the former strong man once
again.
</P>
<P>
"The Attorney General's Office has sent a letter to former
president Soeharto to be examined on Thursday at 09:00 a.m. (local
time) as a suspect in case of corruption, collusion and nepotistic
practices in the foundations that he chaired, namely Dharmais,
Dakab and Supersemar," spokesman of the Attorney General's Office
Soehandojo told reporters here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Early this month an independent medical team established by the
Attorney General's Office examined the health of the former
president and said that he was fit to face questioning, but has
trouble in speaking.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto failed last month to meet an Attorney General's Office
's summons to undergo investigations into alleged corruption
practices during his 32-year-rule.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon repeatedly said his
client was in a big trouble in communication both orally and in
writing after he suffered a stroke last year, so the former strong
man could not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
But on March 8 Soeharto looked healthy when President
Abdurrahman Wahid visited him at his residence in Central Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The former president appeared again in a good shape when he was
praying at the At Tin Mosque, at "Indonesia in Miniature Park" (
TMII) compound.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Straighten out Chinese Tourists Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will take measures to
straighten out the market of Chinese tourists to protect the
rights of Chinese tourists, Pradech Phyakvichien, governor of
Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese tourists should not be attracted by low prices because
they can not get satisfactory service from low-budget tour
packages, he told Xinhua after a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"The (low) price offered in the market does not reflect the
true costs of travel," he said, adding that in order to cover the
costs and make profits Thai tour operators will make Chinese
tourists spend money to draw commissions.
</P>
<P>
The result is the worse quality of service and goods for
Chinese tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
To avoid these problems in the future, TAT is determined to
collaborate with agencies concerned and the Chinese authorities in
changing the vicious circle, he said.
</P>
<P>
If a travel agency is found to have been involved in illegal or
unfair activities against Chinese tourists, TAT will revoke its
business operating license and ask Thai embassies and consulate
offices not to issue visas to the tourists engaged in the tour
program of the company.
</P>
<P>
Thai embassies and consulate offices will also hand out
information forms to Chinese tourists along with visas, asking
them about the quality of the services they received during their
trip to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAT will strengthen public relations to inform
Chinese tourists about their rights, Pradech said.
</P>
<P>
TAT will also support tour operators who offer good tour
packages to help establish a healthy market, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
Pradech returned Sunday from a four-day visit to China, during
which he consulted with the Chinese tourism authorities on
problems existing in the Chinese tourists market and on setting up
a TAT office in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
China is the second largest tourist market of Thailand, with
799,504 Chinese travelling to the country last year, an increase
of 34.66 percent over the previous year.

NEW DELHI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- India and Turkey will sign an
agreement on agricultural cooperation during Turkish Premier
Bulent Ecevit's three-day official visit to India beginning on
March 31, an Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish business delegation is also coming with the Turkish
premier for the fourth meeting of the Indo-Turkish Joint Business
Council, during which the two sides will discuss steps for further
enhancing their economic and trade ties, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also sign an agreement on the establishment
of a mechanism for political consultations between the foreign
ministries of the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit's forthcoming visit was expected to provide a "strong
impulse" to the strengthening of Indo-Turkish cooperation,
particularly in the economic and commercial spheres, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the Turkish premier will hold wide-
ranging discussions with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee on regional, international issues and other issues of
mutual concern. He will also call on Indian President K R
Narayanan, Vice President Krishan Kant and Congress President
Sonia Gandhi during his visit.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President on Burundi Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Monday appealed to the international community to continue
assisting the people of Burundi in their efforts to realize peace.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks at a Tanzania's northern town of Arusha as
he had a closed-door consultative meeting on Burundi peace process
with other African leaders, the Presidential Press Service said in
the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, was
attended by President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, President Benjamin
Mkapa of Tanzania, President Sam Nujoma of Namibia, the Burundi
peace process facilitator Nelson Mandela and Libyan Cabinet
Minister A. Turaiki.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Moi said it was wrong for those seeking
 leadership positions in Africa to use bloodshed to attain their
political goals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while seeking for outside help, the people of
Burundi themselves should play their role in the peace process,
adding that the only way of achieving peace lies with the
committment of the leaders and the people of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president urged the government of Burundi to
initiate measures for a return to constitutional order to
facilitate transitional arrangements and to disband all the
regroupment camps.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Moi appealed to those groups that have not
been taking part in the peace talks to review their stand and
return to the negotiating table in order to give an impetus to the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the parties involved in the conflict to guarantee
the security of those agencies in provision of humanitarian
assistance in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Winning Helps Improve Russia-Poland Ties: Polish Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The victory of Acting President
Vladimir Putin in Russia's presidential election offers a good
chance for the improvement of relations between Poland and Russia,
a senior Polish government official said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Polish Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek said that Putin's
victory would help Russia walk out of the situation of disorder
and unpredictability, and embark on the road of prosperity and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
He hopes that Russia can reform its foreign policies as it

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Germany Supports Palestinian State Proclamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 27 (xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said here Monday that Germany and the European Union (EU)
will support the establishment of the independent state of
Palestine due to be established this autumn.
</P>
<P>
"The Berlin Statement, which was issued here by the EU just one
year ago, is always valid," Schroeder told a press briefing after
his talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
At a summit held here in March, 1999, the EU expressed its
support for Palestinians' right of self-determination, including
the proclamation of their own state.
</P>
<P>
"The Middle East peace process must achieve a conclusion, and
for the latest phase of negotiations a new dynamic is necessary,"
Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, as a major exporter to Palestine, will be "fully
engaged" in building up the Palestinian economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that Germany must coordinate with the EU
since its foreign policy is based on the framework of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat urged Germany and the EU play a stronger role
in the latest Palestinian-Israeli negotiation and to be as active
as the United States and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
"Palestine needs full engagement of Germany and the EU, not
only economic, but also political," said Arafat, adding that "a
stronger role of the EU is a guarantee for peace in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said his plan to establish the
independent state of Palestine in September was in danger as "many
sides" had pressed him to wait till the end of Israel's election.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Arafat also met with Germany's Parliamentary
Speaker Wolfgang Thierse and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
After the talks with Schroeder, he is expected to meet German
President Johannes Rau.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Consumers Confident of Growing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that China'
s Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) climbed up a little in
February, showing increased confidence of consumers about the
country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of consumer confidence released today
by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the ICE stood at 95.5
points, 0.3 point higher than the previous month.
</P>
<P>
About 60 percent of those surveyed said they expect the
national economy to grow faster this year than in 1999, some 5
percent more than the figure in January.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey also reveals a weakening confidence in
family economic status, as the concern about employment, education,
medical care, insurance and housing weighs heavily on the budgets
of many families.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of consumers said they believe this is the
right time to buy household electric appliances, according to the
Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS), which was a little bit higher
than in January.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent of consumers hold that the domestic
consumer goods market is growing healthier in the first two months
this year, compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer indexes, including the ICE, ICS, and Index of Current
Economic Conditions (ICC), are used internationally as indicators
of the overall economic situation and consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the bureau said that the worry about insufficient
income hinders future consumer spending, thus making the drive of
domestic demand more difficult.
</P>
<P>
They call for greater effort to develop a sound social security
system while increasing people's salaries.

<HEADLINE> HK Gains Record Robust Growth in Exports in Feb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports continued to record robust growth last month, according to
the external trade figures released Monday by the Census and
Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the value of total exports (comprising
re-exports and domestic exports) rose markedly by 20.3 percent in
February over a year earlier to 95.2 billion HK dollars (12.2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within the total, the value of re-exports rose by 21.3 percent
and that of domestic exports by 13.6 percent. Meanwhile, the value
of imports increased strongly by 27.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the first two months of this year, the value of total
exports increased by 16.7 percent over a year earlier, with the
value of re-exports increasing by 17.6 percent and that of
domestic exports by 10.8 percent. The value of imports rose by 21.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the figures, a Government Secretariat spokesman
said export performance remained robust, with the value of total
exports recording double-digit growth for four consecutive months
since November 1999.
</P>
<P>
There was an across-the-board surge in exports to the major
markets, boosted by sustained strong demand in the East Asian
economies, the United States and Europe, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said imports retained for local use had accelerated for four
months in a row, with a sharp surge of 41 percent in value terms
in February over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
This has led to a widening in the visible trade deficit over
the past few months, he said, adding that the surge in retained
imports and the larger visible trade deficit were associated with
a distinct pick-up in domestic demand in line with a more
entrenched economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier: Seize Opportunities and Speed up Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
today urged the country to seize opportunity and speed up economic
development to lay a firm foundation for realizing the third set
of China's strategic objectives for modernization.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the remarks at the opening session of the "China
Development Forum" convened here today.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Development Research Center of the State
Council and the Shenzhen Development Bank, the Forum is expected
to produce valuable suggestions and opinions in helping China map
out its tenth Five-Year Plan starting next year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has begun to formulate its tenth Five-
Year Plan, Wen said, pointing out that this plan will be the first
five-year plan since the establishment of socialist market economy
in China in the late 1970s and early 1980s. "It is also a plan for
us to further carry out reforms," he added.
</P>
<P>
"By 2010, China will have established a comparatively complete
socialist market economy, doubled its GDP, and will further
improve the living standards of the Chinese people," Wen said. (

Casting eyes upon China's progress over the past 20 years, Wen
noted that China has fulfilled its development target of
quadrupling the total GDP since 1980 and has realized the goal of
quadrupling the total per capita GDP, despite an increase in China
's population.
</P>
<P>
Social productive forces and the people's livelihood have been
raised to new heights, he added.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts of the whole nations, in about 50
years, the initial modernization of China will be realized," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wen also pointed out that China is now at the important
transitional stage in the economy. "We not only should solve
residual issues, but also face the issues which have emerged since
the reform period," he added.
</P>
<P>
In this new era of economic development, Wen stressed that
China "must make strategic readjustments in restructuring the
economy."
</P>
<P>
"These readjustments are a priority for China now and in the
future. We should continue economic reforms as the economy
develops," he stressed.

Wen also pointed out that the service industry must be
developed by utilizing human resources.
</P>
<P>
"The strategy for urbanizing small towns and for developing
China's western region must be implemented. The gap between
developing urban and rural regions must be narrowed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wen also said that protecting the environment is a priority and
must be undertaken on a grand scale to realize economic and social
development.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Separatist Forces Can Never Come To Any Good: People's Daily (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- "Lee Teng-hui has been forced to
step down amid angry voices from all parts of Taiwan," says a "
People's Daily" commentary, to be published tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
for Lee Teng-hui, 12 years' chairman of the Nationalist Party
of China, or the Kuomintang (KMT), "political life has finally
come to an end."
</P>
<P>
The paper lists three factors for the KMT's defeat in local
election in the Taiwan Province, namely, corruption, splits within
the KMT, and conniving at "Taiwan independence" forces.
</P>
<P>
Lee had been engaged in "black gold" politics. He combined
political power with commercial interests, losing the support of
the people;
</P>
<P>
Lee appeared to have practiced democracy, but actually his rule
was a dictatorship. Lee had for long implemented a separatist "
Taiwan independence" line and has been an opponent of
reunification.

<P>
The commentary goes on to criticize Lee for his words and
activities in the past 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who claims himself as "Mr. Democracy," has been very
autocratic, intolerant to differences of opinion and has been an
vocal opponent against reunification.
</P>
<P>
The paper describes Lee as "being very good at disguising
himself, accustomed to playing political tactics, capricious and
deceiving" and as having ultimately lost the fundamental moral
fiber necessary to a politician.
</P>
<P>
Lee has exposed himself in front of the KMT members and the
people of Taiwan, the paper says. He is like a mouse being chased
and beaten. "This goes to show that history makes a fair judgment
and justice resides in the hearts of the people."
</P>
<P>
The most important reason for Lee's demise from power is his
activities against the one-China Principle and reunification. (

In the first few days after Li took office, he pledged that the
Taiwan Authorities advocated the one-China Policy and were opposed
to a two-China policy, while making also stating that he would not
tolerate "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
Lee later changed his views stating he "had never talked about
a One China." Lee has advocated "two equal political entities," "
separation and governing in separation," "two Chinas for a period,
" and "the Republic of China is located in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Being connived by Lee, "Taiwan independence" forces have become
"legal" and increasingly arrogant.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Lee made his notorious "two states" statement,
following his other theory of "separating China into seven parts."
</P>
<P>
Lee was overly confident of his own "authority," thinking that
he could deceive the entire world. But he has finally eaten his
own bitter fruits, the commentary says, emphasizing that Lee's
political demise is a warning to others: whoever engages in "
Taiwan independence" can never come to any good!

The growth of Taiwan independent forces has led to increased
tensions across the straits. The people of Taiwan are not only
worried about cross-straits ties but the security of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan have recognized Lee's true colors in
seemingly trying to advocate reunification while in fact
advocating "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
The commentary reiterates the central government's consistent
position that anything is negotiable across the straits, under the
premise of one-China principle, and that if the principle is not
observed, there will be no grounds for improving cross-straits
ties. "Taiwan compatriots should be on their guard against
tricksters in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The commentary concludes that anyone who moves against
historical trends and the will of the people by adhering to the "
Taiwan independence" line will end up just like the now fallen Lee.

abducted.

<P>
No clues to the whereabouts of the 16-year old high school
student have surfaced to date despite her parents efforts to

<HEADLINE> No Change in Syria's Policy Toward Peace Talks: Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The inconclusive U.S.-Syrian
summit in Geneva on Sunday indicated no change in Syria's policy
toward peace talks with Israel, said Israeli Foreign Minister David
levy here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Geneva U.S.-Syrian summit shows that there has been no
change in Syrian President Hafez Assad's outlook and he is still
expected Israel to meet all Syrian demands for moving the peace
talks forward," Levy told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, resumed last December, stalled
again in January after two rounds of talks due to Israel's
rejection to Syria's demand to commit itself to full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights is captured during the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants security arrangements and normalization of
bilateral relations to be discussed first in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton met Syrian President Assad Sunday in
a last ditch effort to reactivate the peace talks. The summit had
been widely believed to lead to the announcement of revival of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
But the two leaders said at the end of their talks they had
nothing to announce.
</P>
<P>
Levy did not say whether Israel will make some compromise so as
to reactivate the talks. The Israeli government is expected to
discuss this issue in the coming days as U.S. special Middle East
peace envoy Dennis Ross arrives here Monday to brief Prime Minister
Ehud Barak on the Geneva summit.
</P>
<P>
An official in Barak's office said Monday that the prime
minister was not disappointed by the outcome of the summit, because
expectations of the meeting had been realistic.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans will continue looking into various options for
moving the Israeli-Syrian track forward," the official said, adding
that "the door to peace has not been closed."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the failed Geneva summit, Chief of General Staff
of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Lt-Gen. Shaul Mofaz said Monday
that the IDF will continue its preparations to withdraw from south
Lebanon, on the assumption an agreement can still be reached with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to withdraw the IDF from south Lebanon by
July this year, with or without an agreement with Syria. The Israel
cabinet has already approved this.
</P>
<P>
Barak called his key cabinet ministers to an emergency meeting
Sunday night to discuss the consequences of the failed Geneva

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Premier Reaffirms One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Helen Clark reaffirmed here Monday that her government will adhere
to its "One China" policy and stressed that New Zealand will not
encourage "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
She made the statement in a meeting with the visiting alternate
member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the
Chinese Communist Party (CPC), Zeng Qinghong.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Clark and Zeng had a cordial and friendly
conversation on the issues of common concern. They reviewed the
successful state visit to New Zealand made by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin last September. During that visit, both China and New
Zealand agreed to establish a long-term, stable and all-round
relationship of cooperation oriented towards the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Zeng, who is also a member of the
Secretariat and head of the Organization Department of the CPC
Central Committee, stressed that the Chinese government has a
consistent policy in solving the Taiwan issue, namely, there is
only one China and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
China, he added, has all along been working for a peaceful
settlement of the Taiwan issue. Recently, both President Jiang and
Premier Zhu Rongji made it clear that with the "One China"
principle as its prerequisite, any problem can be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Zeng noted that persisting in the "One China" policy and
opposing any form of "Taiwan independence" will be conducive to
the peaceful settlement of the Taiwan issue and to the peace and
stability across the Taiwan Straits as well as in the Asia-Pacific
region and the world over.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Prime Minister agreed with Zeng on the Taiwan
issue. She reiterated that her government will adhere to its "One
China" policy and that her country will not encourage "Taiwan
independence."
</P>
<P>
She said New Zealand is glad to see the all-round development
in Hong Kong and Macao after their return to China.
</P>
<P>
Zeng and his party arrived in New Zealand on March 25 at the
invitation of the New Zealand government. The main purpose of Zeng
's visit is to study New Zealand's public servants system and its
efforts in building a clean government.

<HEADLINE> Angola's North Under Government Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The situation in Angola's northern
 provinces is "calm and well controlled by the government troops",
 Lieutenant-general Marques Banza, commander of the Angolan
Northern Battle Front, has said.
</P>
<P>
The statement made by Banza at the weekend followed a local
tabloid's report that the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was in the
north, perhaps in Malange Province for a meeting with his
followers.
</P>
<P>
Banza said that the situation in northern regions had remained
calm since January, when the government troops ended a mass
offensive on the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) with the rebels having been driven out of their
traditional bases in the central highland.
</P>
<P>
Some of them fled to the eastern areas bordering Zambia and
others went to the northern regions bordering the Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Banza said that the government troops had only lost control of
two municipalities in the Uige Province, adding that some small
rebel groups are currently operating in two regions, Quimbele and
Buengas-Norte.
</P>
<P>
The government troops will make efforts to dislodge the rebels
as soon as possible and keep quiet and order in the frontier
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Banza also said that the rebels had changed their strategy by
launching guerrilla warfare and terrorist actions against the
government and civilian targets.

LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
on Monday congratulated Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin on
his election victory and discussed with Putin how to forge new
links between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the 15 minute telephone call, Blair also stressed the
need to bring an end to the Chechen conflict in Russia, Blair's
official spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"He congratulated him on a clear victory," the spokesman told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Putin said he had been given a big responsibility by the
Russian people," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The new Russian leader told Blair he would be honest with his
people about the problems the country faces.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed the importance of building
economic and business links.
</P>
<P>
Putin has won more than 52 percent of the weekend votes.

Blair was reportedly the first Western leader to meet Putin
since he was made acting president.

The prime minister, who met Putin in Russia two weeks ago, said
Putin was an impressive politician and portrayed him as a fellow
modernizer with a "focused view of what he wants to achieve in
Russia."

<HEADLINE> Jospin Reshuffles Government in Preparation for 2002 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
reshuffled his government on Monday in a move widely considered as
preparation for the 2002 presidential election but also harkens
back to the era of Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
Two Socialist heavyweights and former ministers under President
Francois Mitterrand, Jack Lang and Laurent Fabius, took over the
Ministry of National Education and Ministry of Economy, Finance
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the French Communist Party (PCF) won its fourth seat
in the government as Michel Sapin, who is also a former minister
under Mitterrand, became State Secretary for Patrimony and
Cultural Decentralization.
</P>
<P>
Guy Hascoet from the Greens became State Secretary for Economic
Solidarity, the second ministerial post for the Greens.
</P>
<P>
Two other former ministers in the Mitterrand era, Catherine
Tasca and Roger-Gerard Schwartzenberg, were nominated Minister of
Culture and Communications and Minister of Research.
</P>
<P>
The decree of nomination of the ministers was signed by
President Jacques Chirac after a long telephone conversation with
Jospin, said the Elysee presidential palace, which did not
elaborate on details.
</P>
<P>
Among those being sacrificed by Jospin are Claude Allegre,
former Minister of National Education and Research Christian
Sautter, who took over the post of Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry from Dominique Strauss-Kahn several months ago, and
Catherine Trautmann, former Minister of Culture and Communications.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the reshuffle is aimed at winning as many
supporters as possible to the Socialist government as the
presidential election is nearing.
</P>
<P>
In the next presidential campaign, Jospin is expected to
challenge Chirac, who is weakened by a deep crisis of the right-
wing camp of France.
</P>
<P>
Fabius, 53, who is now speaker of the National Assembly, is
greatly favored by the middle class of the French society.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to be more flexible in adopting economic
policy than some of his left-wing peers in the Socialist
government.
</P>
<P>
Jack Lang, who is former Minister of Culture under Mitterrand,
has a wide influence among intellectuals, minority groups and the
circle of arts.
</P>
<P>
By giving one more seat to the Communist Party, Jospin is
apparently trying to win more support from the trade unions and
working class.

Arafat called on the European Union (EU) to play a bigger role
in the Middle East peace process, saying that both economic and
political support from Europe would be vital.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed that Germany will play an important role in
the peace process, but as a member of the EU, Germany will
coordinate its actions with the organization.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir V. Putin, a career Soviet KGB agent and untested
politician who rocketed to popularity on the strength of his
prosecution of a war and a vow to impose order out of chaos, was
elected to be Russian president, the Central Election Commission
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton met with Syrian President Hafez
Assad for three hours Sunday but failed to move him any closer to
resuming direct peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- When Acting President Vladimir V. Putin met behind closed

-- The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is on the
verge of an agreement to increase its oil production limits by
about 1.7 million barrels a day, officials from several oil
exporting countries said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's inability to persuade Pakistan to reduce
tensions with India or to coax India back into talks with its
rival leave nuclear South Asia just as he described it before he
visited the two countries: the most dangerous place in the world.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft made several major concessions in its offer to
settle antitrust charges, including freeing computer makers to
embed competitors' software in Windows, people close to the
settlement talks said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts Discussing Cleaner Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and British experts today
discussed technical solutions on manufacturing cleaner vehicles in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jianping, director in charge of auto industry development
under the State Administration of Machinery, said that developing
low-emission vehicles is a key task for the industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that China's auto industry has rapidly developed in
the past ten years. Its annual output increased to nearly 1.8
million cars in 1999 from 509,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the rapid development of the auto industry has
had negative effects on the environment.
</P>
<P>
China has set the Euro 1 target of emission standards for
vehicles -- the standard adopted by ten European countries in
early 1990s -- by 2000. By 2005, emission standards will reach
Euro 2 standards used in the late 1990s in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
To find practical and cost-effective measures to reduce vehicle
emissions, China has launched a Clean Car Campaign which will
promote cleaner fuels, natural gas engines, and develop research
on electric cars.
</P>
<P>
Nigel Davies, an official from the British Cleaner Vehicles
Task Force, said that Britain has a lot of experience in dealing
with car pollution and will share their experience with their
Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The Britain-based Johnson Mattey Corporation also plans to set
up a joint venture in Shanghai to manufacture a catalyst device
and cooperate with Chinese universities and institutes in finding
cleaner ways to run vehicles.

HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada is supportive of Hong
Kong's continued prosperity, social systems and the well-being of
Hong Kong people under the principle of "One Country, Two Systems,
" a Canadian diplomat said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Canada and Hong Kong enjoy long-standing, deep, multi-faceted
ties based on people to people links," Canada's Consul General in
Hong Kong Colin Russel told a news briefing prior to Tung Chee Hwa
's coming visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Tung, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region, will visit Toronto and Ottawa on April 1-4. He will meet

Lastman and the Canada-Hong Kong Parliamentary Friendship Group.
</P>
<P>
Tung will be delivering keynote addresses at functions
organized by the Canadian Club of Toronto, the Hong Kong-Canada
Business Association and the Business Council on National Issues.
</P>
<P>
China's entry into the WTO and the Asia-Pacific regional
economic development will certainly be among the topics of Tung's
discussion with Canadian officials, Russel said. "But I think that
Canada has been, from the very early days of recognition of China,
very clear on One-China policy, and we have kept clarifying that
we have this One-China policy which makes absolutely no room for
ambiguity there," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Russel said that Hong Kong is home to the largest Canadian
business community in Asia with over 100 local or regional
Canadian corporate offices, and over 450 other companies
represented by agent.
</P>
<P>
Russel said Tung's visit will further the mutual understanding
and economic ties between Canada and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports and imports to and from Canada in
1999 were 4.2 billion Canadian dollars (2.87 billion U.S. dollars)
and 1.8 billion Canadian dollars (1.23 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Drops to Nine-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's annual inflation rate
dropped to 5. 2 percent in January from 6.6 percent last December,
hitting the record low in the past nine years, according to media
reports on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's inflation rate reached the all-time high of 78
percent in 1995, and slided to the single digit level of 6.5
percent in mid-1997, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts are surprised that the inflation rate
continued its downward trend despite several inflation-inducing
developments in the economy such as continued depreciation in the
value of the currency Naira.
</P>
<P>
They contributed the sharp fall in inflation to the new
government's commitment to revitalizing the country's ailing
economy after the long-term military rule ended in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
When launching Nigeria's macro-economic blueprint last
Wednesday, President Olusegun Obasanjo emphasized the government's
"determination to pursue stability in the price and exchange rate,
ensure a healthy balance of payments and allow interest rate to
support the real sector".

<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Riot in a town of Nigeria's central
State of Niger continued on Sunday defying the presence of a large
group of police, soldiers and a curfew imposed by local
government, the Punch, a major Nigerian newspaper, reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting youths at Suleja, a town some 50 kilometers from
the west African nation's capital Abuja, set fire to many
buildings and automobiles and blocked all roads leading to an
emir's palace.
</P>
<P>
Army was called in on Saturday to quell the violence, which had
claimed several people's lives.
</P>
<P>
The clash was sparked by a long-running dispute over who should
be the Emir, or traditional ruler of Suleja.
</P>
<P>
The riot participants objected to the reinstatement in January
of Awwal Ibrahim as Emir. He had been deposed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Among the dead, several had been shot dead by the police when
they were attempting to storm the Emir's palace.
</P>
<P>
Niger State governor and other officials had traveled to the
town on Saturday to assess the situation and appeal for calm.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic, religious and communal violence has seemed to be on the
rise recently, which has killed several thousand during the past
half-year, said observers.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's presidential elections on
Sunday generally complied with Moscow's commitment to the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
Council of Europe, said a joint statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
There was some misconduct in the preparation and the holding
of elections, but it did not affect the outcome, said the OSCE/
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, the OSCE
Parliamentary Assembly and the Council of Europe Parliamentary
Assembly on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Observers regarded pressure on the mass media as the main
drawback on the election campaign. In their opinion, many public
and private mass media failed to give unbiased information about
the election campaign and candidates.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya lacked general conditions for the election campaign
due to hostilities and instability in some of its districts, the
observers said. They did not exclude possible intimidation of
voters in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, however, voting in Chechnya was
conducted calmly and in an orderly manner. No serious disruptions
from separatist rebels were reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 international observers were deployed during the
voting day.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Forest-Fire Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
has asked localities to act swiftly and take every possible
measure to prevent outbreaks of large forest fires as dry and warm
weather persists this spring.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a nationwide tele-conference on forest-
fire prevention held today by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the risk of large forest fires is high, he said
that special attention should be paid to forest areas in northeast,
northwest, and southwest China and Inner Mongolia, and urged these
crucial localities to be specially assiduous in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He noted that four precautionary measures should receive top
priority this spring, namely motivating the people to guard
against fires, strictly controlling all possible fire sources,
losing no time in developing isolation belts in forest regions,
and accelerating comprehensive forest-fire control.

<HEADLINE> WB Official Foresees Big Potential in China Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- In 20 years China will have the
second-largest economy in the world, with its economy shifting to
a knowledge-based, service one, a senior World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
"If you project current growth trends out 20 years you'll see
that China will no longer be the tenth largest trading partner in
the world but probably number two," the Hong Kong Standard Monday
cited Yukon Huang, the World Bank official in charge of the Bank's
operations in China, as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the Washington-based development bank's quarterly
economic review, the Chinese economy, which is classified under
the category of transition economies, obtained a growth of 9.6
percent, 8.8 percent and 7.8 percent in 1996, 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy in 1999 is estimated to grow by 7.1 percent,
while the growth in 2000 and 2001 are projected to reach 7.0 and 7.
2 percent respectively, the economic review said.
</P>
<P>
Huang forecast that even if the Chinese economy grows by 6
percent or 7 percent and not 9 percent or 10 percent, China will
become the second-largest economy in the world.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official, who is managing an annual 3 billion U.
S. dollars lending program in China, sees the inevitability for
the China economy to shift to a knowledge-based, service one from
the current agriculture-driven one.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural population, which makes 50 percent of the
total, will be 20 percent 20 years from now, Huang said. Twenty
years ago China's agricultural population was 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Since the ratio of arable land to the population is very
unfavorable and there's no other way for China to employ 1.3
billion people, 20 years from now China will transit to a
knowledge-based, service economy, the WB official predicted.
</P>
<P>
Although the land has been the source of China's productivity
growth and its income growth in the past 20 years, it would not be
the base of its future success.
</P>
<P>
China cannot provide productive jobs for its people unless it
has much larger service sector, he said. Currently China's service
sector is too small, contributing only 30 percent of its gross
domestic product, compared with 50 percent in Brazil and the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Huang said China's imminent accession
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will be very useful for the
Chinese mainland's economic transition.
</P>
<P>
In his view, China is eventually going to be an economy like the
United States, less dependent, and in some sense less concerned
about the external economy because of the size and variety of its
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
In 20 years' time, China's economic growth prospects will be
largely determined by what's happening domestically. There will be
a shift from a focus on the coastal provinces to the central
provinces, and distribution centers and direction of growth will
be more affected by north-south corridors and east-west corridors,
Huang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Tourist
Association (HKTA) opened its Visitor Information &AMP; Services
Center on Hong Kong Island Monday in a move to offer better state-
of-the-art services to tourists.
</P>
<P>
The service center, located in the downtown Central District,
covers some 3,000 square feet, compared with 700 square feet of
the former site. Internet i CyberLink is introduced to offer 24-
hour online travel information to visitors.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, HKTA Executive Director Amy

Center on Hong Kong Island is important to the HKTA's program of
enhancing visitor facilities and services in Hong Kong's major
tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
"As a marketing body, the HKTA is committed to promoting Hong
Kong abroad as the premier tourism destination in Asia, but we
also are the driving force behind providing quality assistance at
home," she said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA runs three visitor information &AMP; services centers in
Hong Kong, with the rest two at the Hong Kong International
Airport and Kowloon.
</P>

MACAO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 200,000 people have over
the past two months flocked to see the presents given to the newly-
founded Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) by China's

<HEADLINE> China Needs To Find Its Own Economic Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and overseas business
experts and executives gathering at today's China Development
Forum said that China needs to find its own path of economic
development, instead of following the models of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Seiichi Kondo, deputy secretary general of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said that China
should learn the lessons from Japan's model of building global
giant corporations which were very successful from the 1970s to
the mid 1980s, but suffered major setbacks for "overlooking the
global trend".
</P>
<P>
Mark Moody-Stuart, chairman of the Royal Dutch Shell Group,
agreed that China should not rely entirely on Japan's model or
other southeast Asian countries. Rather, China should find its own
path in promoting and developing e-commerce and its business-to-
business industries.
</P>
<P>
Li Yizhong, president of Sinopec, or China Petroleum Chemical
Industry Group, said that Sinopec has almost completed its
distribution and financial networks. "China's traditional
industries should not be pessimistic in facing the challenges of a
Web economy."
</P>
<P>
Robert Hormats, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs International,
suggested that the smaller businesses in the service and
information sectors will adapt to e-commerce technology more
easily if they can attract enough capital.
</P>
<P>
Chen Qingtai, deputy director of the Development Research
Center under the State Council, said smaller businesses constitute
a powerful engine behind China's economic growth and can help
alleviate unemployment problems by taking in laid off workers from
state-owned enterprises. Chen said that Chinese and foreign
smaller businesses will be allowed more market entry after China
enters the WTO.

<P>
YONGXING ISLAND, Xisha Archipelago, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A key
state project to collect rainwater for soldiers and people living
on Yongxing Island of the Xisha Archipelago in the South China Sea
has passed official appraisal after a half year's trial run.
</P>
<P>
With the project now in operation, gone are the days when local
people had to rely on water shipped by vessels.
</P>
<P>
For decades, the soldiers and villagers, under frequent threat
of subtropical storms and cold fronts, faced the problems of
irregular water and vegetable supplies and poor communications
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the Ministry of Water Conservancy and the
General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army launched a 65-million-yuan project to build water gathering
facility on Yongxing Island.
</P>
<P>
The project was been built on the basis of an existing
rainwater purification project.
</P>
<P>
Four water tanks, each with a capacity of 5,000 cubic meters,
now have been constructed with a total gathering and processing
capacity of 140,000 tons of water a year.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rejects MILF Call for Independence Plebiscite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government rejected
Monday a reported call by the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
to hold a plebiscite supposedly for the "independence" of
residents of Muslim Mindanao, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
suggestions to follow the mechanics of the plebiscite in East
Timor are baseless as the situation in East Timor is vastly
different from the situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the East Timorese have maintained their identity as
a different state even during those 30 years of Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
But in the case of areas in Mindanao populated by Muslims, he
said, these have always been part of the Philippine territory.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada pointed out that
unlike East Timor, which was a Portuguese colony for 23 years
before the Indonesians took over their island, Mindanao has always
been a part of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
East Timor now enjoys independence after its residents voted to
break away from Indonesian rule in August last year.
</P>
<P>
The Estrada administration is undertaking all efforts to forge
peace with the MILF in Mindanao, which the president wants
transformed into the country's next food basket and regional
economic hub.
</P>
<P>
Formal talks between the government and the MILF are scheduled
to resume on May 2 in Cotabato, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Estrada has called on the MILF to lay down their arms and work
hand in hand instead with the government in pursuing lasting peace
and development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The government forged a peace agreement in September 1996 with
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) headed by its
chairman, Nur Misuari, now governor of the Autonomous Region in
Muslim Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets 2003 as Deadline for Ending Oil Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has set
year 2003 as target date for all oil companies operating in the
country's Niger Delta region to attain zero percent discharge of
all effluents and solid waste emanating from their operation.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times, a major Nigerian newspaper, Monday quoted the
country's Minister of State for Environment Imeh Okopido as saying
on Sunday in the capital Abuja that all gas flaring, which is long
blamed to be the main reason for the environmental deterioration
in the region, will be stopped in 2003.
</P>
<P>
From the third quarter of this year, oil firms operating in the
region must start processing their operation effluents including
drill cuttings, drilling mud and sludges in its integrated waste
management centers before discharging them, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
She said that henceforth the government's attitude toward
projects, as well as the decision on granting drilling permits
would be by a large extent determined by each company's level of
environmental compliance.
</P>
<P>
Since oil was found in the 1960s, environment of the Niger
Delta has seen a quick deteriorating, which the current Obasanjo
administration had vowed to stop.

Vladimir Putin.

<P>
Gudermes Mayor Malika Gezimiyeva said at the meeting that they
had Chechen presidents Dzhokhar Dudayev and Aslan Maskhadov but

<HEADLINE> China to Crackdown on Inferior Gas Cylinders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China will to crack down on the
production and selling of poor-quality steel cylinders containing
liquefied petroleum gas used for household gas stoves.
</P>
<P>
Factories producing inferior gas cylinders that endanger people
's lives and property will be forced to shut down, said an
official with the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision today.
</P>
<P>
A recent random examination conducted by the bureau among 66
gas cylinder producers across China found that only 72.7 percent
of their products were up to national standards.
</P>
<P>
The spot check showed that 18 kinds of gas cylinders have
quality problems in their materials and volume and pressure, three
key factors that can cause explosions.
</P>
<P>
With the wide use of gas stoves in many regions of China, the
output of gas cylinders continues to increase, hitting 34 million
last year, with an annual value of 2.72 billion yuan (about 328
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, many factories produce poor-quality cylinders in order
to cut costs. In May last year, two people were seriously injured
in a gas cylinder explosion in Jinghai County of Tianjin, a port
city some 150 km from Beijing.

Scientific and Cultural Organization, is focusing on the
difficulties faced by many countries in their attempts to make
such reforms and on exploring ways for improvements.
</P>
<P>
An official with China's Ministry of Education noted that since
the 1980s, science and technology education worldwide has been
improved by combining science and humanistic characteristics and
providing a comprehensive research method.
</P>
<P>
However, many countries still need to reform their textbooks
and improve the quality of their teachers, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
All the educators agreed that teaching science and technology
at primary and secondary levels will play an important role in the
coming years.

<HEADLINE> Parliamentary Elections Began in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraqis began voting on Monday
morning to choose 220 members of the National Assembly (parliament)
from a total of 512 candidates, including President Saddam
Hussein's eldest son Uday, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
Polling booths opened at 8:00 a.m. (0430 GMT) and will close at
8:00 p.m. (1230 GMT), the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Counting of the votes will begin immediately after the voting
ends, with the results expected later Monday or early Tuesday, said
the INA.
</P>
<P>
During the day, some 9 million eligible voters will go to 1,574
polling stations to cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
"I am here to elect those who will defend us and look after us,
particularly at a time when we are suffering from hardships from
the embargo," said Saleh Nada, one of the voters, referring to the
decade-old sanctions imposed by the United Nations on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary Command
Council (RCC), stressed Sunday when meeting foreign delegations as
well as local and foreign reporters that the candidates must stand
firmly in line with the Iraqi leadership under President Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim, the No. 2 man of RCC which is headed by Saddam Hussein,
claimed that the Iraqi people's choices will be true and free.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim promised that the foreign delegations will have "full
freedom to investigate deeply and precisely at all the election
centers."
</P>
<P>
As head of the supreme disciplinary committee supervising the
elections, Ibrahim said that there will be 45,000 supervisors
nationwide to oversee the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, elections will not be held in the northern Kurds-
populated areas. The United States and its Western allies imposed
two no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq allegedly to protect
the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's persecution.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi election laws require that all parliamentary candidates
must defend the constitution and believe in the principles of the
July 17 Revolution of 1958 which established the republic.
</P>
<P>
Four parliamentary elections have been held in Iraq, with the
last one in March, 1996.

<HEADLINE> Russian Submarine Makes 2nd Launch of Ballistic Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A second ballistic missile was
launched from a nuclear-powered submarine in the Sea of Okhotsk on
Monday, Itar-Tass quoted a Russian Navy spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The missile blasted off at 1 p.m. local time and flew over 7,
000 kilometers to hit a target in Kanin Nos testing ground, Tass
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a ballistic missile was launched from a
submarine in the Barents Sea. The missile was fired from a nuclear-
propelled submarine at 10 a.m. and reached a designated area on
Kamchatka in the Far East in 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The early warning system detected the missile immediately after
the launch and timely relayed information about it to posts of the
Russian army's supreme commander and the General Staff as a
training warning signal of a missile attack.
</P>
<P>
The missile cruised 8,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency, however, reported that the second
missile was also launched from a Karelia submarine at the Barents
Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Karelia submarine (Delta-4 according to NATO classification)
was put into service in 1989. Its water displacement is 11,740/18,
200 tons and it can dive to a depth of 450 meters. It is also
equipped with 16 launchers for RSM-54 ballistic missiles. It has a
crew of 135, including 41 officers, and can navigate autonomously
for 90 days, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Hopes Early Japan-Russia Summit After Putin's Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on Monday
welcomed the victory of Russia's Acting President Vladimir Putin
in Sunday's presidential election and expressed the hope for an
early Japan-Russia summit.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the election of Acting President Putin as Russia's
next president based on the Russian people's consensus," Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also pledged to cooperate with Putin's new government to
further promote bilateral relations in all areas, particularly in
negotiations to sign a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki
expressed the hope that a Japan-Russia summit be held at an early
date after Putin secures victory in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Mr. Putin would be able to come to Japan is a matter
that should be discussed between the two governments following the
election," the top Japanese government spokesman told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's hope that the leaders of the two
countries should meet at the earliest possible date has not
changed, no matter where the summit takes place, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
A Japan-Russia summit is being planned to take place in another
Russian city instead of Moscow at some time before the Group of
Eight (G-8) nations meets in Okinawa Prefecture on July 21-23,
according to Japanese official sources.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that Obuchi and Putin will discuss agenda items
for the G-8 summit and bilateral issues such as the long-delayed
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Before the abrupt resignation of former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, Japan and Russia had been working on arranging a visit to
Japan by Yeltsin in 1999 following Obuchi's trip to Moscow in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since Putin was named as Russia's acting president, Japan has
been trying to arrange an informal bilateral summit that will take
place some time after the Russian election and before July's G-8
summit.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Navy Destroys Rebel Boats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Around 20 rebels of Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) were reportedly killed when the Sri
Lanka navy destroyed three rebel boats in the north of the country
early Monday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The navy launched a heavy attack on an LTTE flotilla which was
attempting an attack on the army at Champianpattu in the
northernmost Jaffna peninsula, said officials.
</P>
<P>
Three LTTE boats with around 20 rebels were destroyed in the
confrontation which occurred in the early hours of Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
All rebels in the boats were believed to be killed in the clash,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Lloyd's List, a leading publication of
international shipping and insurance, said in a detailed
investigative report that the LTTE has set up a new naval base at
the Thai holiday island of Phuket to transport large consignments
of weapons and drugs.
</P>
<P>
"The colossal profits helped to fund the Tiger war machine,"
said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said that most of the LTTE ships were small general cargo
ships, registered in Panama, Honduras or Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE, fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983, is reportedly to be in
possession of a naval wing known as Sea Tigers.

<HEADLINE> Another Mass Grave Found in Southwestern Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have discovered
what they feared was another mass grave behind the house of a
doomsday cult leader in southwestern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
"Local police found the grave on Sunday and they stopped
digging when they uncovered the arm of a corpse behind the house
of Dominic Kataribaabo in Bushenyi district," a police spokesman
told Xinhua on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"They are waiting for investigators and forensic experts. They
would complete the exhuming today," he added.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that they thought there were more bodies
there and the body they had discovered seemed to be buried
recently, the New Vision daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kataribaabo, one of the leaders of the Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God, was said to have sold the
house to his nephew just days before at least 530 people,
including 78 children, were burnt to death on March 17 in Kanungu
church in Rukungiri district, 320 kilometers southwest of the
capital Kampala. Bushenyi district is neighboring Rukungiri.
</P>
<P>
Kataribaabo, who obtained a master's degree in theology from a
university in California, the United States, was believed to have
been killed in the Kanungu church fire. Police said that the body
close to one door of the church was Kataribaabo.
</P>
<P>
The police found corpses of 153 members of the same cult in
three mass graves last Friday in Kashenyi village, some 60
kilometers from Kanungu. They had apparently been poisoned,
strangled or hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
According to Ugandan authorities, leaders of the cult appeared
to have systematically killed cult members for months.

<HEADLINE> COMESA to Improve Telephone Links between Member States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has launched a new company, Comtel, to
improve direct telephone links between member countries.
</P>
<P>
COMESA's 21 member states are now committed to their ambitious
dream of creating a free trade zone this year from Egypt in the
north to Angola in the south.
</P>
<P>
However, direct telephone communications does not exist between
many of the COMESA countries, which have to transit through third
countries, mainly in Europe and North America.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the member states lose up to 90 million
U.S. dollars per year in transiting telephone calls, the East
African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new company will lay down fibre optics and install
microwave transmitters, while the existing national
telecommunications systems in the member states will be upgraded.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Hopes Early Japan-Russia Summit After Putin's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary
Mikio Aoki Monday expressed the hope for an early Japan-Russia
summit after Russian Acting President Vladimir Putin secured
victory in Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Mr. Putin would be able to come to Japan is a matter
that should be discussed between the two governments following the
election," the top Japanese government spokesman told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government hopes that the leaders of the two
countries should meet at the earliest possible date and this will
not change no matter where the summit takes place, Aoki said.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Japanese government have said that a Japan-
Russia summit is scheduled to take place in a Russian city other
than Moscow, some time before the July 21-23 summit of the Group
of Eight (G-8) nations in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
At the planned Japan-Russia summit, Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and Putin are expected to discuss agenda items for
the G-8 summit and bilateral issues such as the long-delayed
Japanese-Russian peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Before the abrupt resignation of former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, Japan and Russia had been working on the arrangement of a
visit by Yeltsin in 1999 following Obuchi's trip to Moscow in
November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Since Putin was named as Russia's acting president, Japan has
been trying to arrange an informal bilateral summit, to be held
some time after the Russian presidential election and before
July's G-8 summit.
</P>
<P>
Japan has called for a visit by the newly elected Russian
president before the G-8 summit as a means of reviving the stalled
peace treaty negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Urge Taiwan's New Leader to Accept One China Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Scholars with the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences (CASS) recently urged the new leader in Taiwan
to accept the one China principle, abandon the stance on "Taiwan
independence", and start talks on peaceful reunification with the
mainland as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
At a symposium organized by the CASS, the scholars unanimously
supported the recent remarks of President Jiang Zemin and Premier
Zhu Rongji on the Taiwan issue, and the statement the Taiwan
Affairs Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China and the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council issued
after Taiwan's election.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xiaoheng, deputy secretary-general of the Academic Exchanges
Committee of the CASS, said that "peaceful reunification" and "one
country, two systems" are basic principles for the Chinese
government in dealing with the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
The one China principle is the basis and prerequisite for
peaceful reunification, Lu said, and "Taiwan independence" in
whatever form will never be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Haipeng, chief of the Institute of Modern Chinese History,
said that only when the new leader in Taiwan accepts the one China
principle can political talks and dialogue be carried out across
the Taiwan Straits, and cross-Straits relations develop smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Yin Yungong, chief of the Institute of Journalism and
Communication, appealed to Taiwan compatriots to join the people
in the mainland to safeguard the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the motherland, protect the fundamental interests of
the Chinese nation, and realize the complete reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The scholars reiterated that there is only one China in the
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory,
saying that the election in Taiwan and its result can not change
this fact.
</P>
<P>
In addition, all the participants suggested further research on
perspectives and development of cross-Straits relations.

ZHENGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Jin Xiangwu, the owner of a
video-game parlor who was convicted of murdering three primary
school children, was given the death penalty today by a local
court in the city of Luoyang in central Henan Province.

they owed, and soon left.

slaughtered the three children. Afterwards, Jin and his elder
brother Jin Xiangyu took their bodies to a mountain valley in
Yiyang County near Luoyang, and burned the corpses.

<P>
On March 5, the two brothers were arrested by local police.
</P>
<P>
At today's first judgment, the court sentenced Jin's brother to
10 years in jail for the crime of shield.

throughout in country, but many of these businesses are operating
without official approval and the necessary legal documents,
according to reports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Asked to Clarify Retirement Within Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said it
will only recognize former president Kenneth Kaunda's retirement
from active politics when he makes the announcement from within
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda announced his retirement from politics last Friday in
Cape Town, South Africa, where he was invited to address delegates
at a workshop on the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba said in an interview
here on Sunday that Kaunda should announce his withdrawal from
political stage to his United National Independence Party (UNIP),
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Zimba as saying Kaunda has in the past announced his
retirement from politics only to bounce back in no time. The
government would only be too sure if Kaunda came back home and
made his position clear to his party.
</P>
<P>
"We have heard that political statement before." But "if the
family and other people think there is truth in this, we will wait
until he comes back and makes the statement. That is when the
government will make an official statement on him," Zimba said.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said the government has all along advised Kaunda to
retire and emulate his colleagues in the region who have retired
to concentrate on peace mediation and other ways of assisting the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
He said the government, however, already recognized Kaunda as a
 retired man on the basis of being the former president.
</P>
<P>
The government has to this effect continued to give him
retirement benefits and other conditions as stipulated by the law,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 75, served as the president from Zambia's independence
in October 1964 to November 1991.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for Better Fund Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has directed the country to establish a special
committee to work on strategies to curb theft and misappropriation
of funds in cooperative unions, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony of a two-day symposium on the
future of the ailing cooperative movement in Tanzania on Saturday,
the president ordered the Attorney General, the Director of
Criminal Investigation and the Director of Prevention of
Corruption Bureau to form a special team to study all such cases
facing officials of cooperative unions.
</P>
<P>
He pledged the government's commitment to ensuring smooth
operation of the unions, saying that responsibility to run the
unions should be entrusted to serious, honest people.
</P>
<P>
At the workshop, the president was presented with a report
which indicated serious misuse of resources in eight cooperative
unions in various regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa attributed the poor performance of the cooperative unions
to lack of trustworthy managers, arguing that the ongoing economic
reforms have nothing to do with problems facing the cooperative
movement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also urged the required support to all
cooperative unions that are on the verge of collapse under the
heavy debt burden to enable their revival.
</P>
<P>
There is no way poverty could be eradicated in the country
without sound cooperative unions, the president said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Wins Presidential Vote, Vows to Work Harder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin
has become the new master of the Kremlin after winning the Russian
presidential elections on Sunday, Central Election Commission
Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov announced Monday, citing preliminary
returns.
</P>
<P>
Of 94.27 percent of the ballots counted, Putin won 52.52
percent of the vote, compared with 29.44 percent for Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. Ratings for the other nine
candidates are in single digits.
</P>
<P>
Putin averted a run-off with Zyuganov as he garnered more than
50 percent of the vote. Under Russia's electoral law, if none of
the candidates wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a run-off
between the two leading candidates will be held.
</P>
<P>
Final results of the vote will be available on April 4-6, and
Putin would be sworn in as the new president as early as May 5,
Veshnyakov said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a regular government meeting, Putin, who also serves
as prime minister, said the returns of the vote "prompt us to work
still harder and with better results," the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the members of his government for "ensuring complete
control over the situation over the past months in spite of the
pre-election battles, for not failing any problems," Tass quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after midnight Sunday, Putin told a news conference at
his campaign headquarters that his compatriots should not to
expect miracles of him.
</P>
<P>
"In my trips around the country, (I find) people are tired;
life is difficult; and they expect better things from me. But
there can be no miracles."
</P>
<P>
He said not to promise miracles is the only way to avoid
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is sit down and analyze the current
situation, he said. "Years later, the people will have an
opportunity to draw conclusions -- what was wrong, what was right.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the better-than-expected performance of Zyuganov is a
sign of dissatisfaction among ordinary Russians and the need for
their worries to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Putin indicated that he might invite some of his electoral
rivals into his government.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to talk to them in order to see whether they are
prepared to work within the framework of the program that is being
proposed by the government. If they are ready, they will find
their place."
</P>
<P>
Putin praised former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Zyuganov for their position on the question
of Chechnya, saying that they helped consolidate the nation.
</P>
<P>
Luzhkov, once considered a strong contender to the presidency
but never entered the race, welcomed Putin's victory, saying he
stands ready to cooperate with the new president.
</P>
<P>

campaign was under way, voting was also conducted in a calm and
orderly manner without any report of major disruption from rebels.
More than 800,000 Russians working or traveling abroad were also
able to participate in the elections.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents' Bank Savings Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The slow bank savings growth for
Shanghai residents which began in the second half of 1999 has been
replaced by a fast surge since the beginning of this year,
according to the People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
According to sources, bank savings in Shanghai went up 10.24
billion yuan in the first two months this year, of which 5.51
billion yuan was added via time deposits and 4.72 billion yuan via
current deposits.
</P>
<P>
The growth of bank savings was largely attributed to the
increase in per capita annual income around early February, when
the country celebrated the traditional Spring Festival -- an
occasion for family reunions.
</P>
<P>
Some local residents chose to place their savings in banks due
to the limited channels for venture investment and anticipated
expenditures, though the stock exchanges were bullish and personal
spending was active in the first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, bank savings in hard currencies also
went up by 370 million U.S. dollars in January and February as a
result of increased remittances from overseas around the Spring
Festival season, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> China Taps Potential for Coal Gas Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up coal gas
development as a major new energy resource by working out
preferential policies for loans and fee exemptions, according to
the Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
The government will not collect compensation fees for the
exploitation of coal gas resources from enterprises which are in
the initial stage of developing coal gas. Moreover, preferential
loans will be made available for key coal gas projects.
</P>
<P>
The country has given priority to the development of coal gas
to make up for a shortfall in energy supply. The increasing use of
coal gas is expected to improve the country's energy consumption
structure, reduce air pollution, and enhance safe production.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in coal gas resources, as coal fields in the
north, northeast, and south are calculated to have coal gas
deposits totaling 3.5 billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The country's major coal production areas in recent years have
developed over 50 coal gas projects, including a gas storage tank
with a capacity of 650,000 cu m, and a coal gas pipeline with a
capacity of 620,000 cu m.
</P>
<P>
Annual utilization of coal gas in China now exceeds 400 million
cu m.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China has developed complete sets of advanced coal
gas technologies, with more than 20 of them up to international
standards.

In 1997, Kazakhstan and China signed an agreement valued at 9.5
billion U.S. dollars to develop oil fields and lay oil pipeline in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries expressed the hope of implementing the
agreement as soon as possible in a joint statement on bilateral
cooperation in the 21st century issued last year.
</P>
<P>
"When the agreement is implemented, remarkable achievements
will be reached in bilateral trade ties," Sultanov said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Kazakhstan and the neighboring Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region of China accounts for about 80 percent of the
total bilateral trade. However, other parts of China, especially
the developed coastal regions, lack trade ties with the central
Asia country.
</P>
<P>
Furthering exchanges between China's coastal regions and
Kazakhstan will bring more trade opportunities for both countries,

<HEADLINE> Xinhua Commentary Calls for Further Ideological Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A Xinhua News Agency commentary
has called for the furthering education on correct ideology and
belief among members of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
In the new historic period, the CPC should continue to arm the
Party and rally the masses with the correct ideology and belief if
it is to continue to represent the advanced productive forces and
culture, and the fundamental interests of most Chinese, said the
commentary, carried in some major national newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The very reason for the CPC's victories during the past decades
lies mainly in that the Party has vigorously educated Party
members and the broad masses with the lofty ideals and historic
targets for different stages of development.
</P>
<P>
In the preliminary stage of socialist development, communism
and the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics should
be upheld as the most important ideological basis for the Party
and the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
Current education in ideology and belief should be entirely
focused on this major theme, the Xinhua commentary noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that intensifying ideological education calls for
further promoting the fighting and critical spirit of Marxism.  (

<TEXT>
<P>
It is imperative to take the initiative in the ideological
struggle and guard against all attacks of the corrupt ideologies
and concepts of values, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
At present, it is very important to strengthen the education of
materialism, atheism, and the scientific spirit of Marxism, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the decisive victory over the Falungong cult, we
should never relax our vigilance, as conditions for the existence
of idealism, theism, and all kinds of anti-science concepts will
exist in the country for a long time," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
"It is a must that we focus our efforts on the theme of the
correct ideology and belief, and further promote the education of
materialism and atheism," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stressed that education in ideology and belief
represents the core of ideological work at this time, and should
command the attention of Party organizations at all levels.
</P>
<P>
As long as the Party's basic policy is strictly implemented and
ideological education effectively carried out, a healthy social
atmosphere of opposing superstition and fallacies will eventually
come into being throughout the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
This will help to rally the entire Party and people around the
CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, and
further push forward the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the commentary concluded.

<HEADLINE> Basic Scientific Research Requires Creativity: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China's basic scientific research
in the coming decade will stress creativity, said Li Xueyong, vice-
minister of science and technology, here today.
</P>
<P>
The goal of basic scientific research in the next ten years is
to improve the country's overall creativity and nurture high-
quality personnel in basic research, said Li at today's opening
ceremony of a national conference on basic scientific research.
</P>
<P>
He said that after five to ten years of effort, China is
expected to achieve breakthroughs in some fields of basic
scientific research, and help establish a scientific system with a
creative spirit.
</P>
<P>
Li asked scientists to take note of the fields of agriculture,
energy, information, environment, population and health, and
materials, and provide the scientific basis for solving problems
relating to these areas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Ministry of Science and Technology said
that China spent 4.9 billion yuan in basic scientific research in
1999, an annual increase of over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, the country has set up 157 key national
laboratories and many key departmental labs.
</P>
<P>
Although China's overall scientific strength is in a leading
position among developing countries, only 5 percent of its basic
scientific research can compete with the world's advanced
countries, because of problems including the lack of creativity
and insufficient funding.
</P>
<P>
The conference will close on March 29.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh on Sunday flatly
denied a report in The Sunday Times of London that Israel plans to
lay nuclear mines on the Golan Heights to prevent a Syrian attack
after it withdraws.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, any Syrian invasion of Israel would
trigger an explosion of the neutron land mines, which would emit an
intense burst of shock waves and radiation, penetrating tanks and
killing the soldiers inside.
</P>
<P>
Some military sources said that although the Israeli government
will not acknowledge it, portable and low-yield neutron bombs have
been perfected over the past two decades at a factory in the west
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday called on his One Israel
coalition's Knesset (Parliament) members Amir Peretz and Haim Katz
to postpone the vote on their minimum wage bill, which is scheduled
for its first reading in the Knesset Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed legislation would raise the minimum wage in Israel
to the shekel equivalent of 1000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Barak issued a statement saying that "bring the minimum wage
bill to a vote in the Knesset, without a thorough investigation of
its implications, is liable to actually harm the minimum wage
recipients the bill's sponsors wish to assist."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad failed in three hours of talks Sunday to reach an agreement
to restart peace talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to early predictions that the summit would lead to a
breakthrough, they had nothing to announce at the end of their
talks. U.S. special Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is to travel to
Jerusalem Monday to brief Barak on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear what was the sticking point of the discussions
and few details were divulged about their substance. But one U.S.
official said al-Assad had not been "very receptive" to Clinton's
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
The American president reportedly presented Barak's idea about a
withdrawal from the Golan Heights to modified June 4, 1967 lines -
which would not include a withdrawal from Lake Kineret, or Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak's government is facing the onslaught of five separate
non-confidence votes Monday in the Knesset. However, even if some
parties in the ruling coalition backs the motions and votes against
Barak, chances are slim that the 61 votes necessary to topple the
government will be assembled.
</P>
<P>
Motions by the opposition Likud and Herut are attacking the
government of not being firm enough in its negotiations with the
Palestinians, while the National Union and the Arab parties blame
the government of failing in socioeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Shinui is dissatisfied with the government's stance on
ultra-orthodox men's recruitment into the Israel Defense Forces.

New Zealand Economic Development Ministry estimates that 42.8
percent of the country's households will have a personal computer
by the end of this month, up from a confirmed figure of 32.9

<HEADLINE> Putin Wins Russian Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin
has become the new master of the Kremlin after winning Sunday's
Russian presidential elections , Central Election Commission
Chairman Alexander Veshnyakov announced Monday, citing preliminary
returns.
</P>
<P>
Of 94.27 percent of the ballots counted, Putin won 52.52
percent of the vote, compared with 29.44 percent for Communist
Party leader Gennady Zyuganov. Ratings for the other nine
candidates are in single digits.
</P>
<P>
Putin averted a run-off with Zyuganov as he garnered more than
50 percent of the vote. Under Russia's electoral law, if none of
the candidates wins more than 50 percent of the vote, a run-off
between the two leading candidates will be held.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference held at his campaign headquarters shortly
after midnight Sunday, Putin told his compatriots not to expect
miracles of him.
</P>
<P>
"In my trips around the country, (I find) people are tired;
life is difficult; and they expect better things from me. But
there can be no miracles."
</P>
<P>
He said not to promise miracles is the only way to avoid
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is sit down and analyze the current
situation, he said. "Years later, the people will have an
opportunity to draw conclusions -- what was wrong, what was right.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the better-than-expected performance of Zyuganov is a
sign of dissatisfaction among ordinary Russians and the need for
their worries to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Putin indicated that he might invite some of his electoral
rivals into his government if the final vote count proves that he
has won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to talk to them in order to see whether they are
prepared to work within the framework of the program that is being
proposed by the government. If they are ready, they will find
their place."
</P>
<P>
Putin praised former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Zyuganov for their position on the question
of Chechnya, saying that they helped consolidate the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said if he wins in the first round, he will immediately
undertake to form a new cabinet and consult the State Duma (lower
house of parliament) on the appointment of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who was promoted to the premiership in August last year
from a virtually political unknown, automatically became acting
president following Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation on
December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
More than 68 percent of the country's 107.9 million registered
voters went to the polls on Sunday to choose from 11 candidates a
new head of state.
</P>
<P>
Voting in the largest country in the world was calm and
peaceful with virtually no reports of noticeable glitches, the
Central Election Commission said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
No significant irregularities had been reported that would cast
doubt on the outcome of the elections, CEC Chairman Alexander
Veshnyakov told the ORT television.
</P>
<P>
In the breakaway republic of Chechnya where an anti-terrorist
campaign was under way, voting was also conducted in a calm and
orderly manner without any report of disruption from rebels. More
than 800,000 Russians working or traveling abroad were also able
to participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 international observers from various countries and
international organizations were deployed across the country but
Chechnya to monitor the voting process. Representatives from
international bodies like the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe expressed their
satisfaction with the conduction of the elections.
</P>
<P>
Putin is most probably inaugurated on May 5, one month after
the CEC officially announces the final outcome of the elections.
Putin will be mandated for a four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Putin Promises No Miracles for Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting President Vladimir
Putin, who is seen marching toward victory in Sunday's
presidential elections, told his compatriots not to expect
miracles of him.
</P>
<P>
"In my trips around the country, people are tired; life is
difficult; and they expect better things from me. But there can be
no miracles," a calm and relaxed Putin told reporters at his
campaign headquarters early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said not to promise miracles is the only way to avoid
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is sit down and analyze the current
situation, he said. "Years later, the people will have an
opportunity to draw conclusions -- what was wrong, what was right.
"
</P>
<P>
Putin said there is no difference as to whether he would win in
the first round or second round. "First round (victory) gives us
more responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for 3 a.m. Monday (2300 GMT Sunday) when 58.81 percent of
the ballots had been counted, Putin garnered 50. 67 percent of the
vote, compared with 30.51 percent for Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the better-than-expected performance of Zyuganov is
a sign of dissatisfaction among ordinary Russians and the need
for their worries to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
"I want to point out the Communists achieved that level even
though -- let us be direct and honest about this -- they did not
have that many opportunities in the media, especially electronic
media."
</P>
<P>
Putin indicated that he might invite some of his electoral
rivals into his government if the final vote count proves that he
has won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to talk to them in order to see whether they are
prepared to work within the framework of the program that is being
proposed by the government. If they are ready, they will find
their place."
</P>
<P>
Putin praised the position on the question of Chechnya of
former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov
and Zyuganov, saying that they helped unify the nation on the war
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
These politicians had been aware that the war was serving
increasing his popularity but "they haven't let themselves slide
into anti-national positions," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would do tomorrow, Putin said Monday would be
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
"A vacuum of authority or management should not be allowed for
a second. The Cabinet should work as usual."
</P>
<P>
He said if he wins in the first round, he will immediately
undertake to form a new Cabinet and consult the State Duma on the
appointment of the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Putin Wins Race, Daunting Tasks Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Putin's victory in the
Russian presidential vote Sunday has long been seen as foregone,
and preliminary results released Monday dispelled the only
suspense in the race.
</P>
<P>
With 94.27 percent of the ballots counted, Putin netted 52.52
percent, above the 50 percent needed for an outright win. He will
not have to face Communist party leader Gennady Zyuganov in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov picked up 29.44 percent, followed by liberal Yabloko
leader Grigory Yavlinsky with 5.85 percent, according to the
Central Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
By far the most popular politician in post-Soviet Russia, Putin
rose from relative obscurity to a mounting approval rating thanks
to his forceful military actions against Chechen rebels, his
incorruptible tough-guy image and a no-nonsense style.
</P>
<P>
At 47, he is young and energetic, a far cry from his
predecessor, former President Boris Yeltsin, who was dogged by
poor health and waning authority.
</P>
<P>
When he took over last August as the country's fifth prime
minister in about 18 months, Chechen rebels were staging armed
incursions into neighboring Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
A series of deadly apartment bombings ensued and over 300
people were killed in Moscow and two other cities in the blasts,
which were blamed on Chechen militants.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops moved into the breakaway republic of Chechnya in
September amid broad support in the society.
</P>
<P>
The military campaign has now entered the final stage, with
much of Chechnya under federal control and most of the remaining
rebels driven into southern mountains. Despite major casualties on
the part of the federal forces, the offensive remains vastly
popular.
</P>
<P>
On the political front, the Unity movement Putin helped set up
made a strong showing in the December 19 parliamentary elections,
defeating the Fatherland-All Russia bloc of former prime minister
Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov to third place in
the State Duma lower house.
</P>
<P>
The Communist party continued to command the most seats in the
new Duma, but far less than in the previous one that had enabled
it to frequently frustrate the Kremlin's hands.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Putin's victory as a presidential candidate was
sealed with Unity's strong performance in the parliamentary
balloting.
</P>
<P>
Heeding Putin's popularity and the emergence of a more
conciliatory parliament, Yeltsin announced his abrupt resignation
on New Year's Eve, six months before the expiry of his term,
leading to an abbreviated election campaign that further favored
Putin, now the acting head of state.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who had announced his presidential bid before the
December vote, left the Kremlin race, and Luzhkov, also a strong
contender for the presidency, never entered.
</P>
<P>
This left Zyuganov the only other major competitor who could,
at best, only drag Putin into a second round.
</P>
<P>
The economy also fared well under Putin. Blessed by higher
world oil prices and a devaluated ruble, the Russian economy
bottomed out and posted a 3.2 percent growth last year in its
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reported its foreign reserves, a vital
indicator of Russia's financial well-being, had risen to 15
billion U.S. dollars in the week to March 17, the highest since
the August 1998 financial crash that drained national coffers.
</P>
<P>
Putin's victory can also be attributed to Russians' longing for
someone who could lift the country out of the chaos and
unpredictability they apparently have had enough in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, Putin has kept a "constructive
ambiguity" about his policy orientations, a tactic that attracted
many supporters across the Russian political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
Putin vowed to proceed with market reforms, to sustain
democracy, and to revive Russia without resorting to further "
experiments," "radicalism" or calls to "revolutionary extremism."
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to institute a "dictatorship of law" and a
streamlined and corruption-free bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Whatever his path, Putin will have his hands full.
</P>
<P>
First, he will form a new cabinet, but that task is made easier
with a more cooperative State Duma.
</P>
<P>
In Chechnya, despite their victories, the federal forces still
face fierce resistance in the remaining pockets under rebel
control. The Chechen fighters have also undertaken guerrilla
warfare in the areas under federal control. And to restore the
province's economy would take even longer than returning peace
there.
</P>
<P>
With an official toll of about 2,000 among federal troops,
Putin will have to consider his moves to keep public support or
wind up the operation fast.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the favorable indicators, Russia still has a long
way to go before recovering from its economic shambles that is
beset by a mountain of debts.
</P>
<P>
Putin is well aware of the challenges.
</P>
<P>
In an article published shortly before becoming acting head of
state, he said even if Russia's per capita gross domestic product
were to rise by an annual 8 percent for the next 15 years, the
nation would still only reach the level of present-day Portugal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the devaluated ruble's effect in boosting export
and helping domestic producers is almost spent while prices of oil,
Russia's top foreign exchange earner, face mounting pressure to
move down on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Above all, Putin would have to live up to the high expectations
of his countrymen. However, Putin told his first news conference
after the Sunday vote that "no one should expect miracles."
</P>
<P>
And for the outside world, people have to measure Putin with an
even longer-term view.
</P>
<P>
There has been suggestion of a seven-year presidential term,
which could mean a total of 11 years in the Kremlin if Putin is
reelected four years later. Putin said he was only thinking about
this idea, but his aides are reportedly talking about it as a done
deal.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Fees-to-Taxes Reform In Rural Areas (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two years ago, farmers in
eastern Anhui Province took the lead in adopting a contract
responsibility system in China's vast rural areas, marking the
beginning of the nation's vigorous reform program.
</P>
<P>
Today, they are poised to take on another important reform --
turning fees to taxes -- a move viewed by experts as "the second
revolution" in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The government has chosen Anhui as a pilot zone for carrying
out the fees-to-taxes reform this year, which is aimed at reducing
excessive burdens on farmers, rationalizing distribution, and
encouraging farmers' reinvestment enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
According to the central government plan, the reform will first
be carried out in Anhui, then extended nationwide in 2001, and
completed by 2002.
</P>
<P>
During the first couple of years following the implementation
of the contract responsibility system, Chinese farmers just turned
in grain quotas set by the state in accordance with the land area
they had contracted, without other burdens.
</P>
<P>
However, beginning from the mid-1980s, some township and
village authorities started to levy various fees for the
construction of roads and the development of education. Meanwhile,
due to financial shortages, some grassroots authorities also
collected numerous charges from farmers in the name of developing
welfare projects.
</P>
<P>
Excessive burdens on farmers have caused many conflicts between
farmers and village leaders and have become a major social problem
in the country's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Rural Economic Development Department
under the Development Research Center of the State Council,
pointed out that the fees-to-taxes reform will abolish various
fees collected by township and village authorities, and at the
same time raise the agriculture taxation rate collected by the
governments at higher levels in order to stop township and village
authorities from charging farmers directly.
</P>
<P>
During the Third Session of the Ninth National People's
Congress held in Beijing earlier this month, Premier Zhu Rongji
stressed that China must lighten the burdens on farmers by all
means, adding that under the current situation in which farmers
shoulder heavy burdens, lightening these burdens means increasing
the income of farmers.

<HEADLINE> Book on Inscription on Ancient City Wall Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nanjing Publishing House has
published a book entitled "Illustrations and Commentary on the
Ming Wall in Nanjing".
</P>
<P>
The 14-21 meter high wall in Nanjing, the capital of east China
's Jiangsu Province, is approximately 33.67 km long, longer than
the city walls of Beijing and Paris. The book includes
illustrations of ancient walls and inscriptions on 249 engraved
bricks.
</P>
<P>
The oldest part of the City Wall of Nanjing was first built
during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States Period (c. 770-207
B.C). Much of the preserved wall today was rebuilt during the Ming
Dynasty (1368-1644).
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the book is valuable to the study of culture,
customs as well as political, economic and social conditions in
the Ming Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Fees-to-Taxes Reform In Rural Areas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taihe County in Anhui Province was the first in China to
introduce fees-to-taxes reform in 1994 on a trial basis, when all
fees imposed on farmers were abolished, and according to
regulations the local farmers only needed to turn in 50 kilograms
of grain per mu (0.066 hectares) per annum.
</P>
<P>
This method not only reduced the burdens on local farmers, but
also eased the contradictions between farmers and village heads
caused by excessive charges.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 and 1999, Anhui Province chose five more counties as
pilot zones for introducing fees-to-taxes reform, which
drastically lightened the burdens on farmers and won great
popularity among them.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Chunpei, 47, a farmer of Tuanjie Village in the province's
Wangjiang County, gave an account of his story. In 1998, his five-
member family was charged over 653.16 yuan (about 78 U.S. dollars)
in the form of various fees. In 1999, when Wangjiang County
implemented the fees-to-taxes reform, Zhou only turned in 479 yuan
in agriculture tax and other expenditures.
</P>
<P>
He said enthusiastically, "Obviously, burdens have been
lightened. But I hope that the reform be further deepened, so that
I can shoulder even fewer burdens."
</P>
<P>
Anhui Province has worked out a series of measures to promote
this reform across the province, which include:
</P>
<P>
-- abolishing all administrative fees, including funds raised
for rural education and all fees collected by township authorities,
including money collected for road construction, while funds for
rural education and expenditures for other welfare undertakings
will be arranged by government finance;
</P>
<P>
-- rationally adjusting current policies on collecting
agriculture fees; and
</P>
<P>
-- raising the transparency of the management of village
affairs and handling village affairs by soliciting opinions from
all villagers.
</P>
<P>
All these measures will become effective provincewide in April.

<HEADLINE> Icy Floods Pass Smoothly Through East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The last section of the frozen
Yellow River in east China's Shandong Province has thawed and the
icy floods have passed smoothly through the province into the
Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the provincial Yellow River Affairs Bureau said
the frozen river began to thaw in the middle of this month when
water temperature rose due to the increasing water flow from the
upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
As much as 306 kilometers of the river in Shandong Province was
frozen due to the very low temperature this year, with the
thickest ice reaching 20 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
However, the ice run did not cause any damage because of the
continual discharging of water from the upper reaches of the river,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The section of the Yellow River in Shandong Province is 627
kilometers long and freezes every year from December until the
following March.
</P>
<P>
The 5,400-km-long Yellow River, the second longest in China,
originates in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in northwest China, runs
through nine provinces and autonomous regions, and flows into the
Bohai Sea in east China.

<HEADLINE> China's Coal Sector Aims at Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to expand coal
exports and cut coal production this year in a bid to ease the
country's large domestic stockpile and achieve a balance between
coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
China reduced its coal output to 1.1 billion tons last year by
cutting 250 million tons of coal production, according to a source
at the Administration of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
This year, the country will force a large number of small coal
mines to close down or cut production, and see that large coal
mines reduce coal stockpiles and produce less.
</P>
<P>
The administration source said that expanding coal exports is
of great significance for the sustainable development of the
country's coal industry, and can help reduce coal stockpiles and
achieve a balance between coal supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the expansion of coal exports will make the country'
s coal sector more open to the rest of the world, and help turn
the sector from one that is extensive to one that is intensive in
terms of management and operation.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's largest coal producer, turning out one-
third of the world's total output. However, the country exported
only 34 million tons of coal last year, accounting for merely six
percent of the world's total coal trade.
</P>
<P>
China is set to tap the huge potential for coal exports, and
plans to export 38 million tons this year, said the administration
source.

The move is aimed at making postal service between the inland
areas and the Hong Kong and Macao regions more convenient, which
may help promote cultural exchanges across the Straits, according
to a SPB release.
</P>
<P>
While lowering costs, the SPB also plans to classify postage
for express mail into three categories with different charges,
namely, from Shenzhen to Hong Kong, from Zhuhai to Macao and from
other areas of Guangdong Province to Hong Kong and Macao, and from
other inland provinces to the two special administrative regions.
</P>
<P>
The costs of some postal services between inland areas and the
Hong Kong and Macao regions were readjusted last March.

YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a grand military parade here to mark the day,

Force, the Fire Brigade and the Red Cross, Than Shwe, who is also
chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and
prime minister, said the four objectives have been laid down to
enable the armed forces to serve the interest of the people in
accordance with the requirements of the country and the historical
need.
</P>

The four objectives include the promotion and propagation of
the union spirit and the building of a peaceful, tranquil, modern
and developed nation.
</P>
<P>
He called for the implementation of these objectives in order
to make the armed forces strong, capable and modern for the nation

On internal anti-government armed groups, he said 17 such
organizations and many smaller groups have come into the legal
fold and are working together with the government for regional
development.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that some other armed groups, which still remain in
the jungles, will respond to the government's reconsolidation call
and will soon follow suit.

<HEADLINE> PROFILE: Vladimir Putin: President With A Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Vladimir Putin's victory in
Sunday's race toward the Kremlin has long been seen as something
foregone.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary results released Monday by the Central
Election Commission, the acting president netted 52.52 percent of
the 94.27 percent votes counted, far ahead of Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov, who picked up mere 29.44 percent in
Sunday's balloting.
</P>
<P>
Born on October 7, 1952, in Leningrad, now St. Petersburg,
Putin was the only child of a factory foreman and his wife who
were both reportedly decorated war veterans.
</P>
<P>
Putin was enrolled in martial arts classes by his parents. By
16, he was a top-ranking expert at sambo, a Russian combination of
judo and wrestling dating from the 1930s. He was Leningrad's judo
champion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Putin received pre-college education at School 281, an elite
college-preparatory institution where only students with near-
perfect grades could get in.
</P>
<P>
When he finished his studies as a law student at Leningrad
State University, Putin was approached by a professional recruiter
for the KGB. Shortly after, he started a 16-year career with the
intelligence establishment. Putin was the only one picked up by
the KGB of the 100 or more students in the 1975 class of the
Leningrad law school.
</P>
<P>
Besides the law degree, Putin also has a doctorate in economics
from Russia's oldest technical university. He speaks some English
and such impressive German that he can imitate dialects.
</P>
<P>
Putin returned to Leningrad from Germany in the early 1990s and
took up work in the international affairs department at his alma
mater. He later became a first deputy governor of Leningrad under
his mentor, Anatoly Sobchak, taking charge of all foreign trade
and business in the second largest Russian city.
</P>
<P>
He was praised as "one of the most honest and decent people in
the St. Petersburg government" and credited for significant
foreign investment projects there in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, when Sobchak lost his political campaign, Putin
resigned from the city government and later moved to Moscow to
work in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, he was appointed head of the Federal Security
Service, the main successor to the KGB. In March 1999 his duties
were expanded to include running the Kremlin Security Council, a
top advisory body that includes ministers of the so-called power
ministries.
</P>
<P>
Five months later, he was hand-picked by then President Boris
Yeltsin to become the country's fifth prime minister in about 18
months. Few had expected him to stay in that post long, but so he
did, and became acting president after Yeltsin's abrupt
resignation on December 31 last year.
</P>
<P>
When he started work in the White House, seat of the Russian
government, Chechen rebels were staging armed incursions into
neighboring Daghestan in southern Russia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily newspaper Kommersant, Putin said
he again felt the call of patriotic duty as he did when he joined
the KGB.
</P>
<P>
"I made a decision for myself: my career is very likely to end
here, but my mission, my historic mission -- sounds high-flown,
but that is true -- is to resolve the situation in the Northern
Caucasus," he said.
</P>
<P>
Following a series of apartment bombings that killed some 300
people in Moscow and two other cities, also blamed on Chechen
militants, Russian federal troops marched into the breakaway
republic in September.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces are now in control of much of Chechnya and
the remaining pockets of die-hard rebels were driven into the
southern mountains and isolated villages.
</P>
<P>
Putin's tough-guy image and forceful, no-nonsense style, as
displayed in handling Chechnya, won him mounting support among
Russians who are frustrated by the chaos and the woes accumulated
over the years since the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Many pin their hopes on the young and energetic Putin to lift
Russia from the ashes, rejuvenate the largest country on earth,
and restore the national pride.
</P>
<P>
In an article published on a Kremlin web site shortly before
becoming head of state, Putin said he was determined to proceed
with market reforms, to sustain democracy, and to revive Russia
without resorting to further "experiments," "radicalism" or calls
to "revolutionary extremism."
</P>
<P>
Putin seems well aware of the challenges ahead for him to
fulfill his mission of regaining the greatness of Russia. Even if
Russia's per capita gross domestic product (GDP) were to rise by 8
percent per year for the next 15 years, he wrote, the nation would
still only reach the level of present-day Portugal.
</P>
<P>
But he also has better chances in achieving his vision: the new
State Duma is more conciliatory than the previous one and the
economy, blessed by rising world oil prices and the devaluation of
the ruble, has bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
Russia's GDP last year went up by 3.2 percent with industrial
and agricultural output growing 8.1 percent and 2.4 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank reported its foreign reserves, a vital
indicator of Russia's financial well-being, had risen to 15
billion U.S. dollars in the week to March 17, the highest since
the August 1998 financial crash that drained national coffers.
</P>
<P>
By and large, the Russians are bracing for a stronger state
under Putin who advocates "dictatorship of law" and a streamlined
and corruption-free bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
Putin is married, with two teenage daughters. He does not smoke,
rarely drinks, and regularly works 16 to 17 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
By listing Charles de Gaulle of France as one of his heroes
that pulled their countries out of chaos and catastrophe, Putin
apparently wants to go down in history as someone who would
achieve a similar mission in reviving Russia.

<HEADLINE> Phnom Penh City Sees Lower Crime Rate in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Serious crimes fell by more
than 15 percent in 1999 in Phnom Penh, capital city of Cambodia,
according to the municipal police annual report.
</P>
<P>
A total of 860 serious crimes such as murders, assaults and
kidnappings took place in the capital, down 15.8 percent from 1,
021 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
And the downward trend is continuing in 2000. According to
chief of the municipal police Suon Chheng Ly, kidnappings have
fallen from two or three a month last year to only two so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the reduction to the government's greater
effort to crack down on crime and to improve public order in the
city and Prime Minister Hun Sen's demand that police do a better
job in catching criminals.
</P>
<P>
So far, the municipal police have arrested 1,211 offenders in
connection with serious crimes.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Grant Vietnamese Refugees Citizenship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will bring an
end to the issue of Vietnamese refugees in the country with the
grant of Thai citizenship to their second and third generations by
the end of this year, The Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government's move will be in tandem with the termination of
its security policy on Vietnamese refugees in Thailand, initiated
by the Thai National Security Council in 1992 in order to ease
their integration into Thai society.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese refugees will be dealt with under Thai law by
authorities for alien affairs, while their offspring who are
granted Thai nationality will be subject to Thai law.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures, there are 31,625 Vietnamese
refugees in Thailand, comprising 6,399 of the first generation and
25,226 of the second and third generations.
</P>
<P>
"This is the last chapter in the history of the Vietnamese
refugees in Thailand, which started when a group of Vietnamese
fled the fighting between Vietnamese nationalists and France to
our kingdom in 1947," Kajadpai Burutpatana, secretary-general of
National Security Council, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that by the end of this year all the second- and third-
generation Vietnamese will be granted citizenship.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has followed a more lenient policy toward the
Vietnamese refugees with less restrictive conditions and shortened
screening procedures since 1992, when the governments of the two
countries agreed to bury the hate of the Vietnam War rivalry.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless officials involved in the reviewing process
admitted that some technical aspects and lingering mutual mistrust
between Thai authorities and the Vietnamese refugees had slowed
down the nationalization procedure.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended Thai National Law of 1992, a Vietnamese born
to a Thai father or mother is eligible for Thai nationality. Those
whose parents are aliens can be granted nationality upon special
consideration by the interior minister.
</P>
<P>
The 1947 generation, however, was not entitled to Thai
citizenship but issued aliens certificates to allow them to live
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Under a recent agreement between Bangkok and Hanoi, this group
is allowed to visit Vietnam on either special passports issued by
the Vietnamese government or travel documents issued by the Thai
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese communities are spread across 13 northeastern
provinces in Thailand, where they are permitted to live and work.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Offer Free Secondary Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Public secondary schools across
Thailand will begin offering free education from grade one to
grade four this year, The Nation newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 3 million secondary school students in the country will
enjoy their constitutional right to receive free education from
the government for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Department of General Education will instead provide these
secondary school schools with a subsidy of 750 baht (20 U.S.
dollars) per year for each grade one to grade three student.
</P>
<P>
Each grade four student will get 1,400 baht (37.3 dollars) per
year.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 constitution of Thailand guarantees all children in
the country 12 years of free fundamental state education, six
years in primary school and six in secondary school. Primary
education is compulsory for all Thai children over seven.
</P>
<P>
The department presumes that it will be able to provide free
education to all secondary school students in its public schools
by 2003,the report said.
</P>
<P>
In order to prepare the secondary schools for the 2003
provision, the department has instructed all administrators to
start offering free education to their students from grade one to
grade four in May.
</P>
<P>
Parents and guardians, however, will still have to pay for
their children's books and study materials.
</P>
<P>
The department plans to allocate about 2 billion baht (53.3
million dollars) to subsidize the services.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Urges Better Protection for non-Albanian Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations top refugee
official said Sunday that the security situation in Kosovo is grim,
urging actions to better protect non-Albanian residents in the
ethnically-troubled Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for the Refugees (UNHCR)
Sadako Ogata made the comment at a press conference in Pristina,
capital of Kosovo, right before she ended her three-day visit to
Kosovo, Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
She said whether the tens of thousands of non-Albanian Kosovar
refugees could return home and whether the continuous exodus of
minority refugees could be stopped hinged on the security
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The current security situation in the province is grave,
especially for the Serbs and other non-Albanian minorities, Ogata
said, citing the recent violent conflict in Kosovska Mitrovica as
an example.
</P>
<P>
Last month ethnic Albanian terrorists repeatedly attacked Serb
residents in Kosovska Mitrovica and clashed with French
peacekeepers stationed there, killing at least a dozen people and
injuring many others.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said she does not believe security in Kosovo is stable
and does not want to blame the international peacekeeping troops
for that either, but the ultimate fact is that many residents are
fleeing the province.
</P>
<P>
According to Yugoslav official statistics, since the deployment
last June of the NATO-led multi-national peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo following the western military bloc's 78-day bombing on
Yugoslavia, a total of 4,354 violent cases have occurred in Kosovo,
leaving 933 innocent residents killed and 860 kidnapped. Some 360,
000 non-Albanian refugees have since fled their homeland and more
than 50,000 houses have been burnt and destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Archaeological Discovery Dates China's Ceramics to 10,000 Years Ago (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The archeologists disclosed that more than 6,000 New Stone Age
sites have been unearthed in China, but most of them belong to the
middle or late periods of the New Stone Age, and they are mainly
found in south China.
</P>
<P>
They said the Cishan Culture ruins discovered in the 1980s at
the eastern foot of Mount Taihang in north China's Hebei Province
date back 8,000 years, but the Nanzhuangtou site is more than 2,
000 years earlier than the Cishan Culture ruins.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out that the Nanzhuangtou Site provides
important data for analyzing climatic environment changes during
the Holocene epoch in north China.
</P>
<P>
This historical site can be regarded as belonging to the
juncture between two geological periods -- the later Pleistocene
and Holocene epochs -- and thus it is of significant geological
value, experts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists excavating
a graveyard of over 180 years old in Shenzhen said that their
findings suggest the southern China city was then what it is today,
a bustling economic center, according today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper said that the excavation will be

finished in the next dozen days or so.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 tombs unearthed here may offer significant clues for
studying the development of politics, economy and culture in the
city, which neighbors Hong Kong, said members of the archeological
team from the city's relic administration committee.
</P>
<P>
A report earlier this month said the tombs were unusual because
of its long history. It has been so far the first of such find in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were built from the Jin Dynasty (265-420) to Qing
Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Archeologists here said generations of people chose the Tiezai
Hill, which is located in Bao'an District to the west of the city,
to bury themselves, because they believe it to have a good "
Fengshui", or geomantic omens.
</P>
<P>
In the group's oldest tomb, bricks were decoratively inscribed
with the words "the third year under the reign of the Daxing
Emperor". The experts explained that this inscription refers to
the year 319, when the Eastern Jin Dynasty ruled China.
</P>
<P>
The tombs were found during construction of a freeway, which
represents a sign of the fast urbanization development in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zengde, a member with the archeological team, suggests the
municipal government set up a museum to preserve the findings.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Xi'an Planning Projects to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, capital of northwest China
's Shaanxi Province, is developing a 30-year plan to conserve the
city's water supply.
</P>
<P>
The plan involves 26 projects. A total of 8.2 billion yuan (987
million U.S. dollars) will be spent on the projects, which are
slated to begin in 2001 and on through 2030, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an Mayor Feng Xuchu said that when the projects are
completed, the city's urban water supply and rural irrigation
condition will be much better, and the environment of the city
will also be greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, known for its Qin Dynasty terracotta warriors and horses,
has suffered from a water shortage for years. The city suffered a
drought in 1996 that left one-third of its residents without water.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that the total recoverable reserves of
underground water in Xi'an is only 1.55 billion cubic meters.
However, the city needs 1.77 billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the local government began to address the situation,
obtaining water from the Heihe River.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, local residents began to use water brought in by the
Heihe river project.
</P>
<P>
With western China poised to undergo rapid development pushed
by the central government, that will mean more industries and more
talented people will be coming to Xi'an, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
The city needs to be fully prepared for this, Feng added.
</P>
<P>
The 26 projects include construction of urban water supplies,
reservoirs, water-saving irrigation works, water and soil
conservation and river realignment, Feng said.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- North Carolina defeated Tulsa
59-55 in Sunday's South Region final, completing the most
improbable of its record 15 runs to the Final Four, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Freshman Joseph Forte led the eighth-seeded North Carolina (22-
13) with a season-high 28 points in the final held in Austin,
Texas, including six during a key 10-0 run. He sealed the victory
by making the second of two free throws with 4.1 seconds to end.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina snapped a tie with UCLA for the most Final Four
appearances by one school in the NCAA men's college basketball
tournament and will play the East Region winner -- Oklahoma State
or Florida -- in Saturday's semifinals at the RCA Dome in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>

coach Bill Guthridge, who is headed to his second Final Four, was
quoted as saying. "They did a tremendous job. We beat a very good
Tulsa team."
</P>
<P>
The Tar Heels, who did not have a four-game winning streak all

By clinching their sixth Final Four berth since 1991, the Tar
Heels denied Tulsa its first trip to the sport's showcase event.
They have reached the Final Four seven times since 1979, but each

Five times they were seeded first and twice they were the
second seed when they reached the Final Four.

BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Two tombs dating back to the
Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.) have been found by Chinese
archaeologists recently.
</P>
<P>
The tombs are close to a previously discovered tomb which is
believed to belong to one of the 12 kings of Yan, the ancient name
of the Hebei and Beijing area. during the Western Han Dynasty (206
B.C.- 24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the two tombs are located some ten
kilometers from the center of Beijing and seem less important than
the larger one of the Western Han Dynasty, which was found some
weeks ago and called by some archaeologists "one of the most
significant archaeological discoveries in Beijing in the past half
century."
</P>
<P>
However, the two new tombs, though small ones, might be helpful
for the experts to decide more details of the larger tomb, said
Wang Wuyu, deputy director of the Beijing Culture and Heritage
Preservation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that the smaller tombs have not been excavated

<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 27 (Xinhua)-- North China's Shanxi Province, a
major coal producer, will lay off 10,000 coal miners this year as
part of a strategy to curb losses.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial coal department said that the
laid-off workers will find employment in massive highway
construction projects, which are receiving an unprecedented amount
of investment.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coal mines will also engage in high-tech
agricultural projects on their wasteland to absorb the surplus
workers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that three fifths of the laid-off miners since
1998 have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi produces one-fourth of the country's coal, and the
number of coal workers there account for one-seventh of the
country's total. However, due to mounting losses, coal mines have
been cutting the size of their staffs since 1998.

</P>
<P>
Chen Ruixian, deputy mayor of Nanning, explained that banning
coal is part of a campaign to reduce acid rain within the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
Nanning suffers from acid rain pollution caused by the burning
of high-sulphur coal produced in the region. Roads and buildings
have been seriously affected by acid rain. Nanning has been
designated by the central government as a major acid rain city.
</P>
<P>
Leading Coal Producer Prioritizes Environmental Protection
</P>
<P>
Coal-rich Shanxi Province in north China has been prioritizing
environmental protection in its development agenda and has seen
its intensified efforts in that regard pay off.
</P>
<P>
The massive restoration program which was launched in the late
1980s with an aim to transforming areas around the coal mines into
arable fields has reclaimed 180,000 ha of such land since then.
</P>
<P>
Damages on environment in the mine areas were also eased as the
province spared no efforts to restore these areas through growing
various species of green plants.
</P>
<P>
The rare species of animals and plants in the province are also
being better protected today with the establishment of seven
nature reserves in the 1990s, in addition to the four such
reserves built in the past.
</P>
<P>
East China Coastal City Sees Blowing Dust
</P>
<P>
People in the coastal city of Qingdao in east China's Shandong
Province usually live under a blue sky, but beginning on March 23
morning they have witnessed an immense amount of dust blowing
through their town.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists said the dust was brought on by strong cold air
from north China, where there has been little rainfall this Spring.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the blowing dust has been seen in many
cities in north China for the past few days, they added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Journalists Urged to Contribute to Tree Planting
</P>
<P>
More than 550,000 Chinese journalists have been urged to make
their own contributions to the country's desertification control
efforts by planting trees.
</P>
<P>
Northern China Cities Report Worse Air This Week
</P>
<P>
The quality of air in most major cities in northern China
worsened this week because of wide-ranging dusty weather in the
region, the China Environmental Monitoring Center said in its
weekly Air Quality Report.
</P>
<P>
Dry weather, high-temperatures, a shortage of vegetation in the
region, and strong winds were blamed for dusty weather resulting
in a drastic increase of suspended air-borne particles in the air.
</P>
<P>
From March 17 to 23, the cities of Xining, Zhengzhou, Tianjin,
Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, Chongqing, Urumqi, and Qinhuangdao reported
slight air pollution; Beijing and Taiyuan reported unhealthy air;
and Yinchuan, Lanzhou, and Hohhot reported hazardous air.
</P>
<P>
30,000 Birds Saved in Nanning
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 birds have been saved from dealers in Nanning,
capital of south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, since
the first Birds Week was held here in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In this year's annual Birds Week (March 20-26), a painting by a
schoolboy of a crying bird being cooked in a pot attracted much
attention.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Mingchuan, honorary vice president of the
Nanning Wild Life Protection Association, Guangxi's once-abundant
bird resources have been diminishing due to abuse of ecological
environment.

<HEADLINE> China's Cultural Market to Open Wider: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China is looking to speed up the
development of the arts and entertainment sector, said Vice
Minister of Culture Li Yuanchao.
</P>
<P>
More investments in the form of private capital or equity
funding will supplement government funding for movies, magazines,
art trading and education, today's "China Daily" quotes Li as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the cultural market is aimed at satisfying
Chinese people's growing demand for arts and entertainment
products by introducing a competitive mechanism into the industry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Reforms will be also carried out in the cultural administration
departments, which used to organize cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, such departments will switch their
focus to drafting plans and guidelines to guide the development of
the cultural sector, providing consultation and information for
those working in the sector as well as co-ordinating government
efforts to foster a better environment for the development of
culture.
</P>
<P>
Ministry statistics show that urban residents spent only 2.35
percent of their total incomes on cultural activities in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Li said the small size and fragmentation of the arts and
entertainment industry have prevented cultural resources from
being maximized and retarded the sector's development.
</P>
<P>
So far, no entertainment companies have made China's top-
ranking 500 enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China's aggregate cultural consumption reached 7.8 billion US
dollars in 1997, while potential demand was estimated to be 36.1
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
From 2001 to 2005, the government will spend more to build
libraries and cultural centers in underdeveloped regions, says the
paper.

<HEADLINE> Russian Presidential Elections Calm, Peaceful: CEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's presidential elections
held Sunday was calm and peaceful with virtually no reports of
noticeable glitches.
</P>
<P>
No significant irregularities have been reported that would
cast doubt on the outcome of the Russian presidential elections,
Alexander Veshnyakov, chairman of Russia's Central Election
Commission (CEC), said Sunday in an interview with ORT television.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Security Service (FSB) also said there were no
incidents hindering the elections. The FSB spokesman said the
service and the Interior Ministry took precautionary measures
against any extremist moves.
</P>
<P>
Bjorn van der Esch, head of the mission sent by the Council of
Europe's Parliamentary Assembly to monitor the balloting, said the
elections have passed very openly and quietly.
</P>
<P>
He was pleased with everything he and his colleagues had seen
in the course of the elections, Interfax quoted him as saying
Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
He visited nine polling stations in Moscow and the Moscow
region, including one in an army unit, van der Esch said, adding
that he and his colleagues believe the elections were absolutely
legitimate and met internationally recognized democratic standards.
</P>
<P>
Certain faults, such as the absence of curtains in some voting
booths, were insignificant because they can happen anywhere, van
der Esch said.
</P>
<P>
Eduard Brunner, head of the observer mission of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the
Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), said
he was not aware of any serious violations during the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss diplomat said final conclusions concerning
the elections can be made only after analyzing all the reports
from the foreign observers in different parts of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Brunner described the presidential election campaign as calmer
compared with the campaign preceding the parliamentary elections
in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 international observers from various countries and
international organizations were deployed across the country to
monitor the elections. They joined some 500,000 Russian observers
representing the presidential candidates. No international
observers were deployed in the breakaway republic of Chechnya
owing to the fact that personal security could not be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
In Chechnya, like in other regions, voting was also conducted
peacefully and without any glitches. The local election commission
suspended work at 8 p.m. Sunday (1600 GMT) until Monday morning
owing to a curfew.
</P>
<P>
The only noticeable glitch might be a hoax bomb threat at the
results center in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man called from a pay phone Sunday night and
claimed that a bomb had been planted in the concert hall of
Ostankino, where the Federal Information Center is stationed. A
team of engineers on duty in the building and sniffer dogs found
no bomb and the area was not evacuated.
</P>
<P>
Ballot counting continued in the center in Moscow. As of 4 a.m.
(0000 GMT) Monday when 69.42 percent of the votes had been
processed, Putin won 51.17 percent, while his major rival
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov had 30.37 percent.
Approval ratings for the other nine candidates were in single
digits.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, a candidate can claim victory in
the first round if he/she wins more than 50 percent of the vote.
Otherwise a second round of voting will be held three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Putin is seen moving toward outright victory, but a run-off
with Zyuganov remains a possibility given the narrow margin
between his ratings and the 50 percent requirement.

Putin continued his lead in partial returns of Sunday's
presidential elections, taking 51.5 percent out of the 77.42

<HEADLINE> Ailing Sampras Wins Third Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINNTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras overcame an
upset stomach and an upset bid by Swede Andreas Vinciguerra on
Sunday to win 5-7, 7-6 (3), 6-4 in the third round at the Ericsson
Open held inn Ky Biscayne, Florida.
</P>
<P>
The gutsy performance was reminiscent of Sampras' victory in
the 1996 U.S. Open quarterfinals, when he threw up during a
dramatic fifth-set tiebreaker against Alex Corretja, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Sampras vomited after cracking a crosscourt backhand for a
clean winner to break Vinciguerra's serve and take a 4-3 lead in
the final set. Sampras then routinely won his final two service
games, punctuating the victory with his 21st ace.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who won the Open that year, is seeking his first
tournament title of 2000. He advanced to a fourth-round showdown
of serves against Greg Rusedski, who beat Byron Black 6-1, 7-6 (4).
Rusedski is 1-7 against Sampras.
</P>
<P>
American Jan-Michael Gambill upset another Swede, fifth-seeded
Magnus Norman, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3. No. 3 Yevgeny Kafelnikov beat
Fernando Meligeni 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Italian Gianluca Pozzi reached the fourth round by
beating Jiri Novak 6-3, 7-5. The showing is Pozzi's best in seven
appearances at Key Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, Lindsay Davenport and Serena Williams won
women's third-round matches. The top-seeded Hingis beat Anne-
Gaelle Sidot 6-0, 6-3. No. 2 Davenport swept Silvija Talaja 6-2, 6-
2. No. 5 Williams eliminated Ai Sugiyama 6-3, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Nathalie Tauziat of France lost to countrywoman Nathalie
Dechy 6-4, 6-2. Two-time champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, seeded
10th, was beaten by Sabine Appelmans 6-3, 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Detains 171 "Snakeheads" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China has
mounted its battle against trafficking, and police here have
announced that 171 "snakeheads" were detained so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The coastal province has been the focus of the Chinese
government's efforts to curb human trafficking, mainly to
Australia and the United States. Gang members who demand high fees
for taking people out of China are known as "snakeheads."
</P>
<P>
The intensified campaign has helped bring down the number of
such smugglers, as last year 288 "snakeheads" were arrested.
</P>
<P>
Border police with the provincial Public Security Department
said they have successfully eliminated syndicated human smuggling
from this part of the coast.
</P>
<P>
The provincial-level crackdown campaign started on December 15
last year, aiming at foiling smuggling attempts around New Year's
and Spring Festival, China's Lunar New Year, which fell on
February 5 this year.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said there are still 12 "snakeheads" high on
wanted list, and 17 others at large. However, the campaign has
proved effective since 17 smugglers turned themselves up to the
police during the period.
</P>
<P>
Police officers have vowed they will not give up until all the
remaining smugglers are punished.

fen nickel coin issued in Hubei in 1925, and a silver seal
featuring the image of the warlord Yuan Shikai of the early 20th
century. The bottom bidding prices are 100,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan,
40,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before the auction is held, a special four-day show will be
organized to teach interested collectors how to tell real precious
coins and banknotes from counterfeit or ordinary ones, said Fan
Ganping, deputy chairman of the board of the Shanghai
International Commodities Auction Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Major Cigarette Smuggling Case Cracked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Haikou,
capital of south China's Hainan Province, recently stopped a boat
loaded with 781 cases of foreign-brand cigarettes that were being
smuggled into China.
</P>
<P>
The seized cigarettes are estimated at a total value of more
than 1.8 million yuan, said a customs source.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, on the afternoon of March 17, customs
officers aboard a Coast Guard vessel spotted the smuggling boat as
they were patrolling the northern sea area of Yangpu Port.
</P>
<P>
The smuggled cigarette cases were disguised to avoid inspection,
and had been loaded into two containers. The boat was registered
in the coastal city of Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
All eight suspects aboard the boat were detained in Haikou, and
the case is still under investigation, local sources said.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco Takes Equity Stakes in Petro China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- BP Amoco and Petro China have
reached an initial agreement that the former will take 20 percent
of the shares currently being offered, up to a maximum of one
billion US dollars, by Petro China through its initial public
offering.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
major environment stories Xinhua released from March 19 to 26:
</P>
<P>
Rare Tiger Seen Near Northeast China Township
</P>
<P>
A rare Siberian tiger has been seen twice near Xilinzi Township,
Raohe County, in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junming, a local official, encountered the tiger when
driving on a hilly road near the township on February 23. "It ran
off into the nearby woods when my car was only four or five meters
away from it," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
That same night, a horse was killed, apparently by the tiger,
and the following night, three geese were devoured; a tiger's claw-
print was found at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao Hikes Funds for Environmental Protection
</P>
<P>
This city in east China's Shandong Province will spend 2.3
billion yuan (about 277 million U.S. dollars) on environmental
protection this year, to ensure that local residents have a better
living environment.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao hopes to be included on the list of China's model
cities for environmental protection, said Liu Jianhua, deputy
mayor of this coastal city.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has drawn up a plan for realizing this goal, including
32 standards for environmental protection and costing a total of 2.
3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city will require all local enterprises to make their
control of industrial pollution discharge meet the state standards,
and will further improve the water and air quality in the city, to
achieve all-round environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Puts All Counties Under Biological Construction
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Gansu Province has enlisted all its 87
counties, cities and prefectures into a biological construction
program which focuses on planting trees and grass, according to a
provincial meeting on environmental protection held in this
capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, the province had issued a series of
programs on turning farmland back into forestry and grassland, and
building shelter-belts and sand-fixing afforestation.
</P>
<P>
To date, the province has finished rehabilitating 112,000 ha of
land for forestry and pasture.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to return another 79,000 hectares of
farmland to forestry and pasture use, and plant trees and grass on
about 2.7 ha of poor land.
</P>
<P>
Western China Launches Afforestation Drive
</P>
<P>
China is vigorously pushing ahead a program to return low-
yielding farmland in its vast western areas to forests and
grassland.
</P>
<P>
Under the government-initiated "grain-for-green" program, China
's resource-rich, economically backward hinterland is expected to
be afforested with trees and grass in the upcoming decades.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai Province, where China's two longest rivers -- the
Yangtze and the Yellow -- originate, will convert 18,000 ha of its
low-yielding farmland along the rivers to forests and grassland
this year. The area will expand to 360,000 ha by 2010.
</P>
<P>
People in Golmud, a city built on gobi desert, will build an 11-
km-long and 606-meter-wide forest belt on the edge of the Qaidam
Basin.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Gansu Province has pledged to launch three
ecological projects this year. The first one is to build a tree
belt along the middle reaches of the Yellow in 11 years. The
second one is to take measures to prevent desertification, while
the third involves pilot experiments with the grain-for-green
scheme.
</P>
<P>
The government of Sichuan Province has set up a leading group
to take charge of local afforestation efforts. Sichuan plans to
turn 200,000 ha of its hillsides and barren land to grassland and
forest. By the end of February, 86,000 ha had been afforested. (

A team of 42 geologists left Zhengzhou, capital of central
China's Henan Province on March 21, on a three-month expedition to
the world's biggest canyon, the Yarlung Zangbo Valley.
</P>
<P>
Located in the southeastern part of the Tibet-Qinghai Plateau,
known as "the roof of the world", the Yarlung Zangbo Valley is
about 496 km long, with an average depth of more than 5,000 meters,
outclassing the Grand Canyon in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Snaking around the Himalayas, the canyon has a great drop and
various vertical biological belts with abundant natural resources,
including mineral deposits.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Inspects Environmental Protection Effort
</P>
<P>
East China's Jiangxi Province sent out an inspection group to
supervise environmental protection work in the Ganjiang River
valley, which covers half of the province's total area.
</P>
<P>
The group's work will continue until the end of this year.
Officials and experts will inspect the control of pollutants, air
quality and ground water in the cities and prefectures of Nanchang,
Jiujiang Jingdezhen, Pingxiang, Xinyu and Shangrao.
</P>
<P>
The inspection will help raise people's awareness of the
importance of environmental protection, ensure the implementation
of pertinent laws and regulations in Jiangxi and solve some
environmental issues, said Qian Zihong, an official with the
provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
East China Province Combats Industrial Pollution
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui Province will invest more than 6 billion
yuan (about 720 million U.S. dollars) in combating industrial
pollution this year, according to the provincial environmental
protection authorities.
</P>
<P>
Main projects cover smog control, treatment of industrial waste
water and discharge of sulfur dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Pan Tiansheng, director of the provincial environmental
protection bureau, said, by implementing the plan, all the
province's industrial enterprises are expected to reach the
standard set by the state for discharging pollutants by the end of
this year. Those enterprises which can not reach the standard will
be closed down.
</P>
<P>
China to Increase Firewood Forests by 12 Million Ha
</P>
<P>
China will plant 12 million more hectares of trees for firewood
in the future in an effort to ease the energy shortage in rural
areas, according to the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the over-logging of forests for firewood has
accounted for 30 percent of firewood consumption in rural areas,
which lead to deteriorating soil erosion and the destruction of
the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Growing more firewood forests, a clean and renewable energy
source, will help solve the energy problem in rural regions.
</P>
<P>
China initiated a firewood project in 1981, and firewood
forests now cover 4.3 million hectares nationwide.
</P>
<P>
China Builds Biggest Ever Wildlife Park
</P>
<P>
Construction of China's largest ever center for wild animals
and plants has begun recently in Jintang County near Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Sichuan Tourism Investment Group Co. Ltd.,
which sponsored the construction of the center with others, said
that about 36,000 animals will be introduced from among the world
to the center with 80 percent of the center to be planted with
more than 10,000 plants.
</P>
<P>
Located in a subtropical area with knaps and streams rivers and
rich vegetation, the center is an ideal place chosen from among 40
areas with the approval of the State Forestry Administration, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the center, 32 km from Chengdu, is expected to
cost 300 million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars).

China Plans Vast Nature Reserve to Purify Big Rivers
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Qinghai Province plans to set up a vast
nature reserve to curb the worsening water and soil erosion in
areas around the sources of three major rivers in China during the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
Mu Dongsheng, vice governor of the province, said that a 23.6-
million-hectare nature reserve will be established in Yushu, Golog
and Haixi prefectures in the province, where China's two longest
rivers -- the 6,300-km Yangtze River and the Yellow River -- and
the Lancang River originate.
</P>
<P>
Purified Wastewater to Replace Tap Water to Spray Beijing Roads
</P>
<P>
Starting from mid-June, a large wastewater treatment plant in
Beijing will daily channel 100,000 tons of purified wastewater to
spray the downtown roads as one of the water-saving measures.
</P>
<P>
The project, the largest one in the Chinese capital, is
expected to be initiated soon and completed in mid-June at the
Gaobeidian sewage treatment plant. And then every day 200,000 tons
of purified wastewater, instead of tap water, will be transferred
to the Beijing No.1 Thermal Power Plant and another 100,000 tons
be used to water trees and grass patches and clean the main roads
in the city, said related officials.
</P>
<P>
Sand Sweeps Chinese Capital
</P>
<P>
The five-six degrees of the disgusting Boreas on March 22 night
has brought sand to the Chinese capital for the third time this
month.
</P>
<P>
Buildings, autos, and roads were covered with a thin layer of
sand after a night of northerly winds. Meteorologists said that
higher temperature in the beginning of March, scant precipitation,
and loose earth, are the main reasons for the sand storms.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cold air from Mongolia, together with sand
storms in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, worsened
the condition, said the local meteorological station.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that they will put more efforts into
dealing with the pollution, and as part of the efforts they have
required all construction companies to take feasible measures to
lessen blowing dust while demolishing old buildings.
</P>
<P>
Anhui Uses Foreign Funds to Develop Forestry
</P>
<P>
East China's Anhui Province has attracted more than 100 million
US dollars in foreign funds to develop its forestry since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The province has 14 foreign-funded projects, involving tree
planting, treatment of plant diseases, fire prevention and forest
industries.
</P>
<P>
A major afforestation project with 289 million yuan in
investment, including 19 million U.S. dollars in loans from the
World Bank, will fund tree planting over an area of 46,000
hectares, raising the forest coverage rate in the involved areas
by 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, the province still expects foreign investment to be
used in 15 other forestry projects.
</P>
<P>
Government Supports Pollution Control
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the State Economic and Trade Commission
this week lists 62 environmental protection facilities in need of
money or upgrades.
</P>
<P>
These facilities are used to treat water pollution, air
pollution and solid water, control noise, monitor environmental
conditions, and save energy.
</P>
<P>
The circular noted that as more efforts should be devoted to
pollution prevention, it is important to prioritize the
development of these facilities.

<HEADLINE> Tissue Factories Urged to Improve Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Quality experts are trying to
wipe out inferior paper napkins from the market. In a recent
quality inspection conducted by the State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration, only 81 percent of all local-brand
paper napkins met State standards.
</P>
<P>
The inspection covered 78 brands of paper napkins from 49
manufacturers in Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast China's Liaoning
Province, Shanghai and East China's Jiangsu Province. Only 63
brands passed quality tests, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The figure showed little improvement from the inspection
results one year ago.
</P>
<P>
Quality problems discovered during the inspection included
inadequate sterilization and excessive use of bleaching powder,
the administration sources said.
</P>
<P>
China now has 320 paper napkin manufacturers, with a total
production capacity of more than 2.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Most of the enterprises mushroomed in the past decade, during
which time paper napkins have gradually turned from a luxury item
to a daily necessity.
</P>
<P>
While local brands of paper napkins are quite popular among
families because of their comparatively low price and reliable
quality, a considerable number of people prefer foreign brands for
their softness, scent, packing and promotion activities, says the
paper.

remote areas since 1997.
</P>
<P>
The commission puts forward proposals on suitable places for
installing the equipment, while NEDO carries out further studies
and work with the local government to set up the power sites.
</P>
<P>
Inoue said that NEDO will complete the installation of solar
power equipment in a clinic of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region and in a middle school in southwest China's
Yunnan Province this month.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the number of sites equipped by NEDO to 10. Two
more sites will have solar electricity system installed in May and
June this year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The environment-friendly equipment can bring electricity to
areas not covered by the electricity grid. It will help improve
the quality of life for the people in these areas, Inoue said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Promises No Miracles for Russians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Acting President Vladimir
Putin, who is seen marching toward victory in Sunday's
presidential elections, told his compatriots not to expect
miracles of him.
</P>
<P>
"In my trips around the country, people are tired; life is
difficult; and they expect better things from me. But there can be
no miracles," a calm and relaxed Putin told reporters at his
campaign headquarters early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Not to promise miracles is the only way to avoid disappointment,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The first thing to do is to sit down and analyze the current
situation, he said. "Years later, the people will have an
opportunity to draw conclusions -- what was wrong, what was right.
"
</P>
<P>
Putin said there is no difference as to whether he would win in
the first round or second round. "First round (victory) gives us
more responsibilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
At 3 a.m. Monday (2300 GMT Sunday) when 58.81 percent of the
ballots had been counted, Putin garnered 50. 67 percent of the
vote, compared with 30.51 percent for Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the better-than-expected performance of Zyuganov is
a sign of dissatisfaction among ordinary Russians and the need
for their worries to be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
"I want to point out the Communists achieved that level even
though -- let us be direct and honest about this -- they did not
have that many opportunities in the media, especially electronic
media."
</P>
<P>
Putin indicated that he might invite some of his electoral
rivals into his government if the final vote count proves that he
won in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to talk to them in order to see whether they are
prepared to work within the framework of the program that is being
proposed by the government. If they are ready, they will find
their place."
</P>
<P>
Putin praised former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov, Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov and Zyuganov for their position on the issue of
Chechnya, saying that they helped unify the nation on the war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin said these politicians were aware that the war served to
increase his popularity but "they haven't let themselves slide
into anti-national positions," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Asked what he would do Monday, Putin said that he would do
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
"A vacuum of authority or management should not be allowed for
a second. The cabinet should work as usual."
</P>
<P>
He said if he wins in the first round, he will immediately
undertake to form a new cabinet and consult with the State Duma (
lower house of the parliament) on the appointment of prime
minister.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 27 (Xinhua)-- China is expected to overtake the
US within the next two or three years to become the world's
leading beer producer and marketer, said Sun Jie, an official of
the State Administration of Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
Attending a trade fair in this capital of Southwest China's
Sichuan Province, Sun said that the per capita consumption of beer
in China is less than 18 kg, below the world's average, suggesting
a huge potential for future growth.
</P>
<P>
He said that China will be able to produce 22 million tons of
beer this year, a figure slightly less than the record output of
23 million tons of the United States in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China turned out 20.88 million tons of beer, ranking
closely behind the US.
</P>
<P>
China's beer production has been surging at an annual rate of
25 percent in the past decade, a phenomenal rate compared with
other countries. Last year, the Tsingtao and Yanjing breweries
each passed the one million ton mark in annual output.
</P>
<P>
While beer witnessed unprecedented growth, the liquor market
has been withering. Last year, China produced 5.02 million tons of
liquor, down 14 percent from the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Assad Back Home after Geneva Summit with Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
returned here Tuesday afternoon from Geneva where he held an
inconclusive summit with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton aimed at
restarting peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders reviewed the Middle East
peace process and the possibility of resuming the Syrian-Israel
talks that have been stalled since January this year.
</P>
<P>
But the summit failed to immediately revive the talks because of
what Syrian side said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's refusal
to offer a clear pledge to pull back his troops to the pre-June 4,
1967 borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy attributed the
failure of the summit to Assad's refusal to change his position of
make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh was quoted by Lebanese
daily "Al-Safir" on Monday as saying that "Although we had no
illusions about the summit, we were astonished to realize that
Clinton did not bring about any new proposal from Israel."
</P>
<P>
He expressed regret that Clinton asked Syria to "help Barak get
out of his own political crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We did not expect a miracle at the summit, but we did not go to
it in order to help Barak," Shareh underlined.
</P>
<P>
The summit between Clinton and Assad, an ailing 69 who hardly
made any trip abroad, had rekindled hopes for a resumption of the
peace talks on the Syrian-Israeli track.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Libyan Discuss Pan-Arab, Bilateral Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amman, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh said on Monday his government was keen to further advance
inter-Arab relations and to link interests of Arab peoples and
states together on solving issues facing the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during a meeting with visiting Libyan Foreign
Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham before he ended a three-day visit to
the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also said Jordan welcomed any steps to deepen
cooperation with Libya in all fields to set an excellent model for
the joint Arab action, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Ilah Al-Khatib.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Shalgham praised Jordan's role in supporting Arab
causes and strengthening Arab solidarity and the joint Arab action
on issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been an active advocate for an Arab summit to discuss
issues facing the Arab world, including the Middle East peace
process as well as other challenges for economic development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, becoming
the second Arab country after Egypt to strike a peace deal with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
For years, Jordan has been a key peace broker between Israel and
its Arab neighbors, but the kingdom has on many occasions voiced
its support for the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon to regain their
rights and territories lost to Israel during the Middle East wars
under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Shalgham affirmed that Jordan and Libya were trying to promote
bilateral relations to set a good example for inter-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
Almost 45 percent of non-Jordanians who receive medical
treatment in Jordan are from Libya, he said, adding that a large
number of Libyan students are studying at Jordanian universities
and higher institutions, he added.

<HEADLINE> Stance of Outgoing U.N. Aid Official Appreciated: Aziz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq appreciated the "objective
stance" of Hans von Sponeck, the outgoing U.N. humanitarian
coordinator for Iraq, said Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the Iraq-based U.N. relief official, Aziz said Iraq
also appreciated the "positive efforts" made by von Sponeck in
trying to alleviate the sufferings of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Aziz and von Sponeck exchanged views about
the humanitarian situation in Iraq, reported the official Iraqi
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, along with Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf, met von Sponeck to praise his
critical stance on the sweeping U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi people are reeling under the crippling sanctions imposed
after Saddam ordered troops into neighboring Kuwait in 1990. Von
Sponeck said the U.N. oil-for-food program failed to meet the
minimum needs of the 22 million Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. program, an exception of the decade-long sanctions,
allows Iraq to sell limited amount of oil to buy food, medicine and
other humanitarian relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck's criticism of the sanctions as resulting in a
humanitarian tragedy angered the U.S. and Britain, who often tried
to stall U.N. approval of Iraqi contracts and preferred to keep
embargo against Iraq in place.
</P>
<P>
As the top U.N. relief official for Iraq, von Sponeck submitted
his resignation to the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last
month. He is going to leave his post at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck said that he resigned as the U.N. humanitarian
program he heads has proven to be a failure, and he has lost hope
of an improvement in Iraq's humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
The veteran German diplomat, appointed to the post of U.N.
humanitarian coordinator for Iraq in October 1998, urged the U.N.
Security Council to treat Iraq's humanitarian needs separately from
the council's aim to monitor Baghdad's disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Donate Blood Samples to Save Greek Cypriot Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 300 ordinary Turkish
Cypriots Monday crossed to the south to give blood samples to help
save a six-year-old Greek Cypriot boy, the Cyprus News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Busloads of Turkish Cypriots reached out their helping hands to
Greek Cypriot doctors who took blood samples at the U.N.-controlled
Ledra Palace on the Green Line dividing the island.
</P>
<P>
The sick boy, Andreas Vassiliou, was in urgent need for a bone
marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
Serdar Denktash, the son of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash, and President of the Republic Turkish Party Mehmet Ali
Talat were among those who offered blood and registered as possible
bone marrow donors.
</P>
<P>
"This is obviously a very good thing and it will help build
confidence between the two communities," said Talat.
</P>
<P>
The first Turkish Cypriot to give blood was Haroun Outsar, a
photographer at the Kibrisli newspaper, who said he would be very
happy if the young boy could be saved.
</P>
<P>
Serdar Denktash said he came to help save a small child. "This
is a humanitarian issue it has nothing to do with politics, Turkish
Cypriots want to help."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus Karaiskakion Foundation, in charge of the bone marrow
register, has also pledged to help a 12-year-old Turkish Cypriot
boy who is undergoing treatment at the Royal Free hospital in
London since February.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday the Cyprus government welcomed the Turkish
Cypriots' response, noting that it promotes solidarity among the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots also contributed blood samples on Sunday during
a bi-communal event organized by some youth groups.

<HEADLINE> Albright Briefs Jordanian King on Clinton-Assad Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright called Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein on Monday to
brief him on the outcome of Sunday's summit between U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone conversation, Albright also briefed the
monarch on Washington's efforts to bring the Syrian and Israeli
views closer to achieve a peace agreement that would ensure the
restoration of the occupied Syrian lands.
</P>
<P>
For his part, King Abdullah stressed the importance of the
efforts by the United States to achieve a just, durable and
comprehensive peace in the region and also expressed appreciation
for Clinton's efforts in this regard, Jordan's official news agency
Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The king reaffirmed Jordan's support to all efforts by all
parties aimed at ensuring the peace process on all tracks,
including Israel's peace talks with the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon, to succeed.
</P>
<P>
He also called on parties concerned to make tangible progress in
the peace process to bring confidence back and pave the way for a
just, durable and comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright hailed Jordan's efforts to advance the peace process
between Israel and its Arab neighbors since Jordan signed a peace
treaty with the Jewish state in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Assad held a face-to-face meeting in Geneva on
Sunday, their first summit in six years, but failed to clinch a
firm agreement to restart the Israeli-Syrian talks which were
stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
"The differences are significant and important and obviously
more work needs to be done to bridge them," White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart said after the Clinton-Assad meeting, adding that it
was still impossible to predict when the Syrian-Israeli peace talks
would resume.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Israel make prior commitment to a full
withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured from Syrian in the
1967 Middle East war before their talks can be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Israel wants Syria to make concessions on the border issues and
demands that security arrangements, Israel's access to water and
normalization of relations be discussed first.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Religious Party Decides to Stay in Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's ultra Orthodox
religious Shas party decided Monday night to stay in Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's coalition despite the fact that its spiritual leader
was under investigation ordered earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Shas's Council of Torah Sages held an emergency meeting Monday
night to discuss the party's future in the coalition after Israel's
Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein instructed to investigate Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef for his inciting remarks against Education Minister
Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the policymaking council after the meeting
stated that it condemned the attorney general's decision as a "
serious attack on the honor of a great Bible scholar, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef" but the party will remain in the ruling coalition for now.
</P>
<P>
While the council members meeting at Yosef's home in Jerusalem,
hundreds of ultra Orthodox citizens rallied outside the house in
protest against Rubinstein's order.
</P>
<P>
The legal procedure was started up following a weekly end-of-
Shabbat sermon carried over local radio and television by satellite
on March 18, in which Yosef draw an analogy between Sarid and Satan
and two other condemned figures in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
He stated that like Haman, a Persian minister who according to
the Bible was hanged after an abortive plot to kill all Israelis,
Sarid's name should be wiped out of the world forever because of
his constant attacks on the Orthodox way of life. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rabbi later wrote a statement clarifying his stands
by saying that he had no intention of physical violence toward
Sarid, the position failed to satisfy Sarid and his party
colleagues, who are asking for a full and clear apology from Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein flied a test balloon on Saturday by saying that he
had made up his mind about the case but he didn't plan to make the
decision known until Monday, hoping Yosef would make further
apology for his remarks during the period. 
</P>
<P>
His good wish, however, had been damped by Yosef, who went
further Saturday night to accuse Sarid of "sowing seeds of racist
hatred" during his traditional Torah lecture to his followers in
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioning the name of Haman, the stubborn Shas spiritual
leader this time compared Sarid to an Egyptian Pharaoh who
persecuted the Jews, an analogy in keeping with next month's
Passover, which commemorates the Hebrews' liberation from slavery
in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Far from apologizing, Yosef noted he would not take back what he
said previously. His impenitent stance made Rubinstein have no
alternative but to let the prosecution go ahead after consulting
with State Attorney Edna Arbel.
</P>
<P>
Shas members reacted strongly to Rubinstein's order, suggesting
that the attorney general make the Ashkenazi-Sephardi relations
from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
Ashkenazi, Jews whose ancestors lived in Central or Eastern
Europe, are for a long time at odds with Sephardi, Jews whose
ancestors lived in the Arab countries of North Africa and the
Middle East. Yosef is a former Sephardi Chief Rabbi.
</P>
<P>
Shas had accused the current Israeli establishment of treating
in favor of Ashkenazic Jews and preventing Sephardic Jews from
closing the economic and political gaps between the two Jewish
groups.
</P>
<P>
"The things he (Rubinstein) said are racist. His decision is
racist because we are Sephardic and ultra-Orthodox...They are
making us feel like second, third, fourth class citizens," Shas
leader and Health Minister Shlomo Benizri was quoted by Israel
Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some fervent Shas followers even painted slogans against
Rubinstein on the walls of the Justice Ministry Sunday night. To
guard against possible violence against the prosecutor, the police
decided to assign 24-hour protection around the home of Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear why Shas flinched back from its earlier
threats to withdraw from the government and join the anti-Barak
forces, a move that surely would made Barak's already ailing
coalition more crumbled.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that Shas leaders decided to stay in
coalition for fear that quitting the coalition is equal to
committing political suicide because the party would lose its
bargaining strong point in the government to fulfill its
electorate's demands, which would trigger its collapse in a short
time.
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Barak could have a breathing spell now as
Shas's decision saved him from the political dilemma between Shas
and Sarid's left-wing Meretz party, which also threatened to leave
the coalition if Rubinstein hadn't ordered probe against Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had pointed out that Barak couldn't afford to lose
either side of the conflict in such a critical time when he
desperately needs solidarity in his ruling coalition and Knesset's
majority support for the upcoming peace deals he negotiates with
Syria, the Palestinians and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party in the 120-member Knesset with 17
seats, and Meretz, the fourth largest party with 10 seats, are both
the largest ruling partners of Barak's One Israel coalition.
</P>
<P>
In case that either of them jumps off the boat, the Barak
government would surely lose the simple majority in the Knesset and
became minority.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation would possibly bring an end to the current
administration and lead to an early general election in the near
future, according to these analysts.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts pointed out the atmosphere of relaxation for now
would be temporary as the religious party still has many demands
unfulfilled and it will be eager to revenge this humiliating
defeat.
</P>
<P>
Shas had urged Sarid to allocate enough funds from the Education
Ministry to cover financial deficit in its ailing education system.
It also hoped that Sarid would hand over the control of the ultra
Orthodox education system to his deputy Meshulam Nahari, who is a
Shas member.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Religious Leader Denies Religious Persecution in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I don't think this is the case. I deeply regret that the U.S.
government made allegation without too much real investigation and
knowing the real situation," said Han Wenzao, President of China
Christian Council(CCC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, made the allegation against China in State
Department's human rights report of the year 1999, is planning to
lodge a draft resolution concerning China at the United Nations
conference on human rights in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao told a press conference in the Chinese Embassy in
the United States that Chinese people enjoy religious freedom
guaranteed in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The religious leader, who is currently visiting the U.S. as
head of a CCC delegation, said 130,000 churches were reopened and
23 million Bibles were printed in China by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Han Wenzao said there is a "big deep misunderstanding" in the
west about the religious situation in China.
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that cases concerning violation of
religious rights do occur from time to time in China.
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect implementation of policies will be the same
everywhere," he said. "Such cases could happen, did happen and
will happen from time to time, here and there." he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our duty to refer such cases and complaints to the upper
level and ask for investigation and rectification," he said.
</P>
<P>
Han said the religious freedom in China was not affected by
China's crackdown on Falungong cult.
</P>
<P>
"Falungong has nothing to do with religion," he said, "

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Accuses Murder of Americans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A minor, 16 years old, was
accused Monday by the Organism of Judicial Investigation (OIJ) of
Costa Rica of murdering two young American females in the country.
</P>
<P>
Acting director of the OIJ Jorge Rojas said the underaged
person, (whose name wasn't made known) is being held and fully
identified and there is a search for two other people involved in
this crime. It has caused shocks in the South American country and
also in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of the young American women, Emily Eagen and Emily
Howell, both 19 years old, were found on March 13 in Cahuita,
about 13 kilometers southwest of the capital, with shots in the
head and body.
</P>
<P>
These killings received wide disclosure in the United states'
press and caused worry here, due to the increase of violence in
this zone and the effects it may have on tourism.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Department Says Cuban Boy's Relatives Fail to Comply Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In their letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, the boy's
relatives said they asked a federal appeals court to set an
expedited schedule for hearing an appeal, however, the letter did
not meet the other demand Reno made on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
"We do not consider them in compliance with Friday's letter,"
said Justice spokeswoman Carole Florman.
</P>
<P>
"They have not agreed to provide written assurances they will
comply with Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)
instructions if they do not prevail in the appeals court and
cannot obtain a stay from the Supreme Court," Florman said.
</P>
<P>
Florman said the Justice Department had responded in court to
the family's request for an expedited appeal that was not so swift
as the government had hoped and that a new letter would be sent to
the family laying how the government proposed to proceed from here.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department late Friday told relatives of Elian that
they have until noon Monday to agree to a speedy appeal or the boy
will be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department wants to give the family's lawyers until
April 3 to file the expedited appeal, a date the lawyers had
proposed. If the relatives do not agree to the deadline, the
government will begin the process of returning Elian to his father
in Cuba next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled
that only the U.S. attorney general can grant political asylum to
the boy.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle Florida filed a political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son be returned to him while the boy's great
uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S., asked the
boy to stay with him.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Mexico to Renew Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of Brazil and
Mexico will meet this week in Brasilia for the second round of
talks on an accord for customs' preferences, to be signed this
year by both countries.
</P>
<P>
This meeting will be the real start of negotiations as the
first one, carried out February 2 and 3 in Mexico City, was
initial contact for exchanging lists with 1,500 products of
preference in each country.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian companies fear the competition of products made in
the United States and put together in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has a foreign trade two times over Brazil's.
</P>
<P>
Mexican firms are more competitive in the world markets, like
America's, and the structure of exempting taxes for exports is
better in this country than in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
According to Brazilian diplomats, Mexico is speeding talks on
bilateral accords in order to diversify its products markets,
depending on the United States.
</P>
<P>
Besides forming part of North American Free Trade Agreement (
NAFTA), Mexico has negotiated free trade accords with European
Union (EU), Chile, Bolivia, Venezuela and Colombia, and has
agreements of customs' preferences with Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay.

<HEADLINE> Gore Offers New Proposals for Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
Monday offered new proposals for fund-raising reforms to fight
against his political rival George W. Bush's repeated attacks on
his past fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
Gore called for creation of a 7.1 billion dollars endowment to
pay for House and Senate campaigns, new disclosure rules for
lobbyists and outside groups that pay for political ads, and
mandatory free"rebuttal" air time for candidates targeted by such
third-party ads.
</P>
<P>
Gore's proposed new rules would require public identification
of those paying for any political ad that airs within 60 days of
Election Day and, in the case of an organization-paid ad, the
names of the group's financial backers.
</P>
<P>
Under his proposal, lobbyists also would be required to make
monthly disclosures of all their lobbying contacts, what topics
they discussed and what political contributions they made.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who laid stress on the campaign finance reform in his
Democratic presidential race after he sealed the party
presidential nomination, disclosed earlier that he was planning to
make a long-stalled bill to ban unlimited "soft money" donations
the first piece of domestic legislation he submits to Congress if
he becomes president.
</P>
<P>
"I know I may be an imperfect messenger for this cause, but the
real wounds will be to our democracy itself unless we address this
problem," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
In response to Gore's proposals, Texas Governor George W. Bush
described them as "a taxpayer financed government takeover of
campaigns."
</P>
<P>
Bush has proposed a ban on unregulated soft money from
corporations and unions and an increase in the limit on individual
contributions to candidates.

<HEADLINE> FAO Says Relief Still Short in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will need 13 million U.S.
dollars over the next six months for reconstruction in the wake of
recent floods, according to a report released here Monday by the
United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in an
appeal for support for emergency programs.
</P>
<P>
The country's agriculture, forestry and fisheries will need
major help as flood waters recede and rural people return to their
villages to find that 70-80 percent of their livestock have died
or been seriously injured, the FAO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 140,000 hectares of crops have been destroyed,
while almost 6,000 small-scale fishers have lost 50 percent of
their fishing equipment, the FAO said.
</P>
<P>
The local food supply systems have been completely disrupted
and agro-industry activities halted, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the FAO's Special Relief Operations Service, Anne
M. Bauer said that "there are more than 120,000 farmers and their
families in desperate need of assistance" and they need to rebuild
their homes and farms in preparation for the main agricultural
season in September.
</P>
<P>
Appeals for funding have rung across the globe and major
support has already come from various governments and
international organizations, but people familiar with the
situation continue to stress the need for more aid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Rules On Party's Leadership Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge ruled
Monday that Pat Choate was Chairman of the Reform Party, ending a
war between two sides of the party for leadership.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Norman K. Moon ordered Jack Gargan, who
had fought Choate for the chairmanship, and Treasurer Ronn Young
to stop all activities relating to their previous positions,
including soliciting donations on behalf of the Reform Party,
spending the party's money, operating an official Web site and
planning the party's convention.
</P>
<P>
"This will now allow us to go forth and mount a competitive
race for the White House this fall," Choate, Ross Perot's 1996
presidential running mate, said after the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The ruling came after a two-day hearing in Virginia State last
week.
</P>
<P>
Gargan, the loser of the case, said he would leave the party
after 10 years service in the party and would take his supporters
with him.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a huge exodus from the party at this point," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Gargan, an ally of Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, was
dismissed at a meeting of party leaders in Nashville, Tennessee
State last month. He claimed that the meeting was illegal
and the vote to oust him and install Choate as chairman was
invalid. The case was later submitted to the federal court.
</P>
<P>
The inside fighting in the party, which had strong showings in
1992 and 1996 presidential elections, is hurting the party's
ability to make a meaningful White House bid in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Cherie Blair Settles Nanny Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair'
s wife Cherie has settled her legal action over the publication of
details of family life inside 10 Downing Street,it was disclosed
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
She took the action against the publishers of the Mail on
Sunday, after it tried to print material from an account by the
family's former nanny, Ros Mark.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Mrs Blair won an injunction which meant most
copies of the paper never reached the news stands.
</P>
<P>
She then launched legal action against the publishers,
Associated Newspapers, demanding damages and assurances that the
material would never be used again.
</P>
<P>
The news that the case has been settled came in a statement
issued by Mrs Blair.
</P>
<P>
It said she and Associated Newspapers Ltd have agreed to
resolve her claim "amicably".
</P>
<P>
It added Mrs Blair now has "all the assurance she needs that
confidentiality agreements can protect the legitimate privacy of
her and the Prime Minister's family life.
</P>
<P>
"This resolves the matter entirely to her satisfaction," the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Associated Newspapers has given permanent undertakings to the
High Court not to publish or disclose any information obtained
directly or indirectly from Ros Mark relating to the period she
worked for the Blairs.
</P>
<P>
The undertakings do not cover any material published by other
media after Mrs Blair first obtained injunctions against
Associated Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Blair had already dropped legal action against Ms Mark,
after accepting that she had not sent the 450-page account of her
life with the Blairs to the Mail on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ms Mark insisted she had written the account as a "social
history," which had not been intended to hurt the Blairs or to be
published without their consent.
</P>
<P>
Mrs Blair also dropped a claim against Ms Mark's literary agent,
Jonathan Harris, who had denied forwarding extracts from the
manuscript to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
At the time the injunction was granted, Associated Newspapers
had argued it could not stand because the former nanny's story had
appeared in the early editions, and was now in the public domain.
</P>
<P>
But the judge said the newspaper must have been aware of the
existence of a confidentiality agreement Ms Mark had entered into
with the Blairs.

Microsoft fell today, cutting the edge of a 12 percent rise
last week after the Wall Street Journal reported that the company
was closing to a settlement with the government on the antitrust.
</P>
<P>
The plunge of Microsoft's shares also dragged other stock
indexes lower despite the advance in many other technology
companies such as IBM, Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems.

carmaker DaimlerChrysler AG had paid 2.1 billion dollars for a
controling stake in Japanese Mitsubishi Motors Corp on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It means that DaimlerChrysler will take over the control of

corporate empire in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi is the ideal partner for Germany to strengthen its

The world economy is moving towards a consolidation trend and
the alliance between DaimlerChrysler and Mitsubishi is a part of
it. In May 1998 Daimler formed its alliance with Chrysler and it
was a part of its management strategy to move expanding its market
shares in the world.
</P>
<P>
Schrempp said, "This is only the beginning." He said that two
companies planned to develop a four-door version of
DaimlerChrysler's Smart Car in three years.
</P>
<P>
Besides the alliance with Mitsubishi, DaimlerChrysler is
planning to take a 50 percent stake in Netherlands Car BV.
</P>
<P>
Asia is a giant car market. General Motors and Ford of the U.S.
have entered into the market and German auto groups don't want to
lose the Asian market. After the alliance with Mitsubishi,
DaimlerChrysler has also made its way into the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
After Mitsubishi has been taken over by foreign company, only
Toyota Motor and Honda Motor Co still belong to Japan. Another
Japanese car group, Nissan Motor Co, Japan's third biggest car
manufacturer, had been taken by the French carmaker Renault SA
less than a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Minister Wants U.N. Envoy to Visit Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Sheikhh Salem al-Sabah Monday voiced
his hope that the U.N. coordinator for missing Kuwaitis, retired
Russian diplomat Yuli Vorontsov, would be able to visit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting the president of the U.N.
Security Council for the month of March, Anwarul Chowbhury of
Bangladesh, he said he would also see Vorontsov "put him in the
picture."
</P>
<P>
"We advise strongly that he should visit Kuwait and other
places, including Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov was the Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations from 1990 to 1994, including the period of the Gulf
War, and later served as ambassador to the United States until
early 1999.
</P>
<P>
He was appointed in February to the new post of the U.N.
coordinator for the return of some 600 Kuwaitis and people of
other nationalities missing since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti deputy prime minister said that he did not know
when Vorontsov might go to Baghdad, "but we wish he will go to
Iraq and Iraq would receive him."
</P>
<P>
Vorontsov's post as the U.N. coordinator was established under
a Security Council resolution adopted in December 1999 that also
set up a new agency, called the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and
Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), to complete the scrapping of Iraq
's weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> IMF Report Sees Italian GDP Up 2.75 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
expects Italy to see a 2.75 percent hike in its GDP both this year
and in 2001, according to the forecasts made in a 9-page report
IMF inspectors handed Monday to Bank of Italy Governor Antonio
Fazio and Italian Treasury Secretary Antonio Amato.
</P>
<P>
In their report, the IMF inspectors also predicted that Italy
should easily reach its target of keeping deficit budget spending
to 1.5 percent of GDP and there were no serious signs of any
significant increase in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The report also included a series of recommendations, first
among these was the invitation to Italy to do more to reform
pension spending in view of the overall "graying" of society.
</P>
<P>
In its efforts to reduce welfare spending in general, the IMF
added, Italy must pay particular attention to health costs.
</P>
<P>
The report confirmed indication leaked last week when the IMF
inspectors, headed by Maxwell Watson, shuttled between Rome and
Milan to gather information for the IMF's yearly assessment of the
economic and financial situation in Italy.
</P>
<P>
At the time, Watson warned that Italy was likely to close the
year with an inflation rate closer to 2.2 percent instead of the
currently forecast 2.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
But this would be the fault of higher oil prices which were
having the same effect on all IMF economies.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government's four-year economic and financial
planning blueprint, the DPEF, earlier this year predicted growth
of 2.2 percent in 2000 but at the end of February, Treasury
Minister Giuliano Amato revised the forecast upwards to 2.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
While in Italy, Watson said that at his team's meetings with
top economic and financial officials, including those at the
Treasury Ministry and the Bank of Italy, the question of how Italy
intended to "amplify and extend this growth to include the largest
number of people and regions" had been pressed.
</P>
<P>
Watson also stressed that fiscal reforms were urgently required
as this would "help employment and increase the size of the active
work force."
