LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Around 550 tonnes of
fertilizer, destined for distribution in Zambia's northern region
of Mbala, have been smuggled into neighbouring Tanzania, a
Zambian member of parliament revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
Fredrick Nalili urged the government to investigate into the
case, saying the smuggled fertilizer, was in exchange of maize.
</P>
<P>
He said government-appointed fertilizer distributors failed to
explain why the first consignment of fertilizer has not reached
the hands of the badly needed farmers in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is experiencing a serious food shortage caused by last
season's crop failure. And lack of fertilizer was a big problem

<HEADLINE> UN Decides to Hold Talks with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decided to told talks
on the oil-for-food formula from February 6 in New York, the
spokesman for the U.N. chief announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Sylvana Foa said in a statement that the U.N.
delegation will be headed by the Legal Counsel of the United
Nations Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell while the Iraqi side
will be led by Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, former Iraq's permanent
representative to the United Nations and currently ambassador to
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions, including oil
embargo, on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The five-year long sanctions have damaged Iraqi economy and
hurt a whole generation of children in the country. According to
latest report of the World Food Program, four million or one fifth
of the Iraqi population suffer from severe malnutrition. They
include 2.4 million children under the age of five and 600,000
pregnant and nursing women. Deaths from malnutrition increased
eight folds among children under the age of five since the
economic sanctions came into effect.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation there,
the Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export petroleum worth two billion dollars in six
months for import of food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, however, refused to implement the
resolution, saying the strict monitoring and other conditions for
oil export violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali had repeatedly urged Iraqi side to hold
talks on oil export following resolution 986. On January 16, Iraqi
representative to the U.N. told some members of the Security
Council that Iraq was ready to negotiate with the U.N. on the oil
export issue. The secretary-general has responded positively and
made preparations since receiving the message from the Iraqi
government.

<HEADLINE> NATO Commander Optimistic about Peace Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy Admiral and
Commander of the NATO peace implementation force in Bosnia,
Leighton Smith, said here today that he was optimistic about the
success of the NATO operation in the former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House, Smith said that the rival parties in
Bosnia have been cooperating with the U.S.-led NATO troops and
chances of a major military confrontation involving U.S. forces
seem to be little.
</P>
<P>
"I can't guarantee the American people that we're not going to
see casualties because of road traffic accidents or mines or
snipers," he said. "But I can tell you the cooperation we have
been seeing tells me we will not see a force-on-force situation."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the three greatest risks facing the NATO troops
are land mines, dangerous roads and "rogue elements."
</P>
<P>
In what was described as the deadliest day of the NATO mission
in the region, three British sodliers were killed Sunday when
their vehicle exploded on a land mine. In a Separate incident, one
Swedish soldier was killed and two others were injured when their
armored personnel carrier slid off a road.
</P>
<P>
An American soldier was grazed by a bullet that Smith
presumably said came from a sniper's gun.
</P>
<P>
The 60,000 NAT0-led multination troops began entering into the
Balkan state after the three presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and
Serbia signed a peace treaty to end the three and half year war in
the region on December 14 in Paris. The NATO troops are reportedly
scheduled to complete their deployment in Bosnia by mid-February.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
appointed today State Minister Ibrahim Bin Abdel Aziz Al-Assaf as
Finance and National Economy Minister, the Saudi Press Agency
(SPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
SPA said the royal decree charged the Deputy Prime Minister
and Head of the National Guards, Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz,
with carrying out the order.
</P>
<P>
The decree was signed by Prince Abdullah on behalf of the
King. Prince Abdullah was assigned by the Monarch to run the
kingdom's affairs late December so that King Fahd would have some
rest after last November's announcement that the King was
indisposed.
</P>
<P>
This was the first royal decree issued by King Fahd since his
deputy started to run the state, SPA said.
</P>
<P>
It said the finance portfolio had been unoccupied since the
ex-minister, Sulaiman Abdel-Aziz Al-Sulaiman, resigned in last
October because of his illness, only two months after he was
appointed in a major cabinet reshuffle in August.
</P>
<P>
State Minister Abdul Aziz Al-Khoweiter ran the Finance
Ministry until he was appointed as Deputy Finance and National
Economy Minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Trade Against Yen Faces New Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar's ability to
trade higher against the yen may be tested again this week after
the U.S. currency rose earlier last week to its highest level
against the Japanese yen in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to more than 106 yen after Japan reported its
foreign trade surplus shrank last year, the "Journal of Commerce"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The test on the U.S. dollar may come from profit-takers and
traders who have been influenced by remarks from economists
predicting higher Japanese interest rates, the paper quoted
analysts and dealers as saying.
</P>
<P>
C. Fred Bergsten, a former U.S. Treasury official, said that
Japanese interest rates will rise while U.S. rates decline
further.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese yen may rise to 100 and possibly into the 90s
against the dollar this year, due to a pickup in Japanese rates
and reductions in U.S. interest charges," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted Japan's economy could advance "modestly,"
which should also lead to higher interest rates there. When
coupled with a slowing U.S. economy and declining U.S. interest
rates, the yen could also strengthen, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. treasury would not want to see the dollar rise "too
much more" against the yen for fear that such a rise would hurt
the U.S. trade position against Japan, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The economists predicted the overall U.S. trade deficit will
remain essentially unchanged this year from 1995 while the
Japanese trade surplus will come down " a little more" this year
after declining 10 to 15 billion U.S. dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Greek-Turkish Strained Relations Intensified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The strained relations between
Greece and Turkey have been intensified in the past two days
following a dispute over the sovereignty of the small island of
Imia in eastern Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today that
Greece's response to Turkish "aggressive nationalism" would be
"strong, immediate and effective".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek armed forces were put on higher alert in
the vicinity of the island. Greek navy vessels are patrolling the
sea region near Imia.
</P>
<P>
According to informed sources, a Turkish helicopter tried to
approach the rocky islet this morning and was intercepted by Greek
warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Three Turkish journalists landed on the deserted Greek island
of Imia on Saturday and replaced the Greek flag with a Turkish
one.
</P>
<P>
Greek foreign minister Theodoros Pangalos summoned the Turkish
ambassador in Athens on Sunday evening and warned him the flag-
replacing incident would have a detrimental impact on relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
the latest row between the two neighboring countries, which
have long been at odds over a number of issues, including the the
Turkish occupation of northern Cyprus and airspace as well as
mineral rights in the Aegean, began on December 26 when a Turkish
freighter ran aground on the island. The ship captain rejected
assistance by a Greek tug and said he was on the Turkish
territory.
</P>
<P>
Greek side declared that its sovereignty over the islet of Imia
cannot be called into question.
</P>
<P>
Turkish foreign ministry conveyed through the Greek embassy
recently its position regarding the delineation of territorial
waters in the Dodecanese region, saying the islet of Imia falls
within the administrative limits of the Turkish province of Mugla.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian government
today condemned Niger's coup d'etat and called for "an
immediately return to democratic rule".
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry expressed "deep concern and
disappointment" over the coup, saying it reflected a "worrying
trend of military takeovers of African governments".
</P>
<P>
The coup soldiers overthrew President Mahamane Ousmane and
selected Chief of General Staff Lieutenant-Colonel Ibrahim Bare
Minassara as head of the interim military government, which has
declared that it would not cling to power and promised to hand
over to civil rule at an early date.
</P>
<P>
"No matter what the justification, the latest military
takeover in Niger cannot, by any means, be condoned or
tolerated", said a press release from the foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
"At this time when Africa is undergoing democratic
transformation and is in the process of consolidating the rule of
law, military takeover in Niger can only be viewed as a source of
deep frustration and profound concern for all Africans," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is from this spirit that Ethiopia calls for the speedy
restoration of the constitutional order in Niger," it said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Calls For Child Protection From Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today called on the international community to adopt
urgent steps to protect children from armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a United Nations eminent persons group meeting in
Somerset West, Western Cape Province, Mandela said humanity was
overdue in mobilising all the resources to protect children and
ensure that they lead a normal, healthy and happy life.
</P>
<P>
The UN group is in South Africa on a mission to study the
impact of armed conflicts on children.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said it was extremely disheartening that 2 million
children had been killed, 4 million disabled and 12 million left
homeless in armed conflicts all over the world in the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
"We join you in asserting that the standards which presently
govern conflict are inadequate and something must be done, and
done urgently, to protect children in situations of conflict,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela demanded the severest punishment for crimes against
chieldren and women, who usually fall easy vitims to armed
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the international tribunals dealing with the latest
conflicts in central Africa and central Europe would make an
example of those who had descended to what he described as the
lowest levels of barbarity.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Provides Incentives to Local Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government decided
today to provide special incentives to local industries to help
them tackle the serious problems arising from implementation of
GATT accord and Cyprus' efforts to join the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The government has decided to offer low interest rate and
long-term loans as well as some kind of subsidy to industrial
units," said Commerce, Industry and Tourism Minister Kyriakos
Christophi after a meeting of interested parties with Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
The loan scheme will cover the period between 1995 to 1998 and
will involve investment over 25,000 Cyprus pounds (about 50,000
U.S. dollars) in the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
The government subsidy will be 20 percent of the investment
with a ceiling of 150,000 pounds (about 300,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Christophi said the government will need to table a
supplementary budget in the House of Representatives to cover the
cost of the loans and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou, who attended
Monday's meeting, described this effort as "a very important move
to boost the manufacturing industry."
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated his call for increased productivity and
management improvement.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the government's decision, President of the Cyprus
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Phanos Epiphaniou said the
government had taken a "correct and positive step in dealing with
the problems the local industries are facing."
</P>
<P>
According to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade)
accord reached in Marrakesh in 1994, over 118 countries agreed to
reduce quotas and subsidies on imported goods in a bid to allow
for a more liberalized and free global trading environment.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has undertaken to reduce subsidies on goods destined
for exports as well as to reduce the subsidy that the government
provides to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cyprus has also signed a customs union agreement
with the EU, which envisages reduction of tariffs especially on EU
goods and the implementation of a Common Tariff Policy as regards
to third countries.

WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin pledged here today to continue market reform
in Russia despite difficulties and recent personnel changes in the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"The reform process is not under doubt. The market reform will
continue," Chernomyrdin said at the start of a meeting with U.S.
Vice President Al Gore. Chernomyrdin and Gore are co-chairing the
sixth session of the Joint Commission on Technological and
Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian prime minister said that "certain corrections"
will be made in social reform programs.
</P>
<P>
"This is necessary and we have to do this and we will not
deviate from our path," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Gore-Chernomyrdin meeting is the highest-level contact
between the Russian and U.S. governments since December
parliamentary elections in Russia scored big gains for communists.
</P>
<P>
The result of Russian parliamentary elections has caused
serious concern in Washington. The Clinton administration has said
that it would seek commitment by Chernomyrdin to continuing market
reforms in Russia during the joint session.
</P>
<P>
The Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which has met periodically
since its formation in 1993, seeks to foster cooperation between
the two nations in space, energy and high technology. The last
session of the commission was held last year in Moscow.

<HEADLINE> WTO Confirms US Legal Challenge to EU Hormone Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based World Trade
Organization (WTO) confirmed today that Washington had launched
its long-threatened legal challenge to the European Union's ban on
imports of meat treated with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
WTO spokesman Hans Werner said the United States lodged last
Friday a formal request in the WTO for bilateral consultations
with the EU on the issue. This is the first stage in the WTO
dispute settlement procedure which could lead to the creation of a
WTO panel to rule on the case.
</P>
<P>
The EU banned imports of hormone-treated meat in 1988 under
pressure from consumers wary of the health dangers of eating
hormone-treated meat.
</P>
<P>
Washington argues that meat grown with hormones licensed in the
United States is indistinguishable from normal meat and there is
no scientific basis for the EU import ban.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. complaint, the EU ban violates an agreement in
the Uruguay Round multilateral trade accord, which requires that
trade restrictions imposed on health and safety grounds be
justified scientifically if they do not meet international
standards.
</P>
<P>
Under the WTO rules, the U.S. and the EU have 60 days for
bilateral consultations. If no settlement is reached, the U.S.
could ask the WTO to establish an independent panel to examine the
case.
</P>
<P>
According to Washington's estimates, the EU import ban blocks
about 100 million dollars in U.S. meat imports annually. The
hardest-hit is beef, though the ban actually applies to all
hormone-treated meat, even including poultry meat.

<HEADLINE> Updated: UN Decides to Hold Talks with Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has decided to told talks
on the oil-for-food formula from February 6 in New York, the
spokesman for the U.N. chief announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Sylvana Foa said in a statement that the U.N.
delegation will be headed by the Legal Counsel of the United
Nations Under-Secretary-General Hans Corell while the Iraqi side
will be led by Abdul-Amir Al-Anbari, former Iraq's permanent
representative to the United Nations and currently ambassador to
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions, including oil
embargo, on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The five-year long sanctions have damaged Iraqi economy and
hurt a whole generation of children in the country. According to
latest report of the World Food Program, four million or one fifth
of the Iraqi population suffer from severe malnutrition. They
include 2.4 million children under the age of five and 600,000
pregnant and nursing women. Deaths from malnutrition increase
eight folds among children under the age of five since the
economic sanctions came into effect.
</P>
<P>
In order to alleviate the severe humanitarian situation there,
the Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export petroleum worth two billion dollars in six
months for import of food and other necessities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government, however, refused to implement the
resolution, saying the strict monitoring and other conditions for
oil export violated its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali had repeatedly urged Iraqi side to hold
talks on oil export following resolution 986. On January 16, Iraqi
representative to the U.N. told some members of the Security
Council that Iraq was ready to negotiate with the U.N. on the oil
export issue. The secretary-general has responded positively and
made preparations since receiving the message from the Iraqi
government.

<HEADLINE> EU Likely to Recognize Belgrade Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain, France and other
European Union countries are expected to recosgnize Belgrade this
week, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The move, which is likely to be agreed to at the EU foreign
ministers' meeting in Brussels today and tomorrow, was aimed at
rewarding Belgrade for its role in the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
London and Paris are leading the drive to recognize Belgrade
because they want all the former Yugoslav republics to be treated
the same, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Serbia and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia must first
recognize one another before the EU's recognition goes ahead, and
western sources said this was almost certain to happen.
</P>
<P>
The sources said they were expecting mutual recognition between
the two states to take place by today.

<HEADLINE> Tel Aviv, Jerusalem Mayors Call for Likud-PLO Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Mayors of Jerusalem and
Tel Aviv, both from the Likud party, said today that the
Likud must realize the current political reality and open
a dialogue with the PLO, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, a Likud Knesset (Israel's
parliament) member, said that if the Likud wins the next
general elections, it has to continue the peace process where
the incumbent government leaves it.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo said that the peace agreements
signed with the PLO are political facts that can not be ignored
and that he hopes his Likud colleagues will agree to adopt
such a position.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu told party
members that "we are willing to talk to the Palestinians as
we talk to any Arabs, but we demand any interlocutor that he
fully accept Israel's right to exist."
</P>
<P>
"If the Palestinians do not convince us that they are a
real partner for peace, and they don't seem intent on doing
so, then they cannot be treated as a partner for peace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he will "not send the army to reoccupy
the cities handed over to the PLO. However, he said that "in
Jerusalem, I will close down the Orient House and all other
PLO institutions and will see to it that no more territory
is handed over to (PLO Chairman Yasser) Arafat."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the clear task before the Likud now
"is to preempt the establishment of a Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
"If Labor wins the coming elections, it is a certainty
that the Palestinian state will come into the world, that
Israel will cede every inch of the Golan, retreat to the
shores of Lake Kinneret, and that Jerusalem will be divided,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the Likud is elected, there will be no Palestinian
state and the autonomy will be contained, the Golan will
remain in Israel's hands and Jerusalem in its entirety will
be Israel's capital," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Sharp Decline in Leprosy Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has recently reported a sharp decline in leprosy cases
globally, from 5.5 million in 1991 to about 1.8 million in 1995,
down 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
A WHO report, which was issued last weekend, said that it would
be possible to eradicate the disease globally as a public health
problem some time in early decades of next century provided
efforts against it continue and the current momentum maintained.
</P>
<P>
The disease that can lead to progressive and permanent damage
to skin, limbs and eyes is endemic in a total of 71 countries
today.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 19 countries are rated as "the most endemic
countries" where 90 percent of all cases occur.
</P>
<P>
They are: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea,
India, Indonesia, Madagascar, Mali, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal,
Niger, Nigeria, Philippines, Sudan, Viet Nam and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The current prevalence rate is estimated at 3 cases per 10,000
population. According to the WHO report, when it falls below one
per 10,000 people in a given country, leprosy will no longer be
considered by WHO as a public health problem.
</P>
<P>
About 560,000 new cases are detected annually. WHO and its
collaborators including several nongovernmental organizations in
the leprosy field expect some 3 million cases to be identified and
cured by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Surpasses 10 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel's overall trade
deficit last year, excluding diamonds, rose 40 percent from 1994
to 10.3 billion U.S. dollars, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The largest gap between exports and imports was recorded in
its trade with the European Union, which registered a
6.6-billion-dollar trade surplus with Israel, according to a
recent report issued by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The balances with the U.S. and Asia were also negative,
totaling 1.5 billion and 900 million dollars
respectively. Compared to 1994, Israel's trade gap with the
U.S. grew by 78 percent and with Asia by 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the diamond industry recorded a 200-million-dollar
 trade surplus, up 4.5 percent. With half of Israel's diamond
exports going to the U.S., Israel had a 450-million-dollar trade
surplus with the U.S. if diamonds were included. However, this
surplus was 55 percent lower than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Israel's trade balance is usually calculated excluding
diamonds, due to the relatively low added value of the industry,
which imports expensive stones before polishing and exporting
them.
</P>
<P>
The overall import of goods totaled 28.3 billion dollars with
diamonds and 23.7 billion dollars without them. Half of the
imported goods, excluding diamonds, originated in the 15-member
European Union, 22 percent in the U.S., and 11 percent in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with the previous year, total imports grew 4.1
billion dollars. A particularly notable rise was registered in
imports from Italy, where the Lira depreciated markedly last year
 compared to all of other major currencies.
</P>
<P>
Notable growth was registered in exports to Holland, Germany,
France and the U.K..

<HEADLINE> RoundUp: Anglo-Irish Relations Deteriorating  (BY Li Wengao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Signs have shown that relations
between the British and Irish governments have become worse since
the international commission in charge of arms decommissioning in
Northern Ireland issued its report on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The two governments were obviously out of harmony as the
international commission's report rejects Britain's pre-condition
for all-party talks on the future of Ulster, namely, the Irish
Republican Army must start to decommission its weapons before its
political wing Sinn Fein can be admitted to all-party
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggests that there be not arms decommissioning
before all-party negotiations and that the twin-track approach to
the installed peace process in the troubled province be carried
out simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major was not satisfied with the
commission's report and he advocated an elective body in Northern
Ireland as a stepping stone to all-party talks, while insisting on
his pre-condition for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton has written to Major urging
him to use the conclusions of the commission's report as the basis
for pursuing the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Bruton did not dismiss out of hand Major's suggestion that
elections in the conflict-torn province could provide a way out of
the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
However, Bruton made it clear that he would prefer both
governments to sign up to the commission's recommendations, which
set out six conditions to which all parties would have to
subscribe.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring on Sunday voiced anger with
Major for proposing elections in Ulster without fully consulting
the Irish government, saying, "We will not be treated in that
manner in the future. We are a sovereign government dealing in
international relations."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Irish Radio, Spring also accused the
British government of attempting to split the Irish coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British government had spread rumors that he
took a harder line on Northern Ireland than his Prime Minister
Bruton.
</P>
<P>
Spring described such rumors as "an old British tactic" of
divide and conquer.
</P>
<P>
He told Irish Radio, "They have made attempts before to divide
Bruton's department and mine, but they have not succeeded."
</P>
<P>
Britain's Ulster Secretary Patrick Mayhew rejected Spring's
accusation, saying that the British government wanted to see
united nationalist opinion both within the Irish government and
outside it.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Britain had no interest in dividing the Irish
coalition.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Calls For Election Postponement In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 29 (xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Zanu
party today called on the government to postpone the presidential
elections scheduled for March this year and to review the
electoral system.
</P>
<P>
Zanu leader Ndabaningi Sithole said his party would
participate in the poll only on the condition that the electoral
machinery is changed to include members of the opposition in the
administration of the poll.
</P>
<P>
"If nothing transpires, we will reconsider our position," said
Sithole, adding that his party would not exclude the option of
boycotting the poll if the government does not accede to the
demands.
</P>
<P>
Sithole is one of two candidates expected to challenge
President Robert Mugabe in the elections scheduled to be held on
March 16 and 17. The other candidate is Abel Muzorewa, president
of the United Parties.
</P>
<P>
With two parliamentary seats, Zanu is the only opposition
party represented in the 150-seat Zimbabwean parliament.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, six other opposition parties announced they would
boycott the elections which they said were bound to be "unfree
and unfair" under the current electoral system which "favored the
ruling Zanu party".

<HEADLINE> Swazis Return From Week-long Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Swazi
workers are responding to King Mswati III's call for the return
to work, indicating the week-long crippling strike is ending.
</P>
<P>
According to the South African Press Association from Mbabane,
capital of Swaziland, a heavy police and military presence was
visible this morning as the Swazi government tried to enforce
King Mswati III's command that his subjects return to work.
</P>
<P>
"That is the only person we are supposed to respect," said a
man waiting for the bus to work early in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Troops were guarding bus ranks while military trucks were seen
ferrying people to work.
</P>
<P>
"I think people have heeded the dictator," Swaziland
Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) President Richard Nxumalo said
in Manzini.
</P>
<P>
The national strike was called by the SFTU on January 22,
demanding for a lifting of a 23-year ban on free political
activities in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland's major towns were last week paralysed by the
strike, which is estimated to have cost the country around 50
million rand (about 13.7 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mswati III declared war on the SFTU on Saturday and ordered
strikers return to work.

ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian troops
traded routine firing along the Line of Control in Kashmir for the
fourth consecutive day today but the overall situation remains
normal, reported the official Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"There are routine skirmishes along the Pakistan-Indian border
but there is no cause for worry, and there has been no casualty,"
APP quoted defense officials as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao intends to
create war hysteria and tension to divert the world attention from
the fluid situation in the India-held Kashmir and also rectify its
fragile position in the wake of upcoming general elections," the
Pakistani officials said.
</P>
<P>
"The Indian rocket attack on a mosque at Kahuta near the Line
of Control in Kashmir Friday, followed by intensified firing, was
meant to deflect attention from the Prithvi test," they added.
</P>
<P>
About 18 people were reportedly killed and 20 others injured
in Friday's attack on the Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"However, Pakistan is fully prepared to thwart any aggression,"
the defense officials said.

denied that Syrian and Lebanese officials discussed Lebanon's
domestic issues during their weekend meeting in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Michel
Al-Murr made the remarks in an apparent attempt to clean up some
skepticism on a conference of the Syrian-Lebanese Higher Council,
which was held in Damascus on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Murr told reporters that the conference as well as discussions
on the its sidelines did not deal with any domestic affairs in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad led their countries' delegation to the conference, which
were also attended by the two countries' speakers of parliament,
prime ministers, defense ministers and foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
All of the participants are members of the Syrian-Lebanese
Higher Council, which was set up as part of a "Treaty of
Brotherhood, Cooperation and Coordination" signed by the two
countries in May, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Murr described the atmosphere of the conference as "good,"
denying that the top Lebanese leaders are trying to hold back
information on the talks in the Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
He said that two separate closed-door meetings, one between
Assad and his Lebanese counterpart Hrawi and another between Assad
and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri, did not deal with any current debate on a proposed
information law and other domestic issues in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He added that the last developments in the Middle East region
was one of the main topics discussed intensively by the leaders
of the two countries during their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Local press today reported that the Syrian and Lebanese leaders
signed four cooperation agreements aimed at encouraging and
protecting investments so as to avoid double taxation and set up
joint border posts.
</P>
<P>
The lake of detailed information sparked skepticism and
concern in some Lebanese circles.
</P>
<P>
Some public media reported that the two sides discussed
Lebanese domestic affairs, such as a proposed electoral law to
regulate parliamentary elections later this year, and a
controversial law aimed at organizing the broadcast media industry
in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Greece to Take Part in Reconstruction in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior official from the Greek
foreign ministry left today for Sarajevo for talks with Bosnian
President Alia Izetbegovic on Greece's intention to provide a 7
million U.S. Dollar credit line for reconstruction projects in the
war-devastated country.
</P>
<P>
Dimitris Platis, head of the foreign ministry department
coordinating bilateral economic cooperation, is carrying a message
to Izetbegovic from Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis and
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry announcement described the message as one of
"friendship and cooperation", mentioning Greece's intention to
open an embassy in Sarajevo as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Greece said in December last year it would provide the sum of 7
million Dollars to Bosnia in the first four months of 1996 for the
execution of high-priority projects by Greek companies,
representing one-tenth of Bosnia's immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
The projects will cover the repair of destroyed infrastructure
works, the dispatch of hygiene-related supplies, and
reconstruction of government services in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been working on setting up a
Bosnia reconstruction fund which hopes to raise 5.1 billion
Dollars in donation to be absorbed over the next three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India today signed
a treaty on the integrated development of a border river before
visiting Indian Minister of External Affairs Pranab Mukherjee left
for home.
</P>
<P>
The treaty on Mahakali river on Nepal's western border settled
the controversial Tanakpur issue between the two countries, Nepali
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty has made provisions for Nepal's rights over
India's Tanakpur hydropower and irrigation project on the border
river, a press communique by the Ministry of Water Resources said
today.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 treaty on the Tanakpur project between the two
governments was not ratified by the Nepali parliament because it
was considered it has not brought about enough benefits for Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the new treaty would serve as a guiding
principle to implement future projects on the border river between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in Nepal, the Indian Minister of
External Affairs also pledged some trade concessions to Nepal and
promised to encourage Indian investment in Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Intensify Tourism Promotion Campaign Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will participate in 90
tourism exhibitions organized abroad as part of its efforts to
step up a campaign to promote the island as a holiday destination
for foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today by Antonakis Anoronikou,
Chairman of Cyprus Tourism Organization (CTO), at a high-level
meeting attended by tourism-related services.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Cyprus will be represented in 89
tourism fairs organized in 30 European countries as well as in
Australia, the U.S., Canada and the Middle East. Special
attention will also be paid to the Central and Eastern European
countries as well as Russia.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Anoronikou stressed the need of raising the
standard of services at hotels and restaurants and of resorting to
"the traditional Cyprus hospitality" in order to face competition.
</P>
<P>
Noting that 1996 will be a difficult year for Cyprus
tourism, Anoronikou said CTO will proceed with a package of
measures, including a stepped up advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said more infrastructure projects and facilities such as
marinas and golf courses are needed to help enrich Cyprus' tourism
program.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that over two million tourists visited the
island during 1995, earning the country a foreign exchange of
around 830 million Cyprus pounds (some 1.66 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Despite a decline of British tourist inflow into the country,
Britain still remains the island's leading tourism market.
</P>
<P>
CTO figures show that tourists from Britain accounted for 46
percent of the total number of tourists to Cyprus in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Asian Cup Soccer Qualifiers to Start in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Top favorites China face
lowly-rated Macao and a Hong Kong team, a magic product out of the
recent soccer turmoils here, takes on the Philippines when the
competitions kick off here Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
That will be the first actions for the Asian Cup Group Two
soccer qualifying tournament here, an event almost to have been
shattered to pieces by conflicts between the Hong Kong Football
Association (HKFA) and a group of rebel First Division clubs.
</P>
<P>
But Stewart Lee Leung-nang, president of the HKFA, could
finally report to the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), after an
 official press conference here this afternoon, that all the four
teams are here for the three-day event that starts tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese were the first to come, arriving here last Friday,
followed by the Macao side Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine were the last to arrive here, this evening.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Hong Kong Professional Football Clubs
(AHKPFC), the organization of the nine rebel senior clubs,
threatened earlier this month to boycott the HKFA for any meetings
and competitions it organizes. The ultimatum, aimed for radical
changes in what the group described as a wrong way in running the
Association and the sport.
</P>
<P>
But, among the troubles and worries the statement caused, the
HKFA managed to reach an agreement last Thursday with the rebel
clubs on forming a Hong Kong team for the Asian Cup meet.
</P>
<P>
If Hong Kong fails to host the event or fails to send a team,
it faces a harsh punishment from the AFC. This was obviously the
key factor in pushing the rebel group back to the negotiation
table and a compromise.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the senior clubs claimed though they had never
mentioned a boycott in Hong Kong's preparations for the Asian Cup
meet.
</P>
<P>
The meet also marks the 10th anniversary of a World Cup
qualifying match between Hong Kong and China, which Hong Kong won
2-1.
</P>
<P>
But the Chinese team is no longer the humiliated one back in
Beijing, while the Hong Kong team, largely weakened by the
rebellious clubs, had just lost four matches in a month -- twice
to China's Guangdong provincial team, once each to the Shanghai
team and a Hong Kong non-resident team.
</P>
<P>
But Tsang Wai-chung, coach of the Hong Kong team, said he was
confident of good teamwork by his players. "They have been
together for so many games and they know what to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Cup meet here has only three competing days, Tuesday,
Thursday and Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
said here today that he is in perfect health and strong enough to
swim across the Tigris River, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a cabinet meeting which he presided over, the president
dismissed as unfounded some recent reports that he was suffering
from cancer.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that the reports, which circulated recently on
speculation about his health, was an attempt to stab the Iraqi
people, deter them from their progressive march and soften their
absolute belief in overcoming the present crisis under the
U.N. embargo, which was imposed on Iraq more than five years ago
following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The president said that it is not his custom to respond to such
fake news, but he viewed it as his moral responsibility towards his
people to reveal the truth and clear away such allegations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is God's greatest blessing that he really
enjoys a good health and has never contracted any disease, except
for some special troubles in 1977, which were completely cured
then by doctors from Cuba, Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union,
Britain, the U.S., Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, elaborate on the "special troubles."
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old president said that although he has a flu once
a year or so, his health is perfect and he is completely capable
of carrying out all of his duties.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that were it not in winter, he could cross the
Tigris river back and forth as he used to do.

ISLAMABAD, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's private foreign
currency deposits, which dipped to nearly 5 billion US dollars by
mid-December 1995, reached 7 billion dollars now.
</P>
<P>
The increase of foreign currency deposits reflects the return

their balances frightened by the rumors of account freezing,
economic analyst M. Ziauddin said here today.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the rumors, all the banks in Pakistan run out of
cash dollars at the end of last year and refused to pay cash
dollars to the customers.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency deposits held by private residents are
regarded as the domestic liquidity by the International Monetary

standby arrangement concluded last month between Pakistan and IMF
for 600 million dollars.

BRUSSELS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The GDP (gross domestic

Dutch exports grew 3.8 percent in the third quarter of 1995

imports rose by five percent in the third quarter of 1995 compared

</P>
<P>
"On balance these developments resulted in a somewhat lower
trade surplus and hence a negative contribution towards economic
growth," Statistics Netherlands said.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1995, however, strong domestic demand made
a positive contribution towards the economic growth of the

HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of hill fires in
Hong Kong in 1995 dropped drastically to 96 from 155 and 221 in
the previous two years, according to the Agriculture and Fisheries
Department (AFD).
</P>
<P>
An AFD spokesman also said today that there were 384 hectares
of the green area destroyed by hill fires in 1995 compared with
1,029 and 2,713 hectares in 1994 and 1993 respectively.

Hill fires destroyed 4,200 trees in 1995 as against 86,200 and
193,400 trees in the previous two years, he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the major factors for the fall was the launch of a
fire-prevention campaign and the people's heightened awareness of
the importance of fire-prevention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the damp weather last year was also helpful to
the implementation of the AFD's hill fire-prevention program.

<P>
ALGIERS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Algerian customs officers have
seized 2.5 tons of narcotics of various kinds for the past three
years, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, customs sources said that the largest
portion of the smuggled narcotics was seized by the customs
authorities on the country's western borders.
</P>
<P>
The eastern border area, however, has recently become the scene
of large scale narcotic smuggling and trade, in view of the tight
government control of the western border with Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The northern borders of Algeria are much less used by narcotic
dealers as compared to the southern, western and eastern borders
where narcotic trade and smuggling are more rampant.

<HEADLINE> Sour Taste Causes Losses to HK's Major Drink Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Vitasoy International
Holdings, one of Hong Kong's largest drink producers, has suffered
losses of 66 million HK dollars (8.48 million US dollars) for the
recent recall of millions of packets of its products.
</P>
<P>
The local media reported today that the 66 million HK dollars
included the cost of recalling 15 million paper-packed products
from the local market and another 15 million from overseas.
</P>
<P>
Last month complaints of sour-tasting Vitasoy products aroused
much public concern, and Vitasoy had to stop production in its
Shenzhen and Hong Kong factories and to recall its paper-packed
products from Hong Kong and overseas.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a Swiss consultant hired by Vitasoy to
investigate the sour taste that led to the recall concluded that
the bacteria found in the products was not harmful to human
health.
</P>
<P>
Vitasoy's factory in the New Territories, which was shut down
for three weeks, resumed normal production late last week, and the
company expects to resume sales by about Friday this week.

<HEADLINE> Officers to Be Stationed in HK Meet Press (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On how to manage the military forces, Liu Zhenwu said that the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) has formed a series of effective
management measures in the process of building and development.
</P>
<P>
Ordinances on internal affairs and discipline and so on have
not only summarized the army's building in the past decades but
also provided a basis for the army's internal activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
An outline of army building at the grass-roots level re-issued
last March by the general staff, general political and general
logistic departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has
put forward specific regulations and demands for the overall
building and scientific management of the army, he said, adding
that the military forces will be governed according to the
ordinances and outline after they enter Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some rules and regulations will also be formulated
for the military forces in accordance with the actual conditions
of Hong Kong and the characteristics of the military forces, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Liu assured the Hong Kong compatriots that all personnel of the
military forces will be strictly managed by law.
</P>
<P>
When asked how a case of a member of the military forces
breaking the law in Hong Kong would be treated, Zhou Borong said
that the troops would strictly carry out the Basic Law and the
relevant laws of Hong Kong and shoulder the responsibility for
defense affairs in the region.
</P>
<P>
If such a case takes place, he pledged, the lawbreaker will be
punished according to the relevant laws and the army's regulations.
</P>
<P>
Officers and men in the PLA, wherever they are, will be kept
within the bounds of discipline and must abide by laws, he
stressed, and any illegal behavior will not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
On whether the barracks of the military forces will be open to
the public, Zhou said that some of them may be open under the
circumstance that the defence affairs and the normal training
programs are guaranteed to be completed.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question raised by a reporter from Hong Kong
whether the British army's barracks facilities will be used by the
military forces for the real estate business besides defence
purpose, Xiong Ziren said that there are clear stipulations in an
agreement reached between China and Britain in June, 1994, on the
future use of the land for military purpose in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the military forces to be stationed in the
Hong Kong SAR will earnestly observe each clause of the agreement
and will neither use their barracks for non-military purpose, nor
engage in any commercial activities.
</P>
<P>
Xiong also corrected the allege that the Military Forces will
be stationed in Hong Kong ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Military Forces would take the responsibility
of safeguarding Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, according to the
Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law, and they would
not go to Hong Kong in advance.
</P>
<P>
Before July 1, 1997, he said, a small number of members of the
Military Forces may go to Hong Kong to make preparations for the
transfer of defence affairs. But details of the arrangements will
be discussed by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some other questions were answered by Lu Zhenwu
and Xiong Ziren. Zhou Borong also answered questions raised by
Hong Kong reporters in fluent English.

<HEADLINE> Hostages' Whereabouts Still Unclear in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The military authorities in
Irian Jaya, Indonesia, are still in the dark about the whereabouts
of the 13 people kidnapped by the Free Papua Movement (OPM) gang
since January 8.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian troops surrounded the OPM hideout and were
making every effort to prevent the abductors and the hostages from
leaving the Mapunduma village, the hideout, until last week,
according to reports reaching here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The OPM abducted 26 people including seven foreigners on
January 8 and 13 of the hostages were released later on. At
present, 13 hostages including six foreigners are still in the
hand of the OPM, which is demanding government recognition of a
separate West Papua state in Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Jakarta has flatly turned down the demand, saying that the
majority of Irianese have chosen to be part of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The military did not know if the OPM abductors and the 13
hostages were still at the same hideout or had moved to another
place, since the OPM cut communication contact with them since
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the director of the armed forces intelligence
division, Brig. Gen. Zacky Anwar Makarim, the troops had
established a stratified blocking system to prevent the kidnappers
from leaving the village.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that there are areas which the military
cannot cover.
</P>
<P>
Zacky said there was no possibility of a military operation to
free the hostages.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's tourism industry
witnessed one of the highest growths in the world during the
country's Eight Five-Year-Plan period (1991-1995), latest
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Overseas tourist arrivals in the past five years amounted to
212 million people, among whom 22.43 million were foreign tourists
and 33.96 million were overseas tourists on organized tours. These
were average annual growth rates of 11.1, 27.5 and 13.5 percent
respectively, much higher than the 4.25 percent annual rise of the
worldwide tourism sector, a national tourism meeting, which opened
here today, was told.
</P>
<P>
The country earned a total of 27.5 billion US dollars from
tourism in the past five years, an annual rise of 31.4 percent,
which was also much higher than the world's average growth rate of
5.47 percent in tourism income, putting China in tenth place from
24th in this respect.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic tourism also developed rapidly in the same
period, as 2.2 billion Chinese people travelled within the
country, an annual growth of 18.9 percent, 14 percentage points
higher than during the Seventh Five-Year Plan period (1986-1990).
</P>
<P>
The domestic tourism industry earned a total of 371.3 billion
yuan (44.7 billion US dollars) in the period, an annual rise of
50.2 percent, over 30 percentage points higher than in the
previous five years.
</P>
<P>
Travel agencies have mushroomed in the past five years, hitting
4,926 by the end of 1995, which was three times the figure during
the previous Five-Year Plan.
</P>
<P>
Hotels catering to overseas tourists increased by over 1,000,
adding 150,000 rooms, bringing the total beds to one million, a
rise of 58.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
By efforts to diversify tourist programs, the traditional
products such as landscape, cultural and historical relics, and
folklore programs were renewed. Meanwhile, special sightseeing and
participation-oriented sightseeing programs were provided,
including hunting, calligraphy, etc.
</P>
<P>
The industry also began to develop holiday resort tours and
other special tours by building 12 state-level holiday resorts and
54 provincial resorts in additional to a number of resorts around
major tourist cities.
</P>
<P>
The sector has been providing increasing job opportunities by
employing an estimated five million people so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Over 60 percent of the area of
the economically booming Jiangsu Province is now open to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
This coastal province has turned into an economic giant of the
country with efforts made over the past decade or so.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that both foreign trade volume and foreign
investment pumped into the province have been maintaining annual
growth rates of 30 percent and 60 percent, respectively, over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
Local enterprises with export autonomy exported goods worth
16.54 billion US dollars in 1995, up 28.1 percent from the
previous year. And foreign investment pledged that year stood at
5.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that the success is closedly associated
with the practice that the provincial government has continued to
delegate power to the grass-roots so as to arouse their enthusiasm
for the opening-up drive.
</P>
<P>
Of the 64 counties and county-level cities in the province, 47
can directly handle imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 11 national and 52 provincial development
zones with 17,372 projects, 3,665 of which are funded by overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Singaporean Suzhou Industrial Park, for instance,
alone approved 52 projects last year, involving contractual
capital of 1.26 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 6,000 enterprises in these development zones have
started business, which have made handsome profits.
</P>
<P>
To make its investment environment more appealing to overseas
businessmen, the province has injected huge amounts of funds to
upgrade its infrastructure facilities over the past few years.

<HEADLINE> China's Law on Police Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The newly issued Regulations on
the Use of Apparatus and Weapons by the Police of the People's
Republic of China have authorized Chinese police to use apparatus
and weapons in accordance with the law while performing their
duties.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Public Security made
this remark at a press conference here today, adding that the
regulations aim to safeguard the power of the police when using
apparatus and weapons while performing their duties so as to
better crack down on criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the regulations also strengthen supervision over the
police when they are using apparatus and weapons, in an attempt to
prevent police from abusing their power and protect the citizens'
legitimate rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
The Rules on the Use of Weapons and Apparatus by the People's
Police, approved by China's State Council on July 5, 1980, used to
play an important role in effectively cracking down on criminal
activities.
</P>
<P>
However, great changes have taken place over the past dozen
years in terms of social order and criminal activities. The rules,
therefore, are not suited to the current struggle between police
and criminals.
</P>
<P>
The official said, "The regulations have made some important
additions and amendments to the rules. As a result, they are more

</P>
<P>
The regulations separate apparatus into three categories
according to their functions: some are used for driving away
criminals, some for subduing criminals, and the rest for binding
criminals. And the objects and conditions in which the apparatus
can be used are defined for the three kinds of apparatus
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The regulations emphasize that the use of apparatus should come
to a halt as soon as the relevant criminal activities stop.
</P>
<P>
In terms of weapons, the regulations have some additional
contents, mainly in the light of criminal violence and criminal
activities which severely endanger public security.
</P>
<P>
The regulations provide that police are allowed to use weapons
only when serious criminal activities cannot be stopped without
utilizing them, and even in this case, a warning in advance is a
must.

<HEADLINE> Calm Returns to Mogadishu, Tension Remains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Calm returned to Mogadishu
this morning following Sunday's fierce factional fighting, but
tension remained with street fighters still in defense positions
on the opposite sides of the green line.
</P>
<P>
The fighting, the heaviest in the Somali capital of Mogadishu
in five months, pitted militiamen of the Abgal clan against those
of the Murusade clan. It started on Sunday Morning and ended late
into the day.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu's main hospitals said 31 people were killed in the
fighting, with more than 60 others wounded. Most of the wounded
were civilians hit by stray rounds of bullets or mortars.
</P>
<P>
The hospitals, complaining about a shortage of medicine
supplies especially the antibiotics, Vitamin K and bandages,
appealed for emergency assistance to deal with the war victims.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 families fled their homes near the green line,
witnesses said, and some of them moving elderly relatives in
wheelbarrows or carrying them on their backs.
</P>
<P>
No traffic movement has started in the war-torn city so far,
but pedestrians are seen walking along freely.
</P>
<P>
No official peace dialogue has yet begun, but sources close to
the warring parties said secret peace talks are on between the
opposing sides. Religious leaders are said to be involved in what
the public see as a spontaneous ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Neither of the factional radios supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed
or General Mohamed Farah Aideed has mentioned the fighting and
they just continue with their ordinary programs.
</P>
<P>
The fighting started with clashes among Abgal supporters of
north Mogadishu faction leader Ali Mahdi and later pitted the
Abgals against their rival, the Murusade.
</P>
<P>
The animosity between the two clans is attributed to the
political differences between their political leaders Mohamed
Qanyare Afrah of Murusade, the interior minister of Aideed's
south Mogadishu government, and Ali Mahdi of Abgal.
</P>
<P>
Both Murusade and Abgal clans belong to the Hawiye tribe.
</P>
<P>
Earliers reports said scores of people have been killed this
month in factional fighting in the Horn of Africa country.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been without a central government since rebels led
by Ali Mahdi and his former ally Aideed ousted late President
Mohamed Siad Barre in early 1991. The rebels later turned the
guns on each other in fighting which laid waste to the country.

<HEADLINE> Army Paper Hails Formation of Military Forces To Be Stationed in HK SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Liberation Army Daily
editorial to be published tomorrow says that stationing Chinese
military forces in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) is of great political significance and the unit is expected
to face a serious test.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA)
says that the organization of the unit is a major event not only
in the country's political life, but also in the history of the
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The editorial explains that the stationing of the Chinese
military forces in the Hong Kong SAR on July 1, 1997, is an
important symbol of China's resumption of the exercise of its
sovereignty over Hong Kong, and "It is perfectly justified that
the Chinese government stations its own troops in regions under
its jurisdiction."
</P>
<P>
After noting that Hong Kong has been a part of Chinese
territory since ancient times and explaining efforts the Chinese
government has made to resume the exercise of its sovereignty over
the region, the editorial emphasizes that the unit's being
stationed there is a glorious task with great political
significance.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasizes the importance of the military forces
to appear in Hong Kong with a fine image aftering being stationed
there, saying that this will not only win the support of the Hong
Kong compatriots, but also help enhance the reputation and
prestige of the PLA as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The editorial appeals to every soldier to be stationed in Hong
Kong to cherish the PLA's glory as they cherish their own eyes, so
that the Hong Kong compatriots will come to see, with the unit as
a "window", that the PLA is indeed loyal to the country and the
nation, and loves and serves the people, and is highly disciplined
and powerful.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that the PLA unit also faces a new and
serious test.
</P>
<P>
Based on the principle of "One Country, Two Systems", Hong
Kong's capitalist system and way of life will remain unchanged for
50 years. Thus the Chinese military forces to be stationed in Hong
Kong will face a new and complicated environment.
</P>
<P>
It emphasizes that stricter demands and higher standards in all
aspects should be set for the unit in the Hong Kong SAR than for
other units stationed on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the Hong Kong SAR unit must be built up in
accordance with requirements put forward by Chairman of the
Central Military Commission Jiang Zemin, calling on troops to be
"politically qualified, militarily perfect, with a fine style of
work, highly disciplined and with sufficient logistical support".
</P>
<P>
The editorial concludes by saying that all officers and men in
the military forces to be stationed in Hong Kong shoulder historic
responsibility and great trust of the nation.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Garment Base Formed in Yangtze Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest base for
garment production is taking shape in the Yangtze River Delta, one
of the country's most rapidly growing economic areas, generating
35 percent of the nation's garment output.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the China Garments Association (CGA)
show that the country made 4.1 billion garments in the first 11
months of 1995, while the delta, comprising parts of two provinces
and the municipality of Shanghai, tailored 1.4 billion garments
altogether. Some 470 million were made by the Jiangsu Province
section of the delta, 274 million by Shanghai and 653 million by
the Zhejiang Province section.
</P>
<P>
Boasting industrial power enough to influence the whole
country's garment prices, as well as a skyrocketing economy, the
delta has developed into a hotbed for China's top garment brands,
where the country's fashion trends are created.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, chairman of the executive board of CGA, noted
that the delta has initially built up a capital- and
technology-intensive garment industry enabling it to "carry out
close competition with foreign brands" on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
To create more leading domestic brands, the China National
Textile Council will launch a "Top Brand Program" in the next five
years, so as to give more assistance to the modernization of large
garment enterprises, Dong said, adding that this will provide new
opportunities for the delta's booming garment industry.

<P>
JAKARTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has granted a
financial assistance worth 250 billion rupiah (108 million US
dollars) for a coral reef conservation program in several
provinces of Indonesia, including Southeast Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be given in stages for the next five years,
reported Antara today from Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi, quoting
spokesman for the local administration Djamaluddin Safaa.
</P>
<P>
The fund is aimed at assisting efforts on coral reefs
conservation and covering training programs on marine safety and
sea law implementation.
</P>
<P>
Safaa said that most of the fund will be used in conservation
programs in Buton regency and Tukang Besi island where the central
government in October last year declared the waters of the
800,000-hectare Tukang Besi island a protected national underwater
park.
</P>
<P>
The government and local administrations are determined to
protect resources of coral reef. Some damage to coral reefs is
man-made, such as a widespread use of chemicals by people in
fishing.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian scientific institution said that only 20 percent
of the country's coral reefs are in good condition.

<HEADLINE> Millions to Fly to Spring Festival Reunions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Some six million Chinese people
will travel by air for family reunions during this year's Spring
Festival, the New Year's day by the Chinese lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
Taken as one of the most important festivals for Chinese
families every year, the festival will bring a passenger peak to
the country's transportation for about one and a half months.
</P>
<P>
This Spring Festival will fall February 19, and the
corresponding traffic peak will be 50 days, from tomorrow to March
19.
</P>
<P>
As the result of a big-margin price hike for railway tickets in
the fourth quarter last year, the passenger volume of China's
domestic airlines will increase by 20 percent from that during the
last festival, far higher than the growth of passenger numbers
travelling by railways, highways and waterways.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth operation during the passenger peak the Civil
Aviation Administration of China will add 3,618 flights, including
128 to Hong Kong, as well as open charter-flight services if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the administration is stressing safety, requiring all
airlines to conduct overall checks on their airplanes before the
spring traffic peak and pay more attention to daily maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Around this Spring Festival, the passenger volume will reach
1.52 billion person-times, including 143 million person-times by
railways, 1.33 billion person-times by highways and 40 million
person-times by waterways, according to the government's
calculations. All the increase margins of the three transportation
means are no more than six percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen French tourists kidnapped
last Thursday in Marib province, eastern Yemen were freed this

</P>
<P>
Sabaa quoted Interior Minister Hussein Arab as saying that
four of the kidnappers have been arrested and will face trial.

more than 100 kilometers east of Sanaa.
</P>
<P>
One of the French tourists was freed Saturday, Sabaa said.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni authorities had threatened to attack the kidnappers
from the al-Aslam tribe if they failed to release the French
tourists by midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement was reached before the midnight deadline to
release them by 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) Monday.

<HEADLINE> Year of Safety and Development for China's Civil Aviation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The past year has been a year
of safety and development for the civil aviation industry of
China, a senior official in the field said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC), pointed out that 1995 was the first year without
flight accidents in eight years. "So far we have flown safely for
1.28 million hours in a period of 18 months," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen made the remark at a national conference on civil aviation
that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number of passengers hit 51.12 million, a growth
of 26 percent over 1994. Air cargo increased by 22 percent in the
same period to hit 1.01 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the industry spent 6.3 billion yuan on capital
construction and technological upgrading, which was 26.9 percent
up from 1994.
</P>
<P>
1995 saw the going into operation of nine airports in
Shijiazhuang, Zhuhai, Dali and other Chinese cities. This has
increased the nation's total number of airports to 132.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s the civil aviation industry of China has been
growing at an annual rate of 20 percent. The country has the
fastest-expanding aviation market in the world.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the sustained, rapid and healthy development of
the industry, China has been attaching great importance to the
improvement of its infrastructure, including the building and
upgrading of airports and air traffic control systems.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the industry also made a major step in using foreign
capital, Chen said. In December of that year, Hainan Airlines in
south China transferred 25 percent of its shares worth 25 million
US dollars to an investment company controlled by George Soros the
banking giant, thus becoming the first Chinese airline with direct
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the industry used a total of 15 billion US dollars of
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao Airlines has become the first overseas airline
controlled by Chinese capital, with 51 percent of its shares owned
by the China National Aviation Corporation.
</P>
<P>
1995 also saw the approval of China's first civil aviation law,
which is to take effect March 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Aviation Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the Capital
International Airport, China's biggest air traffic hub, is viewed
as the most spectacular project so far in the development of
China's aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
Chen Guangyi, director of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China, said here today that the project, with an initially planned
investment of nearly eight billion yuan, is the most important
project this year in China's efforts to improve its aviation
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Starting in November last year, the project involves the
building of a 242,000-sq-m terminal building, 170,000-sq-m car
park area, 470,000-sq-m plane parking lot and 16 supporting
projects.
</P>
<P>
The whole project is expected to be completed before October
1999, with an ultimate total investment of 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that this year China hopes to complete eight aviation
infrastructure projects, continue with ten projects, the majority
of which are airport expansion or construction items, and start
preparations for two new airports in Shanghai and Guangzhou,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
He said it is expected that China's air carriers will handle a
total of 60 million passengers this year, 1.18 million tons of
cargo and mail, and complete 8.2 billion ton-kms in overall
transport volume, registering growths of 17.4 percent, 16.8
percent and 14.9 percent respectively, compared with last year's
figures.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges International Network Combating Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today directed all related government agencies to step up links
with international police and intelligence organizations to
successfully combat drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten instruction, Ramos stressed the imperatives of
international networking in the drive to wipe out the drug menace
and the threats of international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The president specially wanted the Dangerous Drugs Board of the
Philippines to be more actively involved in all activities and
campaigns against drug traffickers and users.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' directive was prompted by the arrest of a member of an
international drug syndicate on January 27 following the
establishment of an investigation and intelligence network with
police forces from Chinese Taipei and Thailand as well as the
United States Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
The joint action ended up with the seizure of 1.48 kilograms
heroin worth of 1 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Off-side Rule to Be Canceled for 12 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The off-side rule in field
hockey will be canceled for an experimental period of 12 months
from August 5 this year to make the game more attractive for
spectators, according to reports reaching here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by the International Hockey Federation
(FIH) on the final day of the Olympic qualifying tournament. FIH
said the change would go to effect after the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The FIH said it hoped that the move would increase the
attackers' influence upon events and "more goals, fewer whistles
and increased open spaces around the circle will result."
</P>
<P>
There will be also two other experimental rules to be
introduced internationally in August.
</P>
<P>
The changed rules require all players other than the striker to
stand five meters from the ball when it is played at free hits,
hit-ins and corners and that the long corner be taken from a spot
five meters from the corner flag on the sideline.

<HEADLINE> India's JD President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- India's Janata Dal (JD)
President S. R. Bommai today stepped down following pressure on
him to quit his post in the wake of his alleged involvement in the
hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Bihar Chief Minister Laloo Prasad Yadav was elected as the new
president in place of Bommai at a national executive meeting of
the party held here today, the Press Trust of India reported.
</P>
<P>
Bommai's resignation followed a meeting he had with the former
Orissa Chief Minister Biju Patnaik, who was authorized by the
Janata Dal's Political Affairs Committee (PAC) to persuade the JD
chief to quit from the post, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The JD leader's name is purported to have figured in the diary
of hawala kingpin S.K. Jain as one of those who received the
pay-offs in the hawala controversy that is currently rocking the
country.
</P>
<P>
However, no case has been filed so far by the investigation
agencies against the beleaguered JD president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Bommai, who led the party for eight
years, was adamant not to resign as the allegations were not
proved.
</P>
<P>
But members of PAC, JD's supreme decision-making body, were of
the view that Bommai's exit symbolized that a person whose image
was under cloud could not lead the party which formed in the first
place to fight corruption in the country.

<HEADLINE> Turco-Greek Tension Intensified over Island Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Turco-Greek tension caused
by a tiny rock island of Imia (Kardak) in the Aegean has been
intensified when some Turks took off a Greek flag on the island
and hoisted a Turkish flag over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Turkish daily Hurriyet (Freedom), a Greek
naval vessel Sunday changed the Turkish flag with the Greek one on
the island which is not more than 400 to 500 square meters in the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek assault boats are confronting each other near
the tiny island, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Greek Foreign Minister Theodroros Pangalos said that
Turkey's aim was to force Greece to the negotiation table
regarding the status of the rocks and the uninhabited islands in
the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"Turks are using Imia as a new cause of friction," Pangalos
said, "They want to force us to the negotiation table, but we must
insist on our views. I am sure that the recent events have shown
those who advocate talks with Turkey on all issues that they are
wrong."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly preparing to convey its views to Greece
again, stressing that the small island is Turkey's.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Agriculture in mountainous
areas has seen a rapid growth in north China's Hebei Province,
thanks to years of strenuous efforts to transform arid lands.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, the provincial government has transformed
some 750,000 hectares of land in barren hills. Amid the campaign,
some 82,000 hectares of terraced fields and 113,000 hectares of
orchards have been developed.
</P>
<P>
Mountainous areas constitute about half of the province's
total. More than 24 million people, about 38 percent of the
province's population, inhabit in those areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to accelerate the development of its mountainous
regions, the province has stipulated a series of preferential
policies granting more rights to those engaged in the development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some scientific research bodies and personnel were
organized to conduct research work and introduce technology there.
</P>
<P>
Years of efforts have yielded fruitful results, with abundant
resources in the mountains having got fully developed. The
coverage rate of forests has increased to 10 percent in the
province and ecological environment improved.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' annual per-capita income has been boosted to 647
yuan in 1995 from 91 yuan in 1980.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Janata Dal (JD)'s Political
Affairs Committee (PAC) has asked the party's president, S. R.
Bommai, to voluntarily step down from party presidentship in the
wake of his name figuring in the Hawala case, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
An extended meeting of the PAC held here Sunday said even
though Bommai had denied the allegation, he should resign in the
interest of the party's image at this crucial juncture when the
general elections were round the corner.
</P>
<P>
Several JD leaders at the meeting said the party would fail to
gain electoral advantage if Bommai remains as president of the
party.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, former Orissa Chief Minister Biju Patnaik
drove down to Bommai's residence and reportedly conveyed the
committee's views. Both Bommai and Patnaik, who were closeted for
15 minutes, declined to divulge the nature of talks.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to Bommai said he was considering the entire
gamut of the situation and would make a decision shortly.
</P>
<P>
The sources said there was no need for Bommai to step down in
view of his assertion that he had not received funds from the Jain
brothers, either for political or for personal purposes.
</P>
<P>
Bommai and JD parliamentary leader Sharad Yadav were the only
two leaders among the national front-left parties combine (the
third front) who were figured in the Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Yadav quit the Lok Sabha (lower house of parliament) last week.
 His party and left parties such as the Communist Party of India
and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) hope he will step down
so that the third front could make use of the Hawala case in the
coming general elections.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Swedish Trade Ties Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today that the potential for
Sino-Swedish trade ties and economic and technological cooperation
is great.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during the 12th meeting of the Sino-Swedish
joint committee of economic, trade, science and technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Wu sponsored the meeting with Sten Heckcher, Swedish minister
of Industry and Commerce, who arrived here with his party on
Sunday as Wu's guests.
</P>
<P>
As the world's largest developing country, China needs Sweden's
advanced technology, management experience, capital and markets,
while Sweden needs China's markets and commodities, Wu said,
adding the two countries' economies complement each other.
</P>
<P>
With China speeding up its reforms and opening-up, more
opportunities will appear for Swedish products in Chinese markets,
Wu said, expressing the conviction that two-way trade will expand
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, in 1995 Sino-Swedish
trade reached 1.396 billion US dollars' worth, an increase of 5.1
percent over the previous year. China's exports to and imports
from Sweden were valued at 396 million and one billion US dollars,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Wu pointed out, however, that Sweden's total investment in
China is small. In the first nine months of 1995, it invested
45.39 million dollars in 32 projects.
</P>
<P>
She said that China would like to continue to introduce
technology and equipment from Sweden. Last year, it imported 72
items of technology and equipment from Sweden with trade amounting
to 210 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Heckcher spoke highly of China's achievements in its reforms
and opening-up, and said he agreed with Wu that Swedish-Chinese
trade prospects are bright.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Swedish businesses are very interested in the
Chinese market, he said, adding that not only big companies, but
also medium and small businesses are seeking Chinese partners.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Trade Minister On China-EU Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, Chinese minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), called for
efforts at strengthening trade ties between China and the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope here today that the two sides can solve
existing problems in two-way trade through friendly consultations
based on principles of mutual respect and equality.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during the 12th meeting of the Sino-Swedish
joint committee of economic, trade, science, and technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors of the meeting were Wu and Sten Heckcher, Swedish
minister of Industry and Commerce, who arrived here with his party
on Sunday as Wu's guests.
</P>
<P>
Problems in Sino-European trade include EU's discriminative
quotas on China's exports, increasing anti-dumping moves, and
reduction of preferential treatment for China, Wu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customs statistics show that in 1995, China-EU trade
volume reached 50.8 billion US dollars, 15.9 percent more than in
the previous year. China's exports and imports were valued at 23
and 27.8 billion US dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Recent years have seen an increase in investment from EU
countries in China, Wu noted, adding that total investment is
still far less than that of the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the EU is China's major supplier of advanced
technology and equipment, whose supplies account for 43.8 percent
of China's total imports in this field.

YINCHUAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region in southwest China has earmarked four million yuan in
special funds and ten million kg of grain to support
drought-stricken areas during the upcoming Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Because the severest drought in five consecutive years hit a
large part of the region last year, more than one million people
there are having difficulties with their daily lives, and have
little time to prepare for the traditional festival.
</P>
<P>
Local government is calling for donations from government
officials, military officials, and people from other walks of
life. Recently, the Ningxia military regional command provided
more than 60,000 yuan and thousands of pieces of clothing and
other articles of daily use for people suffering there.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, the region has allocated a total of 22.66
million yuan and 75 million kg of grain for people in

<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region has reported faster economic growth than
any other region inhabited by people of minority ethnic groups,
according to a top local official.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi regional government, said
that Guangxi scored an average annual economic growth rate of
nearly 17 percent during the 1991-1995 period, five percentage
points higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
The region's gross domestic product -- the value of goods and
services produced -- reached 166.6 billion yuan in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
the per-capita net income of urban residents was 4,289 yuan
last year, 2,840 yuan more than in 1990, and that of rural
residents 1,446 yuan, an increase of 800 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also cited the following figures to illustrate Guangxi's
economic boom last year:
</P>
<P>
-- Grain production totaled 15.25 million tons, up 69 percent
from 1990;
</P>
<P>
-- Sugar cane output came to 25.4 million tons, nearly double
the 1990 figure;

amount in 1990; and
</P>
<P>

3.13 times the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi's industrial added value came to 58.7 billion yuan in
1995, rising at an annual rate of 28 percent since 1990, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have done our utmost to speed up infrastructure
construction and the development of basic industries, in a bid to
sustain Guangxi's economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The region has invested a total of 130 billion yuan in fixed
assets since 1991, 3.8 times the amount during 1986-1990 period.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 29 key construction projects have been completed,
he said. They include a highway linking the regional capital of
Nanning to Wuzhou, another from Nanning to Pingguo, a railway
between Qinzhou to the port city of Beihai, the Liuzhou and Wuzhou
airports, the Yantan Hydroelectric Power Station and the Liuzhou
Thermal Power Plant.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 Guangxi has added 1,000 km of highways and 98 km of
railways, and has increased its port handling capacity by seven
million tons, and power installed capacity by 2.25 million kw and
telephone switchboard capacity by 1.2 million lines.
</P>
<P>
Imports into and exports from Guangxi have aggregated 10.25
billion US dollars since 1991, 2.7 times the amount during the
1986-1990 period, he said.
</P>
<P>
The region has brought in 3.33 billion US dollars in overseas
since 1991, ranking 11th among China's 30 province-level areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tourism in the region, best known for the
picturesque scenes in Guilin, has earned 507 million US dollars in
hard currency, a 72 percent increase over the total during the
1986-1990 period.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Dallas Cowboys defeated
the Pittsburgh Steelers 27-17 Sunday night at Tempe, Arizona, to
win the 30th Super Bowl of American football.
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, helped by two interceptions at dramatic moments,
became the first team ever to walk away with three Super Bowl
titles in four years and second in history to win five titles.
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys opened the game with a field goal, leading the
Steelers 3-0. The Cowboys continued to widen their lead in the
first half, building an advantage of 13-0.
</P>
<P>
But the Steelers managed to cut their deficit to six points
with a touchdown and was right on track to take control of the
game in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, Larry Brown of Dallas intercepted a pass from
Pittsburgh's Neil O'Donnell and made a 43-yard return to set up a
one-yard touchdown run by his teammate Emmitt Smith. The dramatic
touchdown threw the Steelers back to a distance of 20-7.
</P>
<P>
The Steelers closed up to 20-17 in the fourth quarter and had
the ball with four minutes left. The Cowboys, within an easy
striking distance of the Steelers, were facing the possibility of
a devastating loss.
</P>
<P>
But Brown made another interception, returning it 34 yards to
set up another touchdown at four yards for Smith. The touchdown
secured Cowboys' victory.
</P>
<P>
American football is one of the most popular sports in the
United States and the Super Bowl game is the most heavily wagered
sports event in the nation.

<P>
KATHMANDU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Indian Foreign
Minister Pranab Mukherjee is leaving here today after Nepal-India
bilateral talks on water resources did not reach a conclusion till
late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mukherjee originally planned to leave on Sunday after his
three-day visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-level officials from both countries' Water Resources
and Foreign Ministries held talks on Sunday to discuss the sharing
of water resources between Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiators failed to reach a conclusion, forcing the
Indian foreign minister to postpone his departure schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials participating in the talks said that the major
difference between the two sides was over the utilization of the
water potentials of Mahakali River on Nepal's western border.
</P>
<P>
Nepal wanted to work out a new agreement on the Tanakpur issue
to replace the 1992 Tanakpur Treaty which the Nepali side believes
has not brought about enough benefits to Nepal, they said.
</P>
<P>
The 1992 treaty, signed by the then Nepali prime minister
Girija Prasad Koirala, allowed India to use a small lot of
Nepalese land to build a barrage for its Tanakpur hydropower and
irrigation project.
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian negotiators during Sunday's talks insisted
on reaching an all-encompassing agreement, or an umbrella
agreement, on Mahakali River, which would include the Tanakpur
barrage and other water projects between the two countries on
Nepal's western border.
</P>
<P>
Nepal and India could sign either a new Tanakpur treaty or an
umbrella agreement today before the Indian delegation leaves for
home, according to Nepali officials.

<HEADLINE> Salted Pork Cause of Stomach Cancer: Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese medical researchers
say that long-term eating of salted pork can lead to cancer of the
stomach.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was reached by researchers at the Institute of
Tumor Prevention and Treatment under the Chinese University of
Medicine in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province,
after seven years of research in Zhuanghe Prefecture, where there
is a large number of deaths from stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
In that prefecture of southern Liaoning, which has a population
of more than 800,000, the death rate from stomach cancer is 50 per
100,000 among men, and more than 22 out of 100,000 among women.
</P>
<P>
Because of the lack of refrigeration, people in the prefecture
slaughter pigs during the winter and preserve pork by salting it
to eat for the following year.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that these findings have not been reported so far
in journals outside China.

</P>
<P>
Officials believe the negative increase is a result of the
one-child policy pursued by the metropolis for the past several
years, and is beneficial to Shanghai's economic, social, and
cultural development, but that it brings with it new social
problems, such as the aging of the population.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, Shanghai had a population of 13.04 million,
a rise of 60,000 over the previous year's figure, most of the
increase coming from immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Thai Military Seeks to Keep More Seats in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Thai military is to seek a
compromise with the government to keep more seats in the senate.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers reported today that Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-Archa earlier indicated that only 50 officers would be named
to the body when the term of the present upper house expires on
March 21.
</P>
<P>
Of the senators whose terms expire on the day, more than 150
are retired and serving officers. The reduction would mean a
weakened influence of the military in the body.
</P>
<P>
Supreme commander gen. Viroj Saengsanit said that the quota was
too small and 60 seats for the military would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
The number could be made up with 10 retired officers, he added.

<HEADLINE> Commentary: Mission of Military Forces Stationed in HK SAR (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy is China's state policy
of handling the Hong Kong issue. China will stick to the policy in
dealing with the stationing of forces in the Hong Kong SAR. The
Chinese Government has time and again reaffirmed its stance that
the forces are necessary for safeguarding state security and
maintaining stability and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law clearly states that the forces will not intervene
in local affairs of the Hong Kong Sar. Soldiers and officers must
abide by local laws as well as national laws. In addition to this,
China will draw up a law for the soldiers to perform their duties.
</P>
<P>
The central government places great importance on drawing up
the forces, and began making preparations immediately after the
signing of the joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
The forces consist of PLA ground, naval, and air forces and
have received strict political, military, and disciplinary
trainings.
</P>
<P>
All members were selected with strict standards. To better
prepare them, they have been required to study the Basic Law and
Hong Kong's local laws, customs, economy, geography, as well as
English language.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's citizens have paid close attention to the formation
of the forces. It has been reported that "China has shown great
care for the people of Hong Kong by shouldering the defence burden
while not burdening local people with military spending, and the
Central Government has shown respect for Hong Kong people by
ensuring the quality of the forces."
</P>
<P>
The forces are to be reviewed this morning for the first time
by members of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR. The
soldiers' presence will certainly help increase confidence in the
future of Hong Kong by its citizens.
</P>
<P>
When the PLA's flag is seen in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, Hong
Kong's citizens will see that the contingent is a trustworthy,
and civilized one.

<HEADLINE> Edible Wild Plants Becoming Urban Favorite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- "I'm going to give my family a
treat this weekend," Jiang Yutang, a retired worker, explained,
showing off a basket of millet, sago, and bracken he had just
bought at a local market.
</P>
<P>
Jiang is one of tens of thousands of residents in this capital
of east China's Zhejiang Province, who have been developing a
taste for coarse grains and wild vegetables in their daily meals.
</P>
<P>
"We used to eat wild vegetables and even leaves in the past,
and they were a symbol of poverty and pain, because we didn't have
enough food," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese people who are, like Jiang, in their sixties, had
some experience during the 1950s and 1960s with the famines that
hit most parts of rural China.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, grains like maize, sorghum, millet,
buckwheat, kidney beans and wild vegetables, which had mostly
disappeared from Chinese tables, have become an urban favorite,
even though flour and rice are abundant and fresh vegetables are
available year round in the markets.
</P>
<P>
Also popular for local families, is going by bicycle or local
buses to pick bracken, wild celery, amaranth, and other edible
wild plants during the two-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy eating wild vegetables that I've picked by my own
hands," said Xiao Xiao, a middle-school girl who was with her
parents on one such outing.
</P>
<P>
At the local market, sago sell for five yuan per kg (about 0.6
US dollars) and millet for three yuan, while rice sells for only
about two yuan per kg.
</P>
<P>
Eating coarse grains constitutes a change in the urban people's
diets and this is good for the health, according to local doctors.
</P>
<P>
Edible wild vegetables are free from chemical fertilizers and
pesticides and are rich in proteins and minerals, which are
necessary for good health, they noted.
</P>
<P>
Wild vegetables have also begun to appear on menus in the best
restaurants in many other Chinese cities, and young people have
started following the fashion by eating wild vegetables at
gatherings or even at wedding banquets.
</P>
<P>
In the nation's capital, busy Xidan Vegetable Market, the
largest in the city, and one of the biggest in the country, sold
some 100,000 kg of edible wild vegetables last year.

<P>
BEIJING, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The formation of military
forces to be stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) is an important step in the resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Twelve years ago, senior leader Deng Xiaoping pointed out that
after resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong,
the Chinese government has the right to station military forces
there as a symbol of safeguarding its territory and sovereignty,
but also as a guarantee of Hong Kong's stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR adopted by China's National
People's Congress in 1990 embodies this spirit.
</P>
<P>
British colonialists began the Opium War in 1840 and forced
China to cede Hong Kong by the Treaty of Nanking, marking the
beginning of a long period of bitter suffering and national
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
After more than a century of struggle, China finally had the
strength and got the international reputation that was its due,
and the PRC government signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration
in December of 1984, announcing that it would resume the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
This history, from the first British forces occupying Hong Kong
to the formation of PLA forces to be stationed there, from the
humiliation of signing the Treaty of Nanking to the pride we take
in signing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, is a history of the
Chinese growing from a poor and weak nation to a strong and
prosperous one.
</P>
<P>
It is a history of the Chinese people's struggle for
independence and sovereign integrity.
</P>
<P>
China's resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and the preparation of forces to be stationed in the SAR will not
only wash away this historical stain, provide consolation to our
forerunners and those martyrs who devoted their lives to the
nation, but also mark the beginning of a new era for the "pearl of
the orient."
</P>
<P>
The establishing of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong
SAR and the formation of forces to be stationed there show that
the Chinese Government is quickening its pace of preparing to
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Yemeni Kidnappers Agree to Release French Hostages Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni tribesmen, who kidnapped a
group of 17 French tourists Thursday, agreed in negotiations on
Sunday night to release them soon, Yemeni officials said.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a solution with the kidnappers to hand over
all of the French tourists before dawn Monday," said Abdel Wali
al-Shamiri, Governor of Marib province in north eastern Yemen.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for them now in the city of Hareeb and they are
all expected to arrive in Marib at 7:00 in the morning."
</P>
<P>
Yemeni officials and tribesmen had been conducting talks late
into Sunday night in the Shabwa region where the hostages, aged
between 48 and 85, including 13 women, were held.
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Shamiri had warned that he might use force to
rescue the hostages if the tribe did not release the hostages
unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
A tribal chief said the authorities have arrested a number of
men from the gunmen's tribe and warned the kidnappers that for
every hostage harmed, three tribesmen will pay the price.
</P>
<P>
The group was abducted by five men from the Al-Doman tribe in
Marib, 170 kilometers north of Sanaa and taken to the Shabwa
region, 460 kilometers southeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The tribe demanded the release of a fellow tribe member, Zubein
Doman, jailed three months ago for abducting a U.S. national last
September, and an official apology for his detention made through
the media.
</P>
<P>
Early Saturday, the kidnappers released one French hostage and
one Yemeni driver. But the governor said the released Frenchman
returned to the group on Saturday night because his wife was
still among the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were reportedly being treated well. They were
taking photos of each other with their kidnappers and helping them
pick oranges.

<HEADLINE> Du Pont Arrested After Two-Day Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Millionaire John E. du Pont,
a heir to a chemical fortune, was arrested Sunday after holding
police at bay for two days following his alleged killing of an
Olympic wrestling champion.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont, 57, was captured as he stepped outside his mansion in
Newtown Square, Pennsylvania, to fix his boiler used to heat the
house.
</P>
<P>
Police had shut off the boiler shortly after the standoff began
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont allegedly on Friday shot and killed Dave Schultz, a
1984 Olympic gold medalist, who worked as a wrestling coach for du
Pont's club team based at the 800-acre estate and lived there with
his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
Newtown Township Police Lieutenant Lee Hunter said du Pont
pulled up in his car and opened fire when Schultz was standing
outside his home on the estate grounds, hitting Schultz three
times.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said police had witnesses to the shooting and believed
du Pont was the lone suspect.
</P>
<P>
Police handcuffed the millionaire and brought him to a police
station in a black van, ending a two-day armed standoff between du
Pont, also a known marksman, and 75 police officers.
</P>
<P>
Police now were searching in the house for a 0.38-caliber
revolver they believed was used to shoot Schultz.
</P>
<P>
Neighbours described du Pont as an eccentric man. One woman
said du Pont once drove up to her house in an armored personnel
carrier and asked if her husband could "come out and play."
</P>
<P>
Residents also recalled that du Pont drove two luxury cars into
a pond on his property, one after another.
</P>
<P>
Du Pont is a great-great grandson of E.I. du Pont, who founded
the Du Pont, a giant chemical company, in 1802. The du Pont family
is estimated to be worth more than 10 billion dollars and John du
Pont's fortune was put at about 46.2 million dollars in 1985 by
his ex-wife.

<HEADLINE> Greece Lodges Protest With Turkey Over Land Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece today lodged a protest
with Turkey against Saturday's planting of the Turkish flag on a
disputed Aegean island claimed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
Several Turkish journalists landed on the deserted rock island
of Imia in the eastern Aegean by helicopter on Saturday, took down
the Greek flag and raised the Turkish flag.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos summoned the Turkish
ambassador this evening and warned him the flag-replacing incident
would have a detrimental impact on relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The row began on December 26 when a Turkish ship ran aground on
the island, two nautical miles off the Turkish coast. The Turkish
ship rejected assistance by a Greek tug and said the island
belonged to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the Turkish ship left, Greece planted a national
flag on the island. Then the Turkish journalists turned up to
planet the Turkish flag, but the Greek navy resounded on Sunday by
removing the Turkish flag and re-raising a Greek flag.
</P>
<P>
Greece has told Turkey that Athens has indisputable
sovereignty over the island according to a 1948 accord signed in
Paris. Before 1948, the Dodecannese islands, including Imia, were

<HEADLINE> Rising NZ Dollar Worries Manufacturers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand manufacturers
and exporters are worried about the possibility of a higher NZ
dollar against its Australian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Bank economists believe the NZ dollar could firm toward 92
Australian cents from the present 90 cents, following a three
percent appreciation from 87 Australian cents this month.
</P>
<P>
It is widely predicted that the confirmation at the weekend
that Australia will hold its election on March 2 could provide
more uncertainty for financial markets which are worried about
several key elements of Australia's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
President of the NZ Manufacturers Federation Colin Martin was
quoted by a local press report today as saying that manufacturers
would have to cut costs, and possibly jobs, if the NZ dollar
continued appreciating and eroding export returns.
</P>
<P>
"If the dollar goes well above 90 cents again, then it will be
of real concern to manufacturers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the NZ dollar rise last year, when it
soared to a high of 95 Australian cents, slashing export returns
from Australian markets.
</P>
<P>
Australia is NZ's largest single export market, taking about
one fifth of the country's total exports. It buys an even bigger
percentage of NZ manufactured exports.

<P>
Despite his failure to better his own world record, Kiptanui
still remained to be the king in the event when he clocked 7
minutes 38.71 seconds for the top honour.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan runner hoped to win again in the coming Olympic

Russian Vjacseszlav Sabunyin ran home with the silver in

7:58.46.
</P>

The men's long-jumping race has attracted four of the top six
finishers at the world athletics championships last year.
</P>
<P>
James Beckford of Jamaica got the gold medal with a jump of
8.36 meters, beating Ivan Pedroso of Cuba to second in 8.27 meters.

</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review

US dollars in "hot money" capital flows from the maturely
developed economies this year, according to a London-based

The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>

cabling.

5.5 billion Aussie dollars (about 4 billion US dollars) a year,

LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Jack Charlton, the legendary
soccer hero, said here Sunday he would be willing to replace Terry
Venables as the England coach.
</P>
<P>
Charlton, a member of England's 1966 World Cup winning team,
was reported as saying if the English Football Association asked
for his help, he could not refuse to give it.
</P>
<P>
"If they came in and said the job is yours if you want it, as
an Englishman you would not be able to say no," said Charlton, who
resigned as manager of Ireland last month.
</P>
<P>
The current England coach Venables declared earlier this month
that he would step down after the European Championship because of
the pressing legal cases against him.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring has accused the British government of deliberately trying
to cause splits within the Irish government.
</P>
<P>
Spring is quoted by the BBC television as saying today that
Britain's proposal for holding elections in Northern Ireland
before all-party talks was an attempt of implementing "divide and
conquer" tactics.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Whitehall had tried to split him from Irish Prime
Minister John Bruton on the Ulster peace process and "that has
been an old British tactic down through the years.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed, "they had not succeeded and I think it is
obvious that Mr Bruton and myself work very closely together in
dealing with Anglo-Irish problems."
</P>
<P>
Spring said that an election in the Northern Ireland was "not
on" because of distrust in the region after years of civil and
political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that Northern Ireland's Irish Catholic
minority fear the elections could lead to a return to old-style
domination by a pro-British Protestant majority.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Joins Effort To Wipe Out Guinea-Worm In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 28 (Xinhua) -- Over 2,000 Nigerian school
teachers have joined local government's effort to wipe out the
guinea-worm disease this year, an official of a relief agency
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The effort is aimed at making school children more aware of
the disease," said Professor Eka Braide, an official of Global
2000, an international agency targeted to eradicate the
guinea-worm worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Eka said the teachers were enlisted on the Nigeria Guinea-Worm
Eradication Program of the country's southeast region which
includes eight of the country's 30 states.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 278,635 cases of guine-worm was reported in the
eight states in 1988 when the program started its operation. The
number dropped to 6,722 cases by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 1,000 health clubs have been formed in
primary schools of the west African country, according to the
professor.
</P>
<P>
He said children's involvement in the program would have a
"ripple effect" on their peers and parents in the government's
target of wiping out the disease.
</P>
<P>
Plans were also under way to step up health education among
villagers and get the primary school syllabus to stress the
dangers of the water-borne disease.
</P>
<P>
And the agency would continue to supply filters and chemicals
for water treatment and train health workers in the villages,
said Eka.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has reduced the cases of guinea-worm by 97 percent by
the end of 1995.
