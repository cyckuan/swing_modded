WASHINGTON: ethics rulings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In voice solicitations and direct mail, fund-raisers invoked the
name ``Starr' and found that long-time supporters of the
Democratic Party and the president were so incensed at the
independent counsel's inquiry that many people gladly contributed
the maximum amount.
</P>
<P>
   In a thank-you letter recently sent to one contributor,
fund-raiser Beth Dozoretz wrote that a donation to the Clinton
Legal Expense Trust is ``different'' from writing a big check to
the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heartfelt support for what the president and first lady
have had to endure is certainly different from your other
contributions,'' Ms. Dozoretz wrote to a supporter. ``Your support
and commitment have been tremendous and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a great number of friends and admirers who
sympathize what he is going through and who think that Ken Starr is
totally out of control,'' said Mark Weiner, a friend of the
Clintons and the treasurer of the Democratic Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause legislative director Meredith McGehee said that the
trust's $10,000 annual contribution limit ``raise questions of
propriety'' if the contributions come from people who conduct
business with the federal government. ``The money should come in
amounts that don't tend to override the campaign contributions
limits and laws,'' Ms. McGehee said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's first legal defense fund was shut down Dec. 31
because its effectiveness was crippled by revelations that it had
been offered, but declined to accept, more than $639,000 in
questionable donations solicited by Yah Lin Trie, a former Arkansas
restaurateur and longtime friend of Clinton. Trie was indicted
earlier this year on charges that he made unlawful contributions,
some from foreign sources. He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The original funds' trustees were forced to testify before a
grand jury and Congressional committees about Trie's donations and
had to fend off a lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch. And as a result,
the fund had to use tens of thousands of dollars intended to defray
the Clintons' legal bills on its own legal fees. In 1997, the fund
took in $79,702 in donations, and had to pay out $92,372 in
administrative and legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictions on the original defense fund were imposed by a
ruling of the Office of Government Ethics, which prohibited any
official connected with it from soliciting funds. The ruling by the
office, a semi-independent agency within the Executive Branch,
deemed the fund and its officers to be extensions of the Clintons
themselves and thus were bound by the same restrictions barring
federal officials from soliciting donations.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund was established independently of the Clinton,
enabling it to solicit and accept larger donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our trust was established, the president and his advisers
felt that he could not accept contributions for political
reasons,'' Michael Cardozo, the executive director of the old fund,
said Wednesday. ``The reality is that the only way to reduce these
legal expenses is to receive contributions in excess of $1,000 per
year per individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the $2 million was raised by Terence McAuliffe, a friend
of the president who chaired the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996 and
chaired the 1997 inaugural committee. McAuliffe was traveling
Wednesday and unavailable for comment. McAuliffe was assisted in
his fund-raising duties by Ms. Dozoretz.

AS DEBATE PERSISTS, NEW STUDY BACKS ATMOSPHERIC WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs for refinements throughout; fixes misleading headline)  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Ala.)   (af/bl)  
 By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As nearly as climatologists can tell by studying measurements
dating back to the 1850s, the earth's average surface temperature
has risen by about one degree over the last century. But
measurements made by orbiting satellites have suggested that the
lower atmosphere is cooling, leading some skeptics to argue that
the world is not warming.
</P>
<P>
   Now two scientists in California have reanalyzed the two-decade
record of satellite data and concluded that it has been distorted
by the inevitable decay, or lowering, of the satellites' orbits as
they encounter atmospheric resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Once this error is corrected, the scientists report Thursday in
the journal Nature, the satellite record shows the atmosphere has
become warmer, but not as much as the surface has.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the study, Frank Wentz and Dr. Matthias Schabel,
atmospheric physicists with Remote Sensing Systems, a private
research firm in Santa Rosa, Calif., report an atmospheric warming
of about 0.13 of a degree Fahrenheit per decade.
</P>
<P>
   The finding could signal ``a sea change in the global warming
debate,'' Dr. James Hansen and four colleagues write in a
commentary that is to appear Friday in the journal Science. Hansen,
the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New
York, has long been an advocate of the view that emissions of
heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide are warming the earth.
</P>
<P>
   If the Wentz-Schabel finding stands up, Hansen said in an
interview, it will make it ``very difficult to deny the reality of
global warming,'' though he and his colleagues note in the Science
article that the finding is likely to be challenged and possibly
revised.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John R. Christy of the University of Alabama, an originator
and keeper of the satellite record, immediately offered a revision.
While Christy called the report, ``real'' and ``legitimate,'' he
said other corrections involving, for example, east-west drift of
the satellites and instrument temperatures had also recently been
made. The net result of all the corrections, he said, shows a very
slight warming in the lower atmosphere, less than the figures
reported in Nature and the reading derived from surface
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Christy acknowledged that this does not necessarily contradict
the surface record. He and others have long maintained that the
temperature profile of the surface and that of the lower atmosphere
would not be expected to be identical, since they differ
physically. Comparing the two records, many scientists say, is like
comparing apples and oranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surface is doing something slightly different from the
atmosphere above,'' Dr. Christy said, ``and that's just the
climate. They do not have to be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has long noted, the surface and satellite data agree
well in many regions, including the Northern Hemisphere continents.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, Christy and a colleague, Dr. Roy Spencer
of NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville have been
using data from weather satellites to put together a continuous
global temperature record. The surface records have many gaps and
inconsistencies resulting from changing methods of measurement.
</P>
<P>
   And although analysts have tried to correct for these, Christy
and Spencer saw their satellite data as having an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   A disadvantage, however, has been that the satellite data record
goes back only to 1979, and many experts say this is too short a
period to detect a meaningful trend. And it has been challenged on
its own methodological grounds, most recently in Thursday's Nature
article.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the new corrections of the satellite record, Christy
had calculated that once the short-lived warming effects of El Nino
and the cooling effects of volcanic eruptions were statistically
removed, the satellite measurements showed an atmospheric warming
trend of about 0.1 degree per decade. Now, with corrections in
place, he calculates it at 0.05 degree to 0.18 degree per decade.
This compares with about 0.25 of a degree for the surface record.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that over the long century and a half of the surface
data record the effects of El Nino and volcanic eruptions tend to
cancel each other out and that no adjustment for them is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Even with El Nino and the volcanoes included, Christy said, the
short satellite record now showed a warming trend of 0.07 degree
per decade.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, is because the 1997-98 edition of El Nino warmed
the atmosphere so much that it counterbalanced the cooling effects
of volcano eruptions in the 1980s and early 1990s, which emitted a
haze that reflected sunlight.

BENNY WATERS, 96, WHO PLAYED SWANKY JAZZ FOR 7 DECADES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md., Pa., N.J., France)   (bl)  
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benny Waters, a saxophonist, clarinetist and singer
who was the country's oldest touring jazz musician, died Aug. 11 at
a hospital in Columbia, Md. He was 96 and had recently moved to
Columbia from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, old enough to have taught clarinet to an original member
of Duke Ellington's late 1920s band, was an independent operator to
the end, appearing as a solo artist with ad hoc bands at clubs and
festivals around the world. Performing until late June of this
year, he never failed to enjoy himself in public, making jokes in
different languages, calling tunes faster than his musicians could
remember them, scatting through vocal breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Though his tone became fragile in the last few years, his
phrasing still had the signature of a man who was a contender in
the 1930s; his rounded, swooping alto-saxophone lines and plush
vibrato advertised his authenticity as surely as the stylish
American diction heard in James Cagney movies.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brighton, Md., near Baltimore, Waters started his
musical education at age 5 with organ lessons and soon moved to
reed instruments. While in high school, still in the pre-jazz era,
he played syncopated music with Charlie Miller's band; in his late
teen-age years he attended the Boston Conservatory of Music for
three years, where he studied theory and arranging and gave private
clarinet lessons. Among his pupils was Harry Carney, who went on to
play baritone saxophone with Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   Waters relocated to Philadelphia and then Atlantic City, N.J.,
where in 1926 he joined Charlie Johnson's Paradise Band. Johnson's
band, for which Waters was a soloist and arranger, played dramatic,
exotic music, often for theatrical revues, on a level with the
highest-ranking jazz outfits in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   The band included such other renowned musicians as Jabbo Smith,
Benny Carter and Sidney De Paris. It performed regularly at Small's
Paradise in Harlem, and recorded for Victor until the late 1920s.
As Waters told it, the Johnson band may have passed up a crucial
opportunity to become more famous than it is now: in 1927, Johnson
was offered a long-term residence for his band at the Cotton Club,
with a built-in radio broadcasting setup, but turned down the offer
because the club's wages were too low. Ellington accepted the
engagement and soon thereafter became world-famous.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Waters' heavy drinking saddled him with a roguish
reputation, which may have hindered his career; a conversion to
Christian Science in 1938 tempered his habits. (He finally quit
drinking in 1969.)
</P>
<P>
   After the dissolution of Johnson's band in 1933, for a time
Waters succeeded the premier saxophonist of the day, Coleman
Hawkins, in the reed section of Fletcher Henderson's band, and then
became a freelancer, spending time through the end of the 1940s
playing with Jimmie Lunceford and Hot Lips Page, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, a tour with a Dixieland band led by trombonist Jimmie
Archey took Waters to Europe, and he stayed, living and working
primarily in Paris until 1991, during which time he published a
memoir. When he couldn't get sufficient health insurance coverage
for cataract removal, he moved back to the United States to have
the operation, which was not successful.
</P>
<P>
   In blindness he persevered, averaging 100 dates a year until
this year, making a second-floor apartment in Hollis, Queens, his
home base. He was awarded the Legion of Honor by the French
Ministry of Culture in 1996, and subsequently wore the medal in all
his performances.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine recordings he made in the last two decades, his most
recent is ``Birdland Birthday _ Live at 95'' (Enja), recorded on
his 95th birthday at Birdland in Manhattan.

LATEST VIDEO WAR ERUPTS  
 BY DAN FOST 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BAN DIVX   c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Not since a Scottish scientist cloned a sheep named Dolly has a new
technology sparked such divisions as the war between DVD and Divx,
two new formats for watching movies at home.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Texas videophile has launched a ``Ban Divx'' Web site. A video
industry coalition erected a billboard in San Francisco that
cryptically opposes Divx. Stores that carry Divx titles receive
angry letters and e-mails touting DVD's superiority.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy centers on Divx's pay-per-view scheme, in which
consumers rent video titles that ``self-destruct'' in two days via
digital scrambling.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Video Express, the Circuit City-backed company that
rents and sells Divx titles, touts this as a big selling point
because it eliminates the hassle of returning movies to the video
store. But the downside is a move to metered entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you feel if every time you pop a disc in your
compact disc player, you had to pay for it?'' asks John Giberson,
47, a real estate agent from Flower Mound, Texas, who runs
 &LR; www.bandivx.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``How long before, when Divx gains popularity, you're going to
have pay-per-listen CDs, and pay-per-use CD-ROMs, and
pay-per-everything?''
</P>
<P>
   Divx is a DVD variant that hit the marketplace as an experiment
in the Bay Area and Richmond, Va., in June, and is rolling out
nationally next month.
</P>
<P>
   It comes at the very moment the long-awaited DVD revolution
appears poised to catch on. DVD players are in about 500,000 U.S.
households, with the number expected to grow to 1 million by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DVD, which stands for digital video disc or digital versatile
disc, eclipses video cassettes in movie quality. It offers crisper
picture and better sound, plus features such as freeze frames and
instant rewind.
</P>
<P>
   Divx discs look just like DVDs (and compact discs), &UR;  &LR; but they
only work in special Divx players. They don't offer all the
features of DVD, and they expire 48 hours after they're first used
_ although customers can pay more money for extra viewings or
permanent ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Foes of Divx contend that it represents a step toward Big
Brother, because Digital Video Express can tell what movies each
customer watched, and when. The company says video privacy laws
prevent it from using that information.
</P>
<P>
   Divx opponents also say it's environmentally unsound, because
people can throw out the plastic discs. But Virginia-based Digital
Video Express says it encourages people to keep the discs for
future paid use, &UR;  &LR; recycle them at the rental store, or pass them on
to friends who can pay the smaller renewal fee.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Baisa, 52, of Grass Valley, was looking for a new CD
player and wound up with a Divx machine. She loves the sound, the
picture clarity and the freedom from video store hassles. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``It keeps you from having to go back to the store and return it
and do all that necessary garbage, which I hate to do,'' said
Baisa, an administrative assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Divx has riled the video industry, which sees a
major threat to its way of life. Only Circuit City and Good Guys
carry Divx titles; other giant companies like Tower, Blockbuster
and Hollywood Video don't plan to offer Divx.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Divx is a direct attack on the VHS rental retailer,'' said
John Powers, vice president of DVD market development worldwide for
Burbank-based Warner Home Video.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Video stores like DVD, because they can still rent movies on
disc just as they do on videocassette. But store owners say Digital
Video Express hurts them with its no-return appeal.
</P>
<P>
   A store would make money when it sold a Divx disc, but wouldn't
get any extra money when the viewer renewed a movie or bought it
outright, said John Thrasher, vice president of video sales for
Tower Records/Video/Books in West Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio and the Divx company share that money and the
retailers are shut out,'' he said. ``The amount of money we make on
it is negligible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tower isn't completely opposed to Divx. ``If Divx became the
format of choice, we'd be there,'' said Rick Timmermans, video
regional manager for Tower in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Tower is one of several companies, including Suncoast, Sam
Goody, Hollywood Video and Frye's Electronics, that have lent their
names to Warner Home Video's billboard along Highway 101 near the
Seventh Street exit in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard proclaims, ``Only Open DVD Delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dedicated videophiles know that it means DVD is an
open standard _ so the discs can be played on numerous platforms _
while it takes a veiled swipe at Divx, a ``closed'' standard, where
you can only use one kind of machine.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Divx and DVD aren't in a clear format war, the way
VHS fought and beat Betamax at the dawn of the VCR age. Many
analysts also shy away from bashing Divx, saying it has an
appealing business model that could catch on in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like anything that completely attempts to change the business
model of the industry, it's a hugely risky undertaking,'' said Tom
Adams, president of Adams Media Research in Carmel Valley. ``On the
other hand, it attempts to address the very real issues the video
industry faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said a video industry survey showed that the thing 38
percent of customers hated the most _ almost four times as much as
any other _ was the hassle of returning videos.
</P>
<P>
   Divx's main answer to the complaints is to let those who like
DVD buy DVD, and others can buy Divx.
</P>
<P>
   Will one emerge as a clear winner? ``Any summary judgments on
the market, on whether one platform will win or lose, are
premature,'' said Jae Kim, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in
Carmel.  &LR;

DIGITAL BAY/TOM ABATE  
 LAWYERS WHO'VE DEPOSED BILL GATES AND LIVED TO TELL ABOUT IT 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Not many lawyers have deposed Bill Gates across a conference table.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I asked two members of this tiny club whether they would have
wanted the press and public watching their every move.
</P>
<P>
   Their split decision may help you decide whether allowing the
public to eavesdrop on the antitrust case against Microsoft will
advance the cause of justice or turn the whole affair into a
carnival.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco attorney Sam Miller, who spent two days
questioning Gates in the Justice Department's 1995 antitrust
investigation, said the presence of a peanut gallery would break
the magic spell that an interrogator seeks to cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this works is that you literally sit across the table
from the witness and look them in the eye,'' Miller said. ``You
want to develop a rapport that gets them to answer your
questions,'' even if that means disregarding the defense attorney
who sits beside witnesses, whispering into their ear.
</P>
<P>
   Of course witnesses like Gates aren't stupid. Interrogators
rarely elicit damaging admissions. But the more people in the room,
says Miller, the harder it is to weave that spell between subject
and interrogator that gets at the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Chu, a managing partner at the Los Angeles law firm of
Irell &AMP; Manella, couldn't disagree more. Chu whipped Microsoft in
1994 _ and won a $120 million judgment _ when he convinced a jury
that Microsoft ripped off a patented process for doubling the
density of hard drives from Stac Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have mattered one whit whether or not there were
press present,'' said Chu, who deposed Gates privately before
questioning him on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Chu said his Gates deposition was so dull, he's sure
reporters won't get a whiff of drama _ until and unless the current
antitrust case goes to trial. That's when the trivial questions get
edited out, and Microsoft's powerful chairman will have to face the
issues that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was Gates on the stand?'' Chu said, posing then answering
the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is without question very smart, but there were some in the
courtroom who felt he came across as arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is appealing the order to let the media hear the
depositions. Los Angeles media attorney Karen Frederiksen said
federal case law on the issue is so complex, Microsoft may yet keep
the Fourth Estate out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   I'd love to know what the government attorney who will depose
Gates thinks about the press being there. My sources say that will
probably be Phillip Malone, who works in the antitrust division's
San Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone and his San Francisco colleagues _ proteges all of
Marin antitrust lawyer Gary Spratling _ never leak, an ethical
standard that don't seem to inhibit the loose lips on special
prosecutor Kenneth Starr's staff.
</P>
<P>
   So the only clue as to Malone's thinking comes from the fact
that the government did not oppose the motion by various media
organizations to let the public hear the depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the ex-Justice leaguer now with Folger Levin &AMP; Kahn in
San Francisco, guessed that the government antitrust team may see a
tactical advantage in having the press around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defending lawyers typically do what they can to be disruptive,
and Microsoft's attorneys tend to be very aggressive,'' Miller
said. ``It might reduce the table-pounding if the newspapers were
in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Tough guy: &LR;  I visited Lycos CEO Bob Davis in Mountain View
yesterday, where he was taking possession of his newest
acquisition, the WhoWhere Web site run by former Apple executive
Dale Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   In his very Boston accent, Davis argued that the $133 million
WhoWhere deal would propel his East Coast search engine past its
West Coast competitors like Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek and Inktomi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound arrogant but you can use it anyway,'' Davis
said. ``Excite and Infoseek just don't matter to me. I see
ourselves as overtaking Yahoo in a year or so.''
</P>
<P>
   He said WhoWhere would fuel that drive, because Fuller's
Mountain View outfit had signed up 1.3 million users to develop
personal Web pages. Davis thinks personal Web page publishing is
the next killer app on the Web. And Lycos owns not just WhoWhere
but Tripod, the other 800-pound gorilla of personal publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course you get a different view from the local search
engines, who say Fuller shopped his property around and couldn't
get anybody to bid over $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller joined us in WhoWhere's soundproof black conference room
to extol the virtues of the deal. In the process, he revealed how
the ambitions of former-DMG investment banker Frank Quattrone
indirectly led him to merge into Lycos.
</P>

HASBRO BUYING ALAMEDA'S MICROPROSE  
 BY BENNY EVANGELISTA  

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - HASBRO  Money-losing MicroProse Inc., no longer able to play alone against
bigger rivals in the electronic game industry, agreed to sell
itself to giant toymaker Hasbro Inc. yesterday in a deal worth
about $70 million.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alameda-based MicroProse publishes critically acclaimed personal
computer games like Mech Commander, Civilization and Falcon. The
company reported a net loss of $7.8 million on revenues of $12.2
million yesterday for the first quarter ended June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, MicroProse has made no secret of its intent to
find a buyer. However, the Hasbro deal was worth far less than the
$250 million merger with GT Interactive that was proposed in
October, but fell apart in December.
</P>
<P>
   But in a rapidly consolidating electronic game market in which
players like Cendant Corp. and The Learning Company were getting
bigger by picking off the competition, MicroProse CEO Steve Race
said Hasbro made a fair offer that gives his company the deep
pockets to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to have the financial resources of a
company like Hasbro,'' Race said.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island-based Hasbro, the world's second biggest toymaker
behind Mattel Inc., offered to pay $6 per share for MicroProse
common stock. The deal includes the assumption of debt and
redeemable preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old MicroProse has concentrated on the PC market in
the past two years, with complex, involved strategy game series
like Civilization that attract hard-core gamers. That contrasts
with Hasbro's electronic games, based on its Tonka and Playskool
toys that cater to younger, more casual gamers.
</P>
<P>
   But MicroProse's limited resources prevented the company from
developing its games for other growing platforms like the Sony
Playstation and the Nintendo 64. Those are markets Hasbro plans to
tap with MicroProse's games, said Hasbro Senior Vice President
Wayne Charness.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted MicroProse was the latest in a buying spree for
Hasbro, which is trying to beef up its electronic games business to
complement a strong lineup of classic board games that includes
Monopoly, Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Hasbro added classic Atari video game titles
like Centipede and Pong and bought Tiger Electronics, maker of the
Giga Pets handheld game.
</P>
<P>
   With MicroProse, Hasbro's electronic games revenue could reach
$650 million _ or 20 percent of its sales _ next year, said John
Taylor, electronic game industry analyst with Arcadia Investment
Corp. of Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been really busy building up their library of games,''
Taylor said. ``Hasbro competes against Cendant and Electronic Arts
and everybody else that has got a stake in the games market. This
demonstrates that the old distinction between interactive
playthings and real-world playthings is starting to blur quite a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   MicroProse has 343 employees, including 135 in Alameda. Charness
said the sale could bring an undetermined number of layoffs. Hasbro
plans to keep open MicroProse's four game development studios in
Alameda, Hunt Valley, Md., Chapel Hill, N.C., and Chipping Sodbury,
England.
</P>
<P>
   MicroProse Chairman Gilman Louie will remain as ``chief creative
officer,'' but Race said he's not sure if he will have a job after
the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in MicroProse rose $1.81 to $5.75, while shares in Hasbro
rose $1.25 to $36.50.

HERNANDEZ HAUNTED BY TWO DAUGHTERS LEFT BEHIND IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez won his second major league start
June 9, beating Montreal, 11-1, the first affirmation of his
ability, a showcase of his various arm angles and pitch speeds.
Hernandez returned to the visitors' clubhouse in Olympic Stadium,
sat in a chair at his locker, his back turned to his teammates, and
he began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was quite sure what to say, Jose Cardenal remembers, and
few understood why Hernandez was crying. Cardenal, the New York
Yankees' first-base coach, quietly explained it to manager Joe
Torre and others: Hernandez, who defected from Cuba last December,
badly misses his two children, 7-year-old Yahumara and 2-year-old
Steffi, girls born during Hernandez's first marriage. He wishes
they could be in the United States with him, wishes they could see
him in his new life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for him,'' said Cardenal, who, like Hernandez,
is a native of Cuba. ``He loves his family, and there is nothing he
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, scheduled to start against Texas on Thursday, is
expressive and gregarious, reaching up to tap an acquaintance on
the shoulder when he passes, a greeting in any language. Even when
speaking Spanish through an interpreter, Hernandez will look his
questioner directly in the eye, generally punctuating his answers
with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   But when Cardenal first interpreted a question Wednesday about
Hernandez's two daughters, the pitcher turned his body to the left,
looked down, his run-on answers reduced to a single sentence or
even a word or two. Hernandez said he speaks to his daughters by
telephone as often as he can. He tries not to dream about them, or
think about the situation. Being away from them is very hard.
Yahumara was named after a dear friend, he explained. Steffi was
named after the tennis player Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's face brightened when he was asked about their
personalities. Yahumara is quiet, he said, like most children her
age. Steffi is ``a fireball,'' Cardenal said, interpreting. ``She
doesn't like to take orders.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Steffi's favorite word is ``No''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Si,'' Hernandez said. His smile was brief. And then he was off
to work out.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal watched him leave. ``He says to me all the time how
much he misses them,'' he said. ``I really feel sad for him,
because I know how much he loves his kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardenal probably has more perspective on Hernandez's situation
than anyone on the team. Cardenal left Cuba nearly 40 years ago to
play baseball on a work visa, after Fidel Castro took control in
Cuba but before the doors between the United States and Cuba
closed. He did not see his parents for 19 years, or any of his
siblings, remembering them all that time.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Cuba for a visit in 1979, both of his
parents were much older; his father, Felipe, who had been strong
and healthy when Cardenal first left, was blind. His mother was
also ill. Five years later, Cardenal went back to Cuba for the
funeral of his father, whom he had barely seen through the last
years of his father's life.
</P>
<P>
   The few visits he has had to Cuba have left Cardenal more
saddened than anything; there is never enough time to get
reacquainted with family and friends, only to say hello and
goodbye. ``It was very hard for me to cope with, and for him, it's
worse,'' Cardenal said of Hernandez. ``I can go back to the
country, because when I left, I left legally. I can go back to
Cuba. But his position is much more difficult, because he left
because of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's younger brother Livan pitches for the Florida
Marlins, and there are branches of family and friends from Cuba he
could come to know. But Cardenal wonders how Hernandez will cope
during the off season, when there will be no baseball to distract
him from the thoughts and memories of his daughters.

AFTER 23 YEARS, FARM WORKERS DEMAND DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - UFW.   By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Some Salinas farm workers who have been waiting for a union
contract for 23 years took their case yesterday to San Francisco's
North Beach, where scores of Italian restaurants and groceries sell
the dark green broccoli rabe that they pick.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dozen workers on strike from D'Arrigo Bros. Co. in Salinas
joined about 35 local supporters to protest their long wait for a
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at D'Arrigo _ which grows 95 percent of the country's
broccoli rabe, a pungent, leafy vegetable also known as rape and
often used in Italian cooking _ voted for representation by the
United Farm Workers in 1975. The two sides have held years of
contract talks since then, but they remain far apart on issues such
as whether the company should provide a pension plan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, about 700 of D'Arrigo's 900 field workers held a
one-day walkout to demand a contract, according to the UFW. A
smaller number _ somewhere between 100 and 400, depending on
whether the union or company is counting _ remain on strike this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The strikers accused the company of intentionally stalling the
contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the negotiating committee myself for 12 years.
There have been generations of us trying to negotiate with the
company,'' said Efrain Lara, who has worked at D'Arrigo for a total
of 17 years. ``We are anxious and desperate to get a contract.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arrigo officials insisted yesterday that they have bargained
in good faith, and that the delay is the fault of the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting for a contract proposal from them for
five years, and we just received it in June,'' said marketing
director Nick Pasculli. ``Now, they're expecting us to turn it
around in a couple of weeks. This is an attempt to pressure us to
accept the UFW proposal without time to prepare an adequate
counterresponse.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arrigo is a 75-year-old, family owned firm that grows, ships
and processes vegetables that include not just broccoli rabe, but
regular broccoli and lettuce. It farms 24,000 acres of land in the
Salinas Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The company pays its field workers a base wage of $6.50 an hour.
It says that with piece-rate pay added in, its broccoli rabe
workers averaged $11.03 per hour during the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   However, the current dispute centers less on pay than on
benefits and working conditions. The workers are asking the company
for a joint union/management-run health plan that would be more
generous than the company's current plan. They also have asked for
a pension and a grievance-arbitration procedure, neither of which
D'Arrigo currently provides.

REGGIE JACKSON TALKS OF SPLIT WITH YANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tempestuous 22-year relationship between Reggie
Jackson and George Steinbrenner soured once again last month in a
spat over name-calling, or terms of employment, or perhaps both
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter what happens, Jackson said Wednesday in the New
York Yankees' clubhouse, he and Steinbrenner will always be joined
together as part of the club's tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I don't think it'll be easy to work things,'' Jackson
said, ``I think it could be, because I'm a Yankee.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was at Yankee Stadium to participate in the filming of a
movie in which he plays himself. The movie is set at the time when
Jackson was with the Yankees, and in the scene shot Wednesday,
Jackson stood in right field wearing his retired No. 44, waving to
a crowd of extras who stood and cheered him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was a special assistant for the Yankees before sending a
letter of resignation to Steinbrenner last month, shortly after
Jackson was quoted in a magazine referring to the Yankees' owner
with a vulgarity.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the organization say Steinbrenner was furious about
the reference and pushed to sever the team's relationship with
Jackson, but Jackson said he was already frustrated with his job,
which afforded him almost no decision-making responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't work out the way I wanted it to,'' he said. ``I
wished I could've done more. I was frustrated because I couldn't
make a larger contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says he intends to visit Steinbrenner and try to smooth
over their differences _ a recurring theme in their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner first courted Jackson as a free agent before the
1977 season, disparaging Jackson when he struggled and lauding him
at those many moments when he generated big hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson subsequently left the club as a free agent, and
Steinbrenner has repeatedly said he wished he had kept Jackson.
Ultimately, Jackson was hired as a special assistant, and on his
Hall of Fame plaque he wears a Yankee cap.
</P>
<P>
   That he is no longer with the organization ``is sad,'' Jackson
said. ``I mentioned that to George. He said, `You should stay with
the Yankees.'''
</P>
<P>
   There will be further chapters, no doubt.

BIOTECH GURU HIT WITH FINE  
 BY PETER SINTON 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - INSIDER   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Alejandro Zaffaroni, one of the leaders of the biotechnology
industry in the Bay Area, has agreed with five of his friends and
family members to pay a total of $1.85 million to settle insider
trading charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission said
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zaffaroni agreed to pay a civil penalty of $552,021 for
passing &UR;  &LR; inside information about the January 1995 acquisition of
Palo Alto's Affymax by Glaxo PLC before the deal was publicly
announced. Zaffaroni founded Affymax and was its CEO at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni _ who also founded Alza, Affymetrix and DNAX and
headed pharmaceutical giant Syntex _ was not accused of
intentionally violating U.S. securities laws or personally
benefiting from the news leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Zaffaroni's friends and two family members who received
the information about the merger have agreed to pay back insider
trading profits and interest totaling $746,411 and $552,021 in
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   They include Eugene Farber of Portola Valley, who agreed to pay
$230,510; Nicholas Vida of San Mateo, $83,501; Alba Rose Arzate of
Mexico City, $165,809; and relatives Pedro Zaffaroni and Ines
Romero of Montevideo, Uruguay, will pay $746,973 and $71,639,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleges that following meetings and phone calls with
Zaffaroni, his friends purchased large blocks of Affymax stock in
the two weeks preceding the Glaxo takeover announcement. (After the
deal was announced, Affymax shot from $18 to $29.50 per share.)
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni also told his sister in Uruguay that he could not
attend her 80th birthday because of the pending deal, and she
passed this information on to other relatives who acted on it.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni, who is 75 and lives in Atherton, could not be reached
for comment. But his attorney, Michael Shepard of Heller Ehrman
White &AMP; McAuliffe, said, ``Dr. Zaffaroni made no trades, received
no benefit from any trading by others and did not intentionally tip
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trading in Uruguay was conducted by distant relatives of
Dr. Zaffaroni who took advantage of a social call,'' Shepard added.
He said Zaffaroni settled the case ``to devote his time to science
and charity rather than litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC brings 30 to 40 insider trading actions a year. ``If
anyone would be aware of insider trading laws, it should be
Zaffaroni,'' said SEC attorney Peter Bresnan. ``This is not one
isolated incident that could be described as a slip of the tongue,
but four separate instances of communicating that a company is
being taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   In previous legal actions against Affymax resulting from tips to
friends and family by a legal assistant to the company's general
counsel, the SEC recovered nearly $300,000 in insider trading
profits and penalties.

O'Meara stays 
humble, focused
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It's funny, actually, when Mark O'Meara takes
the time to really think about it. It was only a few months ago
when O'Meara wore the mantle of best player never to win a major.
Now, he's the unquestioned authority on what it takes to be
successful in the big tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a vicious circle, the circle that goes around here,''
O'Meara said. ``First, the fact that I hadn't won a major was the
talk. Then, I win a major and it's, `How do you win the first
major?' And then I win the second major, and it's like, `OK, can he
win the third major?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I don't play good for the rest of my life, it will be,
`How come you can't play good anymore?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that O'Meara was concerned about the prospect. In fact, he
had bigger things on his mind this week at the 1998 PGA
Championship at Sahalee Country Club. Things like becoming the
first man since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three major championships
in one season.
</P>
<P>
   When the first round gets under way today, bringing professional
golf to the Northwest for the first time, O'Meara will be among the
favorites. A footnote when the season began, O'Meara has climbed to
the top of the PGA Tour ranks and has become something of a major
guru, a big-brother type who can counsel the young guys and still
beat the pants off them.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having two major titles, O'Meara hasn't lost any
enthusiasm for winning more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for me to come here and try to play well,''
O'Meara said. ``There will be plenty of pressure on me. I'll be
nervous when I'm out there playing, like I am in any championship.
If I get in contention and have a chance on Sunday, then I'll give
it a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I'm going to try to go for it. There's no reason why
not to. People remember the people who win. You don't remember who
finishes second, third, fourth or fifth. They remember who wins the
golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his accomplishments, O'Meara insists he's not one of the
great players in the game. That's a title he reserves for the
legends like Jack Nicklaus, Byron Nelson and Hogan. Point out that
O'Meara is trying to tie his name with Hogan's forever by taking
three majors in one year, and O'Meara gets almost embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to even have the opportunity or even be tossed around in
that same light as a Mr. Hogan is a tremendous honor,'' O'Meara
said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara also is one of the lucky ones who had the opportunity to
know Hogan. When O'Meara turned pro in 1980, he did so in Fort
Worth at Hogan's office. And O'Meara maintained a relationship with
Hogan and the Hogan company for his first seven years as a
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several occasions where he took me aside or I
watched him hit golf balls or he'd watch me hit golf balls,''
O'Meara said. ``A couple of times, I would be struggling with my
game and I'd sit down and write him a handwritten letter asking for
some help or advice. And he'd pick up the phone and call me and
tell me he wasn't a teacher. Didn't want to teach me anything
because he didn't want me to ruin my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he gave me good advice. At times, he treated me like a
grandson. And at other times, he was very distant. So I think I got
to know him as well as most young players of our era. And it was a
lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But while O'Meara is reluctant to link his name with Hogan's in
the great-player department, others aren't so shy. Fred Couples
couldn't say enough about the 41-year-old O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great player,'' Couples said. ``He talks a lot about
`semi.' But he's a good player. Winning two majors is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending PGA champion Davis Love III agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark's coming in with a lot of confidence,'' Love said. ``Mark
is a very patient, scrambling, hard-working golfer. He's just
getting his due right now. (Winning a major) just kind of confirmed
what the players have always known, that Mark O'Meara is one of the
great players of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope that he continues on, because he is not only a
great player, he's one of the great gentlemen of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the praise in the world isn't going to help
O'Meara win golf tournaments, specifically the 1998 PGA, and he
knows it. That will be up to his game and mental attitude. O'Meara
said Wednesday that long irons will be at a premium this week,
which is good for him, and while the fairways are narrow, he called
the course very fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've picked a course that is going to require a lot of
thought, and it's going to require a lot of shot-making, not only
on the tee but also coming into the greens,'' O'Meara said. ``If I
put the ball in the fairway off the tee, and keep it in the fairway
most of the week, then there's no reason why I shouldn't have a
good week and play well. I really like the greens. The surface and
the texture are probably the best greens that we've putted on all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The last man with a chance to win three majors in one year was
Nick Faldo, who won the 1990 Masters and British Open. He finished
tied for 19th at the PGA Championship that year, ending any hopes
of tying Hogan. Only Bobby Jones has won four majors in one season.
But O'Meara is poised on the edge of golf history, just waiting for
his ball to drop in for his third major victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anything's possible,'' O'Meara said. ``If you had told
me at the beginning of the year that I would have the opportunity
to win two of them, I would have jumped and prayed for the chance
to have that happen, let alone coming here and know that Ben Hogan
was the last player to win three major championships in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the odds are a little stacked against me. But that
doesn't stop me from going out there and trying to give it my best.
And if I have a chance come Sunday afternoon, hopefully I can dwell
on what I've learned from the Masters and the British Open and use
that to my advantage.''

GREEN AND SCHUMER CLASH IN DEBATE AS FERRARO LOOKS ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York City Public Advocate Mark Green and Rep.
Charles Schumer clashed Wednesday night over the tone of the
Democratic Senate primary as Green repeatedly assailed Schumer's
positions on Social Security and health insurance abuses, and
Schumer warned that such intraparty attacks could insure the
re-election of the Republican incumbent, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   The third major Democratic candidate in the race, former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro, sat by silently in their second debate as Green,
almost from the moment his microphone was switched on, attacked
Schumer by seeking to raise concerns about his Democratic
credentials in a forum sponsored by a labor federation.
</P>
<P>
   Green pointed to positions that Schumer had taken during 18
years in Congress to support his contention that he would not
protect Social Security or block insurance company abuses.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the evening, Schumer ignored Green, sitting with his
arms folded tightly in front of him. But finally, as the forum drew
to a close, Schumer reached under his chair and produced a blown-up
headline from a 1992 issue of the New York Post _ ``Dem Debaters
Dish Dirt Again'' _ reminding his rivals and audience of the
Democratic infighting that occurred the last time the party tried
to come up with a candidate to unseat D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be focusing our fire on Al D'Amato,'' Schumer said.
``Otherwise, we're going to repeat what happened in the 1992
primary. Democrats will bash one another and Al D'Amato will be
your senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had had no success until then in provoking an
exchange with Schumer, looked out at the audience and grinned. ``If
the congressman wants to run on his record, he's going to have to
defend it,'' he said. ``I know the difference between slander and
substance and I'm sure you do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange between Green and Schumer was the most memorable
moment in the candidates' last scheduled joint appearance until the
weekend before the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, the session suggested a change in the
tenor of the campaign, with Schumer and Green emerging as the main
contestants at the expense of Ms. Ferraro, who was once considered
the front-runner because of her political history. She is a former
member of Congress from Queens who was the Democratic vice
presidential nominee in 1984.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three candidates were warmly received; indeed, the only
person who received a bad reception was one of the moderators, Dave
Hepp, a host of ``Inside Albany,'' a weekly public television show,
who tried to ask the three candidates for their opinions about
President Clinton's legal difficulties. The first mention of the
name ``Lewinsky,'' though, brought a chorus of boos and hisses, and
shouts of ``No, no, no.'' ``You're wasting our time!'' one man
shouted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've just gotten the response,'' Schumer told Hepp, a
respected fixture in Albany news reporting. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum was sponsored by the New York State Public Employees
Federation, which is to announce its endorsement Thursday. The
remarks by the candidates were clearly intended, to some extent, to
court the union's support.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Green's attempts to draw differences between himself,
Ms. Ferraro and Schumer, the hour-long debate showed that their
views were similar on many issues of interest to labor. All three
candidates, for example, said they would oppose a flat tax and a
national sales tax, as well as oppose proposals that governments
hire private companies to do public work. Ms. Ferraro, Green and
Schumer also said they opposed any effort to turn over either
Social Security or Medicare to private concerns, an issue that is
more likely to arise in the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The privatization issue is a real bad idea _ all you have to
do is look at the stock market over the last month,'' Ms. Ferraro
said. The candidates also opposed efforts to require income-level
testing for recipients of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the candidates were vague on what they would do to
protect the long-term viability of the Social Security system. Ms.
Ferraro said she had asked Clinton to appoint her to a commission
to recommend ways of protecting the system's solvency. Green said
he would oppose increasing Social Security taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer avoided a question about whether he might eventually
support raising either the retirement age or Social Security taxes.
Instead, he argued that the projected federal budget surpluses
would be enough to insure the system's viability.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro's position on the sidelines might have reflected a
political decision: Polls still show her in the lead, and it is
arguably in her interest not to do anything to upset the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Ferraro, in her conclusion, argued that one of the
reasons the labor union should support her is that she is the
candidate with the best chance of defeating D'Amato, who is seeking
a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   ``When push comes to shove, take a look at the polls,'' she
said. ``I'm the only one who can beat him. None of them do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and Green sought to make similar claims. As Schumer put
it: ``I'd say this to Al D'Amato: `You have never been up against a
Chuck Schumer in your life. You don't know what you're in for.'''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who was the Democratic Senate nominee in 1986 and lost to
D'Amato, offered the same argument, if for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I have made the case against Al D'Amato over 12 years, I
think I have the best experience to finally privatize him in
1998,'' he said.

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The New York Giants' preseason game with the
Jacksonville Jaguars on Friday night will be Tyrone Wheatley's
first chance to wrest the job of starting halfback from Tiki
Barber. Giants coach Jim Fassel said Wednesday that he planned to
use Wheatley with the team's first-string offense against
Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Barber will still start the game, but Wheatley, who found little
running room behind the Giants' third-string offensive line in last
Saturday's preseason opener with Cincinnati, will get several
carries in the first half with the starting unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to see Tyrone run more, I've wanted to move him
up,'' Fassel said of Wheatley, who had 32 yards on 11 attempts
against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, Wheatley and Gary Brown, along with fullback Charles
Way, are all vying for carries in the crowded Giants backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Amani Toomer made a leaping, one-handed catch at
the back of the end zone for a touchdown in a goal-line scrimmage
Wednesday. It appeared that the Giants' backup quarterback, Kent
Graham, was throwing the football away, but Toomer jumped over a
crowd of defenders to make the catch, spiking the ball after he
landed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Fassel said of Toomer's reception.
``That's what he can do now. Last year, he might not have been in
the right position to make that catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants signed Grant Baynham, a 6-foot-5-inch, 247-pound
tight end who was waived by the Minnesota Vikings last week. With a
knee injury sidelining Al Pupunu and with the rookie tight ends
Andy Haase (flulike symptoms) and Todd Pollack (knee ligament
strain) out, Fassel was unwilling to go into Friday night's game
with one healthy tight end, Howard Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Baynham spent last year, his rookie season, on the Vikings'
practice squad. Running back Lamont Randle was waived by the Giants
to make room for him. Fassel said safety Sam Garnes, guard Ron
Stone and tackle Robert Harris would also miss Friday's game.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A quarter of a century after the overthrow of
the monarchy started Afghanistan on a downward spiral into
fratricide and destruction, the Islamic hard-liners of the Taliban
movement appear to be on the brink of re-unifying the country and
imposing their vision of a purist Islamic society.
</P>
<P>
   In a month-long offensive, Taliban forces have overwhelmed the
so-called northern alliance, which defied the Islamic militants for
two years by holding on to much of the territory north of the
Himalayan peaks of the Hindi kush.
</P>
<P>
   With a rush of victories in the past week, the Taliban now hold
at least three quarters of the country, and seem poised to surround
the last remnants of the alliance forces in two remaining redoubts,
in the Bamiyan region of the central mountains and in the Panjshir
valley of the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban thus appear to be on the verge of doing something
that neither the Soviet invaders in the 1980s nor the U.S.-backed
guerrillas who ousted them were unable to do: Bringing peace to a
weary, demoralized and underfed country of between 15 million and
20 million people.
</P>
<P>
   While Taliban forces continue to push forward against the
scattered and retreating alliance forces, which surrendered 14
northern cities and towns in recent days with only token
resistance, the historic significance of the moment was proclaimed
by the Taliban's representative at the United Nations in New York,
Noorullah Zadran.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 25 years of struggle, it seems to us that we have
finally come to the end of the struggle,'' Zadran said in a
television interview Wednesday with the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the outcome is full of tragic irony for a nation that
seemed set on a diametrically opposite course in 1973, when King
Zahir Shah, the last representative of the Durrani dynasty that had
ruled the country for 250 years, was ousted in a palace coup
mounted by his cousin, Mohammed Daoud.
</P>
<P>
   As president, Mohammed Daoud proclaimed himself a modernizer but
lasted barely five years before he was killed in April 1978 in a
coup staged by the Soviet-backed Communist Party, which proclaimed
a still more radical modernization program.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists' program aimed at uprooting the pervasive
influence of Muslim clerics, whose support of the Durranis had
consigned Afghanistan to a social and economic backwardness that
marked the country out in a nation already beginning by the late
1979s to catch up with the Western world. Within hours of seizing
the Arg Palace in Kabul, the Afghan capital, the Communists vowed
to emancipate Afghan women, achieve universal literacy and move the
country beyond its bullock-cart economy.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with a Taliban victory, history may record that the
Communists achieved exactly the opposite. The bid to force
compliance with the Communist program, especially in the
arch-conservative world of the Afghan village, triggered a civil
war that drew in Soviet forces in December 1979. In turn, this
prompted President Jimmy Carter and later President Ronald Reagan
to commit the United States to backing the Afghan mujahideen, the
self-styled Muslim holy warriors who drove out the Soviets in
February 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. effort, backed by other Western countries and by Saudi
Arabia, turned Afghanistan into one of the most dramatic
confrontations of the Cold War. By the time the Kremlin withdrew
its forces, the Soviet Union was barely three and a half years away
from collapse. But Afghanistan was virtually obliterated as a
functioning state, with thousands of its villages in rubble, at
least a million of its people dead and another 5 million living
abroad as refugees, mostly in Iran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Taliban first appeared, in 1995, many in the West were
dismayed. But to many Afghans, the rise of the movement rooted in
the ancient ways of the Afghan village, with its insistence on
strict forms of purdah for women and summary executions, or
amputations, for adulterers, blasphemers and thieves, seemed like
an inevitable consequence of the conflict in which modern weapons,
poured in with scant consideration for the civilian population, had
reduced an ancient society to rubble.
</P>
<P>
   With many schools, hospitals and highways destroyed, the way was
cleared for a band of village clerics to offer their own brand of
salvation. While educated Afghans recoiled, many others in a
country that is overwhelmingly rural accommodated quickly to the
Taliban's social strictures. To villagers, and to many
city-dwellers, too, what mattered most was that the Taliban held
out the prospect of ending a civil war in which most of the
factions have long since become little more than warlords,
sustaining their rule by banditry, pillage and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Taliban seem likely to be faced with a continuing
resistance from the two remaining opposition forces, the
Hezbe-i-Wahdat of Abdul Khalili in the mountainous redoubt of
Bamiyan, and the Jamaat-Islami of Ahmed Shah Massoud in the
Panjshir Valley. Massoud, the most effective guerrilla commander
during the war with Soviet forces, seems likely to pose the biggest
obstacle. But now that the Taliban virtually surround Massoud's
forces, even his wily battle tactics may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Taliban spokesmen have renewed demands for
international recognition. So far, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates, out of more than 180 nations worldwide,
have recognized the Taliban, so great has been the opprobrium for
Taliban policies that have banned most women from working, denied
education to girls and imposed a frightening array of other social
taboos, including bans on dancing, television, kite-flying,
bird-keeping and even the trimming of men's beards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Taliban _ the name is taken from an Arabic term
meaning seekers after truth _ have played cat-and-mouse with
Western governments and international aid agencies, hinting that
harsh policies against women might be relaxed in return for
diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   In the BBC interview Wednesday, Zadran, the Taliban spokesman at
the United Nations, suggested changes were possible, but just as
quickly entered what seemed to be a disqualifying condition. ``We
will never compromise on our religion, Islam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, tightening Taliban strictures, including rules
that virtually eliminated any direct international assistance for
Afghan women, have prompted most state organizations to suspend
operations in Kabul, Kandahar and Herat, three Taliban-held cities,
as well as evacuating staff from Mazar-i-Sharif, the pivotal
northern cities the Taliban seized at the weekend. With a harsh
Afghan winter approaching, there have been fears for the survival
of the poorest city-dwellers, including at least 400,000 people in
Kabul, the capital, who have relied on Western aid for food.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has led a chorus of dismay at the threat of a
Taliban-ruled Afghanistan spreading the contagion of Islamic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia considers the stepped-up military activities by the
Taliban in northern Afghanistan as a real threat to the
commonwealth's southern borders,''a Russian Foreign Ministry
statement said Tuesday, referring to the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the grouping of former Soviet republics that
includes the Muslim states of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has joined the outcry, leaving Pakistan, alone among
Afghanistan's neighbors, as a supporter of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taliban's main challenge seems likely to lie at home,
among millions of Afghans who yearn for peace, but not for the
harsh life vouchsafed by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   For these people, the prospect now is for years of living in a
society not much different in its political, religious and social
rigors from the Afghanistan of the distant past. So far, the signs
have been that Western pressure for greater tolerance may not only
be ineffective, but a stir that pushes the Muslim clerics who
control the Taliban to adopt still harsher constraints.

HUNDLEY WORKS EXTRA FROM THE RIGHT SIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Todd Hundley said he would be at Busch Stadium
``early, early, early,'' on Wednesday. And there Hundley was, four
hours before game time, taking right-handed swings off a Mets coach
one day after he had struck out three times batting right-handed
against St. Louis left-hander Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   By session's end, Hundley was driving the ball with authority
off the left-handed coach, Randy Niemann. True, it was only batting
practice. But for someone who is 1 for 12 with 11 strikeouts and 1
walk from the right side of the plate since his midseason comeback,
any positive sign had to be embraced.
</P>
<P>
   After, Hundley said he felt he had figured some things out as he
tried to find a good, fluid motion to his stroke. Niemann said the
same. And Manager Bobby Valentine, who watched the session, seemed
optimistic that something positive had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he and Tom clicked on a little something,''
Valentine said, referring to the hitting coach, Tom Robson. ``At
the end, he hit the ball much better. He should be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is how long can the Mets, who are in
the middle of a wild-card race, afford to wait for Hundley to show
anything as a right-handed hitter?
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey (left hamstring strain) is eligible to come off the
disabled list Tuesday. And even though Valentine said he might want
the right-handed-hitting Huskey to take a minor league
rehabilitation assignment before he comes back, it is possible that
Hundley and Huskey might end up platooning in the outfield _
Hundley playing against righties, and Huskey against lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, however, Valentine doesn't seem all that worried
about Hundley's complete ineffectiveness from the right side (he
was only hitting .205 over all going into last night's game).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those things,'' Valentine said. ``Todd
sometimes gets hot right-handed, but it's never been his strongest
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Valentine pointed out, he prefers to have Hundley's bat
in place in the lineup, because the other team will often bring in
a right-handed reliever. That was the case here Tuesday night, and
Hundley delivered a key run batted in off the St. Louis
right-hander Mark Petkovsek.
</P>
<P>
   As for pinch-hitting for Hundley against a left-hander in a key
situation, Valentine said, ``Right now, probably not. I don't think
I'd send up Jermaine Allensworth to pinch-hit for Todd Hundley.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest Comes First
</P>
<P>
   It had taken the Mets more than two months to retake the
National League wild-card lead from Chicago on Tuesday night. And
the Cubs had already won in San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon to
pull into a tie with the Mets. But that didn't seem to faze Bobby
Valentine, who manages the way he sees fit. That explains why his
two most important hitters, John Olerud and Mike Piazza, were out
of the Mets' starting lineup Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine is intent on keeping his players rested. He knew that
the Mets' have an off day on Thursday, followed by a three-game
series in Arizona this weekend (including a Sunday night game), a
red-eye flight back to New York, followed by a game Monday night
against Colorado at Shea Stadium. Then come two more games against
the Rockies and back-to-back doubleheaders against the Cardinals.
Then there is a home weekend series against the Diamondbacks
followed by a nine-day West Coast swing. And then, finally, the
team gets another day off on Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That was why Valentine said he might give Edgardo Alfonzo and
Brian McRae the day off on Friday, in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, at the end of the game last night, looked like he was in
need,'' Valentine said of Piazza. ``And I thought at the end of the
game, John looked like he was right at that point. They'll probably
rest again, too. Rest is one of those things I believe in. You
don't want to run out of gas. When you run out of gas, it hurts the
engine. You want to get in the gas station before you run out of
gas.''
</P>
<P>
   A First for Fabregas
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Fabregas made his first start behind the plate for the
Mets Wednesday night since being acquired from the Arizona
Diamondbacks on July 31, in the Bernard Gilkey trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fabregas admitted he has been hampered all season by a severe
right ankle sprain and a pulled muscle in his abdomen, which might
explain his .192 batting average. As a Met, Fabregas was 0 for 5 in
six games before tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza said that one of the reasons Manager Bobby Valentine
told him he was giving him the day off was because he wanted to get
Fabregas a start before the upcoming back-to-back doubleheaders.
And Piazza added he did not have any problem with Valentine's
decision to rest him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to flip him to the Arizona side of the off day,''
Valentine said. ``But there was no way I could space it any longer
with Fabregas, I didn't think.''

AARON BIRNBAUM, 103, FOLK PAINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aaron Birnbaum, a New York dress manufacturer who
took up painting after he retired and found himself hailed as an
exceptional folk artist at the age of 100, died Aug. 7 at the Crown
Nursing Home in Brooklyn. He was 103.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum was one of the last of the 20th-century ``memory
painters'' who, like Grandma Moses and Morris Hirschfield, recorded
romanticized scenes from their youth in bright colors reflecting an
optimistic spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In his work, Birnbaum merged incidents of his childhood in
Eastern Europe with the settings of houses, streets and bridges of
Brooklyn, where he had lived since 1913. He worked in oil or
acrylic on paper, wood, glass or tin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron Birnbaum was not a one-note Charlie as an artist,'' said
Gerard Wertkin, director of the Museum of American Folk Art. ``He
was able to use painting to record memories and also the shapes of
things. There is a playfulness and an abstract quality that is most
appealing. But there is also an edgy seriousness to his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at 100, Birnbaum was a powerful presence, all voice, lively
eyes and a ready smile, as he welcomed visitors to his one-bedroom
apartment, where he lived alone. A small man, 4 foot 9, he painted
daily in the living room. When showing his work to a visitor, he
moved easily about the room pulling out examples of his favorite
paintings, which were stacked wall to wall and 10 deep.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum took up painting at the age of 70, after the death of
his wife, Sadie. He had closed his dress business, and to help ease
his loneliness, his daughter, Lorraine Pearce, brought him paints,
recalling that he had always sketched the dresses he produced. Ms.
Pearce, of Howard Beach, Queens, survives him, along with a son,
Eugene, of Valley Stream, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Fame came some 30 years after he started painting, when the
Museum of American Folk Art celebrated his art and his age at a
party at the museum for his 100th birthday. His paintings were
reproduced in the museum's Folk Art magazine and were shown with
great success six months later at the Outsider Art Fair in
Manhattan by Kerry Schuss, a Manhattan dealer who had represented
him since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Birnbaum went to the opening of a retrospective of
his work at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield,
Conn. When they arrived for the opening, Schuss recalled, Birnbaum
seemed humbled, saying, ``If I would have known my paintings were
going to a museum, I would have worked a little longer on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum was born in Skole, a summer resort in Ukraine. His
father was a tailor, his mother a dressmaker. At 13, he was
apprenticed to a tailor, working from 5 in the morning to 10 at
night, six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled by a stroke two years ago, Birnbaum moved to the
nursing home. He was no longer able to paint, but his ego and sense
of humor remained intact. He was proud to display his work on the
Internet, and was looking forward to his first one-man gallery show
in October at K.S. Art in lower Manhattan's Tribeca. ``Be sure to
have the preview party early, between 1 and 3 in the afternoon,''
Birnbaum told Schuss. ``I go to sleep early these days.''

ROSE BLUMKIN, 104, HOME FURNISHINGS ENTREPRENEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Belarus)   (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rose Blumkin, who founded the Nebraska Furniture Mart in 1937,
helped her son and grandchildren build it into the nation's largest
home furnishings store and continued selling carpet there well past
her 100th birthday, died Aug. 7 in Omaha, Neb. She was 104.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. B, as she was fondly known by Midwesterners who often
traveled hundreds of miles to Omaha to shop at the store, was known
for her credo: ``Sell cheap, tell the truth, don't cheat nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   In her last years, she moved around the cavernous store on a
golf cart, sometimes startling visitors by abruptly zipping away
toward customers who appeared to be waiting for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blumkin stood just 4 feet 10 inches in her prime, but her
merchandising skills and daring as she made the long journey from
an impoverished childhood in Russia to success led figures like
Warren Buffett to rank her as a business giant. At one point soon
after founding her store, she sold every appliance and piece of
furniture in her home to pay off a debt. When furniture
manufacturers stopped selling directly to her after bigger
customers in Omaha complained about her low retail prices, she
traveled to Kansas City, Mo., Chicago and New York, bought from
department stores and still undersold her rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put her up against the top graduates of the top business
schools or chief executives of the Fortune 500 and, assuming an
even start with the same resources, she'd run rings around them,''
Buffett said in 1984 soon after Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought
majority control of the Furniture Mart from Mrs. Blumkin. Based on
his experience as a customer and as an acquaintance of her
children, Buffett made the acquisition on a handshake without
bothering to audit her books or inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blumkin was born Dec. 3, 1893, in Schidrin, a village near
Minsk, Belarus (then part of the Russian Empire), one of eight
children of Solomon and Chasia Gorelick. Her father was a rabbi,
and her mother ran a grocery store to support the struggling
family, which lived in a two-room log cabin and slept on straw
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Mrs. Blumkin recalled working in the store age 6,
talking her way into a job as a store clerk when she was 13 and
becoming manager with six men working under her three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blumkin was 20 when she married Isadore Blumkin, a shoe
salesman, soon before he fled to the United States to avoid being
drafted into the Russian army. Although unable to speak English,
Mrs. Blumkin managed to rejoin him in Fort Dodge, Iowa, three years
later, and the young couple moved to Omaha in 1919, where Mr.
Blumkin opened a secondhand clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   The Blumkins had four children by the time the Depression
struck. Mrs. Blumkin encouraged her husband to cut prices, helped
him branch into new products and dreamed up innovative advertising.
She started her own furniture business with $500 she borrowed from
a brother.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blumkin's own nominee for the nation's greatest businessman
was her son, Louis, who became her major ally in running the
Furniture Mart after returning from military service in World War
II. Like her, he typically put in seven-day, 70-hour workweeks. But
she began to feel frozen out of decisions as her grandchildren,
Irving and Ronald Blumkin, became more involved in the 1980s. She
bitterly ``retired'' in 1989 at the age of 95, but after three
months returned with characteristic combativeness, setting up a
rival store called Mrs. B's Clearance and Factory Outlet across the
street from the Furniture Mart. By 1991, it had become profitable
and was Omaha's third-largest carpet outlet.
</P>
<P>
   The family eventually repaired the rift, and Buffett acquired
the new venture in 1992, merging it into the Furniture Mart. He
later joked with reporters that it had been a mistake he would
never repeat to let Mrs. Blumkin retire without signing an
agreement not to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Blumkin's husband died in 1950. She is survived by her son,
Louis; three daughters, Frances Batt, Cynthia Schneider and Sylvia
Cohn; two sisters, Anne Rosenblatt and Ruth Lasher, all of Omaha; a
brother, Mayer Gorelick of Los Angeles; 12 grandchildren, and 21
great-grandchildren.

GREENWICH VILLAGE SHOPKEEPER KILLED; GUNMAN AT LARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A shopkeeper was fatally shot in the face Wednesday
night in his West Greenwich Village novelty shop, apparently during
an attempted robbery, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Ki Lim, 34, was pronounced dead around 8:40 p.m.,
his body slumped in a chair in his shop, Village Wear Design, at 87
Christopher St., said Capt. Charles Hanley of the Manhattan South
Detective Squad.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hanley, a man entered the shop, which is on the
busy Christopher Street strip between Bleecker Street and Seventh
Avenue, and forced Lim into the back of the store behind a display
case, ``a place where customers are not normally invited to go.''
It was there that Lim was shot in the face, police said. It was
8:30 p.m. and Lim was still open for business, selling T-shirts,
buttons, sunglasses and sundry items.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a noise coming from the cash register that we think
indicates that someone tried to break into it,'' Hanley said. No
money was stolen, he said, and the shop did not appear to have been
ransacked. He said investigators believe the gunman left
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect fled on foot, investigators said, and as of
Wednesday night police had no suspects and few leads. The only clue
was a single bullet casing near the body, suggesting the weapon was
a semi-automatic pistol, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were questioning neighbors Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a decent, hard-working guy,'' said Andy Fair,
who lives above the shop. ``It's pretty shocking. This kind of
thing doesn't happen in the stores around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lim opened the store about three years ago. John Park, a local
merchant and a friend of Lim's, said he was a Korean immigrant who
consistently worked 12-hour days in the shop, seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Lim emigrated from Seoul a decade ago, was married and had a
7-year-old girl and a 3-year-old boy, Park said. ``They're here by
themselves,'' Park said. ``They have no relatives here. We'll try
to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the explosion of bars and foot traffic in the West
Village in recent years, violent crime _ particularly murder _ is
relatively uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Located within the 6th Precinct, the West Village has
historically been one of the city's safest districts. Until
Wednesday night, there had only been one reported murder this year,
that of an aspiring actress, Naomi Maki, 23. On May 7, she was
fatally shot by her ex-boyfriend, not far from her apartment on
Morton Street. So far this year, there have been six reported
rapes, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reported murders in 1997 or 1996, and three in
1995. In August 1994, Greenwich Village jeweler Alfonoso Albrizio
was fatally stabbed by a man with a long arrest record after the
two quarreled in Albrizio's store. That store, C'est Magnifique,
had catered to a celebrity clientele that included Madonna and
Bruce Springsteen, embodying a special brand of West Village
eclecticism.
</P>
<P>
   But New York being New York, a murder is a curio and moments
after police arrived people with pizza slices and bottled beer were
peeking through windows, trying to steal a glimpse inside.
</P>
<P>
   It is people like that who make neighbors suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This street has had a particularly uneasy feeling to it,
especially at night,'' said Teimoc Johnston, 41. ``It's not so much
the people who live here, but the people who hang out.''

KELLY KIP SHOWS DAZZLING SPEED AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In racing, speed is dangerous,
especially at short distances. And no horse demonstrates it more
relentlessly than Kelly Kip, who flashed his speed again at
Saratoga on Wednesdy, winning the A Phenomenon Handicap by three
lengths and streaking to his third straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   He did not set a track record, as he had already done at Belmont
Park, Aqueduct and Finger Lakes. But he did race six furlongs in
1:09 3/5, which is faster than anybody else has run it during this
meeting. And he outran any horse who came close, especially the
accomplished Richter Scale, who dueled him into the homestretch
before conceding. In the True North at Belmont Park two months ago,
Richter Scale and Trafalgar withstood the speed of Kelly Kip, but
not this time.
</P>
<P>
   After leading all the way, pursued closely by Richter Scale,
Kelly Kip poured it on as they shot down the stretch and finished
three lengths in front of Trafalgar, who had 2{ lengths on Receiver
in a well-scattered field of seven. And Richter Scale by then had
faded to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not good, he's remarkable,'' said Allen Jerkens, who
trains Kelly Kip for the Hobeau Farm. ``What's remarkable is he can
be vanned for four or five hours and be ready to run. He's got
God-given speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Luc Samyn, the regular rider on Kelly Kip, praised his star
in these words: ``He's been getting better and better. He's got to
be sprint-champion material. He has carried more weight each time,
and he's doing what we are asking him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Kip carried high weight of 122 pounds and was the solid
favorite, returning $4.10 for a $2 bet to win. He was shadowed for
five furlongs by Richter Scale, who carried 120 pounds and was the
second favorite. But the duel ended in the homestretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really felt confident going around the turn,'' said Jerry
Bailey, who rode Richter Scale, ``and I figured that it was just
going to be us and Kelly Kip. At one point, we were on even terms,
and I thought we were going to be able to outrun him. But once
Kelly Kip started to open up, my horse just vanished underneath
me.''
</P>
<P>
   D. Wayne Lukas, who trains Trafalgar, gave the ultimate salute
to the speed of the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly Kip is proving that he's a quality horse,'' Lukas said,
``and, with that, when we saw a first quarter in 23 seconds, that
just gave us too much to make up.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an average horse, you can possibly run them down, but not
one like Kelly Kip.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   _ The trustees of the New York Racing Association approved a
schedule of dates for next year's Saratoga meeting that mirrors
this year's. It will consist of 36 racing dates from Wednesday,
July 28, through Labor Day, Monday, Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ The booming market in horse sales continued on the opening
night of Saratoga's auction of selected yearlings. The 58 yearlings
sold fetched $13 million, an increase of 44 percent over last
year's opening session. The average price was $226,000, a gain of
29 percent. And the show stopper was a chestnut filly by Storm Cat
who brought $1.7 million, the fourth-highest price for a yearling
filly in the history of the Fasig-Tipton auction house. RICHARD
MULHALL, the agent for Prince AHMED SALMAN, the buyer, said:
``She's a big, good-looking filly and very hard to fault. Of all
the horses in the sale, she's the top pick.'' The sale closes
Thursday night. &QL;

RANGERS FALTER WITH RUNNERS IN SCORING POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Texas Rangers manager Johnny Oates rarely criticizes
his players.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' No. 1 complaint during his four-year tenure with the
organization involves his players sometimes trying too hard.
</P>
<P>
   The manager witnessed that in a 6-3 loss to the Indians on
Wednesday night at Jacobs Field. The Rangers squeezed too tightly
and let victory slip between their fingers by pressing at the plate
with runners aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers _ who stranded 12 runners, including seven at either
second or third base _ went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring
position in the final seven innings. Thus, the second-place Angels,
who Wednesday night beat the Tigers, 3-2, crept within a half-game
of the Rangers in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that we take different swings in
run-producing situations,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, left fielder Rusty Greer and
catcher Ivan Rodriguez went down on strikes with a runner at third
and less than two outs during the course of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   The manager would prefer at-bats like the one delivered by third
baseman Todd Zeile in the seventh inning against Indians
right-hander Steve Reed, who dodged a bullet after retiring
Rodriguez on strikes with one out and runners at first and third.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile then strode to the plate and lined a pitch into left
field. The ball, though, carried directly into the glove of left
fielder Brian Giles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked and got a good pitch to hit and smoked it right at
Giles,'' Oates said. ``Those are the type of at-bats we need. We
gave away some outs tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who entered the game leading the league in hitting
with runners in scoring position (.308), indeed squandered their
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   None proved more frustrating than the fourth inning against
All-Star right-hander Bartolo Colon (12-6).
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Roberto Kelly drew a leadoff walk and advanced to
second on a single by shortstop Royce Clayton. Center fielder Tom
Goodwin advanced the runners with a sacrifice bunt, but Colon
retired McLemore and Greer on strikes to terminate the threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also rejected the Indians' generosity in the sixth
inning. Kelly reached on the second of two errors by usually
sure-handed shortstop Omar Vizquel and advanced on a sacrifice bunt
by Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   However, Colon stranded another runner in scoring position by
inducing consecutive ground balls from Goodwin and McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also failed to convert two defensive plays that
allowed two of the Indians' runs. Vizquel's deep fly ball to right
field during the fourth inning resulted in a double after it
glanced off Kelly's glove, and Clayton's seventh-inning throw to
the plate sailed over the head of Rodriguez and allowed Indians
first baseman Richie Sexson to score on a double by second baseman
David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this,'' Oates said, ``could be described as a game of
near misses for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates saw this as a ball game the Rangers could have won, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the manager saw his players press and try too hard in
their attempt.

MARTINEZ MAKING PROGRESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ramon Martinez, the Dodgers' top pitcher until
undergoing season-ending surgery on his right shoulder in late
June, is ahead of schedule on his rehabilitation and could begin
throwing lightly in October.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had rotator cuff and cartilage damage repaired,
returned to Los Angeles on Tuesday from his native Dominican
Republic, where he spent the past month working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to (Martinez's surgeon) Dr. (Frank) Jobe and he told
me Ramon is two months ahead of schedule,'' said Dodgers vice
president Ralph Avila, who has become the top confidant of general
manager Tom Lasorda. ``If anyone can come back from this, it is
Ramon.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 30, acknowledged the weeks after his season ended were
difficult emotionally. He had worked diligently from a similar
injury during the winter after electing to pass on surgery. He
opened the season 7-3 with a 2.83 ERA before breaking down and was
told he probably would not pick up a ball until Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard not to get frustrated, thinking that all I did was
not good enough,'' Martinez said. ``It took a few weeks to get
through that. But then I realized if I was going to come back again
I had to put that aside and concentrate on my rehab.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobe, who said after the surgery that Martinez could be back on
a major-league mound next June, examined the pitcher Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strength and range of motion are excellent,'' Jobe said.
``It's too soon to say if that means he'll be back any sooner, but
we are very encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is in the final season of a multi-year contract, but
there is a club option for 1999 at $5.6 million. The Dodgers are
expected to offer Martinez a $500,000 buyout and re-sign him at a
lower figure.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had hinted to friends he might like to rejoin his
brother Pedro with the Boston Red Sox, but Pedro has said he
doesn't think that is a good idea because of the unforgiving fans
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to say how that is going to go,'' Avila said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Orie: One of the most interesting players to watch for
the Florida Marlins the final six weeks of the season is third
baseman Kevin Orie, who was acquired at the trade deadline from the
Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Orie was a promising rookie for the Cubs last year after jumping
two minor-league levels to have eight homers and 44 RBI. But he
fell out of favor after a slow start this year. He was the Cubs'
Opening Day third baseman but batted just .181 in 64 games and also
spent a month in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still trying to figure out what happened,'' said Orie, who
was traded with two minor leaguers for left-hander Felix Heredia
and and minor-league pitcher Steve Hoff. ``They said I was part of
the future, but I guess the future changed. This is a good place to
be. They'll give me the chance to play. That's all I ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Orie, who did not start Wednesday, said he lost some confidence
after having several potential home runs cut down by the stiff
Wrigley Field wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have lost six or eight homers the first month and
started to press,'' Orie said. ``It just kind of snowballed from
there. Hopefully everything will come together here.''

SELES GLAD TO BE BACK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Welcome back.
</P>
<P>
   That was the appropriate phrase to say to Monica Seles when she
returned to the Acura Classic, which she won last year. The phrase
was especially apropos to welcome her (begin ital)back(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   Seles considered withdrawing from the tournament because of
chronic stiffness in her back. Last week at the Toshiba Classic in
La Costa, Seles' back bothered her so much at times she could not
swing a racket. But after physical-therapy treatments, she felt
better Wednesday. Seles, showing no effects, needed just 49 minutes
to beat Barbara Paulus 6-1, 6-2 in the Acura Classic's second
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing better, but it's not 100 percent,'' Seles said.
``There were no aches, no pains today.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulus, ranked 37th on the Corel WTA tour, did not present a
serious threat to the tournament's defending champ. Seles, seeded
fourth and ranked sixth in the world, is 4-0 in her career against
her. The most games Paulus ever won in a set against Seles is two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to be careful,'' said Seles about taking a win
for granted against Paulus. ``Nobody plays a topspin game like she
does.''
</P>
<P>
   But that nonstop topspin did not trip up Seles.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd greeted Seles with earsplitting applause and more of
the same as she left the stadium. The Yugoslavia native and
resident of Sarasota, Fla., is a crowd favorite in Los Angeles,
winning three of the four times she has played here and making it
to the finals the other time.
</P>
<P>
   She also is a favorite because of her past and the empathy she
receives because of it. On April 30, 1993, Seles' life changed
during a changeover in a match in Hamburg, Germany. Ranked first in
the world then, Seles was stabbed below her left shoulder blade.
The incident knocked her out of tennis for nearly 2{ years. She
never has regained a top ranking alone.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Seles' life changed again when her father and coach,
Karolj, died on May 14 after losing a battle with stomach cancer.
In the first tournament after his death, she beat top-ranked
Martina Hingis in the French Open's semifinals and appeared ready
to make a serious run at reclaiming the top ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Seles said she has not played as well as when she beat Hingis.
She considers herself a longshot in this week's tournament. ``I
think it's going to be between Martina and Lindsay Davenport,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Seles is a different player now than she was when she owned the
top ranking. Her foot speed is slower, and her swing may not be as
powerful. Parts of her game have improved, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I'm doing better than I used to do is my serve
in terms of strength, but not consistency,'' she said. ``Before, I
could go through the French Open and maybe serve one single
double-fault in the entire tournament. Now, I have a hard time
doing that in one match.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the French Open, Seles has yet to take another step toward
No.1, but the environment in Los Angeles could give her a boost,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three tournaments in California are a tour favorite for
everybody, just because they are so convenient,'' Seles said. ``For
me, this is one of my most favorite tournaments _ that's for
sure.''

SANCHEZ VICARIO WORKS OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario had to weather a
grueling, 2-hour, 27-minute match against Ai Sugiyama to advance to
the Acura Classic's quarterfinals at Manhattan Country Club.
Sanchez Vicario edged Sugiyama 4-6, 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The match between third-seeded Sanchez Vicario and Sugiyama was
the tournament's closest so far, which Sanchez Vicario expected.
After all, this was her first match in six weeks. During the
layoff, however, Sanchez Vicario didn't exactly sit on her couch
and eat chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have as much of a holiday as I wish I could have,''
said Sanchez Vicario, who spent a lot of her time working on her
game.
</P>
<P>
   The close match had more to do with the emergence of Sugiyama,
ranked 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis advances easily: Top-ranked and top-seeded Martina Hingis
did not have many problems when she eliminated Iva Majoli 6-3, 6-3.
Majoli, ranked 20th, could not pull the upset on her 21st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we both played well,'' Hingis said. ``It's hard to
play somebody on her birthday, but once you get on the court, you
always want to be the best player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky loser wins: Before her first-round match on Wednesday,
Mary Pierce withdrew from the tournament because of a strained
right groin. So the lucky loser, Elena Tatarkova, ranked 79th,
earned a spot in the tournament and beat Yayuk Basuki 4-6, 6-3,
6-3. The lucky loser is the highest-ranked player who lost in one
of the four qualifying-round finals.

HEART SURGERY TO BE PERFORMED ON THE INTERNET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The network that broadcast a live Internet birth June
16 plans to put open heart surgery from the Texas Heart Institute
on the Internet next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The patient who will undergo the procedure has not yet been
named, institute spokeswoman Jennifer Snyder said Wednesday in
Houston. Nor has it been revealed exactly what kind of open-heart
procedure will be performed.
</P>
<P>
   But the procedure will be live on the America's Health Network
Web site at www.ahn.com and on its cable television channel.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said she could not confirm that Dr. Denton Cooley _ THI's
surgeon-in-chief _ will perform the operation, although he probably
will be in the surgical suite while it was going on.
</P>
<P>
   The birth to Elizabeth Ann and Gilberto Oliver attracted
worldwide attention and more than a million hits on the site, said
the network's officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands who tried to view the birth were unable to see it
because of the great demand.
</P>
<P>
   Cooley, in a statement, said: ``We elected to take part in this
Internet/cable broadcast because it offers an unprecedented
opportunity to teach the public the importance of heart disease
prevention, and to inform them about the new technologies and
treatment that helped many patients live longer and more satisfying
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery will be part of a full day of programming on the
network dedicated to increasing heart health awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives said they had increased the capacity of their
network so that more viewers could log on to the Website during the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, the Web site supplied about
5,000 simultaneous video streams during the birth but at least
45,000 other users were trying to log on during that time.

WHO CAN, CAN'T WIN AT PGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The shame of the PGA Championship at Sahalee is
that it arrived in the Northwest too late for the competitive
careers of Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, Lee Trevino
and other big names from the childhoods of all the aging yuppies
whose split levels do their ungainly squats upon the Sammamish
plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Even Greg Norman, a potential successor to the legacy of the
ancients, skipped this one because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   What we have teeing off Thursday morning, for those who don't
consider themselves dimpleheads (the golf equivalent of baseball
seamheads), is Tiger Woods, local hero Fred Couples and everybody
else. The prospect has all the panache of the Sahalee clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that having 86 of the world's 100 top-rated
golfers makes this the toughest field in the history of majors (at
least in the history since some corporation bought rights to invent
rankings), the course is not overflowing with charismatic figures
who transcend the game.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, winner of the Masters and British Open, is as fine
a gentleman and golfer as the sport has produced, but he's a late
bloomer and a bit of a beige wall.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly can certainly light up a gallery, but his shots lately
are spending too much time in the gallery. Besides, a broken putter
is not the sort of thing the PGA likes to put on the cover of its
media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time PGA winner Nick Price is another good man who's a
household name in Zimbabwe and among the golf mags, but won't snap
many heads on the Monorail.
</P>
<P>
   None of this precludes the novice tourney follower from having a
good time this week _ as long as you stick with the winner. If
you're not in this for love (Davis or golf), and if you're not a
trendoid who must be in either the Woods or Couples camp, here's a
useful, if highly inaccurate, P-I guide for the great unwashed.
</P>
<P>
   WHO CAN'T WIN
</P>
<P>
   Any European. No player from the Incontinent has won the PGA
since the Depression, which also coincides with the rise of
international soccer as well as the rock group ABBA. Clearly the
answer to the decay of European society lies here.
</P>
<P>
   Unconventional fashion statement-makers. Sorry, David Duval
(sunglasses), Payne Stewart (knickers), Jesper Parnevik (turned-up
hat). PGA policy is to never allow its tournament to be won by a
player more than a single wingtip removed from the dead middle of
fashion mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of Microsoft stock. In case you've missed page one, also
in Redmond this week is the Justice Department, which is holding
Bill Gates upside down by the ankles, trying to shake the truth out
of him. If it works, the value of Microsoft stock could drop
dramatically, and all these rich golfers will spend the weekend
screaming into their cell phones at their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Woods. One big stock more vulnerable than Microsoft is Nike,
which has buried itself so deeply into Woods' soul that when he
sneezes, swooshes fill his handkerchief. Now that Nike is in
free-fall, it will insist that Woods win the PGA. The pressure will
be so great that he will fail.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who talks to his ball. If you see anyone on the course
screaming after his shot, ``Get left!'' or ``Bite!'', realize he's
a muni hack just like you, performing the silliest, most hackneyed
cliche in golf. Besides, in big tournaments, galleries are much
closer to the end of shots than the golfers. The ball can hear them
better.
</P>
<P>
   Retief Goosen and Scott Gump. No one named Goosen or Gump can
win a major.
</P>
<P>
   WHO COULD WIN
</P>
<P>
   An Australian. After the Yanks, the Aussies have won more PGA
titles than any other nationality (Jim Ferrier, 1947; David Graham,
1979; Wayne Grady, 1990; Steve Elkington, 1995). There are seven
here: Elkington, Robert Allenby, Stuart Appleby, Greg Chalmers,
Stephen Leaney, Peter Lonard and Craig Parry. You have to like the
idea Sunday afternoon at the clubhouse of more shrimp for the
barbie and more ice for the Fosters.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has his club manufacturer's name and logo on his bag
in type the size of radar stations. This would be everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Couples. The guy is sandbagging. He's poormouthed his recent
game in order to take some pressure off having to carry the clubs
for all of Northwest golf. But lurking inside is the beast of
Jefferson Park, whose furor was fueled by rubber mats, muddy greens
and greasy clubhouse fries. It's something that no rival PGA golfer
wants to see unleashed upon him.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy Waldorf. Somebody named Duffy MUST win a major sometime.
</P>
<P>
   WHO WILL WIN
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair. After O'Meara's triumphs at the Masters and
British Open, it is clear this is the year of roundness. Mayfair is
a round guy, about 5-foot-8 and 180-190 pounds, with a wild shock
of platinum hair and enough rumples to make a good sportswriter.
All these long, lean powerhouses like Woods and Ernie Els are good
for TV, but as with normal women and supermodels, nobody can
relate.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Mayfair beat Woods in a playoff to win the Los Angeles
Open. Last week, he won the Buick Open in Michigan. He's also the
perfect semi-obscure but solid guy (prize winnings of more than $4
million) who tends to make his career with a PGA win, like Grady,
Mark Brooks, Jeff Sluman and Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
   For the demographic-minded, in the 79 previous PGAs, guys
between ages 30 and 34 have won the most times (35). Mayfair is 32.
That fact is as relevant to forecasting Sunday's winner as any
other speculation you will hear this week.
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea if Mayfair's game is made for Sahalee. Mainly
because nobody's game is made for Sahalee unless he's a beaver or a
termite.

ABL TO REDUCE EMPLOYEE SALARIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Basketball League will begin administering
temporary salary cuts to all its employees, except for contracted
players and coaches, effective when pay checks are released later
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Front office employees were informed last week that that will
receive 10 percent reductions and as many as nine league personnel
will have cuts ranging from 15 to 100 percent in an ongoing effort
to increase profitability in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is we'll have it restored in three to five months,''
said Jim Weyermann, who was promoted from league vice president for
team operations to chief operating officer on Monday. ``We want to
use the savings to channel them into revenue generating initiatives
that increase our profitability. Part of that is marketing, part of
that's broadcasts, part of that's P.R., whatever those initiatives
are we want them to ... have a significant return on that
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The league's financial demands have increased since expanding
from nine to 10 teams for the upcoming third season, slated to
begin in November. Plus it recently signed a television agreement
with CBS in which the league will have to locate advertisers for
the two playoff games the network will broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Although coaches are excluded, they will be asked to volunteer
10 percent of their salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is we would like coaches to participate on the part
of the organization across the board, but we understand that
individual choice and circumstances will differ. I don't think that
we're in position to say that they've all agreed to it. I think the
majority on the phone at that point thought that that was something
they would be able to do,'' said Weyermann.
</P>
<P>
   So far, negative reaction from employees regarding the cuts have
been minimum, he said.
</P>
<P>
   `` Does everybody want to do it, no, but there wasn't a massive
outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Weyerman talked to all 10 general managers who reported that
employees ``understood the choice, they understood the decision,
and they understood it was part of the league needing to get more
profitable. The bottom line is we have to manage for the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   The cuts effect six employees in the Long Beach StingRay
franchise, including general manager Bill McGillis. McGillis, who
declined to comment specifically about the cuts and the effect on
his staff, said he was optimistic about the future of the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can say is that the league is looking for an important
financial model that would insure the ABL's long term health. This
is part of that,'' McGillis said.
</P>
<P>
   Weyermann said that employees who were expected to receive pay
increases in August will have their reductions made against the
projected raises. The raises will be activated when the cuts are no
longer necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are trends and there are things that we have to get
ourselves through and being fiscally responsible is one of the tops
things on our list along with providing the best product we can on
the basketball court,'' Weyermann said.

COTTON TO PLAY AT LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former St. John Bosco High star Schea Cotton has finally found a
place to play basketball. And this time, he didn't have to travel
across the country to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, who was one of the most celebrated high school players
in the history of Southern California, enrolled at Long Beach City
College on Monday morning, according to sports information director
Dean Hopkins, and plans to suit up for coach Gary Anderson's team
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton's decision to attend LBCC is the latest chapter in an
odyssey that has seen the 6-foot-6 swingman sign three different
letters of intent with three different universities; gain his
collegiate eligibility only to have it revoked by the NCAA;
consider entering the NBA draft even though he hadn't played a high
school basketball game since his junior year; and finally deciding
to attend St. Thomas More Academy, a prep school in Oakdale, Conn.,
this past season while his family appealed the NCAA's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton family's battles with the NCAA have played the
biggest part in his becoming a Viking. They started after Schea was
released from the first letter of intent he signed with Long Beach
State in April of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks after gaining his release from the 49ers,
Cotton signed a letter of intent with UCLA and seemed on the verge
of joining a standout recruiting class that included current Bruin
point guard Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Cotton and Davis spent most of last summer embroiled in a
NCAA probe that looked into the 1997 Ford Explorers both players
were driving. Also at question was the relationship between the
players and well-known traveling league coach Pat Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were eventually cleared of any wrongdoing, but
Cotton learned a week before he was to enroll in classes at UCLA
last fall that his college entrance examination score was being
invalidated by the NCAA Eligibility Clearinghouse because he had
received special accommodations a test with bigger print and no
time limit while taking the exam. The Cotton family contended that
Schea has a learning disability called test anxiety, but the NCAA
said it did not receive proper documentation regarding Cotton's
disability.
</P>
<P>
   While he appealed the NCAA's decision, Cotton attended St.
Thomas More, where he averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game
last season. When UCLA signed All-American shooting guard Ray Young
of Alameda St. Joseph in November, Cotton opted to take his
considerable talents elsewhere and immediately put together a short
list that included North Carolina State, Syracuse and UConn.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State won the battle for Cotton's services and he signed a
letter of intent with the Wolfpack on April 13, becoming the
centerpiece of a highly regarded class.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA denied Cotton's final appeal on June 5, and earlier
this month, N.C. State coach Herb Sendek confirmed that Cotton
would not be a part of his program. With no plans to retake the SAT
and with the NBA no longer a viable option, Cotton was left with
few alternatives, of which going to a junior college emerged as the
most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton will join a Vikings squad that finished a disappointing
</P>
<P>
   14-16 under interim coach Tony Lipold last season. But four key
players return from the group, led by all-conference forward
Darnell Williams, frontcourt mate Kevin Blunt and guards Isamu
Nichols and Richard Trevino.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton began his high school career at St. John Bosco, where he
played in a handful of games before transferring to Mater Dei just
a few weeks into his freshman season. The muscular lefty guided the
Monarchs to the Division I state title as a sophomore in 1995, but
transferred back to St. John Bosco prior to his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and academic difficulties limited his play as a junior,
and a shoulder injury suffered during a summer game completely
wiped out his senior season.

PGA IS STEPCHILD AMONG MAJORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The season's final major is the last chance for
the world's best golfers to make some noise.
</P>
<P>
   The (begin ital)really big shows(end ital) _ the Masters, U.S.
Open, British Open and even the Players Championship _ generally
suck all of the interest out of golf by the time the PGA arrives,
unless a Ryder Cup match follows.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fourth jewel in the game's grand slam; more a ruby than
a diamond. With no disrespect, the PGA is the smallest of the big
four, even though it's got a tougher field than the Masters, which
lets past champions keep playing again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   It's a minor major, albeit a lucrative one.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner pockets $540,000. That's the second biggest
major payday behind the Masters, which paid Mark O'Meara $576,000.
He also collected $492,000 for his British Open victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin Leonard took home the biggest check of all, $720,000
for his win at the Players Championship, which is the tournament
that might eventually knock the PGA off its major pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful any pro starts the year focused on winning the
PGA, unless one of the other major titles already resides on his
resume. The exception, of course, might be defending champion Davis
Love III, whose late father was a noted teacher and respected
member of the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt like in the majors the most important one was
the one that you were preparing for,'' Love said in a press
conference Wednesday. ``This tournament right now is the biggest
tournament in the world. And it's got the best field that we'll see
until the Players Championship next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But if Love never wins another major, he's proud that his named
is engraved on the PGA trophy.
</P>
<P>
   This tournament makes the John Dalys of the world famous. It's a
first-timer's paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the last 10 winners used the tournament to excise the
phrase ``best player not to win a major'' from their names.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie, the best player in the world not to win a
major, should tee off today as the favorite.
</P>
<P>
   And this week they are playing in Seattle, which is famous for
several things, just not golf. It's the soggiest place on earth,
has lots of great coffee shops, a really big mountain, an even
bigger software company, a world famous rich guy, and Ken Griffey
Jr., who is not the rich guy but, even better, is a fishing buddy
of Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA is Golf's off-Broadway show, routinely going where the
regular tour dares not. Courses with names like Valhalla and
Crooked Stick, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In a noble gesture, the PGA _ not the group that puts on the
professional tournaments each week but the one that staffs courses
around the country _ likes to spread its venues around so more fans
get to see a major championship. They are a lot like the U.S. Golf
Association in this respect.
</P>
<P>
   The product is not, though.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 Steve Elkington claimed the Rodman Wanamaker Trophy,
named for a department store magnate, when the championship came to
Riviera Country Club. Almost no one noticed. The tournament fell
far short of selling out, a rarity for a major. Grandstand seats
were empty on championship Sunday and spectators walking the course
had no trouble getting a good view of the action.
</P>
<P>
   There is some historical precedent in the tournament not getting
the same kind of respect as the other three. No one has ever scored
a gland slam, winning all four majors in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1953, the late Ben Hogan won the Masters and the U.S. and
British Opens. The PGA was played two weeks after the British and
Hogan, who owns a lot of history, took a pass on making more.
</P>
<P>
   He had been horribly injured in a 1949 car wreck and thought
playing two majors in such short a time would be too demanding.
Hogan never took a shot at the slam.
</P>
<P>
   This year history might just jump up and tell us exactly where
the PGA falls in the major scheme of things if Lee Janzen wins.
</P>
<P>
   Right now O'Meara, winner of two of the four majors, is the
favorite for player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   If Janzen, who won the U.S. Open on Father's Day, emerges on
Sunday from the towering pines lining Sahalee Country Club
clutching the Wanamaker trophy, he too will have two major titles
this year.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is, does a Masters and British Open add up to
more than a U.S. Open and PGA Championship? &QL;

THE PGA: WATSON'S UNFINISHED QUEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ For 26 years, Tom Watson has pursued this
title. A PGA Championship would further distinguish an already
fabulous career, one that ranks him with the best in history.
</P>
<P>
   He has won eight major titles, including five British Opens, two
U.S. Opens and one Masters. The fourth leg of the Grand Slam has
been as elusive as his putting stroke. For Watson, it is time to
stop talking and start stalking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant to me,'' Watson said Wednesday after his
practice round at Sahalee. ``This is the one I most want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   If one of golf's enduring players is to prevail Sunday, he would
join Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus as the
only men to capture all four majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can pull it off,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   With another 48-year-old, the confidence would sound as if it
came from an aging prizefighter whose punches aren't landing any
more.
</P>
<P>
   But now that he has rediscovered his touch on the greens, Watson
is connecting again. There were signs early this year when he
finished second in Phoenix and Hawaii. In between, he played at
Pebble Beach and is tied for first with Tim Herron with one more
round to go in the rain-delayed tourney Monday, the day after the
PGA concludes.
</P>
<P>
   There is statistical evidence supporting the revival of his
putter. He ranks 20th on tour with 28.55 putts per round. Watson is
first in sand saves, getting up and down 71 percent of the time,
proving he can once again convert the short ones.
</P>
<P>
   The solution was supposedly simple, perhaps complex. Watson
attributed his improved putting to acceleration through the ball
and proper use of his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   In what was a coincidence or a correlation, Watson also began to
make putts after he stopped drinking in November. He admitted that
the two developments might have been linked.
</P>
<P>
   Watson worked on his lag putting Wednesday, realizing the
importance of two-putts at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really challenge the pin positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson thinks long-iron play will be critical, an encouraging
possibility given the solid shots he was cracking from the fairways
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not played well in the major championships this year,
missing the cut at all of them, even at the British, where he
expected to play well. He said his swing is ``out of kilter'' but
manageable. It won't cloud his outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron Nelson said he never wanted to go into a tournament
feeling 100 percent,'' Watson said. ``It was better to be a little
tentative. It made him concentrate more.''
</P>
<P>
   As game faces go, Watson wears one of the best. Nicklaus likened
him to a horse with blinders, so intent is his focus. Criticism
bothers him; distractions do not. Watson's wife of 25 years filed
for divorce in December, and then he went out and played some of
his best golf ever in a three-week stretch spanning January and
February.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man of conviction and contradiction. One of his best
friends, Ben Crenshaw, called him ``a no-nonsense person,'' using
adjectives like resolute and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend, Tom Kite, says Watson is a ``good guy with a
great sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you try to pry the lid off, you will find that Tom Watson
is a public figure and a private man. He will put his golf on
display but nothing else. Watson will listen to Rush Limbaugh and
then tell you something that conveys a liberal-minded thought. Put
this in your pipe and smoke it: The supposed conservative from the
nation's heartland supports the legalization of recreational drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In any attempts to analyze the Mission Hills, Kan., resident,
you could end up as the subject. Watson majored in psychology at
Stanford. Watson hopes that all of his peers will think he was ``a
pretty good golfer,'' underplaying the actual thought. In 26 years
on tour, he has 34 championships. Arnold Palmer won seven majors,
but was shut out at the PGA.
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Sahalee will only enhance the legacy and diminish the
memories of nine long years between victories when he couldn't putt
it into a garbage can. It has been 15 years since Watson won his
last major at the British Open. In '83, he was still putting
aggressively, knocking the ball past the hole. At the Colonial,
Watson kept making the comebacks, and he is in the middle of
another one now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit quality shots,'' Watson said, evaluating his
ball-striking Wednesday. ``Not too bad for a guy who is almost 49
years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, he will try to smack one into the generation gap.
Watson is paired with David Duval and Justin Leonard, the
26-year-old wonderboys who could be his sons. Duval and Leonard
might be the ones trying to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm expecting him to play well,'' Kite said. ``I'm more
surprised when he doesn't play well. He's hitting it better than he
used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Watson was denied his best chance at a PGA
championship. Trailing by seven shots after the third round, John
Mahaffey caught Watson and then beat him and Jerry Pate in a
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, Watson will be among the Douglas firs, dwarfed by
his surroundings, standing out regardless of any perceived past
failures in PGA Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing in a tunnel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the light at the end is Watson.

   Johnson puts &QL; 
the K-bosh &QL; 
on Brewers
</P>
<P>
   Shutout comes with 13 strikeouts
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Milwaukee Brewers became the newest tenants of the National
League Central this season, supposedly getting away from Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Well, look who showed up in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pitched his second consecutive shutout Wednesday night,
striking out 13 batters as the Astros dumped the Brewers 3-0 before
a crowd of 40,217 at the Astrodome. The Astros maintained an
8{-game hold on the NL Central in winning their sixth straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio provided all the offense the Astros needed with a
bases-empty home run in the third and a run-scoring single in the
fourth. Johnson notched the first RBI of his career in the sixth
inning with a broken-bat single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain in the Johnson era: Whether in the American
League or National, he owns the Brewers. In his last 12 games
against Milwaukee, the 6-10 lefthander is 10-0 with a 2.53 earned
run average.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was no different as Johnson pitched a five-hitter and
ran his scoreless-innings streak to 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he pitches like that, he's going to really like the
National League,'' said Milwaukee third baseman Jeff Cirillo, who
was ejected along with manager Phil Garner in the ninth inning for
arguing balls and strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Since being acquired by the Astros in a trade with the Seattle
Mariners on July 31, Johnson is 3-0 with a 0.72 ERA. He has allowed
only two runs in 25 innings while striking out 33.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's 13 strikeouts Wednesday were the most by an Astros
pitcher this season (he held the previous high of 12 in his debut
Aug. 2) and marked the 97th time in his career he has recorded 10
or more strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson moved into second place on the all-time list for
double-digit strikeout performances, tying Sandy Koufax. The
all-time leader at 215 is Nolan Ryan, who watched Wednesday's game
from behind home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his career-long dominance of Milwaukee, Johnson said
there was nothing easy about his latest victory. He never fully got
comfortable on the mound and said he tired during the game after
running the bases and throwing 135 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson could have fooled the Brewers. Milwaukee's starting
lineup Wednesday night is batting a combined .176 (18-for-102) with
34 strikeouts lifetime against him. First baseman John Jaha has had
the least success against Johnson, going 2-for-25 with 10
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know me so well, they give me fits,'' Johnson said of the
Brewers, who have beaten him four times in 20 career meetings.
``They are a very disciplined, well-managed team. I shut down a
very good team.''
</P>
<P>
   What impressed Astros manager Larry Dierker was that Johnson's
performance came on a night when he never quite reached a comfort
zone on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, Randy came in and said the mound was a little
steeper (than the bullpen mound), and he didn't feel he had the
ball riding the way he likes to,'' Dierker said. ``Honestly, he
didn't feel at his best. What I found to be special about him is
his control. Even when he's not at his best, he still has better
stuff than the average guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten of Johnson's strikeouts came after the fourth inning,
including a string of seven in 10 batters from the fifth inning
through the seventh. The Brewers' only real scoring chance came in
the eighth when they loaded the bases with a pair of singles and a
walk. Johnson escaped the jam by getting Mark Loretta to pop out to
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who went 3-for-5, put the Astros ahead 1-0 in the third
with his 13th home run of the season, a solo shot to left field off
Brad Woodall (5-7). In the fourth, Biggio drove in Brad Ausmus, who
was hit by a pitch, with a single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added his first major-league RBI with a single off
Milwaukee reliever Eric Plunk.
</P>
<P>
   On most nights, three runs might not have been enough. But they
were a plateful for Johnson, who became the first Astros pitcher
since Mike Scott in 1988 to toss back-to-back shutouts. The shutout
was Johnson's fourth of the season and 21st of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that easy to score three runs and win,'' said
Dierker, whose club improved to 6-0 on its current 10-game
homestand. ``I have a feeling with him starting the game it's a lot
more likely.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's taking some getting used to. So what is the biggest
difference for Johnson in the NL?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt real comfortable out here,'' he said. ``The
mounds and ballparks are different in the NL. I'm pretty tired and
realize now that NL pitchers have to be in great shape to do all
the extra running. Maybe I need to get on a treadmill.''

COMMENTARY: IN GOLF, IT'S WHERE YOU HIT IT, NOT HOW FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl) 
By AL BARKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When legendary British golf champion Harry Vardon made an
exhibition swing through the United States in 1900 to promote what
was then the new game in town, he soon perceived an American
predilection for power.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for his exceptionally accurate approach shots, Vardon
wrote in his memoir: ``At that period, the Americans were not
sufficiently advanced to appreciate some of the finer points of the
game. They did, however, appear to thoroughly enjoy the type of
ball I drove. I hit it high for carry, which resembled a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The times have not changed much. Hitting the golf ball farther,
and farther, and farther, continues to be the mesmeric mantra of
American golf. Every golf club or ball advertised has promised to
produce longer shots; accuracy is thrown in at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, equipment manufacturers have been living up to this
sacred oath. In fact, they have wrought a serious conflict with the
United States Golf Association, which administers the rules of golf
and the legality of the equipment used: the USGA feels that the
titanium drivers so popular of late are allowing golfers to hit the
ball too far.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard to argue with power. The best or quickest
way for a tournament golfer to reach the heart of the American golf
fan is to be a long-knocker. Arnold Palmer became a folk hero not
simply because he won tournaments, but also because he won them by
force with his shirttail flying, his club gyrating wildly in the
follow-through and the ball soaring. The gallery regularly forgives
John Daly his past excesses of drink, tobacco, gambling and give-up
nonperformances when he rears back and sends a drive soaring into
the stratosphere. Tiger Woods' moments of youthful petulance are
forgotten the moment he swings his driver and sends the ball
outlandish distances.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the USGA loves the story of Paul Runyan's victory in
the 1938 PGA Championship. With this week's PGA being played in
Redmond, Wash., we celebrate the 60th anniversary of one of the
most astounding performances in the event, if not in all golf
history. Sixty years ago, at the Shawnee Country Club, in
Shawnee-on-the-Delaware, Pa., the tiny Runyan, though outhit by an
average of 75 yards a hole, defeated Sam Snead. And it wasn't a
squeaker; Runyan drowned Snead, 8 and 7, in the scheduled 36-hole
final of what was then a match-play event.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan proved the point: in golf, length is not everything. And
more specifically, super long hitters have a low percentage of
victories in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1946, 212 major championships have been played, and 35 of
them have been won by golfers with reputations for being
exceptionally long hitters. Jack Nicklaus won 17 of the 35, and
here we enter a conditional stipulation: throughout his illustrious
career, Nicklaus more often than not kept his driver in his bag and
played anything from a 3-wood to a 2-iron from the tees, on even
the longest holes, to make certain he kept the ball in play.
Granted, Nicklaus was so long that he did not give up all that much
yardage to the rest of the field, but he did level it. And won.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and British Opens, and the PGA Championship, are the
best measures of what we can call the pinpoint principle. Unlike
the Masters, where there is no rough (and which has had the most
long-knocker winners, 12 of 53), the narrow fairways and heavy
rough in the three other majors make accuracy off the tee essential
to success. Only five U.S. Opens in modern times have been won by
super sluggers, and four of them were won by Nicklaus. The other
was Palmer, and it is interesting that this was Palmer's only
victory in the most prized of the majors.
</P>
<P>
   After Woods' victory at the Masters, in 1997, seasoned golf
observers took a wait-and-see stance to those who were declaiming
the youngster unconquerable. How would he do in the Opens, and the
PGA, with that long ball of his? Would he be able to keep the ball
in the short grass? The answer was no. And it turned out that even
with shorter clubs off the tee, and from the fairway, he was unable
to throttle back his swing.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Woods' U.S. Open performances have been ordinary. In this
year's British Open, however, his third-place finish, only one
stroke short of the playoff between Mark O'Meara and Brian Watts,
indicated he was beginning to learn how to play golf. His swing was
more controlled, and so were his shots.
</P>
<P>
   Many young blasters have come along who could hit the ball out
of sight. But the ones who have the most long-term success are
those who have lightened their foot on the pedal, reined in the
macho pride of long-ball hitters and learned how to hit it where
they could see it.
</P>
<P>
   At the PGA, beginning Thursday, we may see the further maturing
of Woods into the complete champion. In the meantime, look for the
control freaks to dominate center stage, like Justin Leonard, or
O'Meara, the current Masters and British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the USGA ought to throttle back itself, in its
concern over the effects of titanium. Let's assume that Americans
are now sufficiently advanced to appreciate the finer points of the
game.

   Star attraction &QL; 
keeps his cool
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THEY came to see Randy Johnson's heat, which is, after all, why he
is such a perfect match for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   We revel in the heat. We soak it in and drink it up _ 100-degree
temperatures, 100-mph fastballs. Give it to us. Let it pour down on
us and drench us in sweat from the sizzling temperatures and
exhilaration from the scalding fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Richard did this to us. So did Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   They came to the Astrodome on Wednesday night, 40,217 of them,
not so much to see Johnson throw sizzling strikes but to hear him
do it. After all, who really sees the baseball blast out of
Johnson's hand and split the strike zone?
</P>
<P>
   Not the batters. Not you. Not me. And on several occasions
Wednesday night, certainly not home-plate umpire Jerry Meals, whose
strike zone more closely resembled the name of Johnson's favorite
grunge band _ Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A sight to see
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Hill, of the rock band ZZ Top, came. Hill might even be
the perfect poster boy for National League batters who face
Johnson's fastball. After all, have you ever seen the way Hill's
knees wobble when he plays the guitar?
</P>
<P>
   That's what they came to see Johnson do to these guys called
Brewers, whose knees first quivered, then wobbled, then buckled in
what would be a 3-0 Astros win that Johnson even best described
when he walked to his locker stall afterward and said, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   They chanted Johnson's name. They stood and cheered. They begged
for the heat and got what looked like a Houston summer _ 13
strikeouts and fastballs in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Our patron saint for heat, Ryan, even came, sitting behind home
plate with one arm slung over the seat next to him and, like all of
us, looking so contented and happy in the midst of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ryan and a few others knew about Johnson before
Wednesday night, Johnson showed loud and clear to the raucous crowd
and his Astros teammates.
</P>
<P>
   This guy is cool.
</P>
<P>
   The box score and highlight reel no doubt will make this look
like just another dominating fastball night for Johnson. The 13
strikeouts were an Astros season high and tied Johnson with Dodgers
great Sandy Koufax for second overall in the major-league record
book for double-digit strikeout games at 97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a hundred and something to go,'' Johnson said, in
reverence of Ryan, who tutored a young Johnson years ago and holds
the double-digit record with 215.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the way Johnson worked in and out, here and
there, on Wednesday, it was Johnson's polish that had to make
everyone feel that putting Johnson in an Astros uniform shouldn't
just be a rental agreement for the remainder of 1998. This should
be lease-purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out, he didn't really feel that he had the ball working
like he likes to,'' Astros skipper Larry Dierker said. ``He didn't
seem to be at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, through two innings it was Brewers starter Brad
Woodall, whose ERA entering the game (4.52) would have been
excellent if it were a grade-point average, who had twice as many
strikeouts as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fifth inning, when Johnson finally seemed to loosen
the arm and struck out the side, Woodall still had more strikeouts.
Johnson walked a batter in the first and gave up a hard leadoff
single in the second and another smash in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had a whole lot on the fastball,''
Johnson said. ``I feel like I lost three or four mph on my fastball
somewhere between Seattle (and here).''
</P>
<P>
   Heat not all there is
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard radar-gun reading backed up Johnson's contention
as much as his teammates backed him up defensively through the
early going.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night in his home debut when Johnson had eight
strikeouts, he was hitting 97 and 98 mph on the gun. On this night,
he mostly hovered in the 92-to-95-mph range, which still might be
fast for most big-league fans, but this is Houston. That's like
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But why was everyone standing and cheering wildly when Johnson
ended with a complete game? Because it was just that _ a complete
pitching performance.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp-breaking slider got Fernando Via to end the sixth. A
little corner-nibbling got Jeff Cirillo and Darrin Jackson swinging
at air in the seventh. Another slider capped off the eighth. He had
Brewers chasing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special,'' Dierker said. ``In all of his games, he's had
total command of both sides of the plate. When you watch him pitch
by pitch, he's making those pitches all the time. What it tells me
is this guy has a lot of charisma about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's performance told us the same thing Wednesday night.
It's not just the heat. It's the cool. And the scariest thing of
all, as Dierker bluntly put it afterward: ``There are going to be
games where he'll throw harder.''
</P>
<P>
   And we'll be there. We love the heat. The cool will do, too.

   Star attraction &QL; 
keeps his cool
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THEY came to see Randy Johnson's heat, which is, after all, why he
is such a perfect match for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   We revel in the heat. We soak it in and drink it up _ 100-degree
temperatures, 100-mph fastballs. Give it to us. Let it pour down on
us and drench us in sweat from the sizzling temperatures and
exhilaration from the scalding fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   J.R. Richard did this to us. So did Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   They came to the Astrodome on Wednesday night, 40,217 of them,
not so much to see Johnson throw sizzling strikes but to hear him
do it. After all, who really sees the baseball blast out of
Johnson's hand and split the strike zone?
</P>
<P>
   Not the batters. Not you. Not me. And on several occasions
Wednesday night, certainly not home-plate umpire Jerry Meals, whose
strike zone more closely resembled the name of Johnson's favorite
grunge band _ Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A sight to see
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Hill, of the rock band ZZ Top, came. Hill might even be
the perfect poster boy for National League batters who face
Johnson's fastball. After all, have you ever seen the way Hill's
knees wobble when he plays the guitar?
</P>
<P>
   That's what they came to see Johnson do to these guys called
Brewers, whose knees first quivered, then wobbled, then buckled in
what would be a 3-0 Astros win that Johnson even best described
when he walked to his locker stall afterward and said, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   They chanted Johnson's name. They stood and cheered. They begged
for the heat and got what looked like a Houston summer _ 13
strikeouts and fastballs in the mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Our patron saint for heat, Ryan, even came, sitting behind home
plate with one arm slung over the seat next to him and, like all of
us, looking so contented and happy in the midst of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ryan and a few others knew about Johnson before
Wednesday night, Johnson showed loud and clear to the raucous crowd
and his Astros teammates.
</P>
<P>
   This guy is cool.
</P>
<P>
   The box score and highlight reel no doubt will make this look
like just another dominating fastball night for Johnson. The 13
strikeouts were an Astros season high and tied Johnson with Dodgers
great Sandy Koufax for second overall in the major-league record
book for double-digit strikeout games at 97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a hundred and something to go,'' Johnson said, in
reverence of Ryan, who tutored a young Johnson years ago and holds
the double-digit record with 215.
</P>
<P>
   But looking at the way Johnson worked in and out, here and
there, on Wednesday, it was Johnson's polish that had to make
everyone feel that putting Johnson in an Astros uniform shouldn't
just be a rental agreement for the remainder of 1998. This should
be lease-purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out, he didn't really feel that he had the ball working
like he likes to,'' Astros skipper Larry Dierker said. ``He didn't
seem to be at his best.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, through two innings it was Brewers starter Brad
Woodall, whose ERA entering the game (4.52) would have been
excellent if it were a grade-point average, who had twice as many
strikeouts as Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Until the fifth inning, when Johnson finally seemed to loosen
the arm and struck out the side, Woodall still had more strikeouts.
Johnson walked a batter in the first and gave up a hard leadoff
single in the second and another smash in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I had a whole lot on the fastball,''
Johnson said. ``I feel like I lost three or four mph on my fastball
somewhere between Seattle (and here).''
</P>
<P>
   Heat not all there is
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard radar-gun reading backed up Johnson's contention
as much as his teammates backed him up defensively through the
early going.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night in his home debut when Johnson had eight
strikeouts, he was hitting 97 and 98 mph on the gun. On this night,
he mostly hovered in the 92-to-95-mph range, which still might be
fast for most big-league fans, but this is Houston. That's like
autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But why was everyone standing and cheering wildly when Johnson
ended with a complete game? Because it was just that _ a complete
pitching performance.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp-breaking slider got Fernando Via to end the sixth. A
little corner-nibbling got Jeff Cirillo and Darrin Jackson swinging
at air in the seventh. Another slider capped off the eighth. He had
Brewers chasing everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's special,'' Dierker said. ``In all of his games, he's had
total command of both sides of the plate. When you watch him pitch
by pitch, he's making those pitches all the time. What it tells me
is this guy has a lot of charisma about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's performance told us the same thing Wednesday night.
It's not just the heat. It's the cool. And the scariest thing of
all, as Dierker bluntly put it afterward: ``There are going to be
games where he'll throw harder.''
</P>
<P>
   And we'll be there. We love the heat. The cool will do, too.

COTTON TO LONG BEACH CITY COLLEGE
</HEADLINE>
 WITH COACH'S QUOTE-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LOUIS JOHNSON  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former St. John Bosco High star Schea Cotton has finally found a
place to play basketball. And this time, he didn't have to travel
across the country to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, who was one of the most celebrated high school players
in the history of Southern California, enrolled at Long Beach City
College on Monday morning, according to sports information director
Dean Hopkins, and plans to suit up for coach Gary Anderson's team
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's exciting ... I feel great that Schea's coming
home to play,'' said Anderson, who's returning for his his seventh
year as coach after taking last season off. ``With all the
unfortunate problems he's had, this is really going to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotton's decision to attend LBCC is the latest chapter in an
odyssey that has seen the 6-foot-6 swingman sign three letters of
intent with three universities; gain his collegiate eligibility
only to have it revoked by the NCAA; consider entering the NBA
draft even though he hadn't played a high school basketball game
since his junior year; and finally deciding to attend St. Thomas
More Academy, a prep school in Oakdale, Conn., this past season
while his family appealed the NCAA's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton family's battles with the NCAA played the biggest
part in his becoming a Viking. They started after Schea was
released from the first letter of intent he signed with Long Beach
State in April of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks after gaining his release from the 49ers,
Cotton signed a letter of intent with UCLA and seemed on the verge
of joining a standout recruiting class that included current Bruin
point guard Baron Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Cotton and Davis spent most of last summer embroiled in a
NCAA probe that looked into the 1997 Ford Explorers both players
were driving. Also at question was the relationship between the
players and well-known traveling league coach Pat Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Both players were eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but Cotton
learned a week before he was to enroll in classes at UCLA last fall
that his college entrance examination score was being invalidated
by the NCAA Eligibility Clearinghouse because he had received
special accommodations a test with bigger print and no time limit
while taking the exam. The Cotton family contended that Schea has a
learning disability called test anxiety, but the NCAA said it did
not receive proper documentation regarding Cotton's disability.
</P>
<P>
   While he appealed the NCAA's decision, Cotton attended St.
Thomas More, where he averaged 23 points and 11 rebounds per game
last season. When UCLA signed All-American shooting guard Ray Young
of Alameda St. Joseph in November, Cotton opted to take his
considerable talents elsewhere and immediately put together a short
list that included North Carolina State, Syracuse and UConn.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State won the battle for Cotton's services and he signed a
letter of intent with the Wolfpack on April 13, becoming the
centerpiece of a highly regarded class.
</P>
<P>
   But the NCAA denied Cotton's final appeal on June 5, and earlier
this month, N.C. State coach Herb Sendek confirmed that Cotton
would not be a part of his program. With no plans to retake the SAT
and with the NBA no longer a viable option, Cotton was left with
few alternatives, of which going to a junior college emerged as the
most attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton will join a Vikings squad that finished 14-16 under
interim coach Tony Lipold last season. But four key players return
from the group, led by all-conference forward Darnell Williams,
frontcourt mate Kevin Blunt and guards Isamu Nichols and Richard
Trevino.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton began his high school career at St. John Bosco, where he
played in a handful of games before transferring to Mater Dei just
a few weeks into his freshman season. The muscular lefty guided the
Monarchs to the Division I state title as a sophomore in 1995, but
transferred back to St. John Bosco prior to his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries and academic difficulties limited his play as a junior,
and a shoulder injury suffered during a summer game completely
wiped out his senior season.

LOVE KNOWS PAIN OF FAMILY TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Defending PGA Champion Davis Love III knows the
pain and suffering that Stuart Appleby is feeling after the tragic
death of his wife, Renay, last month when she was hit by a London
taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Love lost his father, noted PGA teaching pro Davis Love
Jr., in a plane crash. The tragedy nearly destroyed him until he
returned to what his father always wanted him to do: play
professional golf.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Love III seemed haunted by the death. He would still
win now and then, but the one major victory that he sought always
seemed to elude him.
</P>
<P>
   That was until last year at Winged Foot Golf Club in New York,
when Love, invoking the memory of his father, blew away the field
and claimed the 79th PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to Appleby: Be prepared for the pain to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until he goes all the way through the whole tour and he speaks
to every one of his friends and every one of the tournament
directors and every marshal at every tournament, it's not going to
be over for him,'' Love said Wednesday. ``And that was the hardest
thing for me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Love also knows the best way of dealing with the tragedy is
to play through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy that he's back out because he needs to start that
process and try to enjoy himself out here playing golf,'' Love
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Love, the past year has been particularly joyful because of
the win at Winged Foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as what it's meant to me, it will mean a lot to me the
rest of my life,'' he said of the PGA title. ``This year has been
great, and it still kind of gives you a little shock when you get
on the first tee and they introduce you as the 1997 PGA champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Love would love to be introduced next year as the 1998 PGA
champion, but knows that history is not on his side. The last time
there was a repeat champion of the PGA was in 1937 when Denny Shute
won back-to-back events when the tournament was match play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've reminded me of that a couple of times in the last
couple of days,'' Love said when told how difficult it is to repeat
at the PGA. ``You're just beating it into my head, I think. ... But
it would be a thrill to have a chance on Sunday and I'd like to
break that long-standing record.''
</P>
<P>
   Love likes what he's seen of Sahalee Country Club during the
past two days of practice rounds, but doesn't believe he has the
type of game that is well-suited to the course. Unless, of course,
he can stick to the straight and narrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight works, and that is the main thing,'' Love said. ``You
just have to hit a lot of fairways. Obviously, we're used to that.
In most of the majors, your accuracy off the tee is a premium. But
I think this one is going to be different.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the players are in a quandary over what clubs to
use off of the tees. Some will hit fairway woods, others 1- or
2-irons. Some might even hit 5- or 6-irons on some par-4s just to
get the ball in play and in good position.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it very hard,'' Love said. ``You have to hit two
really good iron shots in a row to get on the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, however, does have something on his side: the confidence
of a defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been there before,'' he said. ``You're still
nervous. You still want to win. You're still excited. You still
have to prepare. But you have that little bit of a more comfortable
feeling going in that I know what it takes and what it's going to
take on Sunday to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   In winning last year, Love also shed what he said was a
``negative mantel'' as one of the best players to have never won
one of golf's four major events. Now, the same thing is being said
about players such as Colin Montgomerie and Jim Furyk.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Love said he chose to use that as a positive
inspiration for the quality of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed the challenge of getting past that (first win at a
major) and I think a bigger challenge now is trying to get more,''
he said. ``I always took it as a compliment that people and other
players said that I should win (a major) and that when I did they
said, `It was about time.' ... Hopefully, we can build on that.''

BULLPEN LETS RED SOX DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mist and rain and gloom hung over Fenway Park when
Wednesday night's game against the Royals began. By game's end,
after a Royal 8-4 thrashing of the Red Sox, the gloom was worse.
</P>
<P>
   In between the early gloom and late doom, though, there were
seven innings of clean, crisp, tight baseball. ``It's
frustrating,'' said Boston starter Bret Saberhagen, ``these games
you're supposed to win but don't win, a close game throughout
except for the ninth inning. I feel we're a better ball club than
what they have.''
</P>
<P>
   A night after Boston rallied against Kansas City closer Jeff
Montgomery for a 7-4, 10-inning win, the Sox bullpen wasted
Saberhagen's gutsy six innings of one-run ball, allowing seven runs
in the final three innings as its ERA jumped from 3.78 to 3.93. And
the ERA of Carlos Reyes, who tried to pitch the ninth, jumped from
1.45 to 3.66 as the Royals batted around and scored five runs
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Until that horrible finish, the game was a sight to enjoy.
Royals starter Jose Rosado (1 run, 2 hits in 5 innings) toyed with
the Boston batters. ``Rosado always pitches us tough,'' said Sox
manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Saberhagen allowed only one run on six hits, striking
out the unfortunate Dean Palmer _ who left 10 runners on base _
with men on second and third in the third and the bases loaded in
the fifth. Each time Palmer whiffed, there was only one out.
</P>
<P>
   The score was 1-1 into the seventh, and as is the custom with
1-1 games, there was spectacular defense.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City right fielder Jermaine Dye made one of the Fenway
catches of the season, charging into the wall and reaching into the
seats at Pesky's Pole in the fifth to take a home run away from
Jason Varitek. It's a rarity at Fenway because right fielders
seldom can get to Pesky's Pole in time to even attempt a catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised he was even playing me that far over (toward
the pole),'' said the switch-hitting Varitek, who was batting
righthanded against lefty Rosado. ``I think that's the first ball
I've even hit to that side of second base all year. I thought when
I hit it, there wasn't a chance he'd catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra made a spectacular play in
the fifth after Saberhagen struck out Palmer for the second out.
Terry Pendleton hit a dart between Garciaparra and the bag, but the
shortstop dived, snagged the ball, righted himself, and fired to
first to nail Pendleton on a very close play, saving two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen made his usual departure after throwing 100 pitches.
``I felt good, but that's what they want to do, look out for the
high pitch count,'' he said. ``They don't want to wear me out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the seventh, Greg Swindell ambled to the mound
in relief. Plate umpire Larry Young was calling some balls strikes
and some strikes balls all night for both teams, and Swindell was
not a beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all threw some pitches that should have been strikes,''
said Saberhagen. ``Especially when I came up here to watch the
seventh (on TV) and Greg threw a 3-2 pitch that I thought was a
strike and they called it ball four and that guy ended up
scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   That 3-2 pitch came when Johnny Damon was at the plate with one
out and none on. After Damon walked, Hal Morris _ who was 5 for 6 _
drilled a double to left, moving Damon to third. Swindell then
walked Jose Offerman intentionally, loading the bases, before
Williams summoned Jim Corsi to face Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Corsi was ahead in the count, 1-2, and Palmer seemed destined to
strand his sixth, seventh, and eighth runners in three at-bats. But
on that 1-2 count with the bases loaded in a 1-1 game, Corsi threw
a breaking ball that skipped in the dirt and eluded Varitek,
rolling about 25 feet behind the catcher and allowing Damon to
score the go-ahead run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slider in the dirt,'' said Varitek. ``I was in front
of it, but it got under me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team added a run in the eighth, and it was 3-2 when Reyes
hitched his ERA to a balloon and watched it soar. Kansas City sent
10 batters to the plate _ including Palmer, who struck out with two
on _ and added five runs on six hits. Of course, Morris had one of
them _ an RBI double after Luis Rivera's RBI single and Damon's
two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like tonight was like any other night out there, but
when you get a couple of hits, you seem to find more and more holes
out there,'' said Morris, who was 6 for 9 in the two-game series.
``I was just up there swinging and hoping something would fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it was not the Boston ERA that fell on this night.

SUSPECT HELD IN OFFICER'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Information from the public led to the arrest of a
20-year-old man suspected of killing police officer Filbert Henry
Cuesta Jr., officials announced Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks identified the suspect as Catarino
Gonzalez Jr. of Los Angeles, who turned himself in Tuesday ``after
becoming aware that he had been identified and was wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the motive was he had an intent to kill a police
officer,'' Parks said. ``I would say it was not accidental. That's
why we call it murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Parks said that ``it was very important the public came forth
with information leading to the suspect. ... When his family became
aware of our interest in him as a suspect, they chose to bring him
to the station.''
</P>
<P>
   When he made the announcement, Park said that Gonzalez had been
arrested a number of times in the past. Lt. Anthony Alba said those
arrests were in connection with narcotics, but had no more details.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a witness told them that Gonzalez was with gang
members crashing a wedding party in the Crenshaw district of Los
Angeles early Sunday morning when he fired at Cuesta who was
outside in a police car.
</P>
<P>
   Cuesta, 26, was shot at 12:35 a.m. while he waited in the car
for backup officers to deal with the boisterous gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing our investigation,'' Parks said. ``Every
investigative lead will be covered ... in hopes of having the most
severe penalty possible at the conclusion of the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief said a vigil for Cuesta is scheduled for 8 p.m. today
at the Los Angeles Police Department's Southwest Division where
Cuesta worked.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services for are scheduled for 10 a.m. Friday at Calvary
Chapel in Diamond Bar, with burial to follow at Rose Hills Memorial
Park and Mortuary in Whittier.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the suspect turned himself in Tuesday and was
booked on suspicion of murder Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen police officers stood by with a photograph of
Cuesta as Parks announced the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers at the LAPD's Southwest Division expressed
relief when they learned that a suspect was in custody.
</P>
<P>
   Cuesta's killing was a blow to many Los Angeles residents, some
of whom brought flowers to police stations and expressed their
sorrow in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Jim McDonnell at the Southwest Division said that even
motorists being ticketed by LAPD officers were anxious to offer
their condolences.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 20 detectives from the LAPD's
Robbery-Homicide and Southwest divisions hunting for the killer.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County supervisors offered a $15,000 reward Tuesday
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was in Los Angeles on Tuesday, telephoned
Cuesta's wife, Sylvia, and spoke to her about violence in America
and about how dangerous it is to be a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Cuesta had served in the LAPD for four years and was assigned to
the Southwest Division, where he worked in an anti-gang detail.

BLUE JAYS' RALLY SPOILS A-ROD MILESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Alex Rodriguez made it onto a short list in the record
books Wednesday at SkyDome. The Mariners just wished they could
find seventh heaven.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in less than 24 hours, the Toronto Blue Jays
erupted with a big seventh inning to erase a Mariner lead. Tuesday
night, the rally was six runs; Wednesday it was seven. But the
result was the same. Wednesday's 11-5 loss left the Mariners
limping back across the border with an 0-2 record in the brief
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we said we didn't want to see another six-spot,''
manager Lou Piniella said Wednesday, referring to Tuesday night's
series opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner bullpen, which has been pitching magnificently
recently, took it on the chin again, squandering the two-run lead
Rodriguez provided in the top of the inning with his 36th homer of
the season and the 100th of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a great opportunity to win the game after
hitting that home run,'' the 23-year-old Rodriguez said, ``but that
wasn't the case. (The home run) is secondary to winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In matching his career high for homers in a season, he became
the fourth-youngest player in big-league history to hit 100 homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the accomplishment, no doubt about it,''
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Only Mel Ott, Tony Conigliaro and Eddie Mathews hit their 100th
homers at a younger age. Ott and Mathews are in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-Rod has had a marvelous year, and he's a marvelous player,''
Piniella said. ``He can do just about anything he wants to do on a
baseball field. The young man can play, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in losing their second straight game after beginning
the nine-game road trip with a four-game sweep against the Detroit
Tigers, the Mariners further damaged their vanishing hopes of
climbing back into the American League West pennant race.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the bullpen for this loss. Specifically Bobby Ayala and
Greg McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Starter Jamie Moyer, who retired the first nine batters he faced
and led 3-0 going into the fifth inning, wobbled a little in the
fifth when Toronto scored two runs. Moyer exited in the seventh
after Mark Dalesandro doubled and scored on Craig Grebeck's one-out
single.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ayala.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander faced two batters and retired neither,
prompting Piniella to summon McCarthy, a left-hander, to face
left-handed hitter Shawn Green.
</P>
<P>
   A good pitch on a 2-and-2 count put Toronto in front for good as
Green fought off a pitch on his hands and blooped a two-run double
over third baseman Russ Davis' head.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could jump higher or was about two inches taller, I would
have had it,'' said Davis, who stationed himself closer to home
plate to cut down the go-ahead run at the plate. ``I had to play in
in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, who has been brilliant since replacing Tony Fossas in
the bullpen, holding left-handers to one hit in 19 at-bats, said he
thought both of the preceding pitches to Green on two-strike counts
were strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have thrown him a fastball (on 2-and-2)
instead of a slider,'' said McCarthy, who then walked Jose Canseco
and served up a grand slam to Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bullpen had stabilized before we came in here,'' Piniella
said, ``but didn't do the job the past two days. Let's hope
starting (Friday night in Chicago) it starts doing the job again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez's clutch home run off winning Blue Jay reliever
Nerio Rodriguez, with Rob Ducey aboard on a leadoff walk, Piniella
hoped to get through the seventh and then turn the game over to
closer Mike Timlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to pitch him two innings because he hadn't
pitched in three days,'' Piniella said. ``But we didn't get to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora opened the game with a walk and eventually scored on
Edgar Martinez's two-out single. The M's made it a 3-0 game in the
third off Toronto starter Kelvim Escobar when both Cora and
Rodriguez, who had singled, scored on a wild throw to third base by
catcher Darrin Fletcher on a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Davis each had two hits for the M's, but Ken
Griffey Jr. and David Segui continued to struggle. Both went
hitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Griffey) had more snap on the bat and he'll come out of it,''
Piniella said of his center fielder, who is 8-for-41 in August.
``No one is immune to going into a hitting funk. We need Junior to
start swinging the bat the way he's capable of, and he will.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Griffey: ``Wow, I'm human! Maybe that's it.''

FOOTBALL FRESHMAN GETS HIS ACT TOGETHER TO HIT WASHINGTON STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The biggest yelp from anyone around the Washington
football program this summer had nothing to do with the Huskies
being ranked
</P>
<P>
   No. 17, or Jim Lambright, the head coach, boating another king
salmon off the Alaskan coast.
</P>
<P>
   It came from Scott Pelluer, the defensive assistant coach, when
he got the news that one of his prime recruits had a qualifying
score on the American College Test and would indeed be eligible
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Hakim Akbar, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound free safety, sat there
Wednesday at the Huskies' annual freshman luncheon, and he said it
more than once: ``I'm just happy to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy? He ought to hear the Huskies' side of it.
</P>
<P>
   Word is already out that when Akbar arrived 10 days ago,
quarterback Brock Huard took fast notice of how Akbar can shadow a
wide receiver. ``A three-year (college) player,'' said another
veteran Husky defender, seeing the NFL in Akbar's future.
</P>
<P>
   Those things happen when you arrive with a healthy 325-pound
bench press, a 38-inch vertical jump and football smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks really good,'' Lambright said after the Huskies'
first freshman drills Wednesday morning. ``Fundamentally, he does a
lot of things right. His athletic ability allows you to think good
things about him being able to play right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to be here. The phrase has come to mean little, but in
Akbar's case, it carries some weight.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Atlanta, he and his brother, Mikal, now 19, were sent
west by their mom to live with their dad in Riverside, Calif., six
years ago. That worked until a major misstep by the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad's a good person,'' Akbar said. ``He helped me be where
I am today. He was strict. He just did the wrong thing. He got
caught up ... he did it for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Akbar's father was convicted of bank robbery in
Riverside. His younger son says he is serving time until 2002 in
San Luis Obispo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers bounced around, from the home of an uncle to family
friends, failure waiting to happen. They wouldn't let it.
</P>
<P>
   Akbar spent his senior year living with only his brother, who is
now a wide receiver at San Bernardino Valley College. It's not the
prescribed way to overcome an academic hurdle, but he accomplished
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't want to go to school, I didn't have to,'' Akbar
said, referring to the absence of parents. ``I had to really push
myself. I had to think about how bad I wanted to get up here. If I
wanted to be a little dud or something, I could have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up making the honor roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The test score came harder. Foiled three times on the Scholastic
Assessment Test, he survived the ACT. When he got his score late in
June, the first thing he did was fall to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thanked God,'' Akbar said. ``I couldn't have done it without
him. I assumed I was done, and I'd have to go to a JC.''
</P>
<P>
   Akbar's family is close. He wrote to his father the other day,
lamenting that for now, he has no telephone to take a collect call.
But he and Mikal talk almost daily, dreaming of a time when they
might meet on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother, he stays on me pretty hard,'' Akbar said. ``If I'm
doing something wrong, he lets me know I'm doing it. I love him to
death. It's kind of hard being away from him. He's a real good
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Akbar visited Arkansas, Arizona State, Cal and Washington.
Tennessee went hard after him, but a change in assistant coaches
swayed him against the Vols. He got eight of 10 votes on the Long
Beach Press-Telegram's Best in the West voting, but was considered
iffy at best when the Huskies signed him because of the
freshman-qualifying questions.
</P>
<P>
   SuperPrep Magazine was impressed, writing, ``Anyone who saw tape
of Akbar projects him as an all-conference player within two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely get his chance. Akbar comes into a position
considered one of the Huskies' most vulnerable, especially against
the considerable legacy of free safeties like Lawyer Milloy and
Tony Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Brendan Jones is the likely starter, pursued by redshirt
freshman Omare Lowe and Walla Walla JC product Renard Edwards, who
is not at the UW yet because he is trying to finish his two-year
degree.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the opening, Akbar is unassuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to work hard,'' he said. ``There's a lot of
good guys there. I'm just going to try to earn my way, work hard
and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   SPEED FREAKS: In a morning testing session of the new players,
running back Jelani Harrison and outside linebacker Jafar Williams
topped all classmates by running 40 yards in 4.55 seconds in
football shoes. That puts in perspective the 4.29 of wide receiver
Ja'Warren Hooker last year in the same circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Lambright said he thought some players' times were slowed by
nervousness, but nevertheless called it ``the best running group of
freshmen we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   IFS, ANDS, MUTTS: Two who weren't on hand were LB Anthony Kelley
and DE Roger Faagata. Kelley, one of the marquee recruits of the
class, is awaiting results of his attempt to get a waiver from the
NCAA Clearinghouse on a core-class issue, and Faagata, one of three
junior-college recruits, is completing work on his JC degree in
Long Beach ... Wideout Will Hooks of Anchorage is apparently
healthy after sustaining a torn Achilles tendon since last season.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most pleased to be here is QB Jerramy Stevens of
River Ridge, freed by a Thurston County judge's ruling to attend
camp after a summer during which Stevens was on electronic home
monitoring for an assault charge, then jailed for three weeks for a
subsequent failed drug test. ``I'm just happy to be at the UW
playing football,'' Stevens said. Lambright, saying Stevens had a
3.5 grade-point average and 1,000 SAT score, observed, ``He made a
mistake. It'll go through the process of trial and we'll let it
take its course. We don't give up on a player because he makes one
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen continue workouts Thursday, with the rest of the squad
reporting Friday. The initial full workout is Saturday afternoon,
preceded by annual picture-day festivities at Husky Stadium from
1-3 p.m. Admission, soft drinks and hot dogs are free.
</P>
<P>
   DT T.J. Jackson, projected as a backup, has left the program, as
has FS Curtis Williams.

MOON SETTLES FOR LESS, ENDING 25-DAY HOLDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY _ In the end, Warren Moon decided it wasn't worth trying
to win at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks starting quarterback ended his 25-day holdout that
was all about money Wednesday by agreeing to a two-year, $4.97
million package that includes a $2.25 million signing bonus and
base salaries of $220,000 this season and $2.5 million next year.
Moon could earn another $1.2 million this season in team-oriented
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't as much money as Moon was seeking, or feels he
deserved. It could end up being less money than he could have
gotten by accepting the club's one-year, $2 million deal that had
been on the table for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A holdout is not a positive thing at all,'' Moon said. ``At
some point, you have to make a decision: Is money more important
than being with the players and doing the things you love most?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to basically come to the realization that I'd much
rather be out here playing football and with my teammates than
sitting out there a little longer for a few extra dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   What finally got a deal done was the Seahawks agreeing to the
signing bonus; Moon and his agent, Leigh Steinberg, accepting the
low base salary that frees up $500,000 under the team's snug salary
cap; and Moon realizing he needed to report to training camp now to
have enough time to prepare himself to be the starter in the Sept.
6 regular-season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Moon is not expected to sign his contract until later this week
because it is the first in NFL history to include guarantees that a
player will repay money to the club in the second year if he
retires or is cut and must be approved by the league. If Moon
retires, he will repay as much as 75 percent of the $1.125 million
that is the prorated signing bonus for the second year. If he is
cut, Moon will repay 25 percent of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   So he could end up with as little as $1.626 million, and Moon
owes the team $125,000 in fines from his holdout and lost another
$68,000 in game checks for missing the first two preseason outings.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this seemed to matter Wednesday. Not to Moon, who
was relieved to have the first holdout in his 21-year professional
career behind him. Not to the large crowd of fans, who trumpeted
Moon's late arrival to the afternoon practice with a chorus of
shrieks and a round of applause. Not to Moon's teammates, who
greeted his return with hugs, handshakes and a little good-natured
ribbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's excited,'' running back Ricky Watters said.
``Everybody knows what he does and what he brings to a team.
There's no way we're going to sit here and try to downplay that
situation. He's a Hall of Fame quarterback. I'm just happy I'm
going to get a chance to play with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon will not play in Saturday night's game against the San
Francisco 49ers in Vancouver, B.C., coach Dennis Erickson said. Jon
Kitna will start and play most of the first half before giving way
to John Friesz. Moon will take over the No. 1 offense Monday after
the team returns to its training complex in Kirkland and start next
week's game at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The official word on whether the 41-year-old Moon starts the
regular-season opener depends on how well he progresses in practice
and the last two preseason games. The expectations are that it's a
given.
</P>
<P>
   Moon remained after practice Wednesday and threw passes for 15
minutes. Each was on target. Each had that Moon touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to have Warren in camp. We hoped it would come down
to this. Obviously we hoped it would be sooner than this,''
Erickson said. ``But we think there's plenty of time to get
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon agrees, especially since he participated in each of the
team's four minicamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be ready for the season,'' he said. ``It's just a
matter of getting out here and doing a little extra work every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon admitted that as late as Tuesday night he wasn't sure if he
would be flying to training camp or his offseason home in Houston
Wednesday. But after he and Steinberg finalized the deal in Seattle
with club president Bob Whitsitt at 12:30 p.m., Moon hopped a plane
to Spokane, was driven to training camp and made his late-practice
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long day that ended right where Moon wanted it to _
standing in the middle of the post-practice huddle addressing his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically talked to them about the reasons why I wanted to
come back,'' he said. ``I had to draw a line on what was most
important. ... I just wanted to let them know why I held out and
hopefully they'll understand and accept me back.''

DODGERS LOSE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers can talk all they want before the
game. They're still stuttering on the field.
</P>
<P>
   An impassioned half-hour meeting Wednesday was designed to turn
the season around, but in the end they lost 3-2 to the lowly
Florida Marlins in front of 36,452 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff hitter Eric Young, a keynote speaker at the meeting,
also stepped up during the game with four hits and two two-out RBI
hits. But No.2 hitter Mark Grudzielanek really spoke for the team,
going 0 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams battle through these things,'' Grudzielanek said.
``We'll see if we're a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers aren't right now, going 2-6 during a stretch of
games against sub-.500 teams that is leading up to a weekend series
against the mighty Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta?'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``We're fighting just
to get to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlins first baseman Derrick Lee hit a game-winning home run
with one out in the eighth off Dodgers reliever Antonio Osuna, who
had just entered the game in place of starter Carlos Perez.
</P>
<P>
   For Lee, it was his 14th homer and it gave the Marlins their
first three-game winning streak of the season. For Osuna, it was
his first loss in eight decisions. For the Dodgers, it was their
third consecutive loss.
</P>
<P>
   But with the beauty, or the perversity, of the wild card, they
remain just 5{ games back with 42 to play. The top of the wild-card
picture changed hands Wednesday when the New York Mets lost in 14
innings to St. Louis and the Chicago Cubs beat San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are close, but they are hardly playing like
champions. They had the tying run on base in the eighth and ninth
but couldn't get it done.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' sixth and Marlins' seventh innings were good
examples of the lack of intensity on the home team.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 1-1 in the bottom of the sixth, Raul Mondesi
appeared to get something started when he legged out an infield
single to short. But with slumping Gary Sheffield at the plate,
Mondesi was picked off first.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who entered the game just 2 for 11 on the homestand,
flied out. Eric Karros blooped a single off the glove of Marlins
second baseman Luis Castillo in shallow right but was thrown out
trying to stretch the play into double.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' seventh was worse.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo grounded wide of first base and beat Karros' throw to
Perez at the bag. One out later, John Cangelosi grounded a playable
ball to third, but it bounced off Adrian Beltre's glove and rolled
away from Dodgers fielders. By the time it stopped, Castillo scored
all the way from first and Florida led 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had taken a 1-0 lead in the fifth against
left-hander Kirt Ojala, the second of three Marlins rookie starters
they will face in this series.
</P>
<P>
   Ojala walked Charles Johnson with one out but appeared to get
out of trouble when he struck out Perez for the second out. Young
had other ideas. He doubled to the gap in right-center and Johnson
scored from first base.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers tied it in the seventh and again it was Young
playing the catalyst. Rob Stanifer (1-3), who turned out to be the
winning pitcher, took over for Ojala to open the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, who was booed for the second consecutive game,
drew cheers when he led off with a ground single to right. Roger
Cedeno pinch ran and moved to second on a sacrifice by Beltre.
Johnson struck out, but pinch-hitter Jim Eisenreich kept the inning
alive with a walk.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who came in just 3 for 14 on the homestand, slapped his
third hit of the game over second base and Cedeno scored.
</P>
<P>
   After batting practice, the entire team, minus coaches and
manager Hoffman, retreated to a players' lounge to discuss how to
turn around their season.
</P>
<P>
   It was no longer a matter of catching the San Diego Padres, who
have run away with the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has been intensity and the fans are noticing. In
Tuesday's 8-6 loss to the Marlins, they loudly booed every Dodgers
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start playing like this is our last game,'' Mondesi
said after the meeting. ``Believe me, we are trying hard, but it
isn't enough. There is time, but have get this thing going. We have
to feel like every game is big. I don't want to go back to the
Dominican and watch other teams in those playoffs.''

S.F. BAY AREA SHAKEN UP BY 5.4 TEMBLOR 
</HEADLINE>

 and DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ A moderate 5.4 earthquake and two minor
temblors rolled through the Bay Area and Central California early
Wednesday, sending bottles crashing to floors, setting off alarms,
opening up a handful of cracks on Highway 101 and sending seniors
at an early-morning bingo game in Gilroy running for cover.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the main quake, which jolted residents from Rohnert Park to
Big Sur and rocked San Francisco highrises, left San Juan
Bautista's oldest living male resident unmoved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a little shake,'' said 93-year-old Spot Wood, who
lives a short distance from the epicenter of the quake. ``You get
more shake in a rocking chair.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5.4-magnitude earthquake was centered seven miles
south-southeast of San Juan Bautista on the edge of the San Andreas
Fault system. No serious damage or injuries were reported, and most
residents in San Benito County took the 7:10 a.m. quake in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of used to it, considering the San Andreas Fault is
a few blocks away,'' said Robert Barnett, assistant manager of the
Lucky supermarket in Hollister, which suffered $700 in damage from
broken bottles of cooking oil and liquor. ``This is the second or
third good one this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reported quake-related injury occurred near Santa Cruz
when an 18-year-old man climbing out of a bunk bed in the loft of
his home on Lionsfield Drive slipped off a ladder when the ground
shook and he struck his head on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics took the man to Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz,
where he was treated for minor injuries and released, a nursing
supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A minor quake, registering 3.1, preceded the main temblor at
7:02 a.m. More than 40 small aftershocks followed within four
hours, the largest being a 3.0 that hit at 8:56 a.m., according to
seismologists at the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not unexpected for the region,'' said seismologist
Frederick W. Lester, who monitors earthquakes day and night
throughout Northern California with the geological survey's
computer-linked network of seismographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very seismically active area,'' said Susan Garcia, a
spokeswoman for the agency, saying this was the strongest quake
since 1990, when there was a 5.4 temblor in the same area. There
was a 5.7 quake in the area in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe this is the precursor for
something bigger,'' she said. ``It's just a reminder from Mother
Nature that these happen, and we need to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Humberto Arredondo, manager of the Windmill Market in downtown
San Juan Bautista, said his store sustained about $5,000 in damage
when bottles of liquor and hot sauce tumbled from shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here counting money,'' Arredondo said. ``We heard a big
noise and felt a hard shaking _ a very hard shaking. The lights
went off, and we had customers running out the door screaming and
yelling. All the aisles were full of broken glass and other
merchandise, especially wine and liquor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clerks working at the Garlic Festival Store in downtown Gilroy
could not seem to rid the place of the pungent smell of gourmet
oils and vinegars Wednesday. About $2,000 worth of the stuff
clattered to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just mopped over and over and over,'' said Kim Ashford, a
salesclerk.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart Store in Gilroy closed for an hour so employees
could clean up broken picture frames and gallons of paint that
splashed on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The quake also disrupted a weekly bingo game there. Thirty to 40
seniors had gathered at the McDonald's inside the Wal-Mart for
their regular game. But as the ground started to rumble, they ran
for cover with doughnuts and coffee in hand. ``They were a little
scared, but not too disappointed,'' said Robin Pilger, a department
manager.
</P>
<P>
   California Department of Transportation crews were dispatched to
Highway 101, just north of Highway 129, to repair three spidery
cracks that had opened up in the southbound lanes. The cracks did
not disrupt traffic, but ``if left untreated, the traffic would
start beating the raw edges and make it worse,'' said Don Webster,
an area superintendent for Caltrans.
</P>
<P>
   The 201-year-old San Juan Bautista mission, a popular tourist
spot, sustained minor damage when a patch of plaster fell from an
interior wall, said Rosie Murray, an office manager. But otherwise
the historic site was undamaged.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Kemp, manager of the Mission Farm R.V. Park in San Juan
Bautista, a community of 1,650 people about 90 miles south of San
Francisco, said other than having to chase two loose goats _ freed
when the quake knocked down the gate to their pen _ he had no
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say sometimes that the best place to be is on top of the
fault line _ the impact spreads out,'' mused resident Jim Morrison,
while chatting with another resident at the park.
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the three quakes and the smaller aftershocks
that followed, seismologists at the geological survey said there is
a small probability that a ``strong and possibly damaging
aftershock'' with a magnitude of 5.0 or larger could hit the region
within the next seven days.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed, however, that the probability of such an event is
only 20 percent and that their calculation is ``not an exact
prediction, but only a rough guide to expected aftershock
activity.'' Other very small aftershocks that might be felt locally
are expected in the same seven-day period, the quake experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreshock that preceded Wednesday's main event by barely a
minute and half was typical of many California earthquakes.
Foreshocks occur in about 10 to 20 percent of all temblors that hit
the state, according to geophysicist David P. Hill at the
geological survey.
</P>
<P>
   The small temblors can vary from a single event to a series of
frequent ones, and any of them can precede a main quake by minutes
to hours or even days, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Earth scientists who study the phenomena have long hoped that
understanding the relationship of foreshocks to larger quakes might
some day lead to early warnings of dangerous events to come, Hill
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are certainly symptomatic that something is happening
inside a fault, but there's still a lot we need to learn about
them,'' he said.

HACKER STOLE THOUSANDS OF PASSWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY K. LEE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When a University of California at Berkeley
graduate student logged onto his computer, he made a startling
discovery: someone had cracked his password and was using his
account to run a program to get even more passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Using a program called ``John the Ripper'' that can be
downloaded from the Internet, the high-tech intruder had broken
into computer accounts not only at UC Berkeley but at universities
and companies around the world. The hacker had decoded nearly
48,000 passwords from a list of 186,000 encrypted ones _ in what
computer experts say is one of the largest known collections of
filched access codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just amazed by the sheer number of passwords he had,''
said Michael Kleber, the system administrator who spent several
weeks investigating the breach at Evans Hall, UC Berkeley's math
building.
</P>
<P>
   The June break-in, which is being investigated by the FBI,
underscores how easy it is for cyber prowlers with just basic
technical skills _ and plenty of time on their hands _ to penetrate
and manipulate computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   While the hacker apparently didn't seek out classified
information or break into government accounts, he or she was
decidedly hungry for more passwords, trotting the globe
electronically in a quest for greater access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technology he was using is not sophisticated, but what's
interesting here is the scope,'' said Doug Tygar, a computer expert
at Carnegie Mellon University who will join the UC Berkeley faculty
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed by his persistence to keep something running for
that long,'' Tygar said. ``The stamina to collect this number of
passwords is pretty awe-inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the hacker is operating from somewhere in
Europe because the computer systems that were first compromised
belonged to European universities.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the hacker broke into accounts at a noted Silicon
Valley company, an Internet service provider in Indiana, UC
Berkeley, UCLA, the California Institute of Technology, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.
Another 80 percent of the cracked passwords found at UC Berkeley
belong to accounts yet unidentified.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber said the intruder gained access to the Internet through
Telenordia, an Internet service provider in Sweden. The cyber
prowler left a computer trail through England, Denmark and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker wasn't detected until June 29 at UC Berkeley, where
Kleber was notified by the graduate student that his account had
been broken into.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber notified the FBI, and the agency's computer crime squad
in San Francisco is investigating, said spokesman George Grotz.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team,
or CERT, which monitors computer security violations nationwide,
publicized the breach on its Web site last month.
</P>
<P>
   The intruder had compiled a list of 186,126 accounts and
encrypted passwords _ most of which were non-UC Berkeley accounts _
and, at the time of Kleb-er's discovery, had decoded 47,642 of
those passwords, according to CERT.
</P>
<P>
   Kleber found that in some cases the intruder had installed
``trojans'' or ``back door'' entrances, allowing immediate re-entry
into the compromised systems.
</P>
<P>
   These were used with ``John the Ripper,'' the password-cracking
program, and ``packet sniffers,'' programs that intercept passwords
typed in by account users.
</P>
<P>
   Password-cracking programs are used legitimately by system
administrators to make sure user passwords can't be easily cracked.
Packet sniffers are key tools in diagnosing problems with slow
networks. But used nefariously by hackers, the programs actually
undermine the systems they were designed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of ways to take care of the vulnerabilities
that exist today,'' said John Vranesevich, founder of AntiOnline, a
computer security group. ``It's not that the hackers are using
methods that aren't known, but system administrators for the most
part haven't been putting a big enough emphasis on security.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts acknowledge that identifying the hacker will be
a difficult, if not impossible, task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without law enforcement help, it's pretty much slim-to-none,''
said UC Berkeley graduate student David Wagner, a founding member
of Internet Security, Applications, Authentication and
Cryptography, or ISAAC, a computer security research group on
campus. ``It's a matter of patience and luck and being able to
trace it all back.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ISAAC revealed a major security flaw in Netscape's Web
browser that could have allowed scofflaws to intercept bank account
and credit-card information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Two other high-profile incidents have also renewed concerns
about computer security. In March, hackers attacked computers
nationwide running Microsoft network software at NASA, the Navy and
colleges including UC Berkeley. Last month, two Cloverdale
teenagers pleaded guilty to hacking into U.S. government
computers. &QL;

 SKIRMISHES OVER GAY RIGHTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gays rights advocates scored one of their biggest political
victories ever last month when the House rejected an attempt to
overturn President Clinton's executive order banning discrimination
against gays in federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment was just one in a series of high-profile
battles over gay rights: attempts by conservatives, both in and out
of Congress, to raise the issue before the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate Republicans have held up the nomination of openly gay
San Francisco businessman James Hormel to be ambassador to
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., publicly compared
gays to kleptomaniacs and alcoholics _ and other GOP leaders,
including House Majority Leader Dick Armey, supported Lott,
referring to Old Testament condemnations of homosexuality as a sin.
</P>
<P>
   -- The House passed an amendment last month written by North
Coast Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., punishing San Francisco for its
policy requiring city contractors to provide domestic partner
benefits. The bill would deny money currently provided by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development unless the city drops
the policy.
</P>
<P>
   -- A conservative group placed full-page ads in newspapers last
month urging gays to become ``reformed'' through faith and prayer. &QL;

GAY REPUBLICANS VENTURE DEEP INTO ENEMY TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gay Republicans call it the Selma of their own
civil rights movement: Dallas, where the religious right dominates
the GOP the way liberals dominate politics in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was in Dallas two months ago that the spokesman for the Texas
Republican Party, Robert Black, called the Log Cabin Republicans a
``deviant group'' like the Ku Klux Klan and denied the gay
organization a booth at the state party convention. ``We don't
allow pedophiles, transvestites and cross-dressers, either,'' he
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a gay Republican in Texas is a little like being a black
Democrat in Mississippi in the 1950s,'' said Dale Carpenter, Texas
director of the Log Cabin Republicans. ``You're involved in a party
that doesn't really want you, where you're excluded, discriminated
against, segregated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Log Cabins protested their exclusion from the
convention, they were met with venomous counterprotesters who
shouted slurs, shoved and pushed them and waved signs saying ``God
Hates Fags.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is in Dallas this weekend that about 200 Log Cabin
Republicans from around the country will gather for the group's
national convention, challenging the GOP to come to terms with the
gays and lesbians in their own ideological family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the radical statement of the gay civil rights movement
is that you can be gay and be anything,'' said Carpenter. ``We are
everywhere in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Log Cabin Executive Director Rich Tafel said gay Republicans
should fight rather than switch parties _ to prevent the GOP from
becoming a Republican version of George Wallace Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Republican and you believe in individual rights,
less government and free markets, the Republican Party holds those
principles still,'' Tafel said. ``Gay Republicans are simply
saying, `We're staying and fighting for those principles.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpening the irony of the debate, the Log Cabin Republicans
have invited two conservative icons to address their convention:
University of California Regent Ward Connerly and Washington
political pundit Arianna Huffington. Connerly once said that the
vitriol he heard when announcing his support for gay domestic
partner benefits was worse than anything he heard in his battles to
end affirmative action. Huffington has rebuked her fellow
conservatives for their intolerance of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The group also invited Andrew Sullivan, a prominent gay Catholic
activist who advocates gay marriage as a conservative family value.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over gay rights is part of a larger _ and more
politically dangerous _ battle over the direction of the Republican
Party. Connerly and his allies in the party's libertarian wing
believe that the GOP should represent limited government, low taxes
and individual freedom _ including the freedom to live as a gay
person. On the other wing are the social or religious
conservatives, whose greatest concern is what they see as America's
moral decline, reflected by crime and the breakup of the
traditional family unit.
</P>
<P>
   For social conservatives, homosexuals embody all that is wrong
with America _ a deviant lifestyle that in their view subverts
religious and family values. Like abortion, the gay movement evokes
the kind of emotional force that can bring social conservatives
running to the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   And that is just what the GOP needs this November, when control
of the House of Representatives will hinge on which party can best
energize its core supporters. A net loss of just 11 seats would
return the House to the Democrats and deliver a devastating blow to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservative activists such as Gary Bauer, head of the
Family Research Council and a potential presidential contender, and
James Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show, have
made homosexuality a major campaign theme, running full-page
advertisements in major newspapers about how ``ex-gays'' renounced
their homosexual lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those things that the party is very uncomfortable
with,'' said an aide to a high-ranking House Republican. ``For some
segments of the party, the whole gay issue is taboo, and the Gary
Bauers of the world exert a lot of influence on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But some party leaders are taking steps to address the matter
head-on. For the first time, the chairman of the Republican
National Committee, Jim Nicholson, will meet with the Log Cabin
Republicans on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoy the support not just of straight Republicans and
straight Americans, but gay and bisexual Americans as well,'' said
party spokesman Mike Collins. ``We want their support. They want
lower taxes, they want a balanced budget, they want to take people
off welfare and give them jobs. We're doing that. And we welcome
their support.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Collins' comments reflect a considerable fear within the party
that anti-gay rhetoric will cast the GOP as intolerant or bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   A former official in President George Bush's administration who
is homosexual contends that some party conservatives see the gay
issue as a way to ``throw some red meat to the religious
conservatives, at minimal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that even former Christian Coalition head Ralph
Reed is urging Republicans to back away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tone of intolerance and exclusion plays very badly in
today's America, and only somebody with a political tin ear would
think that you improve your position by gay bashing or anyone-else
bashing. . . . Every time you have this sort of `we want to tell
you how to run your life' behavior, it makes it harder for
Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest to gain ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pinkerton, a former political strategist for Bush, said that
while religious conservatives may think promoting anti-gay views is
a good idea, the Republican Party as a whole does not.
</P>
<P>
   The party is having a difficult time accommodating both sides.
And the public itself is of two minds: Polls consistently show that
a large majority of the public condemns discrimination but at the
same time does not approve of homosexuality _ or bringing ``queer
values to suburbia,'' as Pinkerton put it.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton argues that Republicans do need the support of social
conservatives. ``But they should find better ways to do it,'' he
says, ``by promoting such issues as school choice that animate
religious conservatives, libertarians and minorities alike who are
dissatisfied with public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in the
House, said many of his colleagues ``sincerely wish this thing
would not come up and not be voted on, because of the obvious
conflicts it puts them in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Republicans see no conflict. Party spokesman Robert
Black defended the decision to exclude the Log Cabin Republicans
from the GOP convention, saying individuals are free to participate
in the state party, but not ``narrow special interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Christian Coalition was allowed a booth, Black
said, ``OK, let me redefine that. A special interest group that is
so fundamentally at odds with the core principles of the Republican
party. Republicans, at least here in Texas, by and large are
against homosexuality. That's not really news. It's in our
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tafel said that is why the Log Cabin Republicans will be in
Dallas this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view Texas as the frontlines of the gay movement,''
Tafel said. ``It's important for the gay community, in general,
that gay Republicans stay and fight because that's the frontlines,
that's where the battles are taking place.''

straight Americans, but gay and bisexual Americans as well,'' said
party spokesman Mike Collins. ``We want their support. They want
lower taxes, they want a balanced budget, they want to take people
off welfare and give them jobs. We're doing that. And we welcome
their support.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Collins' comments reflect a considerable fear within the party
that anti-gay rhetoric will cast the GOP as intolerant or bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   A former official in President George Bush's administration who
is homosexual contends that some party conservatives see the gay
issue as a way to ``throw some red meat to the religious
conservatives, at minimal risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that even former Christian Coalition head Ralph
Reed is urging Republicans to back away.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tone of intolerance and exclusion plays very badly in
today's America, and only somebody with a political tin ear would
think that you improve your position by gay bashing or anyone-else
bashing. . . . Every time you have this sort of `we want to tell
you how to run your life' behavior, it makes it harder for
Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest to gain ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pinkerton, a former political strategist for Bush, said that
while religious conservatives may think promoting anti-gay views is
a good idea, the Republican Party as a whole does not.
</P>
<P>
   The party is having a difficult time accommodating both sides.
And the public itself is of two minds: Polls consistently show that
a large majority of the public condemns discrimination but at the
same time does not approve of homosexuality _ or bringing ``queer
values to suburbia,'' as Pinkerton put it.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton argues that Republicans do need the support of social
conservatives. ``But they should find better ways to do it,'' he
says, ``by promoting such issues as school choice that animate
religious conservatives, libertarians and minorities alike who are
dissatisfied with public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Jim Kolbe, the only openly gay Republican in the
House, said many of his colleagues ``sincerely wish this thing
would not come up and not be voted on, because of the obvious
conflicts it puts them in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Texas Republicans see no conflict. Party spokesman Robert
Black defended the decision to exclude the Log Cabin Republicans
from the GOP convention, saying individuals are free to participate
in the state party, but not ``narrow special interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Christian Coalition was allowed a booth, Black
said, ``OK, let me redefine that. A special interest group that is
so fundamentally at odds with the core principles of the Republican
party. Republicans, at least here in Texas, by and large are
against homosexuality. That's not really news. It's in our
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tafel said that is why the Log Cabin Republicans will be in
Dallas this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view Texas as the frontlines of the gay movement,''
Tafel said. ``It's important for the gay community, in general,
that gay Republicans stay and fight because that's the frontlines,
that's where the battles are taking place.''

MUSLIM HOLY LEADERS DENOUNCE TERRORISM AT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN SCHWARTZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a meeting last weekend, Muslim religious leaders
from around the world condemned Islamic fundamentalism and
terrorist acts committed in the name of their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Although conference organizers had already planned a joint
declaration on the two issues, their stance was grimly underscored
by the news that the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania had been
bombed, possibly by fundamentalist extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extremists attack us at the same time as they attack the
United States,'' said President Aslan Maskhadov of the rebel nation
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost thousands of our people fighting for Islam against the
forces of Soviet imperialism, but (fundamentalist extremists) say
we are not good Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; In interviews and speeches at the Second International
Islamic Unity Conference in Washington, Maskhadov emphasized that
the Chechens, notwithstanding their intense Islamic faith, would
never accept the imposition of fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Chechens are striving for democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was called by the Islamic Supreme Council of
America, headed by Lebanese-born Sheik Hisham al-Kabbani.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbani also voiced a strong condemnation of the bombings in
Africa. ``Whoever is behind the terrorist act in Africa we
condemn,'' he said. ``Our religion has never called for
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements by the assembled leaders carry considerable
weight in the Muslim world for two reasons: Those attending
included some of Islam's most respected figures, and their stance
both reflects and amplifies the belief in nonviolence held by most
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Maskhadov, the Washington event attracted other
Muslim leaders from the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly dramatic statement came from Sheik Mahomed
Albogachiev, supreme mufti of the Ingushetia Republic, which
borders Chechnya. Albogachiev pointed out that 60 percent of his
nation's residents, who now number only 300,000, had died in
repression meted out by Josef Stalin. ``We were killed for our
faith. Yet they (fundamentalists) claim we are not real Muslims,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbani, the presiding figure at the conference, is a major
leader in Sufism, a mystical movement in Islam that fundamentalists
condemn.
</P>
<P>
   The Sufi orders, which developed chanting and other forms of
``dhikr'' or remembrance of God through meditation and repetitive
prayer, are extremely influential in the northern and eastern
regions of the Muslim world, from Turkey through Pakistan to
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sufi orders follow the Sunni branch of Islam, and
Sufis are credited with bringing Islam to India. They have millions
of members. But they are continuously attacked by fundamentalists
who claim that following Sufi leaders and venerating Islamic
teachers from the past as holy figures are corruptions of Islam
borrowed from the Christian tradition of sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Washington gathering was called by Kabbani, it
concentrated on the broadest issues in Islamic life, with an
emphasis on the repudiation of fundamentalism and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The conference heard repeated calls for Muslims to adapt to
democracy and modernity without abandoning their faith and
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering paralleled a similar event hosted by the Muslim
women's organization Kamilat, with presentations boosting women's
political participation, women's rights in an Islamic context, and
the struggle against domestic violence in Muslim households.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants included Sheik Mohammed Nazim al-Haqqani, the
grand mufti of Turkish Cyprus and head of the Naqshbandi Sufi
order.
</P>
<P>
   Nazim has made the repudiation of terrorism a major feature of
his Islamic teachings, in Cyprus and elsewhere, declaring: ``Those
who plant bombs and kill the innocent are not Muslims. A Muslim
defends the faith by fighting face to face, not by cowardly
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov expressed his gratitude for the support of the
Naqshbandis, to which the majority of Chechens are affiliated,
during the recent war with the Russians. ``I do not hesitate to say
that although we lacked heavy weapons in our struggle with the
Soviet empire, we had great support from Allah, strengthened by our
Sufi commitment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation of Muslims with a long history of integration into
Russia was described by a delegation of religious leaders from
Tatarstan, a region surrounding the Russian city of Kazan, with a
population of 4 million, about 60 percent of them Muslim Tatars.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Galiulla Gabdulla, mufti of Tatarstan, said his people had
lived in peace with their Russian neighbors for more than 400
years. But he said that because of anti-Muslim racism among
Russians, Tatars have been treated as an underclass.
</P>
<P>
   In comments similar to those of African American Muslims,
Gabdulla stressed the importance of prison ministry work. Many
young Tatars have ended up in prison, he said, because of limited
professional opportunities and other forms o

   1. SUDAN CRISIS Special two-part report on the Sudan famine. By
Hilary Mackenzie. From The New York Times on the Web. Photos
available.
</P>
<P>
   A. Enmeshed in Conflict and Drought, Southern Sudan Starves Ten
years after a famine claimed 250,000 lives, the Sudan faces a new
catastrophe. In a country divided by 15 years of civil war and
devastated by two years of drought, aid officials say 2.6 million
people face starvation. B. At Epicenter of Famine in Sudan, A
Wrenching Struggle to Provide Aid At World Vision's Thiet feeding
centre, it is nurse Karen Easterday's task to determine who will
receive food and who will be turned away. Easterday, who has worked
as a volunteer at relief centres for several years, weaves her way
through the crowd to pick out the worst cases ... 2. ALOE : THE
ALL-STAR OF MEDICINAL PLANTS Over the centuries, some plants have
achieved well-earned reputations for treating human maladies. Few
plants may be used both internally and externally but the aloe -
the multi-talented member of the lily family that is native to
Africa and the Mediterranean area - has a proven track record. By
Charles Dickson. 750 words. 3. STUDY FINDS NO BENEFIT WITH
HIGH-DOSE BREAST CANCER THERAPY Many medical centres and doctors
are treating women with high-risk breast cancer with a
controversial regimen of extremely high-dose chemotherapy. Some
researchers say this approach has not been adequately tested and
may be doing more harm than good. Dutch researchers report the
results of a trial that compared conventional chemotherapy with the
new high-dose regimen. The high-dose treatment, they conclude, is
no better than conventional chemotherapy and should not be
routinely used. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000
words. 4. WHY INDIA IS NOW A NUCLEAR POWER While the end of the
Cold War transformed the political landscape of Europe, it did
little to ameliorate India's security concerns. The rise of China
and continued strains with Pakistan made the 1980s and 1990s a
greatly troubling period for India. If nuclear deterrence works in
the West, why won't it work in India? By Jaswant Singh. Foreign
Affairs magazine. 2,000 words. (The author is senior adviser on
defence and foreign affairs to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee and a member of Parliament for the Bharatiya Janata
Party.) 5. GIFTED CHILDREN : LITTLE GENIUSES, BIG PROBLEMS They
learn Chinese or Japanese at age 4, display passionate interest in
politics or philosophy, and do complex maths. Yet gifted children
also often suffer from their intelligence. Schools may fail to
challenge them, and the result can be boredom, apathy and
alienation. That can lead to rage-filled outbursts and bouts of
depression. Nor do parents have an easy time of it. Having a gifted
child can be an expensive and frustrating experience. From Der
Spiegel. 1,000 words. English translation available. 6.
BACK-TO-SCHOOL BARGAINS With many children due to return to school
in the next few weeks, here are some creative tips to help parents
save money on clothing, lunches and other school-related purchases.
By Leah Ingram. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
MUSTANG SALLY Sally Hershberger is ``the closest thing to a female
superstar the hair world has ever had.'' She has created the
hairstyles of Hollywood stars such as Meg Ryan and Tom Cruise and
has worked on numerous magazine cover shoots. Ready for a new
challenge, she is embarking on her own product line. Interview by
Dana Wood. From Women's Wear Daily. 800 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
AH-SO SICK IN GAY PARIS ``My raw throat felt like a tractor had
rolled through it on caterpillar treads. My vision was blurred; I
was alternately sweating and freezing. Was I really going to be
sick all day? ....'' By Carolee B. Morrison. A personal account of
feeling ill during a trip abroad. 1,300 words. 9. THE TOUR DE
FRANCE'S SHATTERED LEGEND The 1998 Tour de France cycle race was
undermined by a doping scandal and came perilously close to
imploding. There is certainly no way it will be able to go ahead in
1999 as though nothing had happened, writes Jean-Marie Colombani.
From Le Monde. (English translation available.) 600 words.

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ In recent years, government bashing
has become so fashionable that many people now believe industry can
do everything better than government. Unfortunately, about half of
all states, including Georgia, have embraced the idea that prisons
can be safely run by private companies. (Geewax, Atlanta

   LATHAM-COLUMN _ I remember writing these words sometime in
October of 1992: ``Do we really want to elect as president a man
who has essentially admitted being unfaithful to his wife?'' The
answer, as we must all remember, was a resounding ``Yes!'' (Latham,

announces that the Hyatt is hosting the annual Mary Kay Inc.

 &HT;    The air was heavy with perfume
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The first indication that this wasn't going to be a
typical hotel stay was at the front desk of the Hyatt Regency at
Reunion Square, a hotel hard by downtown and within walking
distance of the Texas School Book Depository. The clerk, who is
from Cork County, Ireland, according to her name tag, hands me a
letter welcoming me to the hotel. The letter announces that the
Hyatt is hosting the annual Mary Kay Inc. conference, and that more
than 1,000 are attending over the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the letter says, at certain times elevators will be
extremely crowded, phone lines will be busy, and checking in or out
could be a problem. The clerk then directs me toward the elevators,
which are being
</P>
<P>
   guarded by two security men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell them I said it was OK to use the elevators,'' she says
with a lovely accent belied by a rather dubious set of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   I finish reading the letter as I shoulder my way through a crowd
of women wearing prom-like dresses and plenty of makeup. Someone
made a killing on glitter, sequins and velvet for this convocation.
</P>
<P>
   The letter suggests that I might consider taking the stairs
during busy times. Since I've been assigned to a room on the 22nd
floor, the place is going to have to be on fire before I lumber up
and down nearly two dozen stories.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the security men let me pass. I get on an elevator
relatively quickly, and am joined by a set of Mary Kay women
apparently intent on breaking the Guinness record for most folks
crammed into a single elevator.
</P>
<P>
   We stop at nearly ever floor. I am concerned that a spark of
static electricity will somehow ignite the overwhelming cloud of
hair spray and perfume in the elevator. We will go up in flames
quicker than a hay meadow during this drought if that should occur.
</P>
<P>
   I get off without incident, though my sinuses protest the
assault of a dozen different types of perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I venture back to the lobby, again riding with a crowd of
Mary Kay women, all wearing name tags and most decked out in what
look like prom dresses _ except for the most part the women are
more than a few years and pounds past attending a prom. So am I, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   I meet with my co-workers in the lobby, one of whom hands me a
pink business card a Mary Kay consultant from Kingsport, Tenn., has
given her.
</P>
<P>
   She's a bit miffed the woman took one look at her and determined
she needed Mary Kay's services. You have to admire their
aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby, groups of women are taking turns getting their
photo taken in front of a large glass ball whose purpose I can't
determine. Decoration, I guess. One woman walks by wearing a
diamond tiara, as if she had just won the Mary Kay Inc. beauty
contest, though I don't know if there is one. A few husbands lurk
about, most looking as if they would rather be somewhere else,
though I don't know that for sure either.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay women, judging from this gathering, come in all shapes,
sizes, races and ages. I look up the company's Web page later and
find out there are more than a half-million Mary Kay Beauty
Consultants in 27 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Its international headquarters is in Dallas, in a 13-story
building that contains about 600,000 square feet. That's about like
five Wal-Mart Supercenters for point of reference. Retail sales are
more than $2 billion,
</P>
<P>
   and the company owns the best-selling brand of facial care
products and cosmetics in the United States, with 10 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kay Inc. has been listed for years as one of the ``100 Best
Companies to Work For in America'' by Fortune magazine. In the past
few years, the company has given away hundreds of thousands of
dollars for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Pink Cadillacs are everywhere on this landmark summer day _ the
first time the thermometer has dipped below 100 degrees in about a
month _ lining the circle drive, in the pay-lot where I'm parked,
and out on the street. Mary Kay has the largest commercial fleet of
GM passenger cars in the world, with 10,000 cars valued at more
than $150 million. The company has added a pink Grand Prix, a red
Grand Am and lately a white GMC Jimmy sports utility vehicle to its
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Parked by my car out in the lot is a Honda whose owner has
posted a sign on the back windshield. It reads, ``This time next
year I'll be driving a Mary Kay red Grand Am.''
</P>
<P>
   Good for her. I hope she makes it.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Is it Lt. Blassie's Medal of Honor?
 &HT;    (For release Aug. 16, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no greater sacrifice a person can make for his country
than giving his or her life for it. And that's what Air Force 1st
Lt. Michael J. Blassie did over Vietnam in 1972. But, was what he
did worthy of the Medal of Honor, the highest award this country
can bestow on a military hero?
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's remains recently were removed from the Tomb of the
Unknowns at Arlington National Cemetery, where they had rested
since 1984. Finally identified through DNA testing, he was reburied
near his family home in Missouri with full military honors.
</P>
<P>
   For the Blassie family, the moving ceremony would have appeared
to be closure to the ordeal they had endured for 26 years, now
knowing that Michael indeed had died and the whereabouts of his
remains. But it hasn't ended there.
</P>
<P>
   The family wants the Medal of Honor to come out to Missouri with
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   And that has caused complications, which it should.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four Unknowns at Arlington were presented with
Medals of Honor _ not for what each of them did in battle, but as a
representation of all who had fallen in battle and not been
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Morally, if not technically, the awarding of the Medal of Honor
to the Unknowns was a generous mistake. According to Ronald D. Dake
of Mt. Pleasant, S.C., executive director of the Congressional
Medal of Honor Society, the route to the Medal of Honor begins with
a recommendation, by name, of a potential recipient followed by the
testimony of two unimpeachable witnesses to a heroic action. None
of that happened with Lt. Blassie, or any of the other three
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   For what is trying to be stated at the Tomb of the Unknowns, it
can be understood that those requisites could be waived. But if the
medal is awarded to a representative Unknown, can it remain with
that person once he becomes known?
</P>
<P>
   Blassie's sister, Patricia Blassie, is pushing the campaign for
the medal, just as she did to compel the government to exhume the
body in the tomb for DNA testing on her strong belief that it was
her brother.
</P>
<P>
   She agrees that giving the medal to an Unknown is symbolic but
insists that her brother was that symbol for 14 years and,
therefore, has earned it. Some veterans groups oppose this, and
Secretary of Defense William Cohen is in a quandary and has called
for a study of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Understand that Lt. Blassie already has been awarded the Silver
Star for his gallantry in action, and that has gone home to the
family.
</P>
<P>
   The unease by the veterans groups is not specifically about Lt.
Blassie but about the approximately 3,500 Medals of Honor awarded
since the Civil War. When one considers the heroics above and
beyond the call of duty of these recipients, it can be seen as
depreciating the award to have Lt. Blassie retain it.
</P>
<P>
   The remains later identified as those of Lt. Blassie were
chosen, at random, to be the Vietnam Unknown by a Marine Corps
Medal of Honor winner, a sergeant. The Korean War Unknown was
chosen in 1958 by an Army sergeant from among four unidentified
Americans; the World War II Unknown was chosen the same year by a
Navy hospital corpsman from two remains, and the World War I
Unknown was selected in 1921 by an Army sergeant from among four
Americans still buried in France.
</P>
<P>
   It is only by chance as to whose remains are chosen for the Tomb
of the Unknowns. And with DNA testing, it probably will be
difficult, but not impossible, to find another Vietnam War unknown
to replace Lt. Blassie in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   But, the effort should be made. To have the Vietnam War tomb
empty would further add to the bitterness of that war's veterans.
And the Medal of Honor, perhaps too casually awarded to the
Unknowns in the first place, should stay above that tomb as part of
its symbolism.

 &HT;    Americans ought to impeach themselves, not Bill Clinton
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I remember writing these words sometime in October of 1992:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really want to elect as president a man who has
essentially admitted being unfaithful to his wife?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as we must all remember, was a resounding ``Yes!''
In fact, Bill Clinton's acknowledged dalliances (we all knew what
he was saying on ``60 Minutes'') did not seem to hurt him with any
demographic group or in any state in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal in politics has always been getting elected, not
governing. Why is anyone surprised when we hear of yet another
marital transgression, particularly when it has been demonstrated
that the voters just don't care?
</P>
<P>
   If you don't say ``no,'' or slap your child's hand when he keeps
putting it in the cookie jar, you've given him tacit approval to
get all the cookies he wants. You can't watch him do it for six
years, then pretend to get upset. It just won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You can book it that Clinton and Paula Jones had an encounter _
likely consensual _ and ditto for a long affair with Gennifer
Flowers. There are a half-dozen others along the way _ at least. We
don't know how many of them are forever holding their peace.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would it surprise me to find out, in some later revelation,
that Clinton isn't getting his cookies from someone other than the
first lady even as all this is going on.
</P>
<P>
   To prove that I am not smarter than anyone else, while I did
write those words before the 1992 elections, I also came back to
write a ringing endorsement of Clinton a few weeks later. This is
back when I believed that Clinton really wanted to govern. In 1996,
I wrote another endorsement, but this time it was less than
enthusiastic. It was based more on Bob Dole's weaknesses than
Clinton's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that almost all of us knowingly overlooked
Clinton's affairs. Perhaps a few people voted against him simply
because he had had an extra-marital affair, but it was not the
deciding factor for most.
</P>
<P>
   So now the nation is squirming with the titillating details of a
Clinton affair in your newspapers and on television daily. (I hope
the dress doesn't end up at the Smithsonian someday, alongside the
inaugural gowns worn by first ladies.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are acting surprised. Some from the Republican Party
are even talking about impeachment because Clinton did not admit to
the affair in a deposition in a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm, a married man not admitting to an affair, now there is
something amazing. If Clinton gets ousted for that, dozens of
senators and congressmen from both parties are in deep, deep
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has done with the precocious Monica Lewinsky _ and
I have no doubts he did darn near everything _ is not right, but
the American public by popular vote has told him that it is fine
with us.
</P>
<P>
   Want to impeach somebody? Impeach yourself. Impeach your
neighbors. Impeach the Electoral College. Impeach every person who
voted for Bill Clinton. We got exactly the person we voted for.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: An exemplary family
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This thing could go badly awry yet, I suppose, but for now it
appears the families of those two little girls switched at birth in
Virginia are going to work the matter out sensibly and in mutual
caring. While they do, the rest of us, following the story at a
distance, might usefully pause for a moment and think about what we
mean by family.
</P>
<P>
   For, first, here are two 3-year-olds reared in apparent love by
biological strangers, and the life of one was already further
complicated by the recent deaths of her parents in an automobile
accident; she had come into the care of two sets of grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate reaction to the discovery of the maternity-ward
mix-up was confusion, some understandable anger and agony over what
to do.
</P>
<P>
   We could all expect, from too many examples, that this story
would soon head down a twisting legal road, amid a din of
gavel-blows and recriminations, ending more than likely with horrid
TV news pictures of one child or both being forced in tears from
homes they always had understood were their own.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not this time. Both families have agreed that the
children's feelings come first, and a child's feeling for the
familiar is absolute. Yet realizing that both have an interest now
in the other child as well, the families are working on mutual
visitation and the creation of a de facto extended family that both
acknowledges and transcends biology.
</P>
<P>
   (The prospects are improved, he says in a surly aside, by the
fact that the families are keeping their lawyers discreetly aside
and are meeting together instead.)
</P>
<P>
   We are at the leading edge of another political season in which
great clouds of demagoguery will be huffed on the topic of ``family
values,'' with implied and often explicit contempt for persons who
have not arranged themselves suitably for a 1950s sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study confirmed the obvious, that the number of
unmarried couples continues to rise. Every such twitch in the
statistics sets off the alarmists, and since as a nation we have
fallen to constantly taking our social temperature, we are
generally convinced that we must be terminal. We have, as a people,
pioneered social hypochondria.
</P>
<P>
   What really seems to be happening is that we are developing new
living formats for different parts of our lives. Traditional
marriage continues to be the overwhelming choice for the
child-rearing part, and if the pregnancy often proceeds the vows,
well, we are not the first people to find that pregnancy can be as
much a cause of marriage as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, we adhere, disband, mingle and hive off as suits
our other interests and needs in their time. It is not clear that
any of that is quite as awful in its consequences as our busybodies
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie and Harriet'' and ``Father Knows Best'' could have made
no sense whatsoever out of the lovely muddle of a family that that
young single mother, with her former boyfriend back in the mix, and
four grandparents are cobbling together in Virginia. But it looks
as though two little girls are going to be well cared for by it and
well loved in it.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is worth remembering that ``values'' is the noun.
``Family'' is only the adjective.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Keep Georgia's prisons out of private hands
 &HT;    (Eds: This ran as an unsigned editorial in Thursday's Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.)
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In recent years, government bashing has become so
fashionable that many people now believe industry can do everything
better than government.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the private sector can outperform the government in
many areas. But not in all. Some burdens are too weighty to be
picked up by companies that have to pay more attention to the
bottom line than to the public good.
</P>
<P>
   For example, most Americans would not dream of allowing private
companies to decide whether to launch a war, although the Pentagon
is notorious for buying $600 hammers. We don't ``outsource'' our
Army by hiring low-wage generals from other countries. The decision
to wage war is so grave, it must be made only by officials who
derive their power directly from our democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
   The war on crime is a serious matter as well. Incarcerating
human beings to protect the citizenry is a burden that should be
borne only by government, not by profit seekers. Unfortunately,
about half of all states, including Georgia, have embraced the idea
that prisons can be safely run by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Georgia's first private prison, owned by Cornell
Corrections Inc., opened in Charlton County. Another company,
Corrections Corporation of America, will open two more prisons, one
in Coffee County and another in Wheeler County, in December.
</P>
<P>
   But even as these prisons are getting started in Georgia,
taxpayers in other parts of the country are finding out just how
dangerous and expensive privatization can be:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week in New Mexico, inmates beat five guards in a
Corrections Corporation of America prison. A 15-member state
tactical team had to go in to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month in Youngstown, Ohio, six inmates _ including four
convicted murderers _ broke out of a prison run by CCA. In its
first 17 months of operation, the Ohio prison has had 13 stabbings,
including two homicides.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1996, two convicted sex offenders escaped a CCA prison in
Houston. While Texas officials were told the prison was going to
hold undocumented immigrants, it turned out that CCA had shipped in
more than 200 sex offenders from Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of such outrages, CCA's stock has been taking a beating,
falling from about $44 a share last fall to $16.87 Wednesday.
Though weakened, the company, founded 15 years ago in Nashville,
soon will be in charge of about 3,200 prisoners in southeast
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But CCA is not an extreme example among prison companies; other
prison owners have similar records. For example, in April, state
officials in Colorado closed a juvenile prison run by Rebound Corp.
after the investigation of a 13-year-old inmate's suicide led to
evidence of multiple instances of physical and sexual abuse. In
Louisiana last month, state officials took control of the Tallulah
Correctional Center for Youth, owned by Trans-American Development
Associates, to stop the extreme neglect and brutality documented
there.
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, evidence is growing that many private
prisons are poorly run. Since the prison break in Ohio, Republican
Gov. George Voinovich has explored ways to shut down CCA, but he
has been told by the state attorney general that Youngstown is
stuck with the privately owned safety hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, government officials can also do a lousy job of
running prisons; we have plenty of evidence of that in Georgia,
where credible evidence has suggested that Georgia Department of
Corrections head Wayne Garner led a brutal and unprovoked assault
on prison inmates. But at least when a penal institution is run by
the government, elected officials have to answer to voters. But how
does the public hold private prison owners responsible for their
actions?
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, nobody really knows. Many legal experts seriously
question whether a private corporation has the constitutional right
to hold people against their will. And no one is certain what would
happen if a prison company declared bankruptcy and announced it
could not pay its workers. Would the guards walk off the job and
leave the prison doors open?
</P>
<P>
   For private prison operators, public safety is not the No. 1
mission. Making money for stockholders is. That means private
prisons are inherently more dangerous; they have financial
incentives to house more dangerous prisoners and cut guard costs.
Ohioans realize that now. Here's what happened in Youngstown:
</P>
<P>
   CCA built a medium-security prison to hold convicts transferred
from the overcrowded jails of Washington. The prisoners were
supposed to be serving sentences of less than 10 years. In other
words, Youngstown was supposed to get bad guys who weren't
hideously bad.
</P>
<P>
   But violence has repeatedly rocked the prison. In March,
Youngstown joined a suit by inmates against CCA. In court, CCA's
chief of security, Robert Adams, testified that his prison never
rejected a single inmate from Washington, which is how convicted
murderers ended up in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   And why would CCA take in killers? Because Washington paid good
money to get those convicts out of its sight. Murderers are profit
sources for CCA.
</P>
<P>
   CCA also has a profit motive to cut expenses for things such as
books and tutors. It's not in the stockholders' best interests to
spend a lot of money on prisoner rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   When convicted criminals are released into society, they can
either become productive taxpayers or continue to be dangers to
society. Private prisons have no real incentive to turn convicts
into workers. In fact, their stock gains when society sees an
increase in criminal behavior, not when the supply of prisoners
dwindles.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, for all of their cost cutting, private prisons don't
even save taxpayers' money, according to a study by the General
Accounting Office, a federal watchdog agency. After examining the
books of private prisons in five states, the GAO found no clear
evidence that taxpayers get any significant benefits from
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, political leaders are starting to wake up to these
problems. Last week, the Republican-led House approved an amendment
that would require a federal study of privately run prisons. The
measure still requires Senate approval. This week, Attorney General
Janet Reno ordered an in-depth, independent review of CCA's
security and management procedures at its Ohio prison.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, private prisons are just getting established. Every
legal option should be explored now to stop this mistake before it
goes any further.

<P>
   ``whitechocolatespaceegg''
</P>
<P>
   Matador/Capitol
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me all the magic's gone,'' Chicago's hip
singer-songwriter Liz Phair warbles on the title track to her third
full-length album, which hit stores this week. Two songs later, on
``Perfect World,'' she sings, ``I know I was born to lead a double
life/And when I find it, I know I'll make sense of me'' in her
trademark flat, nasal tone.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Love Is Nothing,'' which takes the album's theme of
relationship ruts to an extreme, Phair wonders, ``Would I lie to
make the day blur into night?'' On ``Go on Ahead,'' she explores
both sides of cohabitation, of lovers walking like ghosts in their
own homes, but then feeling close when they're sleeping together.
``It's a death in our love that has brought us here/It's a birth
that has changed our lives,'' she sings in this song about being
``in way over our heads with this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``whitechocolatespaceegg's'' lead single, ``Polyester
</P>
<P>
   Bride,'' weighs the choice between domesticity and adventure in
favor of the latter. With maturity and responsibility comes fear:
Doubt permeates this album, whose title seems to refer to Phair's
new delightful, disposable family of three. The shell protects, but
it is, after all, only a shell.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite ``lo-fi'' sexual politician, who switched the
dynamics of boy-meets-girl so brilliantly on 1993's ``Exile in
Guyville,'' hasn't entirely devoted herself to the sinking feeling
that bliss is a myth. ``Whitechocolatespaceegg's'' two best songs _
``Johnny Feelgood'' and ``What Makes You Happy'' _ find a reckless
Phair, still falling for the wrong guy for all the right reasons.
The album ends with Phair going back even further, with a
mysteriously irresistible slumber party sing-song, ``Girls Room,''
as if calling for a lost innocence that she realizes wasn't really
that innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Phair's straightforwardly nonlinear lyrics and defiantly off-key
voice have always suggested that life is a sequence of hazy events,
just as her deadpan presentation mirrors the numbing effect of
experiences piled high. On her new record, however, the spirit of
true optimism can be found in the spare, yet creative backing, that
strives to show that fulfillment can be found in simple, tugging
songs, if only for three minutes at a time. Even the album's
weakest tracks _ the roots sendup ``Baby Got Going,'' the
self-explanatory ``S---loads of Money'' and the modern rock
sleepwalk ``Big Tall Man'' _ offer something of merit, if only a
sturdy melody.
</P>
<P>
   On her first full album since 1994's disappointing
``Whip-Smart,'' Phair displays a depth to her writing that makes
her vocals all the more engaging. No longer able to shock with her
bluntness, she opts to enlighten with an unflinching
self-examination that'll have you humming along.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Phair has never made a more enjoyable album, even as she
contemplates the crossroads, after choosing her direction, and
wondering ``Who am I? Who's this guy?'' When she sings that ``Love
Is Nothing,'' she's really telling you that it's the only thing. _

   The Lemonheads
</P>
<P>
   `The Best of the Lemonheads: The Atlantic Years'
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic
</P>
<P>
   The Sugarcubes
</P>
<P>
   `A Collection'
</P>
<P>
   Elektra
</P>
<P>
   If loud guitars and angst-ridden singers are all we remember
about the so-called alternative-rock revolution of the late '80s
and early '90s, then the Lemonheads and the Sugarcubes were gypped.
As proved by new best-of collections from each of these
self-admitted candy-poppers (the sweetness is even in the names),
they were everything they set out to be, and sometimes more.
</P>
<P>
   For Iceland's Sugarcubes, their ``more'' was innovation. Best
known as the band that spawned current electronic-music queen Bjrk,
the Cubes hit the U.S. scene in 1988 with the quirky, rhythmic
single ``Birthday'' and later offered such energetic MTV hits as
``Regina'' and ``Hit,'' all of which are included on ``A
Collection.'' While the group only had the goods for one memorable
album _ ``Life's Too Good,'' from which five songs appear here _
they enjoyed scattered moments of brilliance, on songs such as
``Planet'' and ``Walkabout,'' that make this best-of a worthy
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Lemonheads' surplus quality was how good of a rock band they
turned out to be, at least during their 1992-93 incarnation. Songs
like ``Confetti'' and ``The Great Big No'' feature that rare, tight
pop-trio energy (Fastball, anyone?).
</P>
<P>
   Without that, the Boston-based band was nothing more than a
vehicle for the soft-hearted, coy musings of Evan Dando, which was
plenty for some fans _ young women, in particular. As audaciously
melodic tracks such as ``Into Your Arms,'' ``It's a Shame About
Ray'' and the acoustic ``Ride With Me'' show, Dando was then a
first-rate pop singer whose warm voice matched his nice-guy
approach. Really, what other straight (OK, semi-straight) guy could
have pulled off the delightful ``Big Gay Heart,'' perhaps the best
of this best-of?
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will of these giddy popsters and their
career-milking greatest-hits CDs, just don't interrupt their fans'
lasting enjoyment of humming along. _ Chris Riemenschneider

   Snoop Dogg
</P>
<P>
   `Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told'
</P>
<P>
   No Limit Records
</P>
<P>
   Long before this album hit the stores, it was a big record.
Master P's signing of Snoop Doggy Dogg, probably the most popular
artist in gangster rap, elevated P's independent and successful No
Limit Records label to a higher level. And Dogg's departure from
the notorious Death Row Records was the final nail in the coffin of
what was one of the most successful purveyors of violent, graphic
and drug-laced rap.
</P>
<P>
   But a big record isn't always a great record, as evidenced by
``Da Game Is to Be Sold, Not to Be Told.''
</P>
<P>
   Dogg's teaming with No Limit's in-house production team, Beats
by the Pound, is too often the lulling and unmemorable experience
you'd expect when you match Dogg's languid delivery with equally
lazy rhythms. Not that Dogg rapped any differently on Death Row.
But when Dr. Dre was on the production boards, his keyboard-based
``G-Funk'' always had the kind of power that insisted you listen to
the low-key rapper. And that, coupled with hooks such as those on
``Gin and Juice,'' made even menacing lyrics easy to sing along to.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ``Gin and Juice II'' is an orchestrated yawner complete
with timpani rolls. Dogg's labelmate Mystikal proves more imposing
on ``Tru Tank Dogs,'' and his other new labelmate, Mia X, is as
compelling on the cautionary tale ``Slow Down.'' Dogg finds his
stride only when he's reminiscing, as on the muscular ``Woof!''
That's also true for the well-written reworking of Boogie Down
Productions' ``Love's Gonna Get'cha,'' titled ``Doggz Gonna Get
Ya,'' and on ``DP Gangsta,'' a take on NWA's ``Gangsta, Gangsta.''
</P>
<P>
   NWA, remember, included Dr. Dre. Are you starting to notice the
connection _ or, better yet, what's missing?

   The Tony Rich Project

   `Birdseye'
</P>
<P>
   LaFace
</P>
<P>
   When Tony Rich made his bow in 1996, many wrongly welcomed him
into the then newly titled ``retro soul'' category, a place where
other young and pioneering artists such as D'Angelo and Maxwell
dwelled.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing was that ``soul,'' or black, radio slammed the
door on Rich and his acoustic guitar-based ``Nobody Knows.'' It
didn't have enough beat, enough ``bottom,'' programmers said, to be
played alongside Marvin Gaye-inspired Maxwell and the Hammond
organs and old Stevie Wonder sway of D'Angelo.
</P>
<P>
   It also wasn't this record. ``Birdseye'' is a beautiful
testament to Rich's musical and lyrical growth.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling the worn road of depicting the progression of a
relationship, it starts with the moment he walks into the Atlanta
Live club and sees a woman with Halle Berry's eyes (``Birdseye'').
In ``Silly Man,'' they're ``making love like instruments.'' Then,
after professing how happy he is (``If You're an Angel''), he
questions it on ``Bed of My Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Rich successfully navigates his way through funk
(the title track), early Prince (``Cool Like That'') and soul
(``Blue Butterfly''), stalling only on a few retreads from his
quirky debut (``Ain't No Laughin' ''). _ Sonia Murray

   Musically, this Nashville singer-songwriter's second effort
strays little from the meticulous country-folk and bluegrass sounds
of her Grammy-nominated 1996 debut, ``Revival.'' Indeed, her
adherence to tradition may be a bit too strict _ some songs have a
hermetically sealed, museum-piece feel. It's in the lyrics that
Welch gets adventurous, delving into the dark side of human nature.
``Caleb Meyer'' deals with the attempted rape of a mountain woman,
while the heartbreaking ``One Morning'' observes a Kentucky mother
as she watches her long-gone son ride up on horseback. As he draws
near, she discovers that he's dead from gunshot wounds.

   Lena Horne has lost a few notes through the years, but it
doesn't matter on ``Being Myself,'' a disc on which she's clearly
having fun. And yet emotions run deep in this mixture of pop
standards and blues tunes. Horne is sassy on ``As Long as I Live,''
melancholy on ``Autumn in New York'' and reflective on
``Imagination.'' And don't miss her ``Sleepin' Bee,'' which begins
with a hum and builds to an all-out buzz. Horne, now 81, has
decades of tales to tell from her years as a recording artist and
stage and screen actress. They're all here, a burbling subtext that
gives each phrase, each lyric waves of meaning. Our only regret? We
get just 38 minutes of that old Horne magic.

   It's hard to believe, looking at this homely little instrument,

with Arthur Godfrey, who eventually sold 9 million of his plastic
ukes. This disc has plenty to argue its case, from virtuoso jazz to
humble folk to aromatic old chestnuts such as ``Do I Love You? Yes
I Do!'' Skip the obligatory Tiny Tim track and go right to the
ineffable Ohta San and ``Little Grass Shack.'' The production and
selection are impeccable, and the way overresearched liner notes
are from Jim Beloff, author of ``The Ukulele: A Visual History''
and contributor of the noirishly cute ``For the Love of Uke.''

   They're back. The West Coast crew that gave us ``My Sharona''
returns with a new set of slick, formulaic Cheap Trick imitations.
And somehow they manage the impossible: ``Zoom'' makes ``Sharona''
sound like a rock masterpiece. Just a click short of self-parody,
the Knack's keg-party mix of scattershot-fuzz guitar, sing-song
melodies and brick-handed drumming are as cliche-laden as ever.
Even the lyrics on ``Zoom'' are stone-dumb. Sample: ``Can I borrow
a kiss? I'll pay it back with interest.'' Sheesh. It's almost
enough to make you wonder what Toni ``Mickey (You're So Fine)''
Basil's up to these days. Almost.

   This L.A. power rock trio is getting a lot of mileage from its
omnipresent MTV video for ``Inside Out,'' but, unlike a lot of the
bands on the video channel, Eve 6 has legs. The group of
18-year-olds, fronted by vocalist-bassist-lyricist Max Collins,
could be labeled Hanson with distortion guitar pedals. Collins and
crew show amazing musical maturity and tightness that demonstrate
they've been studying. The memorable melodies coupled with witty,
insightful, angst-riddled lyrics prove once again that there's
nothing like the experience of being a high school outcast to
produce great rock 'n' roll.

 &HT;    Movie review: Bassett, Jamaica heat up well-made love story
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, what a difference a groove makes.
</P>
<P>
   With her semi-autobiographical, older woman-younger man love
story, ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' novelist Terry McMillan
delivers an audience-friendly romance that's as much a fairy tale
as the Cinderella saga ``Ever After.'' What a change from her sour,
male-bashing ``Waiting to Exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   A buffed Angela Bassett is back from that 1995 release to play
40-year-old Stella Payne, a driven, high-powered San Francisco
stock broker and single super-mom who has fallen into a robotic,
joyless rut. Prompted by a television ad, and scolded that life is
too short by her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg), Stella
flies off to Jamaica, mon, hoping to trade in that rut for a
groove.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the idyllic surroundings of an upscale resort, she gains
the attention of handsome, charming hunk Winston Shakespeare (Taye
Diggs), a Jamaican half her age. Though wary and riddled with
guilt, she takes him into her bed and, gradually, into her life.
</P>
<P>
   They have vast cultural and economic differences, but the issue
that preys on Stella is the age disparity. Of course, if she only
took the time to see more Hollywood movies, she'd realize that with
the roles reversed, such a generation gap is almost the norm. Get
over it, Stella, and you go for it, girl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has to be some conflict to pad the movie out to
feature length, so Stella's self-doubts are reinforced by her
snippy sisters and by Winston's haughty mother, only one year older
than Stella.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan and co-screenwriter Ron Bass, the ``Waiting to Exhale''
adaptation team, flesh out the story by enlarging the role of
Delilah and tailoring it to Goldberg's wise-cracking earth-mother
persona. Just as Stella's love life improves, Delilah's health
takes a downturn, a guaranteed tear-jerker. The script gives Stella
and Winston momentary flare-ups of disagreement, but for the most
part their differences get swept away. Few Hollywood movies ever
went broke assuring audiences that love conquers all.
</P>
<P>
   First-time director Kevin Rodney Sullivan wraps the fairy tale
in a visual high gloss. It may already be too late, but consider
buying stock in Jamaica, which is bound to get a boost in tourism
after this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Bassett's stock will also soar. She looks terrific, and handily
carries the movie, with a few great flashes of temper and even more
looks of ecstasy. Diggs makes his feature debut and shows every
sign of staying power.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Stella'' receives the same attention that ``Waiting to
Exhale'' got, its sociological significance will be hotly debated.
But it's just an old-fashioned Hollywood love story with a cultural
face lift. It's well-made and satisfying, but hardly profound.

 &HT;    Experts pack healthy school lunches
 &HT;    By Michele Chan Santos
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The big question when it comes to packing lunch
for your kids is: How do you know they're eating it? They may
cheerfully tote their lunch to school every day, but you may not
know if they're actually eating what you give them, trading your
carefully chosen foods for what other kids brought or throwing them
away.
</P>
<P>
   Our health experts, all parents, recommend packing only items
you know they will eat. If you want to introduce a new, healthy
food item, do it on a weekend or at dinner first. Once you know
they like it, or at least will tolerate it, you can put it in their
lunches, says Marsha Beckermann, sports nutritionist for the
University of Texas Athletic Department.
</P>
<P>
   You can try asking them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Naturopathic physician Gerard Luna, father to 15-year-old Rene
and 8-year-old Ari, used to ask his kids if they ate what he had
made for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd give me a straight answer,'' Luna says. Sometimes they
would say ``I didn't like that, so I threw it out or traded it,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   He advises parents to keep trying, perhaps giving them the food
in a different form: ``Maybe sliced instead of diced will work,''
Luna says.
</P>
<P>
   His family is vegetarian, so his children's lunches often are
different from those of their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter has become a kind of little novelty at
lunchtime,'' Luna says. Ari will unpack her tamari dips and other
unusual lunch foods, to the interest of her classmates. ``She
always has a different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGill, a registered nurse and mother to 9-year-old Jackson
and 4-year-old Grayson, recommends making a list of foods in each
food group that your children like. Try different combinations to
make their lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Todd-Meyer, nutrition team leader at Whole Foods Gateway,
recalls that when one of her daughters was in the fourth grade, she
would bring her lunch home at the end of the day, untouched. She
sat down with her daughter and they made a compromise: the daughter
would bring her lunch three days a week and buy it at the cafeteria
two days a week.
</P>
<P>
   Todd-Meyer changed what she put into the lunches, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Check with them. Try some different things,'' she advises.
``We settled on what made us both happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Children sometimes need to try foods 12 to 18 times before they
accept them, says registered dietitian Susie Jastrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always introduce a new food served with one of their
favorites,'' Jastrow says. And remember that kids' taste buds are
more sensitive than yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is bitter to you, it is 10 times more bitter to them,''
Jastrow says. ``Listen to what they're saying. They usually tell
you the truth.''

   Job: Personal trainer, owner of Fit Source
</P>
<P>
   Children: Kate, 22; Kevin, 21; Kelly, 12; Kayla, 10, and Colin,
8. (Moore packs lunches for Kelly, Kayla and Colin, although
sometimes he lets them get the school lunch.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Turkey sandwich on whole-wheat bread, grapes or
an apple, box of raisins and milk (bought at school).
</P>
<P>
   For a treat: Fig Newtons or cookies
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ``Start them young in treating fruits and vegetables as
dessert-type things.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a nurse's kid eat?
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGill
</P>
<P>
   Job: Registered nurse
</P>
<P>
   Children: Jackson, 9, and Grayson, 4
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Leftover grilled chicken with honey-mustard
dressing sandwiched in a dinner roll, frozen grapes (will defrost
by lunchtime), pretzels, apple slices with peanut butter and a
yogurt smoothie (yogurt, banana and strawberries blended together).
</P>
<P>
   For a treat: Angel food cake with strawberries
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ``My kids love applesauce.'' Buy the small individual
containers of applesauce, McGill says.
</P>
<P>
   What does a school nurse's kid eat?
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Adams
</P>
<P>
   Job: School nurse for Houston, Zilker and Barton Hills
Elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   Children: Loretta, 2. (Adams packs lunch for Loretta to take to
day care.
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Two ounces of chicken, 4 cucumber slices and 2
tomato wedges.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ''Sweets should be a treat. A lot of parents pack gummi
bears. That's not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a holistic healer's kid eat?
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Luna
</P>
<P>
   Job: Naturopathic doctor
</P>
<P>
   Children: Rene, 15, and Ari, 8. (The whole family is
vegetarian.)
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Nori roll (made with seasoned rice and nori, the
green seaweed wrapper used for sushi) stuffed with tofu, greens,
cilantro, mint and sunflower sprouts, spring rolls (vegetable rolls
made with rice paper), sliced fruit, nuts or chips and soy or rice
milk.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ``You need to work with your own kid. It starts at the
grocery store, helping them make healthy choices. Getting them
involved makes them more likely to eat what you do put in their
lunch box.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a dietitian's kid eat?
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Beckermann
</P>
<P>
   Job: Registered dietitian and sports nutritionist, University of
Texas athletic department
</P>
<P>
   Children: Chris, 15 and Daniel, 13 (both play football and
baseball).
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Chris and Daniel usually eat the hot lunch at
school. This is a lunch she would pack for a field trip _ for one
of her sons: two boxes of apple juice (frozen the night before),
two peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, two smoked turkey
sandwiches, banana, apple and a bag of baby carrots.
</P>
<P>
   For a treat: Cranberry fruit newtons or graham crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ``Some people are so hung up on fat. But there can be some
fat in their meals at noon to get them through four o'clock. Stop
torturing your kids with every fat-free thing at lunch _ they'll be
starving by 2:30. Allow for some cream cheese, allow some yogurt.''
</P>
<P>
   What does a Whole Foods team leader's kid eat?
</P>
<P>
   Mary Couto
</P>
<P>
   Job: Associate nutrition team leader, Whole Foods Gateway
</P>
<P>
   Children: Christina, 24, and Karla, 21
</P>
<P>
   Typical lunch: Karla is lactose-intolerant, so Couto had to
devise ways to build a healthy lunch without any dairy products:
turkey sandwich with soy cheese, blue corn chips, celery sticks
with peanut butter, cut-up watermelon and a box of rice milk.
</P>
<P>
   For a treat: Trail mix with dried fruit and nuts
</P>
<P>
   Tip: ``Smoked tofu is great. You can eat it straight, or heat it
up. Once they taste it, they'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tips for packing a healthful school lunch
</P>
<P>
   Be creative. Try a sandwich made with pineapple cream cheese on
a cinnamon raisin bagel, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Pack sandwiches using a variety of whole-grain breads.
</P>
<P>
   Select low-fat milk products, lean meats and water-packed tuna
for lunches.
</P>
<P>
   If your kids want soda pop, try substituting bottled fruit juice
(like black cherry juice) mixed with carbonated water.
</P>
<P>
   Try different green, yellow, red and orange fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Replace chips with low-sodium pretzels or a mixture of cereal,
raisins and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh strawberries are a good source of Vitamin C. Include some
in a small container.
</P>
<P>
   Dried fruit and raisins are great snacks. So is string cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Try including bean dips with chips, carrot sticks and celery
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Buy 100 percent juice, instead of ``juice drinks,'' which are
mostly sugar, food coloring and water.
</P>
<P>
   In some schools, kids don't get to eat lunch until 1 p.m. Make
sure their breakfast has some protein in it _ nuts, leftover meat
from dinner, eggs or yogurt _ to help them make it to lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap a tortilla around your child's favorite fillings and send
that. Or stuff some pita bread with sandwich filling.

 &HT;    Thoughts about Modern Library's best books list
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 100 best English-language novels of the 20th Century, as
drawn by the editorial board of the Modern Library, has been passed
around by the Associated Press and other services causing a lot of
discussion, pro and con, and in between, as was, I'm sure, the
purpose of making the list in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the number one novel on that list is
``Ulysses,'' by James Joyce. Number two is ``The Great Gatsby'' by
F. Scott Fitzgerald, and three, four and five are ``A Portrait of
the Artist as a Young Man'' by Joyce, ``Lolita'' by Vladmir
Nabokov, and ``Brave New World'' by Aldous Huxley.
</P>
<P>
   Various newspaper book pages around the country have been asking
staff members and local dignitaries to comment on that list and, in
turn, name their own top five or ten favorite novels of the past
century. I'm a semi-intellectual, former college professor and
current book commentator, but don't really claim to be a full
fledged ``Book Critic'' for a number of reasons, among them that I
haven't read half the books on the Modern Library list. But I do
read a lot, probably more than the average bear, and my top one
hundred English language novels would be a bunch different from the
Modern Library board's.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I definitely would have included in the top one
hundred William Faulkner's Snopes trilogy a ``The Hamlet,'' The
Town'' and ``The Mansion.'' The Modern Library list includes
several Faulker books, but not
</P>
<P>
   those three. Maybe because they are too funny.
</P>
<P>
   I also would include ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' by Harper Lee,
and ``Look Homeward Angel'' by Thomas Wolfe. The latter is a book
that has caused a lot of young folks over the decades to decide to
become avid readers. It's even inspired a few to become writers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, I would include the Border Trilogy by Cormac McCarthy of
El Paso, and ``Cold Mountain'' by Charles Frazier, although both
are so current some ``critics'' are reluctant to pass judgment
until they'd been around longer.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been one who believed a book had to be several
generations old before it could be judged properly, although I see
what they mean when some say that.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library list includes Jack London's ``Call of the
Wild.'' I guess I'd go along with that, although I read London's
other Klondike adventure, ``White Fang,'' first and have always
loved it best; so, I would sub it for ``Call of the Wild.'' But
that's nit-picking.
</P>
<P>
   I also would include at least one Larry McMurtry novel a
probably ``Lonesome Dove,'' although, in my mind, it's a close race
with ``Leaving Cheyenne.'' So, maybe I would put both on my best
one hundred list. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   I'd also add the late Billie Lee Brammer's ``Gay Place.'' I
agree with the Modern-Library board's selection of Robert Penn
Warren's Louisiana political thriller ``All the King's Men,'' but
would argue that Brammer's Texas
</P>
<P>
   political epic belongs there, too.
</P>
<P>
   And how about F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby'' being
picked way up there at number two? If you are one of those who
believes F. Scott was too popular or shallow to be rated so high on
a list of best novels of the past century, you should go back and
read Gatsby again. It is, indeed, a gem. I might even move it up
one to first place.
</P>
<P>
   If that statement causes you to frown, do as I suggested above.
Read it again. And remember it isn't just that Robert Whathisname
movie. It's a novel.
</P>
<P>
   If you disagree with any or all of the above, don't hesitate to
drop me a line at this newspaper.

 &HT;    Movie review: Point of `Return to Paradise' is lost
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure what the monetary unit of Malaysia is, but I know a
movie as phony as a three-dollar bill when I see it.
</P>
<P>
   That would be ``Return to Paradise,'' a preposterous morality
tale about three reckless American college graduates who frolic
around Malaysia getting high, before idealistic Lewis (Joaquin
Phoenix) stays behind and the other two, Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and
Tony (David Conrad), return to the States.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the returnees are informed by a cagey lawyer
named Beth (Anne Heche) that Lewis was found with their joint stash
of hashish, arrested, accused of dealing drugs and is about to be
executed. The only way they can save him is to return to Penang and
share the responsibility in a Third World hellhole of a jail. As a
plot convenience, they have only eight days to make up their minds
and save Lewis' life.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Wesley Strick (``Cape Fear'') and Bruce Robinson
(``The Killing Fields''), based on a 1990 French film, ``Return to
Paradise'' features clumsily conceived, inconsistent characters
whose motivations are alternately transparent and downright opaque.
Cinematic paradise, it ain't.
</P>
<P>
   At first, docile, high-minded Tony dutifully agrees to go back,
while irresponsible Sheriff wants no part of it. Beth _ whose
motives for being involved in the case remain annoyingly unclear
for too long, then prove patly personal _ despises Sheriff for his
lack of conscience and sense of obligation. At least she does until
she falls in love and sleeps with him. Such affection fogs
Sheriff's brain enough to change his mind, convincing him to give
himself up to Malaysian justice. Then it is Tony's turn to get cold
feet.
</P>
<P>
   For a little media-bashing, there's a persistent newspaper
reporter (Jada Pinkett Smith) on the trail of the story. She wants
the scoop badly and will gleefully jeopardize Lewis' welfare to get
it. Chances are you not only won't like any of these characters,
but you won't understand their actions well enough to care much
about them.
</P>
<P>
   Directing this muddle is Joseph Ruben (``Sleeping With the
Enemy''), who never develops the necessary tension of the deadline
negotiations. Nor does he have much patience for the details and
texture that might have lent this tale some credibility.
</P>
<P>
   As the attorney with a hefty expense account, Heche does do some
acting: Her cool cracks on cue, and she gets to play overwrought a
lot. But no amount of fevered expressions can convince us that Beth
would be suddenly, hopelessly attracted to Sheriff. Vaughn and
Conrad are perfectly adequate, though occasionally interchangeable.
And while the captive Phoenix doesn't have as much screen time as
his pals, he gets to emote wildly in a scene that demonstrates his
tenuous hold on reality.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there's a gripping movie in this ``Midnight
Express''-like story of life choices, friendship and personal
responsibility. Too bad ``Return to Paradise'' isn't it.

 &HT;    `There's no story too tough to tell'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Kay Alden knows everything. Everything.
</P>
<P>
   Like if Mrs. Chancellor's going to lose the mansion! If Neil's
going to tell Dru to take a hike! If Miguel's going to learn that
Veronica's really the murderous maid! If Grace is going to lure
Nicholas into the sack!
</P>
<P>
   Alden, head writer of ``The Young and the Restless,'' has been
with the show since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the luxury of getting to know some people without
them knowing what I do,'' says the Chicago-based mother of three.
``I think some of them think I don't work because I have such a
flexible schedule and can go to most of the kids' things.''
</P>
<P>
   The perfect cover to spy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh no, it's not like that,'' says Alden, laughing. ``It's very
rare that you just lift a situation straight out of real life. The
minute you put a story into the show, it becomes the characters'
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Alden _ a Kansas native who started watching ``As the World
Turns'' at age 12 _ was a doctoral candidate at the University of
Wisconsin when she met ``Young and Restless'' creator Bill Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was doing a dissertation on daytime TV as a mediator of
social change, so I called him for an interview. I remember being
amazed that he answered his own phone and agreed to talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, Bell returned the call with a job offer.
</P>
<P>
   Alden leads conference calls each week with writers in L.A., New
York and Hawaii. After they devise story lines for about five or
six shows, their scripts are sent to another stable of writers who
fill in details, add production notes and research minutiae ``like
finding out Victoria's middle name because we'd forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young and Restless'' head writer Kay Alden on:
</P>
<P>
   Which role she'd portray if she were an actress: `If I could
play any character, it would be Nikki (who debuted in 1978 and is
now married _ again _ to tycoon Victor Newman). I've been with her
for so long, and what I love about the character is how she's
evolved. When she was young, she was remarkably egocentric. We've
watched Nikki grow up and develop compassion, yet she still hasn't
lost her fire.'
</P>
<P>
   A common soap device _ amnesia: `It became such an industry
standard for a while that I found myself cringing when we used it,
but the thing that makes it so irresistible is that it allows
characters to do the ultimate search into themselves. At various
points in our lives, we've all felt that need. It's not just about
some poor sucker who lost his memory. It's about rediscovering an
identity.'
</P>
<P>
   Tackling tough issues on the show: `I believe that if you
construct a story on an issue that is compelling and involves
characters that your audience is committed to, there's no story too
tough to tell. One of the huge, huge values of daytime television
is its ability to educate people about what's going on. The first
divorce I ever had contact with was on As the World Turns when I
was a kid.'

 &HT;    `That's Katherine Chancellor!'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ She is venerable, glamorous, sometimes
compassionate, always brash.
</P>
<P>
   But today, she's sick as a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, like, only the sixth time in 25 years I haven't been
able to tape the show,'' says Jeanne Cooper _ a k a Katherine
Chancellor on ``The Young and the Restless'' _ between hacking
coughs from her home in L.A. ``I keep telling myself `Not
pneumonia!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Chancellor'' may have survived sailing over a cliff in a
car, the ravages of alcoholism and the rantings of arch rival, Jill
Abbott, but, Cooper deadpans: ``This sinus infection may be what
kills me in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to separate Cooper from her character because a)
she's played Mrs. Chancellor for so long, and b) we witnessed her
get a real face-lift in 1984 _ a soap-opera first _ and worried
with her as the bandages came off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind when people ask me about it because it did so
much good,'' says Cooper, who had some more facial fine-tuning (``a
rejuvenation'') last year on the show. ``It took away the fear and
the mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, a grandmom of seven with one on the way, became Mrs. C.
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Creator) Bill Bell wasn't pleased with the ratings, so he
added my character. I went in and read for the role, and he looked
up and said, `That's Katherine Chancellor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And folks around the world (``Y&AMP;R'' airs in 32 countries) agree.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper says she's fond of today's more confident and outspoken
Mrs. C., who's been on the wagon for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many people have come up to me and shaken
my hand and given me a sobriety chip (a token of acknowledgment)
from Alcoholics Anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest child of an oil-consultant dad and teacher mom,
Cooper has three kids, including actor Corbin Bernsen.
</P>
<P>
   She's also the best of pals with actress Jess Walton, who plays
Jill Abbott _ the temptress who had an affair with Phillip way back
when.
</P>
<P>
   ``We crack up all the time,'' says Cooper, who recently had to
wrestle Walton in a scene worthy of ``The Jerry Springer Show.''
``Jess didn't think our stunt doubles were being aggressive enough,
so we jumped in there and did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Cooper had planned to play Mrs. Chancellor for
just two years or so. But the character stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to longevity is to realize that yes, this other person
is in your life. But that no, you're not that person. Otherwise,
you'd probably blow your brains out.''
</P>
<P>
   And we know that can't happen because then Jill would win.

 &HT;    Why the Young and the Restless never gets old
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Imagine swinging a sledgehammer every
day at the fair and hitting the bell every time for 10 years. Not
only that, but you wow the same spectators into returning again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Young and the Restless,'' in a sense, has done just that.
This month, the CBS soap is celebrating 500 consecutive weeks _
nearly a decade _ as TV's No. 1 serial.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bell, who cut his teeth writing for ``Days of Our Lives,''
created the show _ originally titled ``The Innocent Years'' _ with
his wife, Lee. But the pair then decided that political
assassinations and Vietnam had stripped America of its naivete, so
they opted for youth and angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Young and the Restless,'' which debuted in 1973 and has
won an unprecedented five Emmys for best daytime drama, also boasts
many soap opera firsts _ a rape (Chris Brooks), a vasectomy (Victor
Newman) and a case of bulimia (Traci Abbott), just to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, tackling tough issues is part of what propelled ``Y&AMP;R''
to the top, along with glamorous locales, hip background music and
relentless attention to detail (such as each character having a
driver license from Genoa City, Wis., in case a wallet is opened on
set).
</P>
<P>
   The main draw, though, is endearing characters _ folks so
complex and confused that you can't help but stay curious.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you write a soap, you're obviously never done,'' says
head writer Kay Alden, who joined the show in 1974. ``But if you
construct a story that involves characters your viewers are
committed to, they'll always come back for more.''
</P>
<P>
   `God, I feel so restless'
</P>
<P>
   _ On March 26, 1973, medical student Snapper Foster lent an ear
to his waitress friend, Sally McGuire, who speaks the soap's very
first words: ``Kind of a drag, isn't it? Stuck in a place like
Genoa City.'' (Pause.) ``God, I feel so restless.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Genoa City, Wis., really exists. ``Young and Restless''
creators Bill and Lee Bell borrowed the name after driving through
the wee town on the way from Chicago to their weekend house in Lake
Geneva, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Young and the Restless'' theme song _ dubbed ``Nadia's
Theme'' after Olympic gymnast Nadia Comaneci performed a floor
routine to it in 1976 _ was originally titled ``Cotton's Theme'' in
the film ``Bless the Beasts and the Children.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Selleck starred as Jed Andrews from 1975-76, and David
Hasselhoff played Snapper Foster from 1975-82. Lake Worth, Fla.,
native Deidre Hall (now Marlena Evans Brady on ``Days of Our
Lives'') was Barbara Anderson from 1973-75.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts that bolted: they came, they killed, they split Genoa City
</P>
<P>
   David Kimble (Michael Corbett)
</P>
<P>
   When we met secretary David Kimble in 1986, he seemed so
mild-mannered. But once he found out heiress Nina Chancellor was
worth the big bucks, he schemed to marry her _ and vowed to cut up
anybody who got in his way (i.e., Cricket Blair). Turns out ol'
David had killed his former wife, who also was an heiress. Nina
discovered David's evil past, so he faked his death and went to a
plastic surgeon for a new face. (``Can you make me look like David
Hasselhoff?'' he asked.) The all-knowing doc, however, emblazoned
the word KILLER on his forehead. And to make a long story short,
literally, David left _ for good _ after being compacted in a trash
chute.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown)
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Carter was an intermittent whacko, appearing first in
1990, then from 1992-93, then in 1995. First she stole Lauren
Fenmore's husband, Dr. Scott Grainger, by seducing him, faking a
pregnancy and swapping Lauren's baby (fathered by Scott) with one
she'd gotten off the black market. Then she kidnapped Lauren and
was about to murder her when a fire broke out in the Carter
farmhouse, killing a groundskeeper. Sheila even plotted to slay her
mom, who tried to tell Lauren the truth but couldn't because she'd
had a stroke and was unable to speak. Folks assumed Sheila died in
the blaze, but au contraire. She ran off to L.A. and is now on
``Y&AMP;R's'' sister show, ``The Bold and the Beautiful.''

 &HT;    Why i'm hooked on `The Young and the Restless'
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, FLA. _ I know it's not real. I don't care.
</P>
<P>
   What it is, my friends, is consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Day in and day out, Genoa City, Wis., home of ``The Young and
the Restless,'' awaits me _ 60 minutes of exaggerated escapism, 40
minutes or so if you skip the commercials. Beautiful people,
outrageous scenarios, always there.
</P>
<P>
   Same time, same place.
</P>
<P>
   I was just 8 years old when I met grande dame Mrs. Chancellor,
and 25 years later, I still can't bring myself to call her
Katherine, let alone Kay.
</P>
<P>
   I turned into a teen the year ingenue Nikki Reed appeared, then
three years later, I got my driver license when virile Victor
Newman debuted. As I came of age, those two fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   And within those 8 years, my address changed three times:
</P>
<P>
   Croton Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Felton Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Street.
</P>
<P>
   Because my Dad, you see, was an Army man. From pillar to post,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   But folks in Genoa City stayed put. Or at least a few of them
did _ like Mrs. C., Nikki and Victor.
</P>
<P>
   I moved to Florida in 1987, the same year dapper Rex Sterling
turned up, along with loon du jour Leanna Love.
</P>
<P>
   And although this pair left the show years ago, they remain
loosely linked to that milestone in my life. So, too, does young
mom Sharon Collins, whom I encountered the year I hit 30. As she
bagged a buff Newman heir for a husband, I began to wonder about a
white picket fence of my own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Young and the Restless,'' to me, is a ritual. A time to
plop down, turn off and zone out _ like a four-hour Sunday football
epic split into five weekday bits.
</P>
<P>
   Throw me the remote, get out of my face, my team is on. And if I
forget to set the VCR, I kick myself _ but just a tad. You see,
there's always tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Same time, same place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Young and the Respite.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly rocket science. There's no far-flung relevance here.
Just something to banter about with my mom and sisters, and a
chuckle to share with a colleague or two.
</P>
<P>
   Like me, these women know it's not real. And like me, they
couldn't care less.

BEVERLY HILLS COMEDY GOES SLUMMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 1{ Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breasts! First-time filmmaker Tamara Jenkins seems
obsessed by them in her clunky, screwball family story, ``Slums of
Beverly Hills.'' If her characters aren't flashing them or asking
guys to touch them, then they're talking about them, constantly,
incessantly, pointlessly. It's a fixation that Joe Bob Briggs would
love _ for about five minutes _ until he realized, like the rest of
us, that there's not a whole lot more to the movie.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' Jenkins is looking to tell a
poignant, funny, coming-of-age story about the Abramowitz family,
Jewish Joads who move from one crummy, two-story stucco apartment
building to another on the outskirts of Beverly Hills during the
mid-1970s. Father Murray (Alan Arkin) is looking for the good life,
but success seems always around the corner, just out of reach.
Murray has three kids, the suddenly bosomy 15-year-old daughter,
Vivian (Natasha Lyonne); and two sons, Ben (David Krumholtz) and
Rickey (Eli Marienthal), who spend most of their free time staring
at their sister's breasts. (Did they get bigger overnight?)
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who is old enough to often be called the kids'
grandfather, wants to keep the family in the Beverly Hills School
District. ``Furniture is temporary, education is forever,'' he
says. (Never mind that we never once see the kids talk about school
or do any homework. Maybe they're on vacation. Who knows?)
</P>
<P>
   Murray's problem is that he's always running a little short on
cash. So when he learns that his brother's screw-up daughter, Rita
(Marisa Tomei), has escaped from rehab (again), he decides to find
her and take her under his wing _ in return for ample monthly
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The movie focuses primarily on Vivian and her breasts and her
discomfort over what puberty has wrought. (The '70s backdrop adds
little to the film, other than the music on the soundtrack.) Having
Rita in the house gives Vivian the perfect role model for what NOT
to do and also gives her a chance to learn more about vibrators,
menstruation and tampons. Jenkins, who also wrote the screenplay,
manages the occasional insight into adolescent self-image, and her
script has plenty of good ideas. She just doesn't ably execute many
of them.
</P>
<P>
   The film's fatal flaw is the flat tone of its comic scenes.
Example: Late in the movie a character overdoses on pills, the
paramedics arrive and, yup, high jinks ensue. It takes a great deal
of skill to pull something like this off for laughs and not just
have the audience sit there, mouths scraping the floor, wondering
what in the name of God they're supposed to be feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's the Kooky Family Syndrome, all over again.
Contrary to what a lot of filmmakers think, kooky behavior isn't
inherently funny _ even if your message is that kookiness is OK
because, shucks, we're a family. (Nor does the overused comic ploy
of the sing-along always work, but that's an altogether different
gripe about this movie.) Great comedy can come from fully formed
characters, but those are in short supply here. The family's
yearnings for the good life are never adequately thought out or
explored.
</P>
<P>
   We're left, then, with breasts. I never thought I'd use Susan
Skoog's recent coming-of-age yarn, ``Whatever,'' as a benchmark,
but at least in that film, you had a young woman coming to grips
with her adolescence in ways that rang true. And ``Whatever''
didn't need four close-up cleavage shots to make its point. For
some reason, ``Slums of Beverly Hills'' did. Not only were the
shots unnecessary, they were clumsily inserted close-ups of obvious
body doubles whose breasts looked quite a bit bigger than those of
Lyonne and Tomei. (Now she's got me obsessing about breasts.)
</P>
<P>
   Lyonne certainly proves herself game for the raunch. With her
tube socks and halter tops, Lyonne's Vivian looks like an early
incarnation of Roller Girl from ``Boogie Nights.'' The actress
convincingly conveys her character's malaise and enthusiastically
jumps into a scene that calls for her and Tomei to dance in their
nighties and whip around a vibrator to the thumping backbeat of
Parliament's ``Give Up the Funk.'' It's too bad the movie doesn't
pull out of its funk often enough to reward such a brave
performance.

MORAL DILEMMA... AND A MOVIE, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2{ Stars

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Say you're a swinging, young, good-looking guy
and, a couple of years back, you took a memorable vacation to
Malaysia where you enjoyed a good solid month of rum, girls and
fine, cheap hash.
</P>
<P>
   And say in your haste to leave the country and make your flight,
you dumped the leftover pot in the garbage and waved goodbye to
Malaysia and farewell to your tree-hugging buddy who was staying
behind to, yes, save the orangutans. And say the local police found
the hash, prosecuted the tree-hugger and sentenced him to death ...
unless _ and it's a big unless _ you return to Malaysia and serve
time in a sinkhole jail.
</P>
<P>
   That's the provocative premise of ``Return to Paradise,'' a
movie that pokes, prods and nudges you throughout its two hours,
practically begging you to answer the question: What would YOU do?
</P>
<P>
   Sad to say, though, the filmmakers have decided that the core
moral dilemma isn't enough to sustain interest and have added
creaky plot contrivances and the year's worst tacked-on love story
to dilute what could have been a pretty good film. That's not to
say that you'll leave ``Paradise'' feeling ripped off. You'll just
wish the writers and directors had respected your intelligence a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and Tony (David Conrad) are the two young
dudes who left Malaysia and returned to their normal lives in New
York only to find, two years later, that their other vacation
buddy, Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix), has been jailed as a drug
trafficker. Lewis' attorney, Beth (Anne Heche), tells the boys that
unless they are willing to return to Malaysia, serve three years
apiece (or one can go back and do six years), Lewis will be
executed. The thing is, THEY ONLY HAVE EIGHT DAYS TO DECIDE! This
after some 700 days have passed since Lewis was incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   The time frame is an obvious artificial device designed by
director Joseph Rubin (``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' ``The Good
Son'') and writers Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson to create some
excitement. But the basic story generates enough interest. It's
simply not necessary to keep adding subplots, like having a
newspaper reporter (Jada Pinkett Smith) threatening to break the
story and, in so doing, likely expedite Lewis' execution. It's a
false note _ among many _ that submarines the movie's dramatic
thrust.
</P>
<P>
   The actors do their best with their one-note characters. Conrad
plays the Golden Boy, the guy with the beautiful fiancee, cool
apartment and the most to lose by going back. Phoenix is the
Sensitive Soul who now faces death. Heche has little to do but look
determined, while Vaughn is the cynical cool cat who must face the
hard truths about his abandoned ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the contrivances, there is a certain
inevitability to the film because, if the boys don't go back, there
wouldn't be a movie, would there? That plain fact deflates much of
the manufactured suspense. That it doesn't ruin the film
underscores the movie's inherent strengths _ its actors and its
what-would-you-do? dramatic premise. Other than that, it's
``Paradise'' lost.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Like its predecessor ``Waiting to Exhale,'' ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is a luxuriously appointed soap opera
with just enough sass to make it seem like something more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps its main plus, in what's emerging as the Terry McMillan
tradition (she adapted both films from her novels, with the help of
screenwriter Ron Bass), ``Stella'' cannily fills an empty niche in
the women's picture world.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Exhale'' was the first major movie to focus on the romantic
travails of middle-class African-American women, ``Groove'' is the
first Hollywood film in a long time to suggest that mature women
can find real happiness with younger men. An impossibly idealized
younger man, in this case, who makes a lot of the trepidation that
goes with ``Groove's'' main move rather unconvincing. But what the
heck? Men have enjoyed this particular movie fantasy for decades,
and there's no denying that this show looks real good viewed from
the feminine perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Bassett plays Stella, who's pretty ideal herself. She's a
40-year-old San Francisco stockbroker who works hard, works out
harder and takes excellent care of her son, Quincy (Michael J.
Pagan), her troublesome sisters Vanessa (``Jerry Maguire's'' Regina
King) and Angela (Suzzanne Douglas), and even her ex-husband's
feelings. Of course, like most fictional superwomen, she has no
time for self-fulfillment (scenes in the book involving a casual
lover were filmed with Danny Glover, but excised from the movie's
final cut).
</P>
<P>
   On an atypical impulse, Stella goes on a Jamaican vacation with
her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg). Delilah is one of those
earthy, man-hungry, life-affirming movie persons who both
embarrasses and encourages her uptight friend to get a little
looser. But it's the incredibly attractive local fellow Winston
(newcomer Taye Diggs) who really gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The son, conveniently, of a respectable doctor, Winston is not
only well-raised but, even more conveniently, at that age (20)
where committing to a career path is less important than, well,
fulfilling Stella's every fantasy. Sincere, patient, a little naive
(which can be a good thing, too) and effortlessly charming,
Winston's even cute when he complains about Stella's mild acts of
condescension _ which are the only things he ever complains about.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the big problems here stem from others' judgments of
Stella's judgment. But the naysaying characters aren't privy to the
shower scene in which lucky audiences get to ogle Winston. It's all
the proof anybody needs that Stella, too, is of eminently sound
mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan, a former actor making his
big-screen debut, keeps things plush, posh and lazily sensual. The
Jamaican sequences come close to feeling like an actual tropical
vacation, while the stateside shots outdo even ``The Parent Trap''
remake in the architectural eye candy and interior decoration
departments.
</P>
<P>
   And Sullivan keeps the performances real, even when the material
gets repetitive and contrived. Yes, there's the ``touching'' death
of a ``beloved'' side character. Indeed, the film's comic relief
oscillates between too broad at some points and too arch at others.
And of course, the story climaxes on the same, forced Hollywood
note as every other commercial romance of the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, though, ``Groove'' nevertheless charms the
pants off you as effectively as Winston does Stella. And unlike
him, the movie, at least, has flaws it has to work past.

PRESIDENCY DERAILED?

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His advisors are among the wisest that money and
prestige can secure. He commands the mightiest army the world has
ever known, and he's the undisputed and twice-elected leader of the
last remaining superpower.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, on the eve of what history may well record as the
defining moment of his complex career, William Jefferson Clinton is
a man largely on his own, soberly pondering an excruciating
political, legal and moral calculus upon which may rest his
presidency and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   After seven torturous months of first denying and then dodging
charges of carnal relations with a former White House intern, the
president is wandering the peril-strewn wilderness of the
conscience, where the centrist compass that has guided his
breathtaking political journey for more than three decades is
suddenly, terrifyingly, useless.
</P>
<P>
   The search for common ground, after all, can be a very different
enterprise than the quest for truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one wants to get this matter behind us more than I do _
except maybe all the rest of the American people,'' President
Clinton told reporters at the White House recently, in the only
public comment he's made about his plans to testify on Monday about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am looking forward to the opportunity in the next few days
of testifying,'' Clinton asserted. ''I will do so completely and
truthfully. I am anxious to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely what Clinton plans to tell independent counsel Kenneth
Starr and, via a closed circuit television feed, a federal grand
jury, isn't publicly known. Nor is it clear whether Clinton intends
to share his testimony with the American people, either through a
speech or news conference, or whether he simply plans to testify
behind closed doors and board Air Force One without a public word
to begin his two-week Martha's Vineyard vacation.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that, whether Monday becomes seen as
Clinton's moment of truth, whether he emerges in the guise of Slick
Willie or the Comeback Kid, the greatest immediate threat he faces
is not so much a presidency ended, but rather a presidency
derailed. What's at risk for Clinton is nothing less than the very
heart and soul of his success _ his ability to lead from the
center.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of politics revolves around approval and personal
credibility,'' said political scientist Michael Johnston, ''and
that's very much at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   In his rise from obscurity in an Arkansas backwater to the
pinnacle of international power, no gift has served Clinton better
than his knack for combing the counsel of a diverse array of
sources and divining from it all the vital center, the ideological
ground zero. From there, he has repeatedly crafted a working
consensus, employing the combination of rhetorical brilliance and
persuasive genius that have made him, for better or worse, the most
compelling politician of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   As president, he has melded his talents with the times, and
often with notable success, deploying U.S. troops to restore
democracy to Haiti over the objections of a reluctant Congress;
resisting tax cuts and rampant spending to help balance the federal
budget for the first time in three decades; and mixing aggressive
diplomacy with NATO air strikes in Bosnia to end Europe's bloodiest
conflict since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He's been rewarded with remarkable popularity _ a 68 percent job
approval rating, at last tally _ and a national mood of optimism
both reflected in and buoyed by a soaring economy and the greatest
bull market ever to stampede Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton could simply climb on the back of public consensus
and be hoisted out of his current quagmire, however, he would have
done so long ago. He's not stuck on some split-the-difference
policy matter this time; he's tangled in a legal and political web
with no clear exit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's gotten himself into a dilemma for which there is no easy
answer,'' said Larry Sabato, director of the Center for
Governmental Studies at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   And, while any immediate potential legal threats to Clinton
appear eminently defendable, perhaps even ultimately winnable, the
effectiveness of the presidency has always depended far more upon
moral authority _ simple public trust _ than merely on skirting the
letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It terms of the wrongdoing that's out on the table now, we're
talking about fairly dishonorable but reasonably small stuff,''
said Johnston, author of the book ''Political Corruption and Public
Policy in America,'' and a professor at Colgate University, in
Hamilton, N.Y. ''In political terms, it's a very large scandal. He
is in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jan. 21 when allegations first surfaced that Clinton had
an Oval Office affair with Lewinsky, then later urged her to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   At first Clinton was staggered by the blow, telling reporters
the next day that there were ''legitimate,'' questions about his
relationship with Lewinsky and that the American people deserved an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will give you as many answers as we can,'' Clinton vowed.
''I'd like for you to have more rather than less, sooner rather
than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days Clinton reversed course, opting to explain nothing
about what was, beyond dispute, an extraordinary relationship with
a young intern. Instead, he delivered a comprehensive and emphatic
denial of any wrongdoing, then suggested Americans just forget the
whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky,'' Clinton declared forcefully in televised remarks from
the Roosevelt Room, as First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton nodded her
approval. ''I never told anybody to lie, not a single time. Never.
These allegations are false, and I need to go back to work for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a strategy of denial, stonewalling and lambasting his
leading tormentor, Starr, the federal prosecutor and former judge
who went on to conduct the most intensive _ some say invasive _
investigation in history of the personal life of an American
president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launched into a frenzy of activity, all painstakingly
choreographed for the widest possible media coverage, speaking
about crime or education one day, Social Security the next, and
traveling to Africa, Latin America, Europe, China and, early next
month, to Russia, hoping to demonstrate beyond question that he had
indeed gone ''back to work for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts are a bit more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his often touted penchant for compartmentalization,
Clinton has been a president diminished by the cloud of suspicion
hanging over him this year, sharply withdrawing from the press _
his key conduit to the American people _ and spending countless
hours and incalculable energy consulting with lawyers on
scandal-aversion tactics, instead of concentrating on the state of
the union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, I suppose, we have great experience at
soldiering on through these kinds of personal attacks,'' White
House political counselor Paul Begala said, insisting that the
White House staff remains focused on substance, despite the
constant distraction of the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not pleasant,'' Begala said of the controversy, ''but
it's not paralyzing.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of a man hard at work on global as well as bread and
butter issues, in fact, coupled with the drumbeat of White House
attacks against Starr, even seems to have convinced many Americans
that Clinton is being unfairly persecuted.
</P>
<P>
   ''He calls it the politics of personal destruction,'' said
Begala. ''The best way to respond is to rise above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's problem is that Lewinsky has reportedly contradicted
him, testifying in graphic detail to an alleged White House affair
she claims lasted more than a year. She reportedly says a dress
that is being examined by the FBI contains physical evidence of an
encounter with Clinton. And Starr is expected to file an exhaustive
report to Congress, possibly within weeks, detailing what else he
has learned of the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship through his
examination of U.S. Secret Service agents and a host of Clinton
compatriots and confidantes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have said repeatedly they know of no reason for
him not to stick to his earlier denial, which he has also told
under oath to a grand jury investigating the claim by former
Arkansas state employee Paula Jones that Clinton, while governor,
propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel. Clinton's lawyers have
denied Jones' charges and her suit has been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Pointedly, however, Clinton has not repeated his denial of the
Lewinsky matter publicly for weeks, not even when he addressed the
controversy earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   It surely hasn't helped Clinton that he has become more isolated
on the matter as the case has dragged on.
</P>
<P>
   Recent court rulings, in effect, prevent him from confiding in
even his closest staff members and White House attorneys, leaving
the normally wide-ranging Clinton free to seek confidential counsel
only from his wife and the three private attorneys he has hired _
David Kendall, Nicole Seligman and Mickey Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they weren't billing him by the hour, this is not how
Clinton prefers to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton has been truthful, certainly, he has nothing to fear
from the dress, the inquiry or even the personal testimony of
Lewinsky, a self-acknowledged liar .
</P>
<P>
   If Starr can make a convincing, evidence-backed case, however,
that Clinton hasn't told the truth _ either in his sworn deposition
or in his blanket public denial last January _ the politics of
personal destruction could quickly take on new poignancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Clinton were to address the nation and say 'I lied in the
Paula Jones deposition,' the republic would have to reflect on what
that means, to commit perjury, which is a felony,'' said William
Reynolds, professor of law at the University of Maryland. ''That,''
said Reynolds, ''is a serious problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, said Reynolds, a country blessed by peace and
prosperity would forgive a contrite Clinton, and, absent public
outrage, the likelihood of impeachment would appear dim.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' Reynolds quickly injected, ''I don't think he's a man
who can come clean with the nation if it hurts him. I think he is a
man who is incapable of telling the truth if it hurts him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that perception, that overarching lack of public trust,
far more than the risk of impeachment, that threatens to undermine
what's left of Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of evasion, coupled with lingering questions over
Clinton's plans for Monday, have already left many, like Sabato,
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells us that maybe we don't know him nearly as well as we
thought we did, and the whole Monica Lewinsky thing makes me think
that I don't want to know him,'' said Sabato. ''I think most
Americans feel that way _ the less I know him, the happier I am.''

<P>
   It is that perception, that overarching lack of public trust,
far more than the risk of impeachment, that threatens to undermine
what's left of Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months of evasion, coupled with lingering questions over
Clinton's plans for Monday, have already left many, like Sabato,
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ''It tells us that maybe we don't know him nearly as well as we
thought we did, and the whole Monica Lewinsky thing makes me think
that I don't want to know him,'' said Sabato. ''I think most
Americans feel that way _ the less I know him, the happier I am.''

HAPPY TOGETHER: `FELICITY' AND THE WB HOPE TO OUT-FOX FOX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 16)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hollywood dictates this: When you pitch a
television show, you have to have a comparison, such as ``It's like
Bataan, but a musical,'' or ``It's a cross between `Father Knows
Best' and `Silence of the Lambs.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to ``Felicity,'' a one-hour drama premiering this
fall on the WB network (Tuesdays, 9 to 10 p.m. Eastern, premieres
Sept. 29). With regret, the shorthand for this show would have to
be ``Ally McBeal and Her So-Called Life Go to College.''
</P>
<P>
   This drama could suffer by comparison to the one-hour Fox comedy
and the powerful but brief ``My So-Called Life.'' Then again, if an
audience is actually drawn in by the comparisons to this drama,
odds are it will stick around after its individuality emerges.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some rumblings that the ``Felicity'' camp is not
too happy with the ``Ally'' comparisons, yet 22-year-old star Kerri
Russell takes them at face value _ and draws distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a compliment. It is a huge compliment,'' she said at a
recent network party. ``It's groundbreaking for its genre. It's a
smart show. I'm glad to be compared to a smart show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only difference is `Ally McBeal' has that great fantasy
element, and our show doesn't have that,'' she continued. ``I
wouldn't want (the audience) to be let down. We're a drama.''
</P>
<P>
   A good drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' may be one show that ABC will regret having passed
on, which it did before WB picked it up. One of the most polished
pilots of the new season, the show has the potential to be a hit
for the WB and its effort to out-youth Fox and go after Generation
Xers' younger brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The show should twin perfectly with ``Dawson's Creek'' (which
moves to Wednesdays at 8 p.m.) in attracting young viewers to the
WB. Just to make sure the established show's audience finds
``Felicity,'' Scott Foley, who played star quarterback Cliff on
``Dawson's,'' moves over to ``Felicity'' to play a geeky,
love-struck college resident assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The premise for the show is this: Felicity Porter is a
California good girl who plans on following dad's example and
become a doctor. At her graduation she comes across Ben Covington,
whom she always had an eye for but never had the guts to meet. In
signing Felicity's yearbook he admits that he, too, wishes they had
become friends. Is this a nice gesture? Something more? Felicity
has to know.
</P>
<P>
   So after finding out Ben is going to a New York City university
(a poorly disguised New York University), Porter shelves pre-med
and Stanford and on a lark heads off to New York, too, much to the
ire of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Spur of the moment, irresponsible and irrational. The people who
got their cackles crinkled over ``Ally'' are going to be equally
ticked off by ``Felicity.'' What kind of message is this, you may
ask yet again? Are all women brainless ditzes? But don't be fooled:
This is not a McBeal knock-off.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is a coming-of-age story stylishly done with college
life and New York City as a backdrop. As for a character having to
be a role model, ask yourself a question: How together was your act
when you were 17?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you, too, would have taken off after a potential love.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake that she makes,'' said co-executive producer
and creator J.J. Abrams, who along with fellow 32-year-old partner
Matt Reeves has a film background (including writing the
anti-Felicity flick ``Armageddon.'') ``The character even says that
in the show. There's a much bigger reason why she ends up
staying.''
</P>
<P>
   McBeal caused a firestorm when the character somehow became the
poster woman for post-modern feminism. McBeal star Calista
Flockhart, who, like Russell, wants to remind people that her
character is just that, a piece of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just an actress trying to play a part,'' Flockhart said.
``There's no denying that people are thinking of Ally as a role
model.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, ``Felicity'' does _ but only to a point.

 &HT;    Georgia couple serve entree spiced with crime
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by the success of Diane Mott Davidson's culinary
mysteries such as ``Death by Chocolate,'' crime novels that feature
recipes or descriptions of food have become as ubiquitous as creme
brulee or calamari. The latest entree in the genre is ``Go Close
Against the Enemy'' (St. Martin's, $23.95) by an Athens, Ga.
couple, Takis and Judy Iakovou.
</P>
<P>
   The sleuths in this series are Nick and Julia Lambros, owners of
a restaurant in a college town called Delphi. ``He's olive oil,
she's vinegar,'' says Judy Iakovou, describing their fictional
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Like the authors, Nick is a Greek immigrant married to an
American woman. The Iakovous, former proprietors of Zorba's in
Athens, own the Checkered Cloth Cafe in Arnoldsville and the Silver
Screen Grill in Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Being a restaurateur is a lot like being a bartender, says
Takis, 48. ``Your regular customers become almost like a family,
and they tell you all about their lives and their experiences. Of
course, we're careful not to abuse confidences. The people we meet
and the stories they tell us become like ingredients in a recipe.
You mix them all up, and the final product is something entirely
different.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple's 1996 debut novel, ``So Dear to Wicked Men,''
focused on immigration, but the second in their series deals with
latent racism in the South: When a young interracial couple
attempts to bury its stillborn baby in the ``white'' cemetery,
deacon Walter Fry protests. An altercation between the deacon and
the mother ensues, and when Fry is found dead, she becomes the
prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Racism ``was something we've had a lot of experience with,''
says Judy, 48. ``It may arouse some strong feelings, but we can't
ignore the fact that racism still exists. We'd like to do what
little we can to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iakovous will speak to the Mystery Book Club at 7 tonight at
Borders Books and Music, 3555 Gwinnett Place Drive, Duluth.
770-495-4043.
</P>
<P>
   LOVE, KANSAS STYLE: It's not unusual for publishers to send
unknown authors on book tours to drum up publicity. But it is
unusual to send someone on a tour five months before the book is
published. In Janice Graham's case, it was a way of getting a buzz
going for her novel ``Firebird'' (Putnam, $19.95), while
booksellers were making decisions about what titles to order for
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them had read the galleys and were interested in
meeting me,'' says Graham, 50, a Kansas schoolteacher who was paid
$1 million for a three-book deal. ``It was a writer's dream to
actually meet people who have read your book.''
</P>
<P>
   Touted as a romantic tale in the manner of ``The Horse
Whisperer,'' Graham's novel centers on a Kansas rancher and
attorney who is engaged to marry his longtime girlfriend. The
wedding plans are put on hold when he falls in love with a
beautiful concert violinist who returns from Paris for her mother's
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Like her protagonist, Graham returned to her native Kansas after
living for a time in Paris. But there the similarities end. Graham
spent a year in the Middle East, lived six months in Greece and a
month in Turkey, married and divorced twice and held 13 different
jobs. For two months she lived with a friend in a palm frond hut in
the Sinai desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only had canned food to eat,'' she says, ``and we had to
walk to an army base to get our water every day. My whole
metabolism slowed down. I can see myself returning to a place like
that. It was an extraordinarily spiritual place.''
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THIN AIR: If you're looking for early holiday gift ideas,
you might make a note of Villard's illustrated edition of Jon
Krakauer's ``Into Thin Air.'' The true adventure story of a Mount
Everest expedition that ended in tragedy was on The New York Times
Bestseller List for 52 weeks in hardback. The illustrated edition,
on sale Nov. 25 for $40, will include hundreds of photographs with
the complete text and a new afterword by Krakauer. All of the
author's proceeds will be donated to charity.

 &HT;    `Air Bud' carries ball and movie
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, a movie called ``Air Bud'' showcased Buddy, a golden
retriever with a mean hoop shot. Unfortunately, that Buddy died of
cancer. But if Batman can go from Michael Keaton to Val Kilmer to
George Clooney, then why not ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver,'' in which
a quartet of adorable goldens sub for the original star?
</P>
<P>
   This time, Buddy (mostly played by Rush and Zach) and his boy,
Josh (Kevin Zegers), tackle a new sport: football. Josh has a
natural arm, and Buddy is _ well, they don't call 'em retrievers
for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble arises on two fronts. Josh is jealous of his widowed
mother's (Cynthia Stevenson) interest in the town's new
veterinarian (Gregory Harrison). Meanwhile, Buddy is being eyed by
two seedy circus owners (Nora Dunn and Perry Anzilotti, doing a
Boris and Natasha routine) who kidnap talented animals.
</P>
<P>
   When Buddy isn't around, the movie gets a little boring. After
all, it's really just a glorified after-school special. But,
luckily, Buddy is onscreen a lot, and though the script may be
simple-minded, there hasn't been a lot this summer aimed at younger
children. Plus, the movie handles its messages well _ that sports
should be played for fun, not just to win, and that potential
stepparents deserve a chance; you can treat them like a mom or dad
and still love your real mom or dad.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy plays football like a pro, and his end-zone antics _ a
kind of ecstatic victory roll _ are puppy-cute. Old-timers Tim
Conway and Dick Martin (of ``Laugh-In'' fame and, conveniently, the
director's father) provide ready-made nostalgia as comic sports
announcers. And who cares if the movie is really just one long
series of Stupid Pet Tricks? It's a lot more interesting than, say,
``Armageddon.'' And Buddy in his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet looks
every bit as heroic as Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Zegers. Directed by Richard Martin. Rated G. At
metro theaters. 1 hour, 31 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you.

 &HT;    A light-as-gossamer Hollywood `Kiss'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' is a flirty little film that's
about as substantial as a vacation fling. It has a good heart and
an appealing manner, but there's no staying power.
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Sean P. Hayes) is a movie-struck photographer from the
Midwest who has recently moved to Los Angeles. But, as he points
out in his droll introduction, all anyone notices about him is that
he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Billy is also a romantic, still looking for that special guy. He
thinks he's found him when, one day in a coffee shop, he meets a
young waiter named Gabriel (Brad Rowe, a gorgeous-boy blend of Brad
Pitt and Rob Lowe circa 1985).
</P>
<P>
   But is he or isn't he? Gay, that is. Gabriel keeps talking about
his girlfriend back in San Francisco and doesn't seem to have, as
Billy puts it, ``the show-tune gene.'' But as Billy's friend Perry
(Richard Ganoung) says, ``He talks straight, but every once in a
while, you get a vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A vibe,'' it seems, is all Billy can get as hunky Gabriel
keeps himself tantalizingly available without ever committing to a
real relationship or admitting his true sexual orientation. Things
come to a head when Gabriel is hired for a swimsuit shoot on
Catalina Island by a famous _ and flaming _ fashion photographer
(Paul Bartel) and Billy can't keep himself from checking up on his
new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Tommy O'Haver calls his movie ``a trifle,'' the
way Spike Lee calls his films ``a joint.'' True enough. ``Billy's''
is a flyweight at best. More problematical, it's all too familiar.
We've seen Billy before in too many gay romantic comedies: the
lovelorn nice guy who's more cute than drop-dead good-looking and
who inevitably falls for some seemingly unattainable hunk.
</P>
<P>
   The title comes from Billy's proposed photo series in which gay
men re-create famous clinches from the movies. For instance,
Gabriel and former Andy Warhol stalwart Holly Woodlawn imitate Burt
Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach in ``From Here to
Eternity.'' There're also several movie-themed fantasy sequences
featuring an overacting trio of lip-syncing drag queens.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is all very ``like me! like me!'' And pastel-themed.
And unthreatening. And instantly disposable. ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean P. Hayes. Directed by Tommy O'Haver. Rated R for
language, sex and drug references. At Phipps. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Harmless, mildly enjoyable and instantly
disposable.

 &HT;    Grab-bag `Governess' takes the wrong road
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing that's truly kosher in ``The Governess'' is its
heroine. And that's just because she's a 19th-century Jew.
</P>
<P>
   This mixed-up movie attempts to deliver a treatise on religious
intolerance and a dollop of feminism within the context of a
fevered bodice-ripper. Nice try, but on the whole, the thing
doesn't hold together.
</P>
<P>
   Minnie Driver stars as Rosina da Silva, who lives in 1840s
London. When her father is murdered, the family is plunged into
debt. Rather than go through with an arranged marriage to a wealthy
but elderly fishmonger, Rosina decides to take the high road. To
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get a job, she must hide her true heritage. In the
film's wittiest scene, she gives herself a good Christian name,
Mary Blackchurch. She then accepts a position as a governess with a
wealthy family, the Cavendishes, who live on a remote island.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the elements are in place for a fascinating
fish-out-of-water story. How will this Jewish girl from the city
cope with a situation that's not only foreign to her (everything
from ham for dinner to Sunday church), but could have serious
consequences should she be discovered?
</P>
<P>
   Instead and unfortunately, writer-director Sandra Goldbacher
chooses to explore Rosina's growing interest in Mr. Cavendish (Tom
Wilkinson), a self-absorbed pioneer in the early study of
photography.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's tone lurches from deadly solemn _ the Cavendishes'
offhand anti-Semitism _ to inadvertently comic. Driver acts herself
almost to death. She's clearly an ambitious performer, and this is
her first real lead since her breakthrough film, ``Circle of
Friends.'' But she approaches her not entirely sympathetic
character with a blinkered brio that's ultimately off-putting. She
doesn't capture Rosina/Mary so much as circle and enshrine her.
Plus, for every compelling scene, there are half a dozen that don't
work.
</P>
<P>
   What's left is an over-busy film with under-realized potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Governess''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Minnie Driver. Directed by Sandra Goldbacher. Rated R
for sexual scenes and nudity. At Garden Hills. 1 hour, 54 minutes.
</P>

 &HT;    Lots of trouble in `Paradise' has lots of trouble
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The title is just one of many things wrong with ``Return to
Paradise.'' It suggests the further adventures of Brooke Shields
(``The Blue Lagoon'') or Phoebe Cates (``Paradise,'' a ``Blue
Lagoon'' clone) when, in fact, this is a remake of a French drama,
``Force Majeure.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture begins with three Americans _ Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad) and Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) _ partying
hard in Malaysia, ``a paradise of rum, girls and good cheap hash.''
</P>
<P>
   But beware with whom you party. Or, more to the point, where.
After five weeks, Sheriff and Tony go home, while Lewis _ described
by Sheriff as a ``Greenpeace tree hugger'' _ stays behind,
intending to travel on to Borneo to help endangered orangutans.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Sheriff and Tony, both working in New York and
long out of touch, are surprised by visits from an earnest and
persistent lawyer, Beth (Anne Heche). She presents them with
startling news and a more startling moral dilemma. The day they
left, Lewis was arrested for trafficking drugs and has been in jail
in Penang ever since. In eight days, he will be executed.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, his traveling companions return to Malaysia and
share the blame, thus technically reducing the amount of drugs in
his possession and no longer classifying him as a dealer. Sharing
the dope, however, also means sharing the sentence. If both go
back, it means three years apiece in prison; if only one, then six
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is a terrific, what-would-you-do premise for a picture. As
Sheriff makes clear in the opening scenes, the three aren't exactly
lifelong buddies, just ``best friends for five weeks'' in a strange
place. At the same time, how easy is it to throw away someone's
life if it is in your power to save it?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the script is so inept that the setup is all but
thrown away. The movie jerks gracelessly from one scene to the
next. Instead of focusing on the conscience-challenging decision
faced by the two men or, perhaps, on Beth's relentless campaign to
save Lewis, the emphasis shifts to a potential romance between
Sheriff and Beth, which not only seems wrongheaded but also manages
to make Vaughn and Heche, two innately appealing actors, look
stilted and foolish.
</P>
<P>
   A further conflict, in which Beth is pursued by a ruthless,
headline-hungry reporter (Jada Pinkett Smith, effective in a small
role), is introduced but never fully dealt with. Instead, it simply
becomes a plot device.
</P>
<P>
   As the wasted opportunities accumulate, the movie becomes an
exercise in frustration. Maybe they should've called it ``Return to
Scriptwriting 101.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Paradise''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. Directed by Joseph Ruben.
Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex scene.
Phipps. 1 hour, 49 minutes.

   You know you're watching a fantasy when the stunning Angela
Bassett can't believe that a young stud wants to get freaky with
her.
</P>
<P>
   This older woman/younger man dilemma is the thin premise of
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' a screen version of Terry
McMillan's novel that tries to distract us from its lack of plot
with visual opulence. It's directed by newcomer Kevin Rodney
Sullivan with the epic slickness of a two-hour commercial for
Caribbean retreats and Marin County real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that there's anything wrong with that. ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite its lavishly artificial tone, McMillan's book is based
on fact: Following a couple of deaths among friends and family, the
40-something author of ``Waiting to Exhale'' took a recuperative
trip to Jamaica and fell in love with a native in his 20s. The two
are now a couple.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens for Stella Payne (Bassett), a high-powered
Bay area investment banker who makes her clients (and herself)
rich, jogs her hard-bodied self through the park every dawn and
acts as divorced single mother to son Quincy (Michael J. Pagan).
When the kid goes away to spend two weeks with his dad, Stella lets
her workaholism slide and takes a trip to Jamaica with best pal
Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg, as zaftig and irrepressible as Bassett is
trim and serious).
</P>
<P>
   There, Stella gets pursued by a 20-year-old local named Winston
Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), a name that sounds like a marketing
character created to entice literary smokers. Actually, he's a
sweet would-be chef and med student who ups the movie's fantasy
element by being absolutely sweet, perfect and sculpted like ebony
marble.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the problem? Well, there isn't much of one, except for
that 20-year divide. The film, co-written by McMillan and
``Exhale'' screenwriter Ron Bass, squanders its chances for real
conflict. Winston's family turns out to be wealthy, so there's no
class tension for Stella to confront. Quincy pretty quickly becomes
best pals with his mom's new beau. And even Stella's ex-husband
greets the newcomer with a beer and a smile.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of any genuine drama, the movie throws in vicious
harangues from Stella's inexplicably cruel sister Angela (Suzzanne
Douglas) and goes for easy tears with the Hollywood-style death of
one character.
</P>
<P>
   What's disappointing is that material based on fact evinces
nothing of the complex emotional realities that come with
unexpected loss and love. Given Hollywood's habit of Gwyneth
Paltrow/Michael Douglas-style pairings, it's refreshing to see a
May-December romance with the woman as the older character. (And
it's Winston, not Stella, who gets the gratuitous nude shot.)
Unfortunately, ``Groove'' never wrestles with what such an age
difference might mean in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that ``Groove'' is a bust. Its conspicuous
consumption and travelogue views of Jamaica become mesmerizing in
their own right, just like the haute penthouse furnishings in ``A
Perfect Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   And, luckily, there's Bassett grounding the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. She makes you believe things are happening,
even when a scene is dead in the water. Diggs is charming as the
boy-toy, and that's all he has to be. Goldberg is in full
love-me-I'm-funny mode, so take that as a recommendation or a
warning. And Regina King gets good comic mileage as Stella's
louder, funnier other sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Angela Bassett, Whoopi Goldberg and Taye Diggs.
Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan. Rated R for sexual situations,
nudity and language. 2 hours, 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Empty eye candy grounded by the invaluable Angela
Bassett.

 &HT;    Warm reception expected for `Cold Mountain'
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending more than a year on the hardback best-seller
charts, ``Cold Mountain'' hits stores next week in paperback. The
paperback version of Charles Frazier's surprise blockbuster
(Vintage, $13), with its National Book Award Winner gold seal, is
already an advance-order hot seller. The North Carolinian's first
novel is about an injured soldier who deserts the Confederate army
and embarks on a Homeric odyssey to his love. The Los Angeles Times
called Frazier's work an ``epic sweep, a war-time love story that
refuses to give way to tired sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Other new paperbacks _ in stores now or coming soon _ include:
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Peachtree Road'' by Anne Rivers Siddons. Harper. $6.99.
It's been a decade since Siddons published the story of the
Bondurant cousins who grew up in a sprawling home on the city's
most famous street. On the cover of the 10th anniversary edition,
author Pat Conroy hails it as ``the Southern novel for our
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Violin'' by Anne Rice. Ballantine. $14. A New Orleans widow
is visited by a violin-playing ghost who whisks her into the 19th
century and madness. Many reviewers found the novel messy,
melodramatic and far below Rice's norm. Fans may not care.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Handmaid of Desire'' by John L'Heureux. Soho. $12.
L'Heureux's witty satire about an English department at a
prestigious West Coast university features battles between the
theorists and the ``fools'' who actually read literature. Our AJC
reviewer found the tale was ``told with splenetic gusto.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Ocean of Words'' by Ha Jin. Vintage. $12. This short-story
collection written by an Emory professor, which earned a
PEN/Hemingway Award, focuses on Chinese soldiers on the
Soviet-China border in the 1970s. Atlanta author Jim Grimsley calls
the work powerful and praises the simple, elegant storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Timequake'' by Kurt Vonnegut. Berkeley $13. A timequake
forces everyone to relive the 1990s in Vonnegut's first full-length
fiction in seven years. The AJC reviewer described it as ``part
autobiography, part meditation, part satire,'' and found that
although it's not Vonnegut's best work, it offers pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Dreams of My Russian Summers'' by Andrei Makine. Scribner.
$12. This fine coming-of-age tale about a Russian boy in the 1960s
and '70s won the Prix Medicis and Prix Goncourt and was named one
of the AJC's 10 best books of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Reign in Hell'' by William Diehl. Ballantine. $6.99. Martin
Vail takes on the right-wing militia. Some reviewers thought this
book even better than his ``Primal Fear.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Foggy Mountain Breakdown'' by Sharyn McCrumb. Ballantine.
$6.99. Kirkus Reviews describes this as a ``whimsically diverse ...
sketchbook of two dozen tales exploring the quicksilver border
between mystery and magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction
</P>
<P>
   -- ``The Dark Side of Camelot'' by Seymour M. Hersh. Back
Bay/Little, Brown. $15. This controversial account of the sexual
and political exploits of the Kennedy administration may provide
ironic counterpoint to present D.C. doings. The New York Times
noted that one may quarrel with Hersh's judgments, ``but the man is
a great investigative reporter, no lie.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``T. rex and the Crater of Doom'' by Walter Alvarez. Vintage.
$13. Alvarez made news last year when he concluded that a giant
asteroid, hitting the Earth with the force of 100 million hydrogen
bombs, triggered the demise of T. rex. Reviewers praised the book's
readability and documentation.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Promiscuities: The Secret Struggle for Womanhood'' by Naomi
Wolf. Fawcett. $13.95. A candid exploration of women's sexual
coming of age and of the conflicting messages _ past and present _
directed at young women. The San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle
called this a ``pioneering work.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Napoleon Bonaparte'' by Alan Schom. Harper Perennial. $20.
This scholarly, giant-size, one-volume biography of the famous
general was declared ``a rip-roaring yarn'' by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Inventing Mark Twain: The Lives of Samuel Langhorne
Clemens'' by Andrew Hoffman. Quill. $16. Our AJC reviewer found
this biography to be ``an intelligent tour through the adventurous
life _ and two-sided psyche _ of an American original.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``To 'Joy My Freedom: Southern Black Women's Lives and Labors
After the Civil War'' by Tera. W. Hunter. Harvard. $15.95. When the
author, a history professor, found an account of the 1881 strike by
black Atlanta washerwomen, it inspired a full-length study that the
AJC reviewer called ``a brilliant reconstruction of New South
history.''

 &HT;    `Stella' creates a groovy kind of love fantasy for moms
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If The Parent Trap can be called a fantasy film for the children
of divorce, then How Stella Got Her Groove Back stands as a fantasy
film for their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, based on the best-selling novel by Terry McMillan, is
a fortysomething mom's dream, where the best friend is a
rollicking, supportive Whoopi Goldberg, the 11-year-old son is
mature and understanding, the body is lean and the bank account
full. Even Stella Payne's ex-husband turns out to be a pretty nice
guy, admitting for the record that even though Stella always thinks
she's right, she usually is.
</P>
<P>
   All that and Jamaica, too, make for a pretty pleasurable time
spent in the company of Stella, played by the ever-impressive
Angela Bassett, and her cohorts as she struggles with a ``problem''
of the heart. Oh, that we should all have such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Stella is a hard-working investment adviser, making millions for
her already-rich clients while not doing badly for herself. She
lives with her son, Quincy (Michael J. Pagan), in a designer house
in the hills of San Francisco. When Quincy heads off on a two-week
visit with his dad, he tells Mom to try to have some fun. Little
does he know.
</P>
<P>
   A spur-of-the-moment trip to Jamaica with best friend Delilah
(Goldberg) lands Stella right in Cupid's sightline. He shoots, he
scores, and Stella is off on a one-week fling (she thinks) with the
poster child for everything a woman would ever ever ever want in a
man.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs) and he says all the
right things at all the right times. Trouble is, he's 20, she's 40.
</P>
<P>
   Age is a problem for Stella, but so is Shakespeare's job and his
mother (who's 41). Stella and Winston spend the movie sorting
things out, riding the waves of a rocky romance held together by
the superglue called chemistry. Believe it, because McMillan's life
story proves that it can happen. Her book was fiction, based on
fact (true, she says, ``in essence but not in particular''), and
from all reports she's still with the guy.
</P>
<P>
   As good as Bassett is, her Stella is not all that fascinating.
She's a drudge, in fact, kept afloat by her relationship with
Delilah and coming to life only when she's messing around with her
sisters, smart-mouthed Vanessa (Regina King) and perfectionist
Angela (Suzzanne Douglas). King, like Goldberg, steals the too-few
scenes she's in, but both of them give the movie a lift.
</P>
<P>
   As for Diggs, there's not much to say. He's perfect, very
convincing as a beautiful young man because he is a beautiful young
man, and he says the nice dialogue with a nice Jamaican accent
(he's from the East Coast). He's the heart of the movie, and one
misstep could have sent everything tumbling down. But he's careful
and very controlled. No worries _ major star in the making (it's
his first feature film).
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back sets itself in nice contrast to
another film based on a book of McMillan's. Waiting to Exhale was
the story of four black women and their wide range of problems with
men who, for the most part, were big disappointments. It was also a
blockbuster, widely hailed for its statement about sisterhood and
widely criticized for its male-bashing sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Stella doesn't have a problem with men, not a bit. (There is a
complaint about taking out the trash, but, hey . . .) Feminists may
flinch, but love has made the world go 'round for a long, long
time. Without it, the groove is gone, face it. And, sure, life can
be lived without a groove, but when Stella gets hers back, it's
time for a celebration. Stella isn't afraid to give us one

 &HT;    No reason to race out with the kids to catch `Golden Receiver'
Rate it ``D'' _ for dog.
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough enough being a parent these days without having to
endure agonizingly bad family films such as Air Bud: Golden
Receiver .
</P>
<P>
   Young children will enjoy the sequel to the 1997 hit about a
basketball-playing pooch, but they're an easily satisfied audience.
Put a cute doggie in a football uniform and you've got yourself a
happy little kids' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Adults, on the other hand, will want to flip a coin to see who
has the misfortune of spending a very long 90 minutes watching it
with the kids.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Buddy the Golden Retriever hits the gridiron
as the star receiver of a hopeless junior high school football
team. In the tradition of every sports comedy from the Bad News
Bears to Major League , the squad miraculously becomes a
state-championship contender. But that's only one of countless
movie cliches trotted out for unsuspecting young viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy's owner, Josh Framm (Kevin Zegers), is threatened by his
widowed mother's budding relationship with the town's handsome
veterinarian, Patrick Sullivan (Gregory Harrison). Jackie (Cynthia
Stevenson) is pulled into the vet's arms by Buddy while in-line
skating, a la 101 Dalmatians .
</P>
<P>
   The sappy, predictable drama is worse than some hackneyed
after-school special, which probably would have better production
values than this cheaply made knockoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Golden Retriever who inspired Air Bud died last year
of cancer. Here he's replaced by six dogs, two of which also
appeared in the original film.
</P>
<P>
   Slapstick comic relief is provided by a pair of bumbling Russian
circus owners _ clearly patterned after Rocky and Bullwinkle 's
Boris and Natasha _ who attempt to steal Josh's ``amazing'' dog.
</P>
<P>
   A canine shooting hoops with his nose, as the original Buddy
did, is impressive. But catching a ball and running with it is
pretty much what dogs do best. Can't wait for the next movie, in
which Buddy fetches a stick
</P>

   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver''

<P>
   Grade: D

 &HT;    `Return to Paradise' a loss; Provocative premise falls victim to
formula in dull drama
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   How far would you go for a friend? That's the intriguing premise
of Return to Paradise , a Hollywood remake of the 1990 French film,
Force Majeure .
</P>
<P>
   Three college grads meet on a hedonistic tour of Asia, which
culminates in a reckless spree of hashish and whores in Penang,
Malaysia. Two of the newfound friends, Sheriff (Vince Vaughn) and
Tony (David Conrad), return to New York City, while their
tree-hugging compadre, Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix), stays behind to
help save endangered orangutans.
</P>
<P>
   Leap ahead two years, when a lawyer appears to inform Sheriff
and Tony that Lewis, having been caught with the large quantity of
hash they left behind, has spent the past 24 months in prison.
Unless they return to Penang to share responsibility, Lewis will
hang as a drug trafficker in eight days.
</P>
<P>
   Their moral dilemma, combined with the ordeal of their
imprisoned friend, could have made for a '90s version of Midnight
Express , the harrowing 1978 film about a young U.S. drug smuggler
brutalized in a Turkish prison. Instead, the formulaic drama is
dull and uninvolving.
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise centers on Sheriff _ the nickname of
self-described Brooklyn bum John Volgecherev _ a hustling limo
driver and the most irresponsible of the lot. If Sheriff and Tony
both go back to Penang, they each face three years in prison. But
if only one volunteers, he must serve six. Tony, a nondescript
straight arrow, will do the right thing, despite his career and
beautiful fiancee (Vera Farmiga).
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff, on the other hand, ``doesn't have it in him.'' So it's
up to the persistent attorney, Beth (Anne Heche), to persuade him
to make the honorable choice. His decision is inevitable _
otherwise, there wouldn't be much of a movie _ but not without lots
of tiresome agonizing in various New York restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Director Joseph Ruben ( Sleeping With the Enemy ) draws little
emotion from what should be an intense situation. The drama is as
drab as the film's muted tones, and the pacing is unbelievably
slow. Worse still, screenwriters Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson
tack on a forced and improbable romance between Sheriff and Beth.
It's about as credible as Jada Pinkett Smith's conniving tabloid
reporter, M.J. Major.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Lewis is almost an afterthought, seen only in a handful of
blackout scenes at the grungy but hardly horrific prison, where he
initially appears to be the only inmate. Perhaps the producers were
worried about offending viewers in the large and lucrative Asian
market.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben eventually ratchets up the tension level as Sheriff
embarks on his road to redemption. The story delivers several
surprising and effective twists, along with a pious anti-drug
screed. There's also a veiled reference to former Kettering
resident Michael Fay, who was caned for vandalizing cars in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, whose father graduated from the University of Dayton,
gives a tremendous performance, redeeming the film, as well as his
character. The tall, handsome actor burst to stardom as the
ultracool ladies' man, Trent, in Swingers and also appeared in The
Lost World: Jurassic Park . Here, he strongly conveys Sheriff's
soulful inner conflict, lending him enough humor and charm to make
the morally indifferent character likable.
</P>
<P>
   The same can't be said for Ruben's drama, which fails to return
on its provocative premise

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FIGHTING TERRORISM UNDER THE OLD CODE
 &HT;    With photo mug of Glass available on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (k) Commentary
categories for use Sunday, Aug. 16 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the outermost ring of the Pentagon, plans are
being drawn for a retaliatory strike against the terrorist bombers
who blew up the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, President Clinton must sign off on any use of force.
In ordering such an attack, Clinton must bear in mind today's
complex geopolitical climate. He must offer explicit proof of the
perpetrators' responsibility to the American public and to the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for U.S. intelligence agencies to link the
carnage in East Africa to Osama bin Laden, the shadowy Saudi figure
who acts as the godfather of a network of radicals who have vowed
vengeance against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it's quite another to commit the Pentagon's directorate for
Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflicts (SOLIC) to a
military assault against bin Laden's terrorist bases in Afghanistan
and the Sudan. Even if a SOLIC raid achieved its immediate tactical
goals, long-term U.S. strategic interests could be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   One option under official review would sub-contract this
anti-terrorist task to interested and competent parties in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In rapidly dispatching their ace military rescue crews to
Nairobi, the Israelis no doubt also gathered some intelligence on
their own. But their primary motive was to repay a favor, which is
a basic, if often overlooked, element of statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   A big debt was incurred in 1976, when Kenya served as a
logistical base for Israel's successful raid on Uganda's Entebbe
Airport, rescuing the passengers on an Air France flight which had
been hijacked by Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, William Buckley, then the CIA station chief
in Lebanon, was close to tracking down the masterminds behind the
suicide assault against the Marines in Beirut, which with one blow
killed about 10 percent of the U.S. forces in that country. But the
pursued became the pursuers and kidnapped Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan thereupon asked Israel for aid. Israeli
leaders, mindful that Reagan had personally intervened to permit
stranded Ethiopian Jews to be flown out of the Sudan, agreed to
help.
</P>
<P>
   In that notorious instance, things didn't work out. Eventually,
Buckley was tortured and killed. And the Iranian connection which
the Israelis activated for Washington led eventually to scandalous
dealings in White House. But the age-old code of nations quietly
trading favors had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are quite capable of making operational blunders of
their own, like the one that led to Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin now being free in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in undertaking the kind of nasty work that needs to done,
Jerusalem can muster more operational flexibility than Washington
can. And the Israelis are probably better able to cope with the
next threatened cycle of revenge if, and when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   What's the chief downside to making an anti-terrorist deal? In
succeeding, the Israelis would undoubtedly ask for favors in
return. Yet, with such high stakes, Clinton could do worse than to
have his Pentagon planners stand down while calling instead on
outside experts to do the job at hand.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FIGHTING TERRORISM UNDER THE OLD CODE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the outermost ring of the Pentagon, plans are
being drawn for a retaliatory strike against the terrorist bombers
who blew up the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, President Clinton must sign off on any use of force.
In ordering such an attack, Clinton must bear in mind today's
complex geopolitical climate. He must offer explicit proof of the
perpetrators' responsibility to the American public and to the
world at large.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing for U.S. intelligence agencies to link the
carnage in East Africa to Osama bin Laden, the shadowy Saudi figure
who acts as the godfather of a network of radicals who have vowed
vengeance against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it's quite another to commit the Pentagon's directorate for
Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflicts (SOLIC) to a
military assault against bin Laden's terrorist bases in Afghanistan
and the Sudan. Even if a SOLIC raid achieved its immediate tactical
goals, long-term U.S. strategic interests could be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   One option under official review would sub-contract this
anti-terrorist task to interested and competent parties in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In rapidly dispatching their ace military rescue crews to
Nairobi, the Israelis no doubt also gathered some intelligence on
their own. But their primary motive was to repay a favor, which is
a basic, if often overlooked, element of statecraft.
</P>
<P>
   A big debt was incurred in 1976, when Kenya served as a
logistical base for Israel's successful raid on Uganda's Entebbe
Airport, rescuing the passengers on an Air France flight which had
been hijacked by Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, William Buckley, then the CIA station chief
in Lebanon, was close to tracking down the masterminds behind the
suicide assault against the Marines in Beirut, which with one blow
killed about 10 percent of the U.S. forces in that country. But the
pursued became the pursuers and kidnapped Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   President Reagan thereupon asked Israel for aid. Israeli
leaders, mindful that Reagan had personally intervened to permit
stranded Ethiopian Jews to be flown out of the Sudan, agreed to
help.
</P>
<P>
   In that notorious instance, things didn't work out. Eventually,
Buckley was tortured and killed. And the Iranian connection which
the Israelis activated for Washington led eventually to scandalous
dealings in White House. But the age-old code of nations quietly
trading favors had been followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis are quite capable of making operational blunders of
their own, like the one that led to Hamas spiritual leader Sheik
Ahmed Yassin now being free in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in undertaking the kind of nasty work that needs to done,
Jerusalem can muster more operational flexibility than Washington
can. And the Israelis are probably better able to cope with the
next threatened cycle of revenge if, and when it comes.
</P>
<P>
   What's the chief downside to making an anti-terrorist deal? In
succeeding, the Israelis would undoubtedly ask for favors in
return. Yet, with such high stakes, Clinton could do worse than to
have his Pentagon planners stand down while calling instead on
outside experts to do the job at hand.

 With color slides and black and white photos of Jason Patric in
``Your Friends and Neighbors.'' 
 (EDS.: Nastassja Kinski is cq) 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features  
 &HT;    He ran off to Ireland with Julia Roberts to comfort her just a
couple of days after she dumped fiancee Kiefer Sutherland on the
eve of their wedding. He has squired beautiful women like Robin
Wright (Sean Penn's wife) and Isabelle Adjani, and his current
girlfriend is Maybelline supermodel Christy Turlington.
 &HT;    So it would seem ideal that Jason Patric should play a womanizer
in his controversial new movie ``Your Friends and Neighbors''
(opening Aug. 19 in New York and Los Angeles and elsewhere on Aug.
28 and Sept. 4).
 &HT;    In the movie Jason's character Cary is a superbly buffed sexual
athlete who sees himself as a love machine, bedding women as a pure
athletic endeavour or in revenge for injustices he feels women have
done him.
 &HT;    He's a nasty, narcissistic meanie _ and it's a role that Patric,
who also produced the film, carefully picked for himself. Dressed
in black from shirt to shoes, the handsome actor sits in a hotel
suite in Beverly Hills and makes no apologies for stepping into
such a nasty role.
 &HT;    ``I've played dark and edgy characters before, but never this
dark or edgy. The scary thing about this guy and the thing that
drew me to him is that he has an explanation or justification for
everything he does. And he seems to have no remorse ... I think
that's chilling because as awful as it may be sometimes, it's
fascinating to watch.''
 &HT;    Patric sees the movie, a morality tale about three guys and the
women in their lives, as wickedly funny because he says he and
others have been there. ``The situations are all ones that we think
of, or that we've been involved in. You're laughing, which is a
reflexive response, but you're also forced to breathe in the brutal
reality of what you're watching.''
 &HT;    The ensemble piece is from writer-director Neil LaBute and the
dysfunctional characters are played by Amy Brenneman, Ben Stiller,
Nastassja Kinski, Catherine Keener and Aaron Eckhart. Eckhart last
appeared in LaBute's controversial film ``In the Company of Men,''
about two nasty businessmen who _ on a bet _ seduce a beautiful
deaf secretary.
 &HT;    In ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' the men swap the woman, and
one woman swaps her man for another woman. But Cary is the most
diabolical of the lot. And as for Patric's ``we've all been there''
line, how many people do you know who practice their sexual
dialogue into a tape recorder while pumping iron?
 &HT;    Yet Patric says he didn't have such a hard time stepping into
the skin of the despicable Cary. ``You have to find those dark
places in yourself,'' he says. ``I've been in relationships where
I've wanted to strangle the other person for some reason. I've
wanted to shoot people for cutting me off on the freeway ... Actors
are fortunate because playing dark characters allows us to free
those hidden emotions.''
 &HT;    Until fairly recently Patric says he avoided starring in
mainstream movies because he wanted to make films that meant
something to him personally.
 &HT;    The grandson of the late comedian Jackie Gleason, and son of
playwright-actor Jason Miller, Patric has worked mostly in
uncommercial films like ``Geronimo: An American Legend'' (1993),
``Rush'' (1991), ``After Dark My Sweet'' (1990) and ``Sleepers''
(1996).
 &HT;    Two years ago he decided to try for a wider audience and agreed
to step into the sequel to ``Speed'' _ ``Speed 2: Cruise Control''
_ opposite Sandra Bullock, when Keanu Reeves turned it down. The
picture was overpriced and a resounding box office flop.
 &HT;    It didn't do much for his reputation but he doesn't regret
taking the big paycheck.
 &HT;    ``I had been offered many 'Speed 2's' in my life and I turned
them all down,'' he says. ``Then at this point in my career I
realised a I needed a mainstream movie to give me the clout to get
the movies I really wanted to be in. That meant I had to be visible
in the global marketplace. And there was no question that film made
me visible _ maybe all for the wrong reasons. But it worked. I was
able to get the $7 million I needed to make 'Your Friends and
Neighbors.'''
 &HT;    Patric is one of those actors who is as handsome off-screen as
movie stars are supposed to be and so seldom are. It's not
something he particularly wants to talk about, however.
 &HT;    It makes him ``uncomfortable,'' he says, when actors are defined
by their looks. ``I'd rather not talk about it or consider it. But
the truth is beautiful people have an advantage in this world
because we want to like them. A beautiful girl can get away with
murder in a relationship based solely on her looks,'' says the man
who has dated his share of gorgeous ladies and should know what
he's talking about.
 &HT;    ``We have certain expectations based on the way a person looks
and when we discover that's not who they are under the surface we
become disappointed and angry.''
 &HT;    While still not considered an A-list box office draw like Tom
Cruise, Brad Pitt or Leonardo DiCaprio, Patric feels being in
charge of his own life and work provides greater satisfaction.
 &HT;    Through his recently formed Fleece Productions he has two
projects in the works _ neither of them blockbuster material. The
first is ``The Gipp,'' which could team him with director Francis
Ford Coppola in a story about Notre Dame football great George
Gipp. There's also ``1066,'' an historical film about the Battle of
Hastings, the decisive victory in the Norman conquest of England.
 &HT;    Patric believes he did his best work in the early '90s, and he
fervently hopes those best days aren't behind him. ``I was given
such great material. Now at 32 I like the idea that I was really a
brazen actor in my early 20s. I only wish I'd done more films. Now
I have to really search for the material.''

 &HT;    If you thought TV had gone as low as it could go with prime-time
nudity, ubiquitous coarse language and graphic violence, perhaps
you haven't heard about CBS' new degradation of America, ''The
Howard Stern Show.'' It is scheduled to begin later this month on
Saturday nights at 11:30 p.m.
 &HT;    ''We'll have a lot of nudity and lesbians,'' Stern promised.
''We plan to have a lot of drunken dwarfs on the show....
Television is ready for someone like me. Standards have gone to an
all-time low, and I'm here to represent the change.''
 &HT;    Howard Stern has a daily five-hour radio show aired in 49 major
markets, but also in smaller places such as Fresno, Calif; York,
Pa., and Panama City, Fla. Its crudity and coarseness is difficult
to describe in a family newspaper in a column like this.
 &HT;    Before illustrating what we can expect to see on CBS, based on
what has been on his radio show, I am pleased to report that the
American Family Association has successfully persuaded 3,100 of
Stern's 3,900 radio advertisers across the nation to cancel their
ads.
 &HT;    The depravity of Howard Stern can be fought and defeated if the
good people in this land express their outrage to local CBS
affiliates and to the Stern sponsors.
 &HT;    Don Wildmon, president of the AFA, says that Stern ''is to radio
what Larry Flynt is to porn magazines. In all our years of
monitoring entertainment programs, American Family Association has
never encountered a more raunchy, despicable, degenerate
entertainment than that of Howard Stern.''
 &HT;    For example, in one show Stern describes a porno star with
enlarged breasts due to implants, who strips in his radio studio
and gives a nude massage to another female.
 &HT;    I heard a program in which a man who works in a mortuary called
in to describe having sex with a corpse. ''Did you kiss her?''
asked Stern. ''Did you go to the funeral?''
 &HT;    This week there was a contest to see who had the largest male
member. In another contest, obese women stripped and described
their bodies, in hopes that a plastic surgeon would do a makeover
with liposuction.
 &HT;    Several retarded men served as judges as Stern made jokes about
these sad creatures.
 &HT;    This kind of programming appeals to some men of all classes who
find it amusing. Stern often tops the ratings in local markets.
That makes it a magnet for advertisers of products that men buy --
beer, computers, cars.
 &HT;    AFA's surprisingly successful strategy to fight this trash is
led by Bill Johnson, AFA's Michigan director. He buys tapes of
Stern's show in 20 cities and has part-time staffers listen and
record the advertisers.
 &HT;    Johnson then sends a polite letter with brief descriptions of
the shows, and asks advertisers to cease advertising on them. If
monitoring does not reveal an advertiser has quit, Johnson sends a
second or even third follow-up letter.
 &HT;    In Grand Rapids, where the campaign began, 374 advertisers out
of 401 have yanked their ads. In Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
three-fourths of advertisers have quit.
 &HT;    ''Howard Stern worked for us in Minneapolis,'' Paris Burrell
told me. His firm, Empire Glass, which replaces car windshields,
got 30-40 more calls a week. ''My job is to make those phones
ring.''
 &HT;    But his boss, Richard Chance, a committed Christian, was
convinced by the second letter. ''He felt it was like God talking
to him. We will never be on the Howard Stern show.''
 &HT;    Among national advertisers who have ignored the pleas are
Budweiser, Dunkin' Donuts, Aamco Transmissions and Erols. But Coors
Beer, RC Cola and America Online did quit.
 &HT;    Radio stations typically sign two-year contracts with Stern.
That means if nine of out ten advertisers quit, the station loses
lots of money.
 &HT;    Let's help CBS avoid such a problem. I urge readers to see if
their CBS outlet plans to carry the shock jock. If so, form a
committee to plead for decency with the station manager. And send a
check to AFA, PO Box 202 Fremont, MI 49412.

monitoring does not reveal an advertiser has quit, Johnson sends a
second or even third follow-up letter.
 &HT;    In Grand Rapids, where the campaign began, 374 advertisers out
of 401 have yanked their ads. In Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
three-fourths of advertisers have quit.

CBS DEGRADES AMERICA WITH `HOWARD STERN' AND HIS DRUNKEN DWARFS

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    If you thought TV had gone as low as it could go with prime-time
nudity, ubiquitous coarse language and graphic violence, perhaps
you haven't heard about CBS' new degradation of America, ''The
Howard Stern Show.'' It is scheduled to begin later this month on
Saturday nights at 11:30 p.m.
 &HT;    ''We'll have a lot of nudity and lesbians,'' Stern promised.
''We plan to have a lot of drunken dwarfs on the show....
Television is ready for someone like me. Standards have gone to an
all-time low, and I'm here to represent the change.''
 &HT;    Howard Stern has a daily five-hour radio show aired in 49 major
markets, but also in smaller places such as Fresno, Calif; York,
Pa., and Panama City, Fla. Its crudity and coarseness is difficult
to describe in a family newspaper in a column like this.
 &HT;    Before illustrating what we can expect to see on CBS, based on
what has been on his radio show, I am pleased to report that the
American Family Association has successfully persuaded 3,100 of
Stern's 3,900 radio advertisers across the nation to cancel their
ads.
 &HT;    The depravity of Howard Stern can be fought and defeated if the
good people in this land express their outrage to local CBS
affiliates and to the Stern sponsors.
 &HT;    Don Wildmon, president of the AFA, says that Stern ''is to radio
what Larry Flynt is to porn magazines. In all our years of
monitoring entertainment programs, American Family Association has
never encountered a more raunchy, despicable, degenerate
entertainment than that of Howard Stern.''
 &HT;    For example, in one show Stern describes a porno star with
enlarged breasts due to implants, who strips in his radio studio
and gives a nude massage to another female.
 &HT;    I heard a program in which a man who works in a mortuary called
in to describe having sex with a corpse. ''Did you kiss her?''
asked Stern. ''Did you go to the funeral?''
 &HT;    This week there was a contest to see who had the largest male
member. In another contest, obese women stripped and described
their bodies, in hopes that a plastic surgeon would do a makeover
with liposuction.
 &HT;    Several retarded men served as judges as Stern made jokes about
these sad creatures.
 &HT;    This kind of programming appeals to some men of all classes who
find it amusing. Stern often tops the ratings in local markets.
That makes it a magnet for advertisers of products that men buy --
beer, computers, cars.
 &HT;    AFA's surprisingly successful strategy to fight this trash is
led by Bill Johnson, AFA's Michigan director. He buys tapes of
Stern's show in 20 cities and has part-time staffers listen and
record the advertisers.
 &HT;    Johnson then sends a polite letter with brief descriptions of
the shows, and asks advertisers to cease advertising on them. If
monitoring does not reveal an advertiser has quit, Johnson sends a
second or even third follow-up letter.
 &HT;    In Grand Rapids, where the campaign began, 374 advertisers out
of 401 have yanked their ads. In Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
three-fourths of advertisers have quit.
 &HT;    ''Howard Stern worked for us in Minneapolis,'' Paris Burrell
told me. His firm, Empire Glass, which replaces car windshields,
got 30-40 more calls a week. ''My job is to make those phones
ring.''
 &HT;    But his boss, Richard Chance, a committed Christian, was

 &HT;    Among national advertisers who have ignored the pleas are

 &HT;    Radio stations typically sign two-year contracts with Stern.
That means if nine of out ten advertisers quit, the station loses
lots of money.

TO MOSCOW WITH LOVE: THE STONES STORM RUSSIAN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ ``How are you going to satisfy the 30-year hunger of
your Russian fans by giving just one concert in Moscow?''
</P>
<P>
   The Rolling Stones were asked at their Moscow press conference
in the Hotel Baltschug Kempinski on the bank of the Moska River.
Across the way, the turbanesque onion-tops of St. Basil's Cathedral
swirled toward the gathering rain clouds over Red Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nibble. It's a start,'' Mick Jagger swiftly fielded the
question, acting consummately as spokesperson for the band. ``We're
very, very excited. When we first tried to play in Russia in 1967,
someone had seen us in Poland and thought our show as too awful and
too decadent for Moscow. We tried to get in, but Madame Furzieva,
the iron-willed minister of culture, said, `No!' (Nyet!).''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Soviet regime in those days didn't want rock bands at
all!'' ``Things have changed,'' Mick Jagger pointed out, radiating
his customary jolly good spirits. ``We hope it will be a wonderful
show for us and everybody else. We're thankful to be here at
last!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are your impressions of Russia and its people? And what
about the women?'' a woman journalist shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Ever the artful diplomat, Jagger, 55, considered and said: ``I
think we're impressed with the grandeur of Moscow, and the warmth
... and the beauty of the men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rolling Stones are giving a concert in Moscow? How
exciting! I didn't even know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Had I stumbled into the Moscow Central police station, or a
stadium show by the Rolling Stones? Squads of police in black
leather jackets, matching berets and combat boots were on hand to
ensure that things did not get out of control. It seemed like a
state of siege.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night inside Luzhniki Stadium, site of the
U.S.-boycotted 1980 Summer Olympics, we encountered police
checkpoints at practically every turn. We were frisked, asked to
show our ticket stubs again and again, and made to unzip our
purses, shoulder bags, and back packs. After the show, columns of
boyish police cadets, hooded and caped in the rainy Moscow night,
were to funnel the emerging crowds to the subway station in an
eerily efficient manner. Their stone-faced commanding mounted
officers stood ready in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rain came down in the partially domed stadium,
pelting the fans who had opted for field dancing and standing room
near the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But once the house lights went out, the formidable-looking
police presence waned as the Rolling Stones, to a chorus of
whistles, shouts, and cheers, took the stage. The Moscow fans,
fortified with giant-sized cups of draft beer, hot dogs, popcorn,
some ice-cream cones, gave the Stones an absolutely bearish
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   His fly-away locks plastered to his head in the driving rain,
Jagger &AMP; Co. played on, happy to spend the night together with
their Russian fans. The Stones belted out a barrage of their
classic songs Moscow fans had come to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paint It Black,'' in particular, seemed to go over very well
with the crowd who were swaying to the music and rollicking in a
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   When Jagger, during ``Miss You,'' proceeded to tongue his
back-up vocalist's outstretched leg, and sucked and sucked on her
wiggling big toe, Moscow went wild.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a delightful all-out performance that lasted
until just about midnight, Jagger and his eternally scrappy mates,
drenched with rain, dished out plenty themselves to their adoring
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks cackled to close the historic show, and the fans
cheered, having gotten far more than their rubles' worth, their
faces twinkling in the rockets' red glare.

A LITTLE COMPROMISE MIGHT GO A LONG WAY

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A few socio-political topics that ought not slip
away without some reflection:
</P>
<P>
   In the Unclear on the Concept category, we have a group of
so-called conservative Roman Catholics wreaking emotional havoc at
Auschwitz in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Angry because there's a move afoot to take down a three-story
cross from this site of one of the Nazis' most notorious death
camps, the Catholics have protested by erecting more crosses. Five
went up last week to bring the total to more than 90.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal: 152 crosses to symbolize the 152 Poles who
were killed at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 152 is a lot. But compared to more than 1 million _ the
number of Jews murdered at Auschwitz _ 152 is minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the numbers, the Polish government and the Catholic
Church have wanted Auschwitz for their own. For years, they have
insisted that the site should be a memorial for Polish martyrdom or
for a generic crime against humanity. Until just a few years ago,
Pope John Paul II, a native son of Poland, backed attempts to
convert the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1995, at a commemorative ceremony for the
liberation of Auschwitz, former Polish President Lech Walesa made
an entire speech about Auschwitz's history without once referring
to the executed Jews.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, folks. Would a plaque be so bad?
</P>
<P>
   Moving on to the Ugly American category, we find the United
States' ``rescue effort'' in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists bombed our embassy there on Aug. 7, but managed to
kill far more Kenyans (more than 200) in a nearby office building
than Americans (12). As local rescuers worked against the clock to
find Kenyan survivors, what were Americans doing to help?
</P>
<P>
   According to angry Kenyans, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Excuses offered by the State Department were: (1) Available
personnel are few and stretched, and (2) U.S. Marines on site must
be used to secure the crime area for an FBI investigation.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Kenyans are wondering when the U.S. government ever let
a shortage of resources stop it from getting something it wants. No
doubt they can imagine how different the scene would be if the
office building had been a school for American children.
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop is at the Why Politics is a Drag category.
Specifically, the California governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   After vowing not to engage in mud-slinging _ and particularly
not to criticize one another's military record _ Gray Davis and Dan
Lungren have begun to crack. Lungren, a Republican, supposedly took
a jocular swipe at Vietnam vet Davis, the Democrat, by alleging
that Davis had joined the Army to make money. At an Oakland
fund-raiser, Davis reportedly referred ``in jest'' to the
medically-deferred Lungren as ``that draft-dodger.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than endure this sort of penny-ante sniping until
November, what do you say Davis and Lungren agree to a
one-time-only, name-calling free-for-all? It could be telecast
after 10 p.m., so both gents could really let fly.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-abortion Lungren could realize his fantasy and call the
pro-choice Davis a ``baby killer.'' Davis could retaliate by
calling Lungren a ``sexist womb Nazi.'' Then Davis could make fun
of Lungren's seriously receding hair line, and Lungren could
counter with how the almost opalescent Davis looks like he lost a
15-rounder to Dracula.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with facts provided by their staffs, the two could take
cheap shots at one another's parents, wives, kids and close pals,
then criticize each other's table manners, carpentry skills,
dancing acumen and choice of leisure wear.
</P>
<P>
   The session could end with the two men repairing to a large
restroom on whose floor a measured grid was painted. There they'd
engage in the juvenile activity for which 98 percent of political
bickering is just a substitute anyway.
</P>
<P>

FASHION (AND COMFORT) FROM THE GROUND UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It must be the generational difference. But
Daniela Faggioli's 18-year-old debutante daughter, Max Boyer, loved
the white rubber-trimmed anthracite sneaks that Giorgio Armani was
showing with his Emporio line. Daniela hated it. ``Why sabotage a
good look?'' she asked. Why indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The Emporio Armani show was a casual affair, a relaxed luncheon
in one of the private spaces at Le Colonial. Emporio clients who
spend $10,000 or more a year were invited as a treat and presented
with a pair of tortoise-shell sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   The women, including San Francisco 49er wives Marva Hanks and
Jackie Rice, were treated to the collection that Armani wanted to
show in Paris. The French canceled that show and Armani went on to
produce the event in New York. It is the fall Emporio line,
complete with sneaks that are worn with literally everything.
Pants. Skirts. Casual clothing. And, ohmigawd, evening dresses.
</P>
<P>
   We've known for some time that young, up-and-coming business
women are sporting athletic shoes with their career clothes and
unlike their older sisters, are not changing into pumps when they
get to work. It is a clumsy look, just as wearing tai chi shoes or
Birkenstocks with designer togs makes the wearer look like a slob.
And I'm not all that sure San Francisco's Elegances are going to
take to it. But, as Max Boyer pointed out, ``It's a generational
thing.'' Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to the clothes. Mr. Armani isn't all that big on color. And
the fall line is stocked with neutrals _ lots of gray, black and an
old gold, which is darker than camel and lighter than rust. His one
splotch of color (besides a gorgeous turquoise and gray cut-out
velvet, belted evening tunic and a trouser suit of black on green
devore velvet) is a marvelous sage or dark seafoam green which he
coupled with gray and with black in a big wooly mohair sweater or
used alone in suits that were cut along the lines of his Black
Label clothing.
</P>
<P>
   The lines are very slim; lapels teensy, rounded and buttoned up
high on the collarbone. Closings are not exactly asymmetrical but a
gentle outward, buttoned curve. Jackets are longer; pants are a
combination of flat front or pleated trousers. The feeling is very
easy, comfortable and very big city sophistication with a youthful
twist.
</P>
<P>
   For evening, Armani designed pieces to go over plain black
dresses, skirts or pants, including a beaded camisole-top
over-blouse; a bolero in the same horizontally beaded
silver-on-black pattern; a show-stopping cage of iridescent sequins
(shown over high-cut body-suit which nobody who wasn't Ashley Judd
could get away with) and the best ensemble in the show: a midnight
blue and black sequined easy jacket worn over a matching sleeveless
top, worn with black silk crepe pants. A real collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of collectibles: St. John Knits are like cashmeres. For
some people, you can never have enough. The St. John ladies all
support Marie Gray, their favorite designer, and at one of her
shows, you're liable to see women of all ages decked out in a
rainbow of boxy knits and Chanel clones _ lots of braid, white
edging around skirt and jacket bottoms and gold. Tons and tons of
gold _ buttons, sequins, beads, belts, pins.
</P>
<P>
   Gray started her company purely as a way to impress her
then-fiance. She knit a dress. Then she got a knitting machine and
made another dress. Fiance, now hubby, Bob Gray, took the dresses
to a buyer he knew who snatched them up. And a way of life was
born.
</P>
<P>
   A dedicated colorist, Gray's fall collection is a long way from
basic black. Redwood (a nice, lively rust), a deep cherry red,
interesting shades of green, from gold-flecked moss to deep
black-scarab, vibrant purples, winter whites and glitter-flecked
gold knits in evening suits and slinky long, mock-turtlenecked
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The clothes are predictable and predictably loud _ Gray must
have a lot of clients in Texas and Florida _ but when a St. John
design is on, it's really on. The big surprise was the sportwear
with a particularly adorable faux-fur chubby baseball jacket with
knit collar and cuffs and a fabulous moss green iridescent nylon
jacket worn with black slacks and a chartreuse/moss/black striped
turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   As for the evening dresses, they're getting slinkier and more
graceful without getting tighter. One stunner was a black slink of
knit with a double strap of sequined gold worn with an all-over
sequined gold jacket. Another was a nifty bit of brocaded
chinoiserie with a deep back and high, faux-turtle halter top.
</P>
<P>
   Let's talk glitter here. Gray says her price points are higher
this year ``because women want luxury,'' and she gave it to them.
Probably half the collection is geared for cocktails and evenings,
with beautifully tailored suits paged with rhinestones, sequins
and, in the case of one red and black paisley number, huge chunks
of colored jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was set off by Gray's accessory line. The shoes,
particularly, were feminine and very high.

FOR IMAC USERS, A WAIT FOR THE BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're one of the thousands planning to buy Apple Computer
Inc.'s new iMac this weekend, try not to be too disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, some of you will go home empty-handed, if the
early buzz is on the level. Apple says it's got 150,000 advance
orders already, and expects to have trouble meeting demand. But
even if you manage to get hold of an iMac, you'll have a problem
buying vital accessories like an external disk drive or a printer.
</P>
<P>
   Apple didn't include a floppy disk drive with the iMac, saying
that customers would buy external drives like the Iomega Zip
instead. But Iomega doesn't plan to have an iMac-compatible Zip
drive available until late this year. Hewlett-Packard Co. was
supposed to have an iMac printer ready to go. Not just yet, the
company told me on Tuesday, though you will be able to buy a $69
adapter that will let the iMac work with traditional printers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my penchant for sniping at Apple, I don't fault the
company for the accessories shortage. I blame the computer industry
for being so slow to take up the banner of USB.
</P>
<P>
   That's Universal Serial Bus to us English speakers. It's the
port and associated circuitry that connects an iMac to ``peripheral
devices'' like mice, printers, scanners and the like. Apple has
made much of its use of USB, but millions of PCs also have USB
ports in back. The technology has existed for years. Still, there
are few USB products for sale.
</P>
<P>
   This will soon change _ and about time too. Apple's iMac will
drive demand for USB devices. More important, Microsoft Corp. has
gotten religion. USB wouldn't work with earlier versions of
Windows. But later versions of Windows 95 include USB support; so
does every copy of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs USB? All of us, and badly. Today's computers are
saddled with outdated ways of linking to external devices. Consider
the serial ports used to hook up modems and mice. They can transmit
data no faster than 115,000 bits every second. That limits the
serial port to fairly low-speed tasks. Parallel ports are about
twice as fast, but still sluggish considering that the computer
flings around millions of bits each second.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got an Iomega Zip drive plugged into your computer's
parallel port, it runs at a fraction of its potential speed. You'd
get much better performance by installing an internal Zip drive,
linked directly to the computer's motherboard. Just rip open your
computer to install it. I bet you can hardly wait.
</P>
<P>
   There are other drawbacks with our present ports. You have to
reboot the computer before it'll accept that new mouse or modem
you've plugged in. In addition, each port accepts &UR;  &LR; just one device
at a time. You can't plug a mouse and modem into the same serial
port, for instance. And while I can run a printer and a Zip drive
on a single parallel port, I can't use them both at the same time.
The average machine has two serial ports and one parallel port. Use
them up, and you've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   USB is designed to fix all this. You can connect up to 127
devices to a single USB port. You can ``hot-swap'' USB devices,
plugging in new ones without having to reboot. And USB ports can
handle up to 12 million bits of data per second _ plenty fast
enough for external Zip drives.
</P>
<P>
   It's even fast enough for high-speed Internet devices. Order
cable modem service today, and a technician will install an
Ethernet card in your computer to handle the torrent of data. But
installing a next-generation cable modem will take about five
seconds _ you'll just plug it into the USB slot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It's no surprise that USB appeals to Apple engineers. They've
long offered a less-advanced version of the same thing. The Apple
Desktop Bus lets you plug up to 16 devices into a single port. On
many models, you can plug the monitor into the computer's desktop
bus port. Then you plug the keyboard into a slot on the monitor,
and the mouse into a slot on the keyboard. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   USB will let PC users do the same, if the hardware ever shows
up. So far I've tested two USB devices. Both installed easily and
worked splendidly. Hewlett-Packard's ScanJet 4100C scanner will
sell for $199 when it lands on shelves this autumn. And you can
already buy the Logitech USB Wheel Mouse for around $40.
</P>
<P>
   But what about USB disk drives, monitors, modems? Just you wait.

PUTTING TEACHING BEFORE TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jennifer S. Puccetti has a master's degree in public
policy and a bachelor's in political science. She has run the
Chelsea Parent Information Center and served as publicist for the
Boston University-run Chelsea school district.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, she is the principal at the new Clark Avenue
School in Chelsea, hiring teachers and generally readying the
school for the Sept. 2 opening with more than 500 fifth- and
sixth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   And according to her resume, her only classroom experience has
been teaching English in the Dominican Republic while a Peace Corps
volunteer in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, the state's alternative certification process
allowed Puccetti and 269 others without a traditional education
background to become certified as teachers and school
administrators. Indeed, according to the state, professional
experience allows many of them to bypass the usual certification
process.
</P>
<P>
   With a statewide chorus for higher standards _ including
required coursework, minimum hours of work experience, and a
mandatory high-stakes certification exam _ the non-traditionalists
teaching and running schools in Massachusetts seems to run against
the current.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is broad support for easing the certification path for
successful mid-career professionals wanting to shift gears. Even
those with traditional backgrounds say such people breathe
creativity into a profession just beginning to cast off some of its
own rigid traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be certified and still not have the strengths,'' said
Jocelyn Mouton, director of the Center for Leadership Development,
which trains Boston public school teachers and administrators.
``Sometimes the second-career teachers are better because they
developed a skill in one area, then realized they wanted to teach.
They bring so much from the experiences they have had, whether it
is in science or writing. It is like adding another layer.''
</P>
<P>
   While 12,677 teachers and administrators were certified the
standard way in Massachusetts, 81 of them _ like Puccetti _ were
certified by the state education commissioner, and 189 were
certified by a panel review. Superintendents are the ones who seek
the licenses for unconventional teachers and principals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a state education department spokeswoman said a
letter and supporting documents from Chelsea Superintendent Douglas
Sears last February extolling Puccetti's work record and life
experience were apparently enough to convince then-Commissioner
Robert V. Antonucci to certify Puccetti not only to be a principal,
but an assistant superintendent or superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Puccetti would not comment on her background, but she and others
appear to be filling what is otherwise an increasingly shallow pool
of traditionally certified applications. Dissatisfaction with
public schools, urban ones in particular, is keeping away
superintendents and principals, say observers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Peter Finn, executive director of the Massachusetts
Association of School Superintendents, teacher pay increases over
the past few years across the country mean fewer teachers are
seeking to move up the ranks to earn a better wage. Some 95 percent
of superintendents began as teachers, he said, but that number is
likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring non-educators as administrators is a recent nationwide
trend. Retired military leaders now run the Seattle and Boulder
public school districts. San Diego recently hired a former
prosecutor, while a former city budget director runs the Chicago
schools.
</P>
<P>
   For teachers, certification is no job guarantee, except possibly
for those trained in science, math, or bilingual education. And
because of demand, these are the fields where nontraditional sorts
get plenty of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Ayers, starting his second year teaching sixth-grade math
at the Robert Gould Shaw Middle School in West Roxbury, is one such
teacher. An applied mathematician and engineer by training, the
36-year-old Winthrop native decided four years ago that engineering
was not for him. He knew he could become certified through the
alternative route had he wanted to teach only math, but he decided
instead to become traditionally certified in elementary education
so he can teach any subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is certainly more challenging than engineering,'' he
said. ``Certainly if someone has worked in the field they are
teaching, they bring a lot to the table.'' But he said the
curriculum and pedagogy courses he took at Lesley College and his
student teaching were vital, too.
</P>
<P>
   Teacher union officials were cautious as they praised
alternative certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are brilliantly talented people out there who ought to
be teaching, and it would be foolish to put them through a standard
teacher preparation program,'' said Fred Andelman, director of
professional development for the Massachusetts Teachers
Association. ``But the public must be assured that people working
in education need to demonstrate, just as anyone who gets in a car,
that they possess the skills to do the job. That is called
licensure.''

IF ALIEN ABDUCTORS CALL, JUST SAY NO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How many times have you asked yourself: What would I do if space
aliens showed up at my door?
</P>
<P>
   If they came for just a friendly close encounter it would be one
thing. You could invite them in for cocktails and a chat. It's the
alien abduction thing you want to avoid. Everybody knows what
happens when you're abducted by aliens. They probe your orifices.
Life is difficult enough these days without some alien sticking an
instrument, or whatever, into your ear, or wherever.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``How to Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction,''
UFO researcher Ann Druffel delivers what her title promises. The
paperback, just published by Three Rivers Press, costs $12, a small
price for step-by-step instruction in techniques that will help you
resist should aliens come calling.
</P>
<P>
   Druffel, who has been researching UFOs since 1957, looked
through 250 case studies and found 70 ``resisters,'' people who
just said ``No!'', in a manner of speaking, to alien abduction.
Actually, just saying ``No!'' is Resistance Technique No.3, one of
nine described in the book. Druffel calls it Righteous Anger. It
requires assertiveness and a positive attitude on the part of the
resister. Righteous Anger, Druffel writes, ``is best combined with
strong commands, either verbal or mental, such as `Go away!' or
`Leave me alone!' and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure I could pull off Righteous Anger if aliens were to
show up at my house. I can't get my cats off the kitchen counter by
saying ``Go away!'' so I doubt it would work on extraterrestrials
bent on probing my orifices. Nor do I think I'll be using
Resistance Technique No.2, Physical Struggle. I wouldn't want to
risk hurting an alien. ``The intent should never be to kill or
seriously injure the intruders,'' Druffel writes, ``but to inform
them that their presence is violating the witness's right to
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this gambit is that aliens don't appear to
understand the concept of privacy. They're forever showing up
unannounced in people's bedrooms in the middle of the night, and if
that's not a violation of privacy I don't know what is. Personally,
I think they could use a short course in etiquette. I bet Miss
Manners could whip them into shape up in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining seven Resistance Techniques my favorite is
No.9, Repellents. Although I'm not ruling out No.4, Protective
Rage, or No.7, Metaphysical Methods, or even No.5, Support From
Family Members.
</P>
<P>
   You can mix and match Druffel's techniques to suit yourself and
the occasion. For example, you could use a well-known Alien
Repellent like St. John's Wort along with a Metaphysical Method of
resistance, such as envisioning yourself enveloped in a protective
bright white light. And if that's not enough, you could fly into a
Protective Rage ``using rejecting statements, even well-chosen
curses'' against the intruders. Begone, alien scum!
</P>
<P>
   Druffel writes that most people in the alien abduction field,
abductees and researchers alike, don't believe Resistance
Techniques can be used successfully. Why? Druffel puts it down to
lack of practical experience: ``..it seems almost certain that most
(abductees) have never even tried (resistance) with the necessary
motivation and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly then, it's best to be prepared. Get a copy of ``How to
Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction.'' Practice the Resistence
Techniques on telemarketers and cold-call sales people and anybody
else who pops into your life uninvited. You don't want to find
yourself thinking, ``Gee, I wish I'd bought that book,'' as some
big-eyed entity drags you off to the mother ship.

`MARIUS AND JEANNETTE' IS HARD TO RESIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ghost of the great French writer and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol
hovers happily over ``Marius and Jeannette,'' a hard-to-resist
French romantic comedy that moves into the Varsity today for a
one-week run. The film was nominated in seven categories at the
1998 Cesar Awards, France's version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Pagnol receives no credit, but the film's title seems to be a
tribute to his most famous character, Marius; it's set in that
character's working-class section of Marseilles; and it's infused
with Pagnol's distinctive flavor and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This updated Marius (Gerard Meylan) is a watchman at a cement
factory that used to be the main employer of this part of the
Estaque section of Marseilles, but has since been abandoned for
unknown economic reasons and is about to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette (Ariane Ascaride) is a big-hearted, loud-mouthed,
twice-wed, single mother of two children who lives nearby, and is
just about to lose her job as a store checker by blowing off steam
at her stuffy boss (Pierre Banderet).
</P>
<P>
   The pair _ both in their 40s _ meet cute one day when Jeannette
sneaks into the factory and steals two cans of paint. Marius
catches her in the act, but lets her go, and then impulsively drops
the paint off at her house. A romance begins.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the Pagnolian neighborhood ensemble, there's two
other couples who play a large part in the story: a battling
husband-and-wife (Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Frederique Bonnal),
and a retired teacher in love with a communist concentration camp
survivor (Jacques Boudet and Pascale Roberts).
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Robert Guediguian (who grew up in the Estaque)
dedicates the film to working people, and most of his characters
are marginal communists and socialists trying to keep the faith in
a post-communist world and an increasingly right-wing France.
</P>
<P>
   The film's political subtext is extremely subtle, however, and
the director paints his scenes with the lightest of brushstrokes _
making sure to quickly puncture his more poignant moments or bleak
observations of life with jabs of cheerful humor.
</P>
<P>
   The characters of ``Marius and Jeannette'' are all especially
well cast. And star Ascaride (director Guediguian's wife) generates
just the right earth-mother charm and panache to carry the film.
She deservedly won the 1998 best actress Cesar for her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Marius and Jeannette. Directed by Robert Guediguian. Screenplay
by Guediguian and Jean-Louis Milesi. Cast: Ariane Ascaride, Gerard
Meylan, Pascale Roberts, Jacques Boudet. New Yorker Films. 102
minutes. In French with English subtitles. Unrated.

BACK PAIN PUTS HURT ON GOLFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The agony that comes with the ecstasy starts in
the backswing as the torso twists one way and the shoulders turn on
another plane entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The combined motion can send golf balls rocketing off toward
another planet. But it also can bring even the most athletic
golfers back to earth in sharp spasms of pain.
</P>
<P>
   Back pain has played a major role this year on the PGA Tour,
shortening the tour schedule of Fred Couples, forcing PGA Champion
Davis Love III to cut back on public appearances and several
events, causing two-time U.S. champion Ernie Els to withdraw in the
middle of a tournament for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   If they stay healthy, all three are among the favorites this
week at Sahalee Country Club. And to make sure that their backs
don't break down over the course of the next four days, the players
have employed their own personal back doctor: Columbus, Ga.,
physician Tom Boers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to quit giving him publicity because he's too busy
already,'' Love said Wednesday when asked what Boers would be doing
to keep his back healthy going into Thursday's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity-shy Boers told Golf World magazine: ``I have a
ball seeing all those guys, but it's not my goal to be out there
every weekend in the fitness trailer.''
</P>
<P>
   Boers is so well-known on the PGA Tour because back pain is
probably the biggest health-related problem that professional
golfers face. Couples, for example, has reduced his schedule over
the past four years because of recurring back and disc problems. In
1996, it forced him to withdraw from the U.S. Open, and in 1995, he
was in such pain that he chose not to travel to the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure he had no serious pain coming into the PGA
Championship, Couples played only two events from mid-June to now:
the U.S. Open and the British Open. He's on medication, and Boers
will help with a stretching and flexibility routine to keep him
from breaking down in agony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a few pills and roll around on the ground,'' Couples
said, describing the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Couples first learned of Boers' speciality after the 45-year-old
therapist from Amsterdam began treating Greg Norman for a back
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game of golf is not conducive to natural movement. The
swing is an unnatural motion,'' Norman once said when asked why so
many golfers seem to be plagued by back pain. Others occasionally
on the tender-back list include Phil Mickelson, Tiger Woods, Larry
Nelson, Loren Roberts and Seve Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Els, Couples and Love have had the most trouble.
That's why Couples has brought Boers to each of the majors he's
played in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom has come out a lot . . . so that is almost every three or
four weeks instead (of seeing him) once or twice a year,'' Couples
said. ``I think he's got me in a good spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples' problems began about five years ago at the age of 33.
Nothing took away the pain until Boers began to manipulate joints
in Couples' back. The joints are known as facet joints and run down
the length of the spine.
</P>
<P>
   According to Boers, Couples' facet joints appeared to be stuck
together and were not moving properly with his back. By
manipulating them, Boers was able to free them up to take away the
pain and gradually increase Couples' mobility. Boers also put
Couples on a new exercise routine to keep his back and the joints
moving properly.
</P>
<P>
   His role in bringing Couples back to playing form attracted Els
and Davis to Boers this year after they, too, began to find back
pain forced them to withdraw from tournaments and public
appearances. Neither one was found to have a specific problem, but
both had sore back muscles because of the extensive practice and
playing regimen of the PGA Tour, and because they are both tall men
who spend a lot of time flying and carrying luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Els said Boers never could pinpoint what was causing him the
most pain, but was able to help loosen up his spine, where he would
feel most of the tightness and soreness. Before he saw Boers, Els
was forced to withdraw from the Buick classic in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just came on over a couple of years. I have no (medical)
problem. Everything is in line,'' Els said, proclaiming himself fit
for the test at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   Love has seen his back problems put a damper on the year he
intended to enjoy the PGA Tour as the reigning PGA Champion. Now he
and Couples are spending more time on the floor and less time
pounding golf balls at the range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing more stretching and range-of-motion exercises than
working out,'' Love said. ``I'm trying to keep my back loose, keep
everything stretched out. I'm doing a lot of the stuff like Freddy
is doing _ just spending some time on your back and rolling around.
It does a lot of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Els, Love was assured that his back problems aren't as bad
as Couples'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a bad back; I have a hurt back,'' Love said.
</P>
<P>
   Couples is resigned to dealing with his back pain for the rest
of his golfing career. It comes and it goes, so Couples comes and
goes on the PGA Tour, having played only 14 events this year,
winning twice with a tie for second at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I still have the game to win,'' Couples
said. ``That is the only reason I play. I don't play this game to
come out and just hope my back will do fine. I come out to compete.
And when I stop doing that, I will quit.''

DRIVER'S PERFORMANCE IN `THE GOVERNESS' MAKES IT WORTH SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Governess,'' a gothic romance novel of a film about one
woman's journey toward sexual self-knowledge and identity, is more
visually adventurous than anything.
</P>
<P>
   It features an odd, sometimes bold, performance by Minnie Driver
in her first star vehicle. Whether you can suspend disbelief for
wild flights of fancy will depend entirely upon your feelings about
Driver herself as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   She's in virtually every scene of Sandra Goldbacher's first
feature. Goldbacher was a successful commercials director in London
and her talent with a camera certainly can't be disputed.
Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the film's soap opera of
a story, which is over-the-top, unfocused and lacks plausibility.
</P>
<P>
   In England during the Victorian Era, a young Jewish woman,
Rosina DaSilva (Driver), learns, after the sudden death of her
father, that his excesses have left her mother and sister
penurious. Rosina boldly decides to find work so she can support
her family and pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing she'll be at a disadvantage in the Christian
community, she changes her name to Mary Blackchurch and secures
employment on the Isle of Skye as a governess for the eccentric
Cavendish family.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) is an inventor. He's engrossed in
finding a fixative for photographic developer, an obsession he
invites the bright Rosina to share. She soon falls in love with the
middle-aged man, embracing him with torrid emotional abandon. The
two embark on a heated affair, much to the agony of the young heir,
Henry Cavendish (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer), who has come home from
Oxford and promptly becomes obsessed with his sister's exotic
governess.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potentially intriguing triangle between father, son
and governess at play but the film never delves into psychological
depths that might have made it more interesting and original. ``The
Governess'' stays mainly on the surface of the characters'
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it feels like Goldbacher became confused over what
she really wanted to convey. The film takes convenient liberties
with Rosina's search for a place in Christian society as well as
the story of a strong-willed woman's struggle for emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a true romance, as was Jane Campion's cunning ``The
Piano,'' a film it resembles. Instead it's indecisively
non-committal, even opting for an ``I Am Woman'' ending that
sabotages and negates the complicated, intriguing setup.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, as a statement on women's freedom and struggles, the
real moments in the film go to the marvelous English stage actress
Harriet Walter. She plays Mrs. Cavendish, a shallow, uninventive
society wife who has suffered from exile in a lonely place as well
as from her husband's inattention. More comment is made about a
woman's heart through her pursed, pained face than with all of
Driver's uncorseted, ``liberated'' sexual writhings with the master
of the house.

O'MEARA IS CHASING A SPOT ALONGSIDE HOGAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; REDMOND, Wash. _ Mark O'Meara's first contract when he turned
professional 17 years ago was with the Ben Hogan Co., and the
association lasted for six or seven years. Now he's in the 80th PGA
Championship at Sahalee CC with a chance to join Hogan in a more
enduring sense.
</P>
<P>
   Should O'Meara, 41, win this tournament, he would be the only
player except Hogan to win three of golf's four professional major
championships in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan won the Masters, the US Open, and the British Open in 1953
and bypassed the PGA Championship because the match-play format at
the time placed too much of a strain on legs he had shattered when
his car was hit by a bus five years before. O'Meara, owner of the
1998 Masters and British Open titles, becomes the sixth player to
enter the PGA with two majors in his pocket since the tournament
switched to stroke play in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's emergence isn't a total surprise, but when he became
the oldest man to win two majors in the same year, it raised a few
eyebrows. He'd won the prestigious Pebble Beach Pro-Am five times,
but his record in majors had been spotty. No more. He's the
favorite to capture Player of the Year honors, and a win at Sahalee
would cement his reputation as one of the game's elite.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara remains unruffled, preferring to spend time with his
family and leave the intense glare of the spotlight to his close
friend and Orlando neighbor, Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could figure that out (why it took so long to win a
major),'' he said, ``I would have done it earlier.'' Then he became
serious. ``I think it's just a little bit of experience and a
little bit of wisdom. It comes with age.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed his resolve at Augusta in April when, paired with
third-round leader Fred Couples on Sunday, he hung around and
seized the green jacket with a 20-foot birdie on the 72d hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was two shots back, so I just tried not to get in my own way
and tried not to let bad shots upset me,'' he recalled. ``I
realized I was going to hit some bad shots, and I think you tend to
recover quicker if you move on and don't carry on with the feelings
that can overcome you. I've learned from that, and I think that's
really been the No. 1 key. When I won, it was a heavy weight off my
chest from that standpoint. I've played well on the Tour and around
the world. That was the one area that was missing in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though O'Meara made his presence felt in the US Open at San
Francisco's Olympic Club, he finished tied for 32d. But he rose up
at Royal Birkdale for the British Open in blustery winds that blew
over the course at various speeds and in differing directions.
O'Meara had played the course before, so he arrived with
confidence. ``I knew it was a golf course I liked very much,'' he
said, ``and I was hoping to go there and play well but not put the
highest expectations on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   When he beat Brian Watts in a four-hole playoff, O'Meara turned
a special year into something extraordinary. After a drought of 56
majors without a win, he'd broken through in near-historic fashion,
far exceeding his goals as a youth in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to get on the Tour,'' he said. ``If I could
win one tournament, I would have thought I was going to be
successful. I think if my career came to an end and I had never won
a major championship, I probably would have been a little
disappointed. But I've had so many great things happen to me in the
game, it wasn't going to take away from all the good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I've won two majors in one year, it's a wonderful
accomplishment. It's great. But you've got to move forward. That's
in the past. Now is the present. We've got the PGA Championship.
We've got a great field here on a neat and different type of golf
course. I think anything is possible. I think the odds are a little
stacked against me. It doesn't stop me from going out there and
trying to give it my best. If I have a chance Sunday afternoon,
hopefully, I can dwell on what I've learned from the Masters and
the British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who died in July a year ago, was an early inspiration to
O'Meara. ``I actually turned pro in the fall of 1980 and I turned
pro at Mr. Hogan's office in Fort Worth,'' said O'Meara. ``I
specifically remember that day. I was the defending champion in the
US Amateur, but I'd lost to Willie Wood. I flew to Dallas, went to
Forth Worth, went to the factory, turned pro in his office, and met
him for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several occasions where he took me aside or I went
and watched him hit golf balls. He'd watch me. I'd be struggling
with my game and I'd sit down and write him a letter asking for
help or some advice. He'd pick up the phone, call me, and tell me
he wasn't a teacher. He didn't want to teach me anything because he
didn't want to ruin my game. I didn't get to see him play, but the
mystique and getting to know him over the years was a big asset for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his rare double, O'Meara doesn't believe he's a great
player. ``There's been a handful of great players,'' he said.
``There's been a lot of very, very talented players. It's just a
matter of how you look at the word `great.' My impression of
someone who is great is someone who won a lot of major
championships and has done it consistently. They're great. I think
I'm a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's life hasn't changed drastically since he won the
Masters and British Open, but nobody mistakes him for Mark McCumber
anymore. ``I feel I'm the same person I was before I went into the
press room on Sunday at Augusta National,'' he said. ``The thing
I've noticed is when I'm out in the public eye, people recognize me
more because of the exposure a major championship brings when you
win. I was raised by a father who's a furniture salesman, who likes
people. I like people. So I don't have a problem with it.''

`RETURN TO PARADISE' IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's extremely rare these days to have a star-heavy Hollywood
movie that revolves around a clear and perhaps
impossible-to-reconcile moral dilemma. For this reason alone,
``Return to Paradise'' comes as something of a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is no slam dunk by any means. The reach of its script
definitely exceeds its grasp, it never makes us completely believe
its bizarre situation and it doesn't quite click into place as
something more than a TV problem-movie-of-the-week.
</P>
<P>
   But it's full of surprises every step of the way, it carries a
powerful emotional punch and it serves as an engaging star vehicle
for Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche _ who make their sketchily written
characters come alive, and develop an appealing romantic chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a trio of young Americans _ Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad) and Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) _ who, as
the film opens, are having a summer of tropical fun in Peninsular
Malaysia, with a liberal amount of hashish involved.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to two years later. Sheriff is back in New York driving a
limousine; Tony is an apprentice Manhattan architect; and neither
has heard anything from Lewis, who stayed on in Malaysia to work
for an orangutan protection project in Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a young attorney (Anne Heche) hires Sheriff's limo
and drops a bombshell on him: It seems Lewis was arrested with
their collective hash stash shortly after the other two left, and
has spent the last two years in an unspeakably awful Penang prison.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Malaysian authorities intend to hang him in a
matter of weeks, unless either he or Tony or both come back to
tesify that he was not a dealer, and shoulder part of the blame.
The deal is three years for each of them, or six years if only one
can be convinced to return.
</P>
<P>
   So the movie becomes this no-win moral dilemma in which the two
men are asked to make an extraordinary sacrifice for someone they
barely know _ egged on by this persistent and mysterious woman who
seems willing to go to any length to convince them.
</P>
<P>
   As this plays out, the script _ which was adapted from Pierre
Jolivet's 1989 French-language drama, ``Force Majeure'' _ seems to
have more than a few pieces missing, and never really tells us
enough about any of its characters to work as a cogent drama.
</P>
<P>
   It also never quite convinces us that: a) the U.S. State
Department would completely ignore the execution of a young
American with no criminal record; b) Malaysia would pose such a
deal to stay the execution; or c) anyone would ever be noble enough
to go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can jump over this considerable credibility gap,
``Return to Paradise'' is often a riveting movie, fueled by the
usual solid direction of Joseph Ruben (``Dreamscape''), top-notch
production values, and an especially poignant love story that
develops credibly in the midst of the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a film that forces us to question what we might do in
such a nightmarish situation; and thus becomes a sobering
cautionary tale. Like ``Red Corner'' and ``Midnight Express,'' it
tells us that being an American carries no special privileges in an
increasingly draconian Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise. Directed by Joseph Ruben. Screenplay by
Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson. Cast: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche,
Joaquin Phoenix, David Conrad, Jada Pinkett Smith. Polygram. 109
minutes. Rated R for drug scenes and mature subject matter.

NEW `AIR BUD' HAS SOME CHARMING MOMENTS AS FAMILY FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can you not love a big yellow dog who wears a goofy football
jersey and helmet and looks pretty weird catching a spiral pass?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Air Bud is back, and this time he's tackling the role of
wide receiver instead of chasing Michael Jordan on the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he's also being pursued by more than a sports
agent; it seems Russian circus wrangler Natalya (Nora Dunn) needs a
star attraction for her floundering animal show.
</P>
<P>
   As long as ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' keeps its eye on the
ball, not the villainess and her moronic right hand man, this
second installment in the life of the sports-loving golden receiver
and his human ``best friend,'' Josh Framm (Kevin Zegers), is
charming family fare. It's only with its old lemon of a sub-plot
that things lag and Air Bud's charismatic tail fails to wag.
</P>
<P>
   Josh is moping around because his recently widowed mom, Jackie
(Cynthia Stevenson), is going on dates with a handsome new vet,
Patrick Sullivan (Gregory Harrison). Air Bud takes to Dr. Sullivan
as much as mom, so Josh is feeling doubly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, his school football team is failing dismally. Just as
things hit an all-time low, Air Bud decides to switch sports. He's
tired of playing around with basketball players like Blue Edwards
and Lee Mayberry and he's found some new friends in the form of
Seattle Seahawks Warren Moon and Joey Galloway (who have small
roles in the film), and who are happy to show their four-legged pal
the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud joins Josh's flailing team, and makes the news in the
process. But his ability to catch a pass also catches the eye of a
Russian circus owner who decides the dog will revive her dwindling
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The original Air Bud died of cancer, so the canine hero is now
played by six golden retrievers, each handling a different facet of
the dog's personality and talent. Since ``Air Bud: Wide Receiver''
is a sweet comedy about growing up and dealing with loss and
tragedy, it's suitable homage to the first pup who made the
character popular. There's a nice rapport between Kevin Zeger, the
young actor who plays Josh and who has a no-nonsense screen
presence, and his canine companion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't trust their humanistic
little core story and had to mess it all up with the broad _ and
out-of-place _ slapstick humor of the Russian circus subplot to
keep the film from feeling too sad and perhaps, intense, for kids.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie that feels disjointed in tone and doesn't
have the continuity to completely sustain itself. Still, it's
enjoyable because the family scenes and the sports action are
touching and a lot of fun. Only with the off-kilter silliness
provided by Nora Dunn does it go ``woof.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver. Directed by Richard Martin. Written by
Paul Tamasy, Aaron Mendelsohn. Cast: Kevin Zegers, Gregory
Harrison, Cynthia Stevenson, Nora Dunn. Dimension Films. 91
minutes. Rated G.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CONWAY, N.H. _ Approximately 400 vertical feet above the
treetops and at the end of his rope, Chuck Stevenson was breaking a
nervous sweat the other day trying to jam the rubber toes of his
climbing shoes between nubbins of quartz and feldspar in the
granite face of Whitehorse Ledge.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, 43, is a television producer on vacation here with
his wife and young children. As this was one of his two days off
parent duty, Stevenson had decided to hang _ literally _ with other
upwardly mobile souls at one of New England's most popular
rock-climbing hangouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, this is quite good for me,'' Stevenson said after
completing a particularly tricky traverse on his first-ever rock
climb. At the moment, he resembled a fly on short tether, glued to
the granite with his instructor, Joe Lentini, and held safely in
place with an array of stainless steel climbing paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it challenging to stay calm,'' said Stevenson, the
CBS-TV producer of ``48 Hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no blow to Stevenson's pride that one day earlier, two
dozen Girl Scouts had made the same climb. At this hangout,
everyone picks their own pace, focusing their energy acutely,
mind-cleansingly, on the process of taking one step at a time. The
exercise is frighteningly simple, and on a summer Sunday, as many
as 500 people hang hereabouts as they play the mind/body game.
</P>
<P>
   The hangout is more accurately a pair of ledges, Whitehorse and
Cathedral, which rise a maximum of 850 feet above the west side of
Mount Washington Valley in Echo Lake State Park. The granite
outcropping, which extends about one mile end to end, supports the
business of two large climbing schools and as many as 30
instructors.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 a.m. on a recent Thursday morning, 17 climbers _ about
half of them first-timers _ were feeling their way up Whitehorse
Ledge, while another 40 climbers were on Cathedral Ledge. Twenty
years ago, there might have been a half-dozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increasing popularity of extreme sports, and certainly Jon
Krakauer's book,'' have vastly added to rock-climbing's appeal,
said Lentini, the director of the Eastern Mountain Sports Climbing
School and a veteran climber and instructor. Krakauer's 1997
bestseller ``Into Thin Air'' depicts a harrowing climb gone wrong
on Mount Everest _ apparently with enough glamour to encourage
gaggles of daredevils onto the ledges of North Conway.
</P>
<P>
   They recently included the Veillette family of Quebec City _
Jacques and Helene, and their children Francois, 9, and Audrey, 7.
Also present were John Garvey, 30, a biochemist studying at
Brandeis University, and a dozen youngsters from Adventure Quest,
an experimental learning camp based in Woodstock, Vt. Eric Slayton,
who has climbed extensively in Europe and the United States, was
one of Adventure Quest's guides.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, Slayton was preparing to attach Melina Coogan, 13, to
an assortment of climbing gear that would hold her like a
short-leashed dog in a fall.
</P>
<P>
   A good climber _ Lentini, for example _ might fall 100 times
during a summer on these ledges. But because the safety anchors he
installs in cracks for his rope are many and closely spaced, the
tumble is never more than a few feet. Deaths and severe accidents
here are rare _ in part because Whitehorse and Cathedral ledges
have a built-in, self-regulating fear factor. Within a few steps
from the bottom, the novice climbers discover they're over their
heads if they don't have an instructor, who usually works for
either Eastern Mountain Sports or International Mountain Equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As Lentini led Stevenson in 230-foot-long legs (the length of
his rope) up ``The Slabs'' of Whitehorse, time was spent as much on
getting the knots and gear right as ascending the rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at your feet,'' Lentini frequently admonished. ``And
breathe. Oxygen is good!'' The higher they climbed, the lower the
crows seemed to be flying, and the easier the whistles could be
heard from the tourist trains plying the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   To the untrained eye, this pair of ledges resembles a rumpled
monochromatic curtain of granite. But the veteran climber here will
see upwards of 500 routes bearing names that first-time ascenders
believed captured the experience: Thin Air, Grim Reaper, Chicken
Delight, Edge of the World, and Liquid Sky, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   The only way up Whitehorse is on foot, but the summit of
Cathedral can be reached by an auto road that brings an estimated
10,000 tourists annually to the top. They watch, often nervously,
as guides and students pop into view just a few feet away. And
sometimes they offer critiques.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last summer Brad White, an instructor with the
International Mountain Equipment Climbing School, was ushering a
hefty climber to the top under the curious gaze of a laconic Maine
tourist. Ropes led from White's waist in opposite directions, one
to the climber below, the other, an anchor, to a fence post at the
tourist's feet.
</P>
<P>
   The climber fell, the ropes tightened, and White got twanged
like a bronco rider _ all the while yelling repeatedly to his
client below: ``Don't worry. I've got you!''
</P>
<P>
   After taking in the scene for a while, the Mainer said: ``I'd
say he's got you.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he walked back to his car.

`STELLA' IS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By William Arnold  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The timing of this film version of Terry McMillan's novel, ``How
Stella Got Her Grove Back,'' could hardly be better. It comes,
after all, on the tail end of a media tempest about all the recent
movies cast with aging male stars and much younger actresses.
</P>
<P>
   And it's the exact reverse of that situation: it's a romantic
comedy about the relationship between a successful, professional
woman in her 40s (Angela Bassett) and a 20-year-old man (Taye
Diggs) who doesn't have much going for himself except a winning
personality and a body by Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it's turned out to be something of a missed
opportunity. It springs to life once or twice in the course of its
two-hour running time, but it's mostly a rough sit: a movie that's
heavy-handed, charmless and incorrigibly mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   The title character, Stella, is a hard-driving, San Francisco
stock broker and divorced mother of one who _ having just suffered
the indignity of a 40th birthday _ is feeling burned-out,
unsatisfied with her job and unfulfilled as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   One vulnerable day, she sees an enticing commercial for a
Jamaica vacation. So she drops everything, wings her way to
paradise and finds Winston _ a hunky Jamaican college graduate who
pursues and finally wins her.
</P>
<P>
   As they gradually fall in love and bound back and forth between
their native countries, the movie explores the impact of their
relationship on their respective families and the difficulties that
arise as they edge toward a life-long commitment.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of scenes along the way are funny and perceptive _ as
when Stella finds herself in a movie theater with Winston watching
a dimwitted youth comedy (something like `Booty Call'') and
realizes with horror that she's the only one in the theater not
howling.
</P>
<P>
   But these moments are few and far between. The script _ by
McMillan and the usually more reliable Ron Bass _ is otherwise so
cliched and predictable that you find yourself constantly saying
the lines in your head just before the actors deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   The first-time direction of Kevin Rodney Sullivan is even more
culpable. The first half of his movie plays like a bad episode of
``The Jeffersons,'' and the last half like ``All My Children.'' He
seems to have no subtlety or sensitivity whatsoever: his scenes are
either buffoonish, cheesy or maudlin.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with a bad script and worse direction, star Angela
Bassett doesn't have much of a chance. Like the rest of the cast _
Diggs, Regina King, Suzzanne Douglas and Whoopi Goldberg (as
Stella's best friend) _ she always seems to be trying too hard, and
never really connecting.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many movies of the late '90s, this one seems an excuse
for a sound track album. The songs are end to end, and often
obtrusive and inappropriate to the scene. Even when one of the
characters is on her death bed, the radio beside her is blaring a
happy tune. (Her dying words to Stella are ``Turn it up, girl.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Grove Back'' is also a movie in which the
art of ``product placement'' has run amok. It manages to work in
references to Snickers, Oreo cookies, YoYos, Cocoa Puffs and
American Airlines. And if those images of Jamaica as a sexual
paradise get to you, the number to call is 1-800-JAMAICA.
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back. Directed by Kevin Rodney
Sullivan. Screenplay by Terry McMillan and Ron Bass. Cast: Angela
Bassett, Taye Diggs, Whoopi Goldberg, Regina King. 20th
Century-Fox. 120 minutes. Rated R for sexual situations and some
nudity.

<P>
   Jake Geller wheels his way out of his home this week to begin a
2,706-mile journey to Phoenix, where he will be a freshman at
Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   The trip will be one of the longest and most difficult of his
life. Geller, 19, of Medway, Mass., has muscular dystrophy, which
makes any type of travel an elaborate effort.
</P>
<P>
   But after Geller's parents drop him off on Aug. 17, he will not
be alone. His lifelong friend, Jack Buchholz, will be his roommate
and serve as his personal care attendant.
</P>
<P>
   While many people have been amazed by Buchholz's dedication to
his friend, Buchholz himself is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big a deal,'' he insisted. ``Waking up a half
hour earlier in the morning is not that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz will get Geller out of bed every morning, dress him,
and help him shave and shower. At night, he will undress him, help
him with such routine bathroom chores as brushing his teeth, and
put him into bed.
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz knows the routine by heart: for the past three summers,
he and Geller have been roommates at the Computer-Ed High Tech Camp
at Lasell College in Newton, Mass. During those summers, Buchholz
has learned what is required of him as a personal care attendant,
including being woken up in the middle of the night by Geller when
he is uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I get pretty mad when he does that,'' Buchholz said.
``But I always apologize in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The two make an unusual pair. Geller, 19, is interested in
theater, computers, and broadcasting. He was editor of his high
school yearbook and a student council member.
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz, 18, was captain of his high school's soccer and track
teams. He also was on the swimming team and hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two have been good friends since they were in
kindergarten, and they say their decision to attend the same
college is based more on their strong friendship than Geller's need
for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just decided we wanted to be rooommates,'' said Geller,
adding that each wanted to have a familiar face around in the sea
of freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Buchholz and Geller went on a tour of West Coast
colleges together, and though they weren't sure until this year
that they would go to the same one, it wasn't exactly an accident,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to go (someplace) just because Jack was, but it
certainly does help,'' Geller said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State is one of the most accessible American
universities for people with disabilities, Geller says. Plus, it
has a broadcast journalism program, which he will join. For
Buchholz, Arizona State has the advantage of being in a good
climate and near his relatives in Chandler, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the first time the pair have been at the same school
since first grade. They met through their parents when they both
lived in Hopkinton, Mass. Geller moved to Medway midway through
first grade, while Buchholz grew up in Hopkinton, but the two
remained friends.
</P>
<P>
   Buchholz goes to the plays Geller is in, while Geller goes to
Buchholz's soccer games. When they get together to watch a video,
they often end up talking through the whole movie. And they have
been attending the computer camp since 1991 _ for the first few
years as campers, and more recently as counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Geller was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy when he
was 3. It is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in
children, and it is progressive. Most of those who have it die in
their 20s or 30s from respiratory problems, though new treatments
offer some hope for longer survival, said Marcia Randall, the
program services coordinator for the Muscular Dystrophy Association
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Geller's mind is fixed on his future in broadcast journalism; at
Medway High School, he was technical director and a reporter for
the school's cable-access channel.
</P>
<P>
   Geller says he is grateful to Buchholz for the sacrifices he has
made, and Geller hopes to hire a personal care attendant in the
next few months to help him at school and take the burden off his
friend.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect them to be spending any less time together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pair, they're inseparable,'' said George Murphy, the
director of the computer camp where the two have spent the last few
summers. ``Their personalities mesh together so well that they're a
great team. I think of them as a pair of superheroes, each with his
own strength.''

 Good health tied to religious vigor
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Getting religion could be good for your health, according to new
medical research out of the Bible Belt.
</P>
<P>
   A study of more than 2,000 North Carolina residents aged 65 and
over found that people who read the Bible daily and attended
services weekly were 40 percent less likely to have high blood
pressure, compared with those who were less actively religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a large and clinically significant difference, one of
the largest effects thus far identified on cardiovascular health,''
said Dr. Harold G. Koenig of Duke University Medical Center, one of
the authors of the study in the current issue of the International
Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not find such a positive health effect for
people who practiced their faith by tuning in to religious
television and radio, only for those who worshipped in the
traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   The study is part of a growing body of scientific literature
exploring links between religion and health, but the authors
caution not to take it on faith that there is a cause-and-effect
relationship. More research is needed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Heart group puts its faith in diet
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While religion's role in high blood pressure is a new area of
inquiry, the role of the diet is well-studied _ yet new things are
still being learned.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time, the American Heart Association is
recommending that people eat more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat
dairy products in order to prevent or reduce hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   The association, in the current issue of the journal
Circulation, cited mounting evidence that a low-salt diet rich in
fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods leads to the greatest
reduction in blood pressure. The Heart Association's longstanding
recommendation to reduce salt consumption is widely known, but
there is still controversy over sodium's role in high blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Euthanasia data said to be inflated
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Surveys of physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia may
overstate by as much as 20 percent the proportion of doctors who
have helped to end a terminally ill patient's suffering, according
to a new study by Boston researchers.
</P>
<P>
   During in-depth interviews with 355 cancer specialists, the
researchers found that 20 percent of the 56 oncologists who thought
they had engaged in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia were
confusing those illegal practices with legal actions _ such as
withholding life-sustaining treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that some doctors don't understand the
difference between physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia, and
fail to observe proposed safeguards, such as referring the patient
for a psychiatric evaluation, before taking either step.
</P>
<P>
   In physician-assisted suicide, a doctor typically prescribes
drugs knowing a patient intends to use them to commit suicide; in
euthanasia, a doctor personally administers drugs, usually by
injection, to end a patient's life, said the study in the current
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, from Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the
University of Massachusetts, Boston, wrote that if the practices
were legalized, the ``environment might change and physicians'
awareness of and adherence to safeguards could be substantially
different. Thus, these data can only warn about areas that might be
problematic if interventions are legalized.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Cancer risk study boosts the Pill
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the birth control pill is known to protect against ovarian
cancer in general, it has not been clear whether it protects
against the hereditary form of the malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   An international study in the current New England Journal of
Medicine provides evidence to answer that question.
</P>
<P>
   Of 161 women in the study who had sisters with hereditary
ovarian cancer, those who had ever used oral contraceptives had
about half the risk of developing the cancer, compared with those
who had never used the pill. Those who had used the pill for six or
more years had a 60 percent lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   For women with potentially cancer-causing mutations in two key
genes, ``The magnitude of the protective effect of oral
contraceptives ... is consistent with that previously found in the
general population,'' write the authors.

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers
through exposure to the arts. (slugged:

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often

the child be one of the youngest in the kindergarten class, or wait
until the following year. Bulion tells the stories of three

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than

programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

THE TIFFANY TOUCH IN THE BACK BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARGO MILLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A century ago a stretch of Commonwealth Avenue was
paved with grand houses almost guaranteed to offend the
sensibilities of ``cold roast'' Boston. Take the corner of Hereford
Street, with its chateaux kitty-corner across the avenue. The
Burridge mansion, now a retirement residence, was French and white,
the facade fussed with griffins and dolphins. The John F. Andrew
mansion of sober brown brick, designed by McKim, Mead &AMP; White in
1884 and &UR;  &LR; now an MIT fraternity, was said to be the first residence
in the Back Bay to reflect an interest in authentic historical
models, in this case, Italian. Anchoring Commonwealth at
Massachusetts Avenue was the great red-roofed French chateau of the
Ames family, now under renovation as a private residence. Its many
reception rooms included a parlor whose walls were braided in gilt
and buttoned with glass mimicking opals.
</P>
<P>
   Only seemingly less modest, because it was a row house, was the
Ayer mansion at 395 Commonwealth. A $2 million restoration now
under way will once again make it obvious that the lady of the
house had breakfasted at Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   This was the jeweler's son, Louis Comfort Tiffany (1848-1933).
He and his studio of artisans are central to the American aesthetic
movement, which was this country's response to Arts &AMP; Crafts in
England, Art Nouveau in Paris, and kindred styles to be found in
every European capital from Vienna to Moscow. A ``Tiffany house''
ought to have put Frederick and Ellen Ayer on the cultural map. But
for Bostonians mired in the pieties of Colonial revival, Tiffany
was too advanced. After prim English Staffordshire and Chinese
Export china, his iridescent blown glass was, well, a bit oily.
Stained glass was suitable for church but not for home. Worse, the
Ayers had mosaic walls where sensible people had wood paneling. Or
so you can imagine the tongues wagging.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayer children would eventually marry into North Shore
society _ Frederick was a considerable horseman _ and in the
family's second-floor library a future World War II general, George
S. Patton, proposed to an Ayer daughter. But for the time being,
cold roast Boston gave the Back Bay newcomers the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   An Ayer descendant thinks there were two reasons. ``New'' money
was one, and there was lots of it, made first in patent medicines
laced with opiates, such as cherry pectoral and sarsaparilla, and
then in wool, the worsteds made at the Washington Mills in Lowell
and the monopoly enforced by the American Woolen consortium. The
second was taste. ``New money and the vulgar new style,'' says
Scott &UR;  &LR; C. &UR;  &LR; Steward of Cambridge, Frederick Ayer's
great-great-grandson, who researched the family for a historical
genealogy called ``The Sarsaparilla Kings.'' Steward thinks
old-money Boston ``looked at the Ayer house and said, `Who are
these people; what's their game?'''
</P>
<P>
   The shell of the Ayer house is severe, a whitish limestone. On
dull days, it looks dull. But when the sun hits the facade, it
breaks out in jeweled effects more to be found in Byzantium than
Boston. Over the front door is a fanlight in a blue, green, and
yellow glass mosaic, and this is framed by a stone mosaic in pink
and rose. When restoration is completed, each window in the
two-story bay will again be transomed in red and yellow mosaic
glass. The corbel under the roof is also mosaic stone. Awaiting
restoration is a frieze of carved and fretted stone that screened
fifth-floor windows. The bronze front doors are gravity itself.
They still open on pure drama.
</P>
<P>
   There can't have been many Boston homes whose front hall could
pass for a stage for music and declamation. You can still see the
oval lined with light-bulb sockets meant to transform the staircase
into a proscenium arch. This touch may follow from the origins of
Ellen Ayer. She was Ellen Banning, of Saint Paul, Minn., and she
was an aspiring amateur actress when the widowed Frederick Ayer
dined with her matchmaking family only to find Ellen had slipped
away to see Edwin Booth in ``Hamlet.'' Ayer gave chase in a closed
carriage, arriving at the theater with a chaperone in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick Ayer knew men did not force themselves on young
women,'' says Steward. ``He apologized to Ellen for the length he
went to scrape an acquaintance and said he would understand if she
ran away. But as she used to tell it, an inner voice told her to
stay. He was the handsomest man she ever saw (he had piercing blue
eyes). He told her he wouldn't have begrudged her Booth in
``Hamlet'' for anything. But now he wanted to see her home. She'd
had her treat and now he wanted the treat of her company. Later
when they were courting, he asked her what she would like as a
present. He expected she would say diamonds, a spray of diamonds.
But she said, pink roses. That's what he gave her the rest of their
married life.'' Home for the first part of the marriage was in
Lowell, where they lived in heavy, dark Victorian respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing older members of his family about Ellen, Steward
found she was regarded as ``rather gushy and tiresome and a little
too dramatic.'' She was 30 years younger than her husband. They
both died in 1924. He went first, aged 96. She followed three weeks
later, surviving ``just long enough,'' says Steward, ``so she could
say she died of a broken heart.'' Their deaths, at Thomasville,
Ga., were not unexpected: Bronze coffins had accompanied them on
the train south.
</P>
<P>
   How Tiffany came to decorate the Ayer mansion is not known. Many
jobs followed from the exhibition of his work at the great
Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, and Frederick Ayer
was among the throngs attending. ``But if I had to guess,'' says a
Tiffany expert, Alice Cooney Freylinghuysen, ``I would say Ellen
Ayer was more the client than her husband.'' Nor can Freylinghuysen
say for sure whether this is the only Boston house Tiffany did.
Records exist all over America for Tiffany-decorated churches and
public buildings but the documentation of commissions for houses is
scanty, says Freylinghuysen, because of the private nature of
residences. Only two known Tiffany interiors are still intact: the
Ayer mansion, finished in 1902, and the Mark Twain house in
Hartford, which is a decade earlier. Freyling-huysen, who is
curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York, thinks Tiffany's greatest interiors were for the
Fifth Avenue mansion of H.O. Havermeyer, the sugar king, and his
wife, Louisine, a pioneering collector of French Impressionists.
Only shards of Havermeyer opulence remain, and Freylinghuysen had
to borrow widely for the show she organized to mark Tiffany's 150th
birthday (at the Met through Jan. 31).
</P>
<P>
   The Ayers' architect of record was a New Yorker, one A.J.
Manning, for whom Freylinghuysen can find no biographical
information. Tiffany very often acted as his own architect, and in
the Ayer interiors she sees ``the same sense of drama as in the
interiors he did for himself.'' This may have been a bit much for
Frederick Ayer. ``The construction and equipment were pratically
perfect though the architectural results were a disappointment to
him,'' Beatrice Ayer Patton wrote as editor of her father's
memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   A small vestibule leads into the front hall. Ahead, flanked by
Tiffany urns of glowing favrile glass, was the dining room. This is
now the chapel of the Bayridge Residence, operated since 1960 by
Opus Dei, the lay Catholic organization; and Mass is offered for
the 70 university women living in the Ayer mansion (and the house
next door). For information about public viewings, telephone
residence director Marie T. Oates or business manager Rosemary Kite
at 617-536-2586. In late August, Ayer descendants will visit the
house during a family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   To the right is the grand staircase. In a conventional house of
the period you would see a flight of stairs rising to break right
and left at a landing. Not in the Ayer mansion: Tiffany hides these
boring upper reaches behind a great gold mosaic wall. As the sage
said, the journey is more interesting than the arrival. And so from
the front hall, Tiffany first makes you mount a series of white
marble semicircles banded in blue mosaics. We could be in Persia,
in Moorish Spain, in India. Then comes the drumroll leading to the
landing: big white marble blocks that would not be out of place on
a public building, say, the US Capitol. Then the landing itself.
</P>
<P>
   This is a little Greek temple. It is totally fake, all smoke and
(literally) mirrors, and totally magical. The silvery glass columns
are very slightly molded. They conceal long mirrored boxes. Light
playing on the mirrors causes them to reflect the glass columns.
``It's a true three-dimensional picture but in two dimensions,''
says Freylinghuysen, adding that she has never come across quite
this theater in Tiffany's other works.
</P>
<P>
   What the rest of the house looked like in Frederick and Ellen
Ayer's heyday can only be imagined. It was never photographed and
the only known rendering was a little painting, by Tiffany artist
Rene de Quelin, for a proposed smoking room. One of Steward's Ayer
aunts recalls the house as light, with lots of white and full of
color. That it was jampacked is apparent from Ellen Ayer's 1903
room-by-room inventory. The front hall was crammed with furniture
and bric-a-brac. Rugs were piled on rugs. There was a 7-foot-long
stuffed jaguar. You could tell the Ayers had ``traveled.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors had sent Frederick Ayer abroad for his health. They
closed the Lowell house, packed up the children _ Frederick had
four more with Ellen _ and spent two years based in Paris. The
winter of 1897-'98 found them in Egypt and they also visited
Istanbul. Reading Ellen's inventory, Steward has the sense the time
abroad turned into a shopping trip for a new house _ but a Boston
house. It's not known whether Frederick Ayer shopped to the extent
that John Gardner shopped with Isabella Stewart Gardner for what
became Fenway Court. In the event, Ellen got a ``French'' drawing
room, with a suite of white and gold furniture in the new, lighter
Louis XVI style and panels of Cluny lace at the windows. Also a
good many Tiffany wall chandeliers _ Freylinghuysen marvels that
the shades are still intact _ and much else that was Tiffany. Did
the effusive Ellen tell Tiffany about Frederick's blue eyes and his
pink roses and did Tiffany then translate that to the front door of
the new house?

 c.1996 Family Circle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.
</P>

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

PALESTINIAN KIDS AND THE CULTURE OF HATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)Israel and the (Palestinian Authority) shall seek to
foster mutual understanding and tolerance and shall accordingly
abstain from incitement, including hostile propaganda.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ From Article XXII of the Israel-PLO Accord (The ``Oslo II''
agreement) signed at the White House, Sept. 28, 1995 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summertime. You're a Palestinian kid. Peace is in the air. If
not full-fledged peace, at least a full-fledged peace process. In
your own short lifetime, you've seen Yasser Arafat shaking hands in
Washington with Yitzhak Rabin and Benjamin Netanyahu. You have
witnessed repeated Israeli withdrawals _ each one painful to
Israelis, all of them victories for Palestinians. You're just a
child, yet you have lived to see the end of the occupation. Gaza,
Jericho, Bethlehem _ they're now under Palestinian autonomy. So are
Nablus, Ramallah, and Jenin. Indeed, 98 percent of Palestinians are
ruled no longer by the State of Israel but by Arafat's Palestinian
Authority (PA).
</P>
<P>
   Summertime. A new season of peace. What are you going to do?
</P>
<P>
   Go to camp, maybe? The PA operates a network of them _ they've
been featured on Palestinian television and in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida,
the official PA newspaper. In one TV ad, a camper at Khan Yunis
sings:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I came to you with my sword in hand.
</P>
<P>
   We will drive them (the Jews) out to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Your day is coming, conqueror, then we will settle accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Our accounts are unending in stones and bullets!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In another promo, you watched a trainer lead children in a
chant: ``My children, my children, o my country/Are in the suicide
squad!''
</P>
<P>
   The camps are for more than just singing, though. Their
commander boasts he has nine military trainers and two supervisers
holding the rank of lieutenant. And the purpose of this intense
military atmosphere? ``To build a generation,'' he told Al-Hayat
Al-Jadida, ``that can arrive at Jerusalem, fight the settlements,
and build the independent Palestinian state.'' Or, as the TV
announcer says: ``Jihad'' _ holy war _ ``is the main belief. It
will never end.''
</P>
<P>
   If you go to summer camp, your head will be filled with violence
and anti-Israel incitement. One trainer, Lawy Abu, drills
Palestinian children in battle techniques, using ``tires, plaster,
and nails.'' Another teaches them how to use a rifle. In one
commercial, according to Palestinian Media Watch, which documented
this coverage, ``children scream `Commando!' and jump into a
burning ring.'' A PA-TV broadcast aired on July 19 showed campers
standing at attention before ``a huge picture of the Temple Mount''
_ Judaism's holiest site _ ``covered with blood, arms, and heads,
and with Arabian horses going up.''
</P>
<P>
   The camps indoctrinate kids in the belief that all of Israel is
occupied land waiting to be ``liberated.'' Children are organized
into brigades named for Israeli cities _ the Safed brigade, the
Tiberias brigade, etc. They wear shirts emblazoned with a map of
``Palestine'' on which Israel has been wiped out. No attention, it
seems, is devoted to the Oslo accords or their requirement to
``foster mutual understanding and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you're a Palestinian kid who's interested in peace, not war.
So you forget about camp. You decide to surf the Internet, check
out the brand-new Fatah website. After all, Fatah is the PLO
faction led by Arafat himself _ Arafat who signed the accords with
Israel, Arafat who renounced terror, Arafat who won the Nobel Prize
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   You visit www.fateh.org. Opening image: A map of Israel pinned
behind crossed guns with a grenade underneath. You click on
Publications. Click on Constitution. Before you is the charter of
the PLO's largest component.
</P>
<P>
   It is raw propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Palestinian struggle is part and parcel of the worldwide
struggle against Zionism, colonialism, and international
imperialism.''
</P>
<P>
   _``The Zionist Movement is racial, colonial, and aggressive in
ideology, goals, organization, and method.''
</P>
<P>
   _``Liberating Palestine ... is an Arab, religious, and human
obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fatah's goal is the ``complete liberation of Palestine and
eradication of Zionist economic, political, military and cultural
existence'' _ i.e., Israel's extermination. And the way to achieve
that goal? It's spelled out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armed struggle is a strategy and not a tactic ... Armed
revolution is a decisive factor in the liberation fight and in
uprooting the Zionist existence. This struggle will not cease
unless the Zionist state is demolished and Palestine is completely
liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)This(unitals) is the new website of Arafat the
peacemaker? You search for the word ``peace.'' It isn't there. You
look for a mention of Oslo. None. Instead you find that Fatah
opposes ``any political ... alternative to demolishing the Zionist
occupation in Palestine.'' Arafat has gone on the Internet with a
message not of peace, but of total and unrelenting war.
</P>
<P>
   Summer camps full of hate. A web site calling for nonstop
terrorism. And more than that: schoolbooks that preach violence
against Jews. Kids' TV shows that glorify suicide bombers.
</P>
<P>
   You're a Palestinian child. This summer, peace should be
embracing and inspiring you. But everywhere you turn, your leaders
teach you to hate. To them, there is no peace process, no
coexistence, no living with Jews in neighborly accord. There is
only jihad. They have no intention of living up to their treaties.
Or of letting you live to them, either.

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I used to feel bad about how lazy I got when I hit Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I would arrive late Friday night at our cabin in the
woods. By flashlight, we'd unroll our double sleeping bag, place it
on the king-size platform we'd built ourselves, and sink into the
foam mat for a good night's sleep. In the morning, when the sun
streamed in and fresh air blew in through the screens, I'd  &UR; open my
eyes, praise the Lord for paradise, and go back to sleep. When I
got up, somewhere between 10 and 11, I'd eat the breakfast Jack had
prepared over the fire in our outdoor cooking area and make my way
to a hammock, one of two we'd strung between trees near our redwood
table. Then the two of us would read, or rock, or simply watch pine
needles falling from the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I'd wash the breakfast dishes in stream water Jack
had heated for me on the  &UR; fire; it took at least a half-hour to
clean, rinse, wipe, and put away a dozen objects. Sometimes I'd
find the energy to collect kindling for our evening fire, but when
that was done, there was nothing either one of us needed to do.
Often after lunch, I'd climb back into our sleeping bag and take a
nap. A trip to the general store 10 minutes away was a major event.
Playing cards was our equivalent of a night on the town. After
dark, we'd blow out the candles and go to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   It felt like the minute I hit Vermont, I turned into a slug _ no
energy, no backbone, no get-up-and-go. My limbs felt heavy. My
brain had all the sharpness of a marshmallow. My mind wandered from
tree to bird to sky to the fact that I was ready to eat again. Who
was this lazy ne'er-do-well? I didn't recognize the suddenly
aimless and terminally lethargic creature taking my energetic
place. I was a little ashamed of the fact that there was a sloth
lurking in my otherwise type A personality.
</P>
<P>
   I started looking at this phenomenon differently last summer,
following lunch with a friend's daughter, who was home from Santa
Fe for a brief visit. She was uncomfortable being back in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not used to this frantic pace any more,'' Ali confided.
``It feels to me like everybody here runs all the time and it
grates on my nerves. I've gotten used to moving at nature's pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Nature's pace. What a stunning idea. Perhaps all this time I'd
believed I was approaching a dead stop, I'd actually been slowing
down enough to enter into the rhythm of the life around me.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's pace. Slow enough to enjoy the song water sings when it
splashes over stones and to notice a peculiar egg mass attached to
a rock in a pond. Slow enough to follow an ant industriously
carrying a crumb home and to appreciate the lovely dance of maple
leaves when the wind blows. Slow enough to be startled by the
brilliance of a myriad stars and to delight in the moon shadows
trees cast upon a meadow at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked back at our time in Vermont, I used to feel like a
character in a children's book: ``Where did you go?'' ``Nowhere.''
``What did you do?'' ``Nothing.'' But now I see that I was
discounting all the things you can do at nature's pace.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I did last week in Vermont: I picked wild
strawberries gleaming like rubies in the grass, caught sight of a
perfectly camouflaged trout in a curve of stream, came alert to the
sound of crows pursuing an adversary through the trees, noticed
tiny pale Indian pipes growing near moss beside a trail, watched
clouds shifting shapes overhead, became mesmerized by the sight of
sparks from our campfire sputtering into nothingness, breathed in
the smoky fumes that clung like an exotic perfume to my hair and my
hands, and fell asleep so easily it seemed as if I were inhabiting
a different universe.
</P>
<P>
   Nature, our first nursemaid, imprinted herself upon my senses,
hushing me _ (itals)Stop this silly chatter!(unitals), comforting
me _ (itals)Taste this maple syrup(unitals), instructing me how to
hold the world close _ Simply (itals)pay attention(unitals). By
Sunday I felt like a recuperating patient about to be discharged
from a hospital for the soul. It may not seem like much in the
world's measure, but moving at nature's pace recovered feelings I
lose as I rush though my tasks at home: Curiosity. Delight.
Patience. Playfulness. Satisfaction. Gratitude. Peacefulness. Awe.
</P>
<P>
   Adam and Eve abandoned the Garden of Eden when they set off in a
hurry, convinced there was much to do and too few hours to do it
in. Jack and I slow down to nature's pace and find it again, poking
its way out of wild flowers, skimming ponds on dragonfly wings, and
welcoming us back with the flick of a chipmunk's tail.

`REGENERATION' A TALE OF WAR'S RAVAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Intelligent and more complex than it appears,
Gillies Mackinnon's adaptation of Pat Barker's acclaimed World War
I novel ``Regeneration'' comes at a most felicitous time. While
``Saving Private Ryan'' is showing filmgoers the effect combat has
on fighting soldiers, ``Regeneration'' brings out their
internalized responses to the horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
   Based on true-life encounters, the story unfolds in and around a
Scottish military hospital, Craiglockart, in 1917, and is peppered
with flashbacks and a climactic move forward to the killing
trenches in France. Several famous characters are working and being
treated for shell shock there, and out of their encounters
psychiatric breakthroughs, deathless poetry and complicated new
perspectives on bravery and butchery are forged.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pryce plays Dr. William Rivers, a pioneering Freudian
determined to cure his shattered charges through what might be
termed compassionate confrontation _ a process requiring such close
identification with the traumatized that it begins to threaten his
own sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Rivers knows that Craiglockart's star inmate (and
that's precisely what he is) has no mental problems at all.
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), a decorated hero and formidable
writer, has been sent to the sanitarium in order to discredit his
well-reasoned protests against the seemingly endless, intractable
slaughter. The enlightened Rivers appreciates Sassoon's pacifist
viewpoint _ but only to a point; while he struggles to protect the
antiwar firebrand's reputation, he also passionately challenges
many of Sassoon's assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce), is less critical.
He idolizes Sassoon's political stance and his poetry
unquestioningly. Sassoon recognizes Owen's own writerly gifts, and
if the film has a major flaw, it is the limited amount of screen
time it gives to the mentoring of Owen, who would become the
century's greatest antiwar poet.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is given, quite involvingly, to working-class
officer Billy Prior (``Trainspotting'' vet Jonny Lee Miller), who
comes to Craiglockart mute but soon speaks volumes about the social
prejudices, twisted honor and genuine devotion to duty and comrades
that have created the bloody stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish director Mackinnon (``The Playboys,'' ``Small Faces''),
working from an adaptation by producer Allan Scott (``In Love and
War''), unerringly captures the tentative mental states of men
who've seen things no one should. The film's gray, autumnal palette
also underscores the rough irony of the process at hand: These men
aren't being treated because the army cares about them, they're
just being brought back up to the functional speed their return to
the trenches requires.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Regeneration's'' most appalling sequence, Rivers observes a
more ``efficient'' military psychiatrist electroshocking a
dumbstruck recruit back into usefulness (in a great, if unintended
bit of pop-culture irony, this blithely sadistic functionary is
played by ``The X-Files' '' ominous John Neville). It's as
horrifying an expression of what 20th-century technology can do to
a warrior's soul as the screaming metal Steven Spielberg deployed
on his Omaha Beach.

XERISCAPING: PREPARING FOR THE INEVITABLE DRY SPELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE HATCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rare is the summer without watering restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Wells are shut down because of pollution, usage spikes with
population increases, droughts happen with some regularity _ the
causes don't matter, because these are the hands we are dealt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  For gardeners, solutions are simple: Find more water, either
through a well, which is expensive and perhaps a drain on the
aquifer, or a gray-water system, which is environmentally friendly,
using household, non-sewage wastewater, but still expensive. Or
live with it.
</P>
<P>
   And that means Xeriscaping to some degree. I Xeriscape
(zer-i-scape), though I didn't start out to do it. I was pursuing
low-maintenance gardening and found they are closely related.
</P>
<P>
   Xeriscape landscaping is a 1981 invention of the Denver Water
Board, which borrowed from the Greek word xeros, meaning dry. I
find this ironic, because when I lived in Colorado in the '60s and
'70s, the water board seemed bent on acquiring and pumping to
Denver every drop in the West. Apparently they saw the light, and
they went so far as to trademark the word Xeriscape in an effort to
maintain the purity of their approach. (The trademark went to the
National Xeriscape Council in 1986.)
</P>
<P>
   Xeriscaping is not what a lot of people think it is: rock-strewn
landscapes studded with cacti and succulents (though it can be).
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's a seven-step program for the landscape that can
apply to sparse plantings or lush installations. These steps are
more than water-saving tips, too. They save work and money and
incorporate good gardening principles:
</P>
<P>
   _1. Planning and design. This is fundamental to all gardening.
In this case, it also means grouping plants with similar watering
needs. Put those that like wet feet in low spots and near the house
(where the water is). Put those that want to bake on that sandy
hillock on the side. This makes for efficient watering. Also, use
drought-tolerant plants to shelter the others.
</P>
<P>
   _2. Soil analysis and improvement. Clay soil holds water well,
but it is difficult to wet it in the first place. Barren, sandy
soils are easy to water, but it runs right through, taking
nutrients with it. Improve either with organic amendments. Raised
beds dry out more quickly. Perhaps they should be saved for
vegetables, not perennials.
</P>
<P>
   _3. Appropriate plant selection. Natives are a good choice. If
it grows wild in New England, it is used to wet springs, dry
summers, and cold winters. For a carefree stand of shrubs in shade,
try Clethra alnifolia ``rosea,'' a pink-flowered form of the shrub
that fills our summer woodland air with a lovely scent. The English
are enamored of solidago, which many of us think of as scrimy old
goldenrod (but check out the varieties, in yellows, oranges and
reds). There are many drought-tolerant non-natives, as well,
especially Mediterranean plants and herbs (often the same).
</P>
<P>
   _4. Practical turf areas. Lawns guzzle water (not to mention the
sweat and gasoline involved in mowing them). Limit them to traffic
areas. Keep them off slopes, which are hard to mow and shed water,
and away from shrubs and trees, which don't need the competition
anyway. Use varieties that use little water: fescues for a normal
lawn, things like buffalograss for the back 40 where it is OK to
brown up in summer.
</P>
<P>
   _5. Efficient irrigation. Irrigation systems are great if you
don't put them on automatic. Water, however you do it, only when
plants need it. I shake my head when I see inground sprinkler
systems watering during summer rainstorms, especially now that
devices exist to turn them off when it has rained. I find that a
little wilting is OK, a simple way to tell when to water. Using a
hose is fine on a small property. Soaker hoses work great,
especially since many plants, including tomatoes, suffer from
diseases if their foliage is wet a lot. I don't have any soaker
hoses yet, but my plan is to bury some in the rose garden and hook
up the front hose to them as needed.
</P>
<P>
   _6. Use of mulches. Mulches hold down weeds, can unify texture
and color, and reduce watering needs. They lower the soil
temperature and, in the case of organic mulches, such as bark and
compost, build the soil. There are drawbacks. Anything hotly
rotting can tie up nitrogen (just add some fertilizer), and
dried-out wood chips could be a fire hazard. Too much mulch is bad
(a haven for rodents, an invitation for shallow roots), too little
is ineffective (weeds).
</P>
<P>
   _7. Proper maintenance. Weeding, pruning and fertilizing will
result in healthier plants, which will withstand dry periods
better. Gardening is work; there is no way around that.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of good information on Xeriscaping. It's worth a
look. Good gardeners will find they're already doing a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of drought and summer, hot would describe the music of
a Long Island band that recently played our area: Peat Moss and the
Fertilizers. You have to love that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Cohen of Peabody, Mass. wrote recently asking for
information on Chinese red grass, specifically how to grow it and
keep its red color.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that the plant is Japanese blood grass, Imperata
cylindrica ``Red Baron,'' which I grow. The leaf blades are red
with some green toward the base and look great with the setting sun
shining through them and next to a hydrangea, picking up some
reddish tones from that. They don't want to bake, and they don't
want to dry out (moist but well-drained soil). Partial shade can be
good in hot summer areas. Variegated plants can lose color for a
variety of reasons. I suspect that with blood grass too much shade
would be the culprit in the foliage turning green. The red should
intensify in fall.

BEST FRIENDS DEFINE A CHILD'S SELF IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The calendar is quickly approaching the month best friends
Lauren Buckley and Iris Butnaru hate. It's not that they dread
school per se; in fact, they both think ninth grade will be
awesome. The problem is, they don't go to the same school and never
have. Since second grade, though, they've gone to the same day
camp, this year as counselors-in-training. When summer ends, so
does their daily contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``We miss each other most at the start of school,'' they say in
unison, then roll their eyes and burst into giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Iris and Lauren spent two summers in the Beaver Summer Program
before becoming best friends. That's when they also discovered they
live within biking distance of each other in Needham, Mass. Ever
since then, they're together as much as possible in the summer, at
one house or the other. The rest of the year, they talk a lot but
rarely see each other. Iris attends Dana Hall, Lauren Ursuline
Academy, and not even their extracurricular activities overlap.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the glue to this best friendship?
</P>
<P>
   ``Iris automatically understands everything about me,'' says
Lauren. ``We think the same,'' says Iris.
</P>
<P>
   How best friends come to be best friends and how and why they
remain so is often a puzzle to parents. Unsure of the dynamics and
ever mindful of potential hurts, we cross the line from being a
sounding board to trying to manage the friendship. In the process,
we risk undermining the benefits there are to be reaped from best
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Having a best friend is one of the most important things to
happen to a 9- to 14-year-old, says child psychologist Gil Noam, a
professor at Harvard Graduate School of Education and director of
child development research at McLean Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives practice at intimacy,'' he says. ``It also meets a
developmental need by helping them answer questions like, `Who am
I? What am I good at? What do I need help with?'''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of best friendships begins in the preschool years
when a child might have several best friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young child, a best friend is the last person they did
something fun with,'' says school psychologist Mary Ann Rafoth, a
professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Through fourth or fifth grade, something fun continues to be
what brings two children together, especially boys. ``For them,
becoming best friends almost always follows from an acitivity,''
says Rafoth. ``It's based on something very concrete: `What is your
entertainment value to me?'''
</P>
<P>
   For girls, the opposite tends to be true, says psychologist Judy
Jordan of the Stone Center at Wellesley College: ``They decide they
like to be together and then choose an activity to do together. If
the activity stops being fun for one, there's lots of accommodation
to preserve the friendship.'' With boys, it's likely the friendship
would be sacrificed for the activity.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that boys don't develop loyalty; by 12, the typical boy
has one friend he values most, even if he plays with several boys
at a time. For a girl, however, by 10, being entertained becomes
less important than being understood, and a best friendship makes
the leap into sharing feelings and secrets. ``Girls get together
just to talk,'' says Rafoth. ``If boys share secrets, it happens
during an activity.'' Iris says age 10 was exactly when her
friendship with Lauren intensified. ``In fifth grade, I didn't have
a good year,'' she says. ``I'd go to her to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because girls' friendships are so intense, there's more
potential for hurt. Jordan says, ``Best friends is a currency: `I
won't be your best friend anymore!' is a terrible threat to hurl.''
</P>
<P>
   It's things like this that prompt parents to leap to action.
``We panic and intervene when we shouldn't,'' says developmental
psychologist Robert Selman, who researches children's friendships
at Judge Baker Children's Center and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He tells parents that one function of best friendships is to
help children learn to handle conflict. ``Most of the small stuff,
parents don't even hear about,'' says Selman. ``If your best friend
betrays you, you're learning about trust: `Maybe this isn't the
person to share my secrets with.'''
</P>
<P>
   Boys tend to be more forgiving about perceived betrayals than
girls but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt them as much or that
the friendship doesn't matter. Selman says boys let time pass, get
involved in an activity, and maybe talk about what happened, maybe
not. Girls agonize: ``Should I call? What should I say?'''
</P>
<P>
   When a child has a best friend, parents have three jobs:
</P>
<P>
   _To facilitate the friendship. ``Give them the time, place, and
space they need,'' says Noam.
</P>
<P>
   _To be available to help process the good and bad. Jordan
defines that as granting them room to figure things out on their
own, with gentle nudges here and there.
</P>
<P>
   _To be alert for red flags. Selman says the most serious
situation is if one child is in control and the other is the
follower, not just once in a while but all the time. The dangers
for the follower are of being manipulated and eventually feeling
badly about himself, and also of doing things that will get him in
trouble, like shoplifting or drugs. The danger for the bully _
``and that's what this really is,'' says Selman _ is that sooner or
later he won't have any friends.
</P>
<P>
   Intervention needs to be gentle. Selman suggests posing
questions: ``It seems to me like John always bosses you around. How
do you feel about that?'' Expect to be scoffed at: ``He's just
kidding,'' ``He really cares about me.'' Even so, it's important to
present your version of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid is so invested in a friendship, the reality of being
best friends is all he sees,'' says Noam. ``Put the reality of
disappointment and frustration out there: `When a person says
negative things about a best friend behind his back, it makes me
wonder how a best friend could trust him again.''' If there's a
longstanding pattern of being bullied by a best friend or a high
turnover of best friendships after age 12 or 13, Selman and Noam
recommend consulting with a professional.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a typical mistake parents make is to see a blowup as
black or white. Jordan says, ``We either invalidate what happened _
`Oh, you're not really mad at Annie' _ or dismiss the friendship:
`You shouldn't be friends with her anyway.'''
</P>
<P>
   She says a better response tunes in to your child's feelings _
``It sounds like Annie really hurt your feelings; I'm so sorry'' _
and also supports the relationship: ``Your friendship has been so
special, maybe there's a way to work this out.'' A daughter is more
likely to engage you in discussion, a son to dismiss it: ``He's a
jerk.'' ``It's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the gentle nudges come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casually drop suggestions,'' Jordan says. For instance,
``Sometimes friendships take a lot of work, don't they?'' or, ``I
wonder how Josh feels ...'' Similarly, if you see something
inappropriate between them, don't interrupt them to point it out
but come back to it later, privately, with your child: ``What you
said was unkind. It's not the way best friends behave.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing when to put your spin on things is tricky. Noam offers
this guideline: ``With best friends, it's often worse to intervene
than to do nothing. But when your child's in pain, look for
openings and be there when he's struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Iris and Lauren have had few disagreements over the years.
``When we do, it's over boys or something stupid,'' says Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing worth sacrificing our friendship for,'' adds Iris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be best friends forever, little old ladies sipping tea
together,'' says Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   Iris says, ``I want to be a doctor, she wants to be an
architect. She'll build my house and I'll deliver her babies.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Treating a best friend as part of your family, especially
including him in outings, adds a richness to the friendship.
</P>
<P>
   _The typical child under 11 isn't able to empathize when a best
friend's feelings are hurt. If it's a feeling he's had himself, you
can remind him, ``Remember when ...?'' Otherwise, offer the
friend's perspective, but keep your expectations low.
</P>
<P>
   _Use a best friend's negative behavior to talk about what
characteristics attract and keep friends: ``What's it like to be
friends with someone who lies?''
</P>
<P>
   _Don't discourage a best friendship that crosses age boundaries.
Chronological age doesn't speak to maturation level.
</P>
<P>
   _Sometimes misunderstandings between best friends are a result
of too much time together. Build in some space for them.
</P>
<P>
   _When best friends break up, provide help in putting the
friendship in perspective but back off from the subject quickly.
It's often too painful for them to dwell on.
</P>
<P>
   _Best friends who have been separated during the summer often
have a rocky period when they first come back together.
</P>
<P>
   _Don't be concerned if your older child doesn't have a single
best friend, as long as he has friends who call him and whom he can
call.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ As they learn to walk, babies often walk on their
toes. It helps them feel balanced and usually disappears within a
few months, according to ``The Parents' Answer Book,''  &QL;

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Like its predecessor ``Waiting to Exhale,'' ``How
Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is a luxuriously appointed soap opera
with just enough sass to make it seem like something more.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps its main plus, in what's emerging as the Terry McMillan
tradition (she adapted both films from her novels, with the help of
screenwriter Ron Bass), ``Stella'' cannily fills an empty niche in
the women's picture world.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Exhale'' was the first major movie to focus on the romantic
travails of middle-class African-American women, ``Groove'' is the
first Hollywood film in a long time to suggest that mature women
can find real happiness with younger men. An impossibly idealized
younger man, in this case, who makes a lot of the trepidation that
goes with ``Groove's'' main move rather unconvincing. But what the
heck? Men have enjoyed this particular movie fantasy for decades,
and there's no denying that this show looks real good viewed from
the feminine perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Bassett plays Stella, who's pretty ideal herself. She's a
40-year-old San Francisco stockbroker who works hard, works out
harder and takes excellent care of her son, Quincy (Michael J.
Pagan), her troublesome sisters Vanessa (``Jerry Maguire's'' Regina
King) and Angela (Suzzanne Douglas), and even her ex-husband's
feelings. Of course, like most fictional superwomen, she has no
time for self-fulfillment (scenes in the book involving a casual
lover were filmed with Danny Glover, but excised from the movie's
final cut).
</P>
<P>
   On an atypical impulse, Stella goes on a Jamaican vacation with
her best friend Delilah (Whoopi Goldberg). Delilah is one of those
earthy, man-hungry, life-affirming movie persons who both
embarrasses and encourages her uptight friend to get a little
looser. But it's the incredibly attractive local fellow Winston
(newcomer Taye Diggs) who really gets the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The son, conveniently, of a respectable doctor, Winston is not
only well-raised but, even more conveniently, at that age (20)
where committing to a career path is less important than, well,
fulfilling Stella's every fantasy. Sincere, patient, a little naive
(which can be a good thing, too) and effortlessly charming,
Winston's even cute when he complains about Stella's mild acts of
condescension _ which are the only things he ever complains about.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the big problems here stem from others' judgments of
Stella's judgment. But the naysaying characters aren't privy to the
shower scene in which lucky audiences get to ogle Winston. It's all
the proof anybody needs that Stella, too, is of eminently sound
mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan, a former actor making his
big-screen debut, keeps things plush, posh and lazily sensual. The
Jamaican sequences come close to feeling like an actual tropical
vacation, while the stateside shots outdo even ``The Parent Trap''
remake in the architectural eye candy and interior decoration
departments.
</P>
<P>
   And Sullivan keeps the performances real, even when the material
gets repetitive and contrived. Yes, there's the ``touching'' death
of a ``beloved'' side character. Indeed, the film's comic relief
oscillates between too broad at some points and too arch at others.
And of course, the story climaxes on the same, forced Hollywood
note as every other commercial romance of the last dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   Flawed as it is, though, ``Groove'' nevertheless charms the
pants off you as effectively as Winston does Stella. And unlike
him, the movie, at least, has flaws it has to work past.

`REGENERATION' A TALE OF WAR'S RAVAGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3{ Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Intelligent and more complex than it appears,
Gillies Mackinnon's adaptation of Pat Barker's acclaimed World War
I novel ``Regeneration'' comes at a most felicitous time. While
``Saving Private Ryan'' is showing filmgoers the effect combat has
on fighting soldiers, ``Regeneration'' brings out their
internalized responses to the horrors of war.
</P>
<P>
   Based on true-life encounters, the story unfolds in and around a
Scottish military hospital, Craiglockart, in 1917, and is peppered
with flashbacks and a climactic move forward to the killing
trenches in France. Several famous characters are working and being
treated for shell shock there, and out of their encounters
psychiatric breakthroughs, deathless poetry and complicated new
perspectives on bravery and butchery are forged.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pryce plays Dr. William Rivers, a pioneering Freudian
determined to cure his shattered charges through what might be
termed compassionate confrontation _ a process requiring such close
identification with the traumatized that it begins to threaten his
own sanity.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Rivers knows that Craiglockart's star inmate (and
that's precisely what he is) has no mental problems at all.
Siegfried Sassoon (James Wilby), a decorated hero and formidable
writer, has been sent to the sanitarium in order to discredit his
well-reasoned protests against the seemingly endless, intractable
slaughter. The enlightened Rivers appreciates Sassoon's pacifist
viewpoint _ but only to a point; while he struggles to protect the
antiwar firebrand's reputation, he also passionately challenges
many of Sassoon's assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, Wilfred Owen (Stuart Bunce), is less critical.
He idolizes Sassoon's political stance and his poetry
unquestioningly. Sassoon recognizes Owen's own writerly gifts, and
if the film has a major flaw, it is the limited amount of screen
time it gives to the mentoring of Owen, who would become the
century's greatest antiwar poet.
</P>
<P>
   More attention is given, quite involvingly, to working-class
officer Billy Prior (``Trainspotting'' vet Jonny Lee Miller), who
comes to Craiglockart mute but soon speaks volumes about the social
prejudices, twisted honor and genuine devotion to duty and comrades
that have created the bloody stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish director Mackinnon (``The Playboys,'' ``Small Faces''),
working from an adaptation by producer Allan Scott (``In Love and
War''), unerringly captures the tentative mental states of men
who've seen things no one should. The film's gray, autumnal palette
also underscores the rough irony of the process at hand: These men
aren't being treated because the army cares about them, they're
just being brought back up to the functional speed their return to
the trenches requires.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Regeneration's'' most appalling sequence, Rivers observes a
more ``efficient'' military psychiatrist electroshocking a
dumbstruck recruit back into usefulness (in a great, if unintended
bit of pop-culture irony, this blithely sadistic functionary is
played by ``The X-Files' '' ominous John Neville). It's as
horrifying an expression of what 20th-century technology can do to
a warrior's soul as the screaming metal Steven Spielberg deployed
on his Omaha Beach.

MARKET DEFLATES HIGH-FLYING BANK STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days, you take comfort where you can find it.
</P>
<P>
   At Fleet Financial Group Inc., the stock is down more than 11
percent in just the last 3 1/2 weeks. Then again, the stock of
chief competitor BankBoston Corp. is off nearly 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rebound Wednesday, bank stocks have been getting
crushed since the stock market started selling off in mid-July. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index is down 8.64 percent since July 17, but
the Keefe Bank index has declined 15.05 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All 24 banks on the list, save one, have lost at least 10
percent in that period. In general, the smaller banks have gotten
hit even harder.
</P>
<P>
   Says Nancy Bush, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co.: ``There is a
real fear factor in the market right now, particularly with any
company that has any kind of international exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   With the single exception of the fourth quarter in 1994, bank
stocks have been the place to be this decade. From the start of
1990 through the end of last month, super-regional bank stocks
showed an average total return of 465 percent, easily outdistancing
the S&AMP;P, which gained about 300 percent in that same period.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks were driven by a near-perfect environment for banks:
steadily improving earnings and quality of loans; managements
focused on increasing shareholder value through stock buybacks and
other means; and a decade of merger mania.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that four-letter word _ Asia _ is raising fears the party
could be over. If Asia sparks a slowdown in the US economy,
analysts say, it will almost certainly slow loan demand and hurt
bank revenues. If a slowdown turns into a recession, look for the
banks to face higher loan losses. Any sell-off on Wall Street could
hurt profits in the investment banking, asset management, and
brokerage units the banks have been spending so much money to build
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Asia, making money in banking has been getting
tougher. The margins in the banks' core lending businesses have
been narrowing with the flattening yield curve _ that is, the
narrowing of the gap between the short-term interest rates they pay
for money and the long-term rates they charge on loans. Competition
to make loans has made pricing extraordinarily competitive. Bank
earnings are expected to grow 10 percent next year, but the rate of
earnings growth is no longer accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous investors haven't been waiting around to find out.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which gets nearly 20 percent of its profits from its
Latin America operations, has been among the hardest hit among the
largest banks, falling from a 52-week high of 58 11/16 on July 8 to
44 11/16Tuesday. It rebounded Wednesday to close at 45 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sell first and ask questions later,'' said John
Kahwaty, BankBoston's director of investor relations. He says the
bank remains comfortable with Wall Street's current earnings
estimates of $3.20 a share this year and $3.54 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet, on the other hand, has been hurt by concern that a
downturn on Wall Street could cut profits from its discount
brokerage unit, Quick &AMP; Reilly, and its money management unit,
analysts and fund managers say. The bank's stock has fallen from a
July peak of 88 7/16 to 78 1/4 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene McQuade, Fleet's chief financial officer, predicted
profits will be higher in the second half of the year than the
first half, a record period. ``There is nothing happening on the
world front that would cause us to change our guidance'' on
earnings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is a nonissue with Fleet, McQuade said: ``We make more
loans in Brockton than we do in Bangkok.''
</P>
<P>
   James Schmidt, who runs the highly regarded John Hancock
Regional Bank fund, thinks the sell-off among banks is improving
the value of the stocks. For instance, the multiple to 1999
earnings (a ratio of stock price to estimated per-share profits)
among issues in the Keefe Bank index is about 63 percent of the
multiple to earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 index; that multiple was
pushing 75 percent last year, he says. BankBoston, he notes, is
selling at a discount to the Keefe index.
</P>
<P>
   David Ellison, who runs the FBR Financial Services fund, is
looking for bank stocks to move sideways until the Asia shock
subsides. ``There just isn't enough in the fundamental side to make
things go up, or blow up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This has been one ugly period, he admitted. ``But the fact that
people are starting to notice, we must be near the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so he hopes.
</P>
<P>

The Red Herring

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Thomas H. Lee &AMP; Co., the Boston buyout firm, is close to a deal
to dump Seattle-based Cinnabon Inc. The maker of those tasty but
over-priced sticky buns has been a dog of an investment for Lee,
which owns more than 50 percent of the company. Cinnabon has more
than 300 stores nationwide and sales of just under $100 million. No
word on the buyer.

GETTING NUDE IN `GROOVE'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another advantage of playing the mature female
partner in a movie romance: You don't have to get naked for the
love scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to take all my clothes off and show it up on a
big ol' screen for all the world to see,'' says Angela Bassett,
star of the sensual romance ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
``Especially not after `What's Love Got to Do With It,' and all the
attention I got based on my physicality in that movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was just dancing and arms showing and shimmying, so I
can imagine ... No, I couldn't imagine. I dare not imagine ... what
would happen if I show my birthday suit up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to a point where Angela said, `I'm not comfortable
doing certain things','' says ``Groove'' director Kevin Rodney
Sullivan. ``Then I had to figure out how to communicate this idea
with no wasted motion in the two love scenes. But in general, your
imagination is more powerful than the camera can ever be. So my
approach was to get you, the viewer, to bring your own
sensibilities to bear on those scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everything was left to the imagination. Taye Diggs,
the 26-year-old actor who plays Stella's Jamaican lover in the
movie, drops trou on camera for both of the film's steamy sex
scenes. How does he feel about being lustfully objectified?
</P>
<P>
   ``It trips me out,'' Diggs says. ``It didn't bother me at the
time we shot it, but I get a little embarrassed by it now. Luckily,
I saw it in a screening room with just me and my girl and the man
operating the projector.''
</P>
<P>
   The significant other's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved it,'' Diggs says. ``But she sees that movie every
day.''

NEW LEAGUES FACE JUMP BALL FOR FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three new professional basketball leagues, including
two with prospective franchises in Boston, are shooting to be up
and running by November 1999, rivaling the NCAA for the best
players in the country and preparing them to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the most talented high school players in the
country academically ineligible for college play, and an increasing
number foregoing most or all of their college eligibility to jump
to the big time, the leagues are seeking to garner many of the best
young players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But will corporate America ante up the necessary sponsorship
fees and other financial support to make the leagues viable?
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Collegiate Professional Basketball League, The
National Rookie League and the International Basketball League are
scurrying to find out. And the CPBL and the Rookie League are
attempting to establish franchises in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a young male basketball player in this country who
seeks to play at the professional level, you have access either to
a league where the average pay is $2.4 million or another league
where the average pay is $15,000 and there is no in between,'' said
Andrew Brandt, a vice-president at Woolf Associates. ``I think
there is a market in this country for more than the National
Basketball Association and the Continental Basketball Association
on a professional level, and this fills the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether all three of them survive, that is a different
question,'' Brandt said of the start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate support is especially important because officials of
the three nascent leagues say that, at least at the beginning,
television revenue or fan support will not generate enough revenue
to operate.
</P>
<P>
   All three leagues are hoping to patch together successful
business plans in part by borrowing strategies from other sports _
minor league baseball is expert at appealing to niche markets;
European soccer clubs have survived on the public sale of stock;
NASCAR racing emerged as one of the country's most popular sports
after long years of operating with no national television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While several corporate spokesmen and their representatives said
they understand the potential for a new basketball league, most
interviewed said they would likely wait before signing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with a start-up league that is difficult for us, and
for corporate America, from an evaluation standpoint is the lack of
history _ especially when there are already other leagues playing
the sport,'' said Tom Haidinger, vice-president of Capital Sports
Inc. of Darien, Conn., which represents companies active in sports
sponsorhips like Bic, TIG Insurance and Naya Spring Water. ``It's
tough to just jump right in, because basketball is so popular, and
assume there will be fan, and television, and sponsorship interest.
With leagues like these we tend to take a wait-and-see attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some buzz about these new leagues, but it is
not as if there is a hot property out there that people are vying
to jump on,'' said Eric Kraus, who handles sports marketing
projects at Gillette Co. ``They are going to have to work very hard
to tap corporate sponsors who are currently involved in other
sports. You're not only competing against other basketball
properties, you are competing with all sponsorship opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of all three leagues say that part of their purpose
is to fill a low-cost entertainment niche for families and
``basketball fanatics,'' while offering a place for quality, young
players to prepare for life in the NBA. But there is more to their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had the feeling with basketball, specifically,
that there is a little bit of abuse going on,'' said Paul McMann,
founder and president of the College Professional Basketball
League, and an assistant professor of accounting at Babson College.
``The colleges generate a tremendous amount of wealth from their
programs and the athletes generally walk away with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The spurious hope of ``hoop dreams'' is well documented across
the country. According to NCAA statistics, less than 40 percent of
NCAA Division I basketball players graduate, the lowest proportion
of degree recipients in any sport. Only one in 10,000 of all high
school players make it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have long advocated that especially bigtime
college athletes ought to be paid, the NCAA and most colleges and
universities reject the notion. Also rejected, to date, are
proposals to lengthen the degree eligibility of college athletes
from five to six years, so that athletes can spead out their
academic workload, and even continue studies for a year or more
after their playing days have ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an increasing number of talented high school
basketball players eschew college entirely and jump immediately to
the NBA. The list includes Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers,
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jermaine O'Neal of the
Portland Trailblazers, Al Harrington of the Indiana Pacers, Rashard
Lewis of the Seattle Supersonics and Korleone Young of the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the start-up leagues would, in their own way, offer some
money for a college education, at a time when the athletes are
ready to attend. They also would provide some training for life and
for conducting themselves as professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International Basketball League values education and will
implement a program which will further develop players' skills on
an off the court,'' said Richard Lapchick, the founder of the
Center for the Study of Sports in Society at Northeastern
University, who will design and implement the educational programs
for the league. ``Keeping in mind that less than half of collegiate
players who use their college eligibility actually graduate, this
program offers distinct elements that will ensure their success
with or without basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's response to date has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leagues may in fact be a viable alternative for basketball
players who may not be academically perpared to handle the load at
the college level and who want to play basketball,'' said Wally
Renfro, a spokesman for the NCAA. ``The big fear is that some
plyers who are academically qualified will pass up that opportunity
for a short cut to the pros.''

BASSETT TURNS TABLES ON HOLLYWOOD AGE RAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The din of complaints has been building since
Christmas, when filmgoers saw Jack Nicholson romance Helen Hunt and
Woody Allen once again seducing a woman young enough to be, well,
one of his wife's girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   It increased with the Valentine season pairing of Dustin Hoffman
and Sharon Stone in ``Sphere,'' then reached Dolby theatrical sound
system decibels with the spring releases of ``Bulworth'' (Warren
Beatty-Halle Berry), ``The Horse Whisperer'' (Robert
Redford-Kristin Scott Thomas), ``A Perfect Murder'' (Michael
Douglas-Gwyneth Paltrow) and ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' (Harrison
Ford-Anne Heche).
</P>
<P>
   Old male movie stars paired on screen with actresses a
generation their junior. Feminists hated it. Actresses of a certain
age decried it. People magazine just did a cover story on it. It's
a problem everyone but film producers seems to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. What's that satisfying sound of relief? Could it be?
</P>
<P>
   Yes! Exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' didn't set out to be the film
that turned the tables on one of Hollywood's most cherished (think
Bogey and Bacall) sexist traditions.
</P>
<P>
   The second novel by ``Waiting to Exhale'' author Terry McMillan
to be adapted to the big screen, the story of a successful
40-year-old divorcee who finds happiness with a Jamaican man half
her age was loosely based on the writer's own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella'' became a movie because ``Exhale'' was a surprise hit
_ at a time, coincidentally, when people were wondering why no
films about upscale African-American life were being made _ not to
counteract a particularly toxic clog of movie-business male ego
displays.
</P>
<P>
   But McMillan and company know how to take advantage of good
timing when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is based on an experience I had a few years back when
I went to Jamaica and I met a younger man _ who was not 20!''
McMillan emphasizes. ``But the story was a departure. For me, it
wasn't even about an older woman and a younger man. It was about
how I felt when I got home, which was very guilty because I was
feeling so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Oh my God, this guy is so young, he's this,
he's that.' Then I started questioning why I was feeling guilty and
what was wrong with this. I hadn't felt that good in years, and why
wasn't I entitled to? Then I started thinking about older men who
date and marry younger women. People make fun of them, but they do
it anyway. Then it became about a woman's sense of entitlement to
her own happiness in general, not just in terms of a younger man.''
</P>
<P>
   Angela Bassett, who also starred in ``Exhale,'' plays the
high-powered San Francisco stockbroker who has everything _
beautiful Marin County home, terrific son (Michael J. Pagan),
supportive and fun-loving best friend (Whoopi Goldberg's Delilah),
problematic but entertaining sisters (Regina King and Suzzanne
Douglas) _ except personal satisfaction. On an impulse, she takes a
rare vacation, with Delilah, to Montego Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Winston (newcomer Taye Diggs), a handsome young local man, comes
on to Stella. Flattered but immediately flattened by ``I'm old
enough to be his mama'' thoughts, she fends off the persistent lad
until, well, she can't anymore. But he's much more than just a
pretty face attached to a beautiful body. Winston's also the
sweetest guy in the world _ and apparently serious about a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the last thing Stella needs. And what she needs most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stella expends a great deal of energy making sure that
everything's taken care of,'' says Bassett, who's portrayed
everyone from Lady Macbeth on stage to Betty Shabazz in two films
to Tina Turner in her Oscar-nominated performance for ``What's Love
Got to Do With It.'' ``She's quick on her feet, she makes things
happen, she's even made her relationship with her ex-husband work
so their son can be raised without any bitterness or animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think she's been putting the needs and desires of others
ahead of her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Well put. But to get to the real question ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Could I? Should I?'' laughs Bassett, who hits the big 4-0
herself on Sunday. ``Date a 20-year-old man? Yes, I would have when
I was single. Sure I would have, if he were mature and sincere and
genuine.''
</P>
<P>
   The age thing was part of the project's attraction simply
because it was such a rare opportunity to play certain emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This film is hitting at a very interesting time, and you can't
plan that,'' says Bassett, who is married to actor Courtney B.
Vance. ``I just knew, when I first read it, that it is different,
the reverse of what's usually seen. One reason why I wanted to do
it was because it's something seen so rarely; it's been years, back
to black-and-white movies, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, not much. And when older women did have relationships
with younger men, such as in ``Sunset Boulevard'' and ``The Roman
Spring of Mrs. Stone,'' they were characterized as ghastly affairs
that inevitably ended badly. Later films, like ``Summer of '42''
and ``Bull Durham,'' were a bit more benign, but they, too, offered
no encouragement that such relationships could possess long-term
viability (although ``Durham'' stars Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins
_ she is 12 years older _ have been together in real life for a
decade now).
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the double standard has always bugged Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wonder,'' Bassett says. ``Did she have to be, like,
almost a teen-ager in `Perfect Murder'? Wouldn't `Six Days, Seven
Nights' have worked with Anne Archer? I mean, would it have changed
these movies so much to include fabulous older actresses? Would it
have detracted from them? What's up with these guys, that they
don't find mature women as beautiful as they are?''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bass, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter (``Rain Man'')
who adapted both ``Exhale'' and ``Stella'' with McMillan, is a
fountain of praise for, at least, Bassett's beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really reverse the situation,'' Bass claims. ``We
don't have an old gal here; Angela Bassett has to stretch to make
you believe that she's 40. She's more beautiful in this film than
I've ever seen her, just breathtaking. She's clearly suitable in
every way as a match for this kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if it was a 40-year-old man who looked as gorgeous
as Angela Bassett with a beautiful, intelligent, articulate
20-year-old woman, no one would say a word,'' Bass acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   People are already talking about one of Bass' upcoming movies,
``Entrapment.'' Something like a May/December take on ``The Thomas
Crown Affair'' (which is currently being remade itself),
``Entrapment'' stars 28-year-old Catherine Zeta-Jones (``The Mask
of Zorro'') as a cop who pretends to be a jewel thief in order to
get close to her prey _ played by Sean Connery, nearly 40 years her
senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of generalities batted around about older
man/younger woman situations in movies,'' Bass says. ``Star egos,
men's fantasies; but to me, it's much more about what is
appropriate to the kind of story we want to tell. In that film,
Connery plays the world's greatest thief who is challenged by this
bright woman from the up-and-coming generation. She's undercover,
trying to entrap him, and the fact that she uses her beauty for
that is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't just saying artificially that every aging male
movie star is going to be attractive to a beautiful 30-year-old,''
Bass adds. ``They're put in a situation of forced intimacy _ and it
is Sean Connery, so it's not unreasonable that true romance would
ensue.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not. But no twists of reason are required to accept the
fact that Angela Bassett and Taye Diggs make one fine-looking
couple. The 26-year-old New Yorker, who makes his film debut in
``Groove'' after a run in the Broadway production of ``Rent,''
found the screen pairing so natural that he's somewhat bemused
about the to-do over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize there was such a hubbub about this,'' Diggs
says. ``When I was filming, I didn't even let that affect the way I
approached the role. I just played this one Jamaican cat; I didn't
take into consideration that she was older and he was younger
because I don't think the character cares.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I am proud to be a part of this, but I also
think that it's silly,'' Diggs adds. ``It's silly to make a big
deal out of something like this. But dealing with the society that
we're in, with all of its goofy stigmas and stereotypes, I have to
be proud that this movie got made.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though making a stand against old-guy hegemony was not her
intention, no one could be prouder of what ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back'' accomplishes than author McMillan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had it with the double standard,'' she says. ``I'm sick
of these movies, and Hollywood should really get wind of it. When I
saw Michael Douglas with Gwyneth Paltrow, I just said, `They cannot
be serious.' These great actresses, the studios think they're passe
when they hit 45, 50 years old. But these guys can keep making
movies until everything on 'em is gray and wrinkled. They don't
even need facelifts to get these young girls _ and we're supposed
to believe that?''

RUBBER IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR FLAT ROOFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The flat roof on my two-car garage is tar and gravel. The
roofer wants to put on a rubber roof. Is that OK for a flat roof?
</P>
<P>
   JOSEPH GIGANTI, Westwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, a rubber roof is state of the art for flat roofs. It was
developed to take the place of tar and gravel roofs, also called
built-up roofs. I think the old roof should be removed first so the
rubber can go on a sound wood or concrete base. Even if putting the
rubber over the tar and gravel is OK by code, taking off the old
roof will result in a better job all around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to find some transom window latches like those
on windows in old schools. Do you know where I might get some?
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES MARTIN, West Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let's put it this way: I know where they are listed in
catalogs, and since the handyman never throws anything away, I
found transom catches in two catalogs: Stanley and Lawrence; they
look the same, a catch with a loop on one part that can be operated
by a window pole. To find where these catches are sold, call
Stanley at 860-225-5111, or Lawrence at 815-625-0360, or a Lawrence
distributor, C.A. Cunningham Co. of Charlestown, Mass.,
617-242-7651.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of the latches in the form of a rod with a
locking knob for holding the window in a set position, the handyman
came up empty.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house is up for inspection prior to a sale, but I just
can't get the rust out of the bathtub. The rust is on the bottom,
caused by wet towels left there for too long. Is there any way I
can get the rust out?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of rust removers on the market, but the
question is where to find them. They are generally sold in hardware
stores and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   One is Rust Stain Magic, made by Magic American Corp.,
Cleveland, OH 44122; telephone 800-321-6330. It contains
hydrofluoric acid, so wear skin and eye protection when using it.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Whink Rust Stain Remover.
</P>
<P>
   Several homemade products are sugarless powdered lemonade
Kool-Aid mix, applied and scrubbed with a sponge. Or, make a paste
with cream of tartar and peroxide and rub it on spots. Or, cut a
lemon in half, sprinkle salt on half and rub.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My concrete front steps are still in pretty good shape, but
the concrete has become pockmarked. Can I trowel on a thin coat of
concrete to smooth out the treads?
</P>
<P>
   BILL SPATRICK, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, and hope springs eternal that it will work. Trowel on a
thin coat of Top 'n Bond, a type of mortar (more mortar than
concrete because it has no stones) designed to go down in thin
layers, without the need for a bonding agent. The handyman has had
pretty good luck using this stuff on small projects. After
troweling it on and waiting about 15 minutes, rub the surface with
a wood float, a type of trowel that is wood rather than steel, and
which makes a rough, skid-resistant surface. If you try to smooth
it out with a steel trowel, you will get a supersmooth surface that
will be slippery when wet, an added hazard on stairs.
</P>
<P>
   The rougher the old concrete, the better the Top 'n Bond will
hold. And, it won't hurt to put a bonding agent (sold in hardware
and building supply stores where you buy the Top 'n Bond) on the
old surface before adding the Top 'n Bond.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am extending my raised hearth by building a frame to hold
the new bricks. I was told to use cement board as a base for the
bricks. Is that the same as WonderBoard?
</P>
<P>
   TIM KANE, Merrimack, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, WonderBoard is cement board, and there are other brand
names as well. The board is made of a sand concrete reinforced by
fiberglass, and it is an excellent base for brick or tile.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>

PEDDOCKS ISLAND COLONY A LIFE FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IRENE SEGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEDDOCKS ISLAND _ When Jack and Mary Downey bought their summer
cottage more than three decades ago, a friend asked where exactly
it was. Oh, the Downeys replied, it's right next to the Kennedy
compound.
</P>
<P>
   Ha! Some Kennedy compound! Do the Kennedys summer with no
electricity and no running water and no cars and no telephone
service and outhouses instead of bathrooms? Do they zip via skiff
to their summer homes in 10 minutes from Quincy and 25 minutes from
Winthrop and 5 minutes from Hull? Do they stroll down a grassy path
to an abandoned Army fort? Do they gaze from their beach at the
Boston skyline and the Nut Island sewage treatment plant? Do they
summer alongside abandoned housing? Do they live in an official
state park and federal recreation area?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not the Kennedys you're thinking of, the ones with
that compound in Hyannis Port. But the Downeys' neighbors sure do.
So do the Downeys and everyone else in the century-old summer
colony on Peddocks Island, a 1 1/2-mile-long spit of land in Boston
Harbor, 7 1/2 miles from the State House. The colony of 47 cottages
is the waning vestige of an era when the harbor islands were home
to fishermen, soldiers, and vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're standing on the other side of Alice's looking
glass,'' says Mary Downey, who will say only that she's in her 60s.
``We're here like the 17th century. It's pitch dark here, and you
see the skyline of Boston with all the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   These days the Peddocks Island cottagers also see the empty
shells of cottages their neighbors have sold to the Metropolitan
District Commission, tangible evidence that today's owners are the
last generation that will spend its summers here. The MDC acquired
the island by eminent domain in 1970, and in 1990 moved to evict
the cottagers by 1992. Controversy led to a committee, which, in
turn, led to a compromise. Whoever owned the cottages in 1990 may
use them for the rest of their lives. Then the state gets them.
Anyone who wants to sell a cottage must sell to the MDC, and anyone
who wants to stay must pay the MDC $400 a year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A long tradition ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, 11 cottagers have sold to the MDC for
anywhere from $4,000 to $14,400, depending on the condition of the
property. A 12th sale is almost final. The MDC sees this as the
resolution of the problem, as harbor region supervisor Holly
Richardson puts it, of ``the private use of public land.'' To the
cottagers, is the end of a long tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, 69-year-old Mary Enos, wife of a retired cable splicer,
looks out her cottage at three vacant shells. ``It's lonely,'' she
says. ``These were all people my husband grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a rustic colony of interconnected families, where
newcomers have been for 20 years and oldtimers boast roots _ and
relationships _ that go back five generations to the Portuguese
fishermen who set up camp here. It's a working-class village where
not much money got you not much house in a great location.
</P>
<P>
   Take 72-year-old Anna Kendall (nee Kennedy, hence the joke about
the Kennedy compound), whose ties go back to 1888. She's related,
via her grandmother's first husband, to the Enoses, whose family
has also been here more than a century. Kendall's daughter,
38-year-old Sheila Martel, heads the island association and lives
in the cabin she bought 20 years ago for $4,500 from her
grandfather's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The cottages in question are fragile, weatherbeaten structures
of clapboard and tar paper, some freshly painted and others quite
dilapidated. Some were floated from Long Island, another island in
the harbor, in 1887 when fishermen there were displaced by
construction of a public almshouse. Today four cabins are occupied
year-round. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Country life, cell phones
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mary Downey exaggerated with her suggestion that life here
resembles life in the 17th century, when the island provided
pasture for mainland farmers. Three centuries ago you wouldn't have
found batteries, some charged by rooftop solar panels, running
pumps bringing water from plastic rain barrels, or wells to kitchen
sinks. You couldn't buy jugs of drinking water to bring here in
your motorboat. Nobody had a beeper or used a cell phone, as the
Downeys once did, to dial Domino's Pizza on the mainland and
request delivery. ``They wouldn't come,'' laughs Jack Downey, a
retired salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, life here remains rustic, out of synch with the
late 20th century. People read at night by kerosene lantern. For
years, cottagers tapped into a line that took water from Nut Island
in Quincy to the fort at the far end of the island, but that ended
in 1990 when a dredge broke the pipe. Refrigerators and stoves run
on propane. Backyard necessities include wash basins and scrub
boards. Want hot water? Try heating it on the stove or collecting
rainwater in black barrels instead of white or leaving a plastic
bag filled with water basking on the roof of your outhouse so you
can have a warm shower later.
</P>
<P>
   ``My granddaughter is 7, and she wants to know, `if you don't
have a TV, how do you watch videos?' I said, `That's the whole
point,''' says Mary Downey. ``Islanders have a tendency not only to
be more independent but also more self-sufficient. You have to
develop the skills for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Island self-sufficiency extends to scouring the beaches for
driftwood and other useful items because it is so difficult to
bring furniture there. Kendall's husband, Wesley, 72, a retired
recreation supervisor, built the benches in their yard from
driftwood and braces that a contractor gave him. The Martels built
the picnic table in front of their cottage from driftwood. They
found another washed ashore that's now on their back deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy life,'' says Sheila Martel, the Kendalls'
daughter, a buyer for Polaroid who one recent Saturday helped mow a
grass road on Peddocks. ``My mother wouldn't let me date anyone who
didn't like the island.''
</P>
<P>
   As beautiful as Peddocks is, with terns nesting on one end and
red-winged blackbirds winging overhead and wayward day lilies from
cottagers' gardens taking root among the wild rose hips and
soapwort, it is not pristine. Harbor water is cleaner than it was _
the other day children delighted to a harbor seal darting among
their rafts _ but after heavy rains the whiff of sewage overflow
from Nut Island still wafts toward the island. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Heyday long gone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early decades of the century, Peddocks vaunted two inns
and a general store. One cottage housed a teahouse. Another
reputedly housed a house of ill repute frequented by soldiers from
Fort Andrews. During World War II, submarine nets off the island
protected the shipyard in Quincy, and up to 1,500 Italian prisoners
of war were housed here. In the era before so many women worked
outside the home, families arrived as soon as school ended and
stayed until Labor Day. Men commuted by boat.
</P>
<P>
   That heyday is long gone. Although a few families still live
here all summer, others are weekend cottagers or visit for shorter
vacations. Grown children often live far from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the lengthy, uneasy denouement with the
MDC. Vacant buildings invite trouble, even on small islands. Last
summer, Marie Chiricosta's nephew found drug paraphernalia in her
old cabin. ``I felt sick,'' says 68-year-old Chiricosta. ``When you
know how I worked for that place. To think that it ended up that
way is hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the remaining families enjoy the time they have left.
They grab a guitar and build a bonfire on the sand _ below the tide
line because you get fire-paranoid on an island with no running
water _ and sing ``Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Children scavenge the shore for periwinkles to string into
necklaces and beach glass to sell to tourists. Jack Downey
remembers the day decades ago when island children ran to him with
a box they had found washed ashore from a Norwegian fishing boat.
Mistaking the Norwegian labeling for German, they interpreted it as
proof that the U-boat captain Heinrich von Fritz featured in
Downey's storytelling was real, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Almost a half century ago, Anna Kendall helped start the
tradition of a Labor Day costume parade to end the summer season.
Now her granddaughter, Alyssa Martel, who dressed as the big rock
last year, and her 6-year-old grandson, Joseph Martel, who was a
bonfire, are talking about putting a raft on a cart, donning
swimsuits, and appearing as a float this year.
</P>
<P>
   By the time cottagers return next summer, the MDC hopes to have
bulldozed the cabins it owns and to have opened a new campground. A
new $2 million pier will be open by then, making the island
accessible to water taxis and ferries two years after a tugboat
accident destroyed the old public dock. Perhaps more owners will
sell to the MDC, and the colony will shrink further.
</P>
<P>
   Martel plans to be back _ ``This is my life'' _ and so does
63-year-old artist Claire Hale of Georgetown, whose family has been
here since 1917 and who wears a ``Peddocks Island Forever''
T-shirt. ``I have 13 grandchildren,'' says Hale. ``They're very sad
about it. I just say enjoy it while we have it.''

AUTHORITIES HOPE QUAKE WILL PROMPT SAFETY AWARENESS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Emergency personnel in the San Francisco Bay
area hope the region's latest earthquake was enough to jolt people
into thinking about quake safety and preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, measuring 5.4 on the
Richter scale, occurred early Wednesday with the epicenter about 90
miles southeast of San Francisco, near San Juan Bautista. The quake
caused some damage to highways but no injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a minor earthquake, but it lets people know we should
always be ready for the big one,'' said Sherman Ackerson, spokesman
for the San Francisco Police Department. ``In California, you can
never forget about earthquakes ... but it's human nature to focus
on other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jerry Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't feel a tremor for a while, it's easy to just go
on with life,'' said Ramirez, a San Mateo County resident who works
in San Francisco. ``No one sits around and thinks about this all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross was optimistic that the quake was big enough to
stir interest in earthquake preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This earthquake has been a friendly reminder that emergencies
can and will happen,'' Red Cross spokesman Gregory Smith said. ``We
invite the public to help us meet this challenge by taking the
necessary steps to prepare for this type of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Susie Wong, public information officer at the state Office of
Emergency Services, said some people won't be moved by Wednesday's
quake. She said it would take a major earthquake for those people
to get serious about safety preparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we get a lot more interest,'' Wong said. ``It's
something we have to work on each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than shaking a few walls and rattling some nerves,
Wednesday's quake caused little damage.
</P>
<P>
   Seismologists said Wednesday that the latest earthquake was the
eighth of its size in the past 60 years, and countless smaller
quakes jiggle the region continually.

ANOTHER LOVE AFFAIR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The magical moment Davis Love 3d had always
dreamed about happened a year ago in Mamaroneck, N.Y., when he
walked up the final fairway of the 79th PGA Championship at Winged
Foot with the tournament in hand. A rainbow enveloped the course as
Love won his first major title.
</P>
<P>
   Love is here to defend his title at Sahalee CC, and the last guy
to do that was Denny Shute, who beat Jug McSpaden in 1937 when the
tournament was still a match play event. ``It would be a thrill to
have a chance on Sunday, and I'd like to break that record,'' said
Love Wednesday. ``It's going to be an interesting tournament, it's
a completely different golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Love, whose 66-71-66-65-269 lifted him to a five-shot victory
over then reigning British Open champion Justin Leonard, said the
course (par 70, 6,906-yard) requires accuracy because of the trees
and deep rough that line the fairways. ``Straight works,'' Love
said. ``It's the main thing. You just have to hit a lot of
fairways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're used to that. In most of the majors, your
accuracy off the tee is a premium. But I think this one is going to
be different. One guy might be comfortable with a 3-wood or a
4-wood, someone else with a 1-iron. It's going to be a lot of that,
trying to get the ball in position off the tee and it's not that
short. For me it's one or two drivers on the whole golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Love has been beset by a sore back, but he said it feels 90
percent better. ``The lack of playing and cutting back on traveling
has really helped,'' he said. ``I was fortunate it was just hurt
and not a bad back. So once I got the swelling out and the
tightness out, it's gotten a lot better. I feel fortunate. It was
just a tough time when any time I sat on an airplane of hit golf
balls it never got better. It just got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory at Winged Foot erased the label of the best player
never to have won a major championship and did a lot for his
confidence. ``I feel I've been there before,'' said Love. ``You're
still nervous. You still want to win. You're still excited. You
still have to prepare, but you have a more comfortable feeling
going in. I know what it takes, what it's going to take on Sunday
to win here. I've done it before.''

A BRIGHT FUTURE FOR SAFETY LEE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ If it's true you have to be smart to play
free safety, then the Patriots are academically deep at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   The starter, Willie Clay, attended Georgia Tech. The backup,
Chris Carter, is a medical school student at the University of
Texas. Also in camp is Harvard's Jeff Compas. And to top it off,
Wyoming's Brian Lee is one of only two rookies (along with Peyton
Manning) to earn both All-America and Academic All-America honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of my parents were teachers,'' said Lee, who's from
Arvada, Colo. ``So it was stressed to me every day that I had to
get my schoolwork done and do my share of studying. I've always
been dedicated to my studies. For me, that's always come first.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who holds a degree in business management, has apparently
been studying the playbook as well. Through two exhibition games,
he's the team's co-leader in tackles with nine (tied with defensive
end Greg Spires). Lately, he's been getting more playing time
because of Carter's injury, which kept him out of Sunday's 28-0
loss to the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   He's playing regularly and thinks that makes the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely,'' he said. ``Earlier in camp, I'd just be sitting
there. It's hard to learn without being on the field. I've gotten
reps with the twos (second team) or threes (third team), and you
get experience going up against some of the tougher receivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2-inch, 200-pound Lee was signed by the Patriots as a
free agent. It is rare for an All-America defensive back to go
undrafted, and Lee figures it reflects NFL misgivings about his
lack of speed _ 4.5-4.7 seconds in the 40-yard dash. There are
probably other NFL free safeties who aren't considered fast,
either, but they compensate with experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea, really, why I wasn't drafted,'' said Lee, who
returned eight interceptions for 196 yards last season and also had
eight pickoffs the year before. ``I don't know if I should have
been drafted. I don't know why I wasn't drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the fastest guy around, so I try to do more by
positioning myself than anything. Sometimes I find myself in a bad
position and I'm watching people go by me, but the longer I've been
out there, the more I'm getting used to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was thrilled to be named an All-American but is prouder of
the academic honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the credit goes to my parents,'' he said. ``They kept me
in class and they set the standard that doing my homework was
important. Most important. My parents are both elementary teachers,
so they stressed good acdemics. I had no choice, but once I got to
college, the good study habits I had continued. Even though as
football players, we all had a grueling schedule in terms of
practice time, I was in a setting in Wyoming where there wasn't
much pressure and everything was pretty easygoing.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his football assets, he said, ``I don't think I bring
anything special. I'm not a speed demon. I'm a solid player who
knows his responsibilities. They can count on me to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely it. Lee isn't fancy. He's not fast or overly
talented. But at every level, he's performend well. He has always
found a way to get to the ball. Against Hawaii last year, he made
11 tackles and intercepted two passes, running one back 56 yards
for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in practice, Lee intercepted a pass, as he did the day
before. In his dreams, he intercepts a pass in an exhibition game
and impresses the coaches enough to keep him on. But he knows
there's a long way to go before he convinces anyone he's an NFL
player.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing his performance in camp, Lee said, ``I think I'm
improving day by day. I'm not anywhere close to where I want to be.
I was nervous and tentative at first, but the extra reps are
keeping me more attuned to what I'm doing. My play has improved.
All the DBs help me out. Willie and those guys are great. (Larry)
Whigham has really helped me out as far as how much communication
you need on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough job covering these receivers. My heart goes out
to the corners on every play. The receivers are top-level. I can't
give them an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't do it with speed or experience, then what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself someone who can get the receivers down,''
said Lee. ``I'm the last person out there and I have to get them
down. I'm not a big hitter. I'm not going to hurt anyone out there.
Anyway, every time I try to line someone up for a big hit, they go
right by me. So I try to do things that are technically sound. It
may not be flashy, but it's always worked for me. I've been able to
do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   As a free agent, he had a few job opportunities other than New
England. But being a West Coast kid all his life, he wanted to
explore the world a little. When his agent mentioned New England,
he jumped at the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like the best opportunity for me professionally,''
said Lee. ``It was a location I'd never experienced. I'd never been
out this way. Being out in the Boston area excited me. Even if I
don't make it, it's something I wanted to experience.''
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't make it, Lee has at least experienced an NFL camp.
He thinks he can hold his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can play,'' said Lee. ``There's so much talent out
there and so few spots, you never know. There are a lot of DBs
competing. It's going to be hard to make it, anyway. But at least I
can say I took my best shot. If nothing else pops up, I can get on
with my life without any sense that I've left something
unfulfilled.''

TRAVEL LOG  
 AN ANSWERING MACHINE ON YOUR BELT 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is becoming impossible to hide. Advances in wireless
communication keep us in touch no matter where we are. The latest
wonder or intrusion, depending on your point of view, is the
Pocketalk portable answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketalk is like a pager on steroids that allows your callers
to leave messages in their own voices. Its functionality is like
that of a regular answering machine, except that you don't need a
phone to retrieve your messages, and you can clip it to your belt
or drop it in the bottom of your purse. Conxus Corporation provides
the service based on a unit designed by Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of Pocketalk is that you know who called. The
frustration of a pager, even an alphanumeric one, is that you only
get a phone number or a short text message. If you don't recognize
the phone number, or the message is cryptic, you are not sure how
urgent the call was. Newer cellular phones come with voice mail
service, but that's an extra charge on top of the monthly fee and
the per-call charge. Pocketalk fills the gap for people who want
something more than a pager but don't need or can't afford a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   You purchase the Pocketalk unit for $49 and then pay a monthly
fee of $19.95 for unlimited messages. As with cellular service, the
fee covers reception in your local calling area, which can be quite
large. For example, the service in New York City covers a good
chunk of Connecticut, New Jersey, Long Island and the northern
suburban communities. The service isn't available everywhere yet,
but it covers most of the major metropolitan areas. Later this year
nationwide service will be available for an additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   I tested the unit recently and found that it worked as
advertised. I got a phone call from a friend who was lost and
needed directions for our meeting. In the middle of his message, he
said, ``Wait a minute, I'm going through a tunnel.'' It turns out
he was calling my wireless answering machine from his wireless cell
phone. I called him back from a regular old wired telephone and
gave him the correct directions.
</P>
<P>
   As with a pager, you can choose to be notified of an incoming
call by an audible tone or vibration. There are buttons on the unit
for replaying messages, adjusting the volume of playback, stepping
through messages, deleting messages and locking messages so they
can't be deleted. Conxus says that you won't miss any of your
messages if you leave the calling area, because the company stores
them in its computers and will download them to your unit as soon
as you return.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocketalk unit will only hold three minutes of messages. If
you don't lock an old message, it may be overwritten when the time
limit is reached. In your outgoing message, it's probably best to
tell your callers to be brief.
</P>
<P>
   My other minor complaint about the Pocketalk is that it uses a
9-volt battery for power. I always carry a supply of AA and AAA
batteries to power everything from my portable CD-ROM drive to my
Palm Pilot. The 9-volt varieties are the size of four AAAs and take
up too much room. Why don't I just use a rechargeable battery? In
some locations, like a small village in Senegal for example, it's
not easy to recharge batteries. And yes, I was able to buy
Duracells in that same village, but they didn't have 9-volts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, technology is making it harder to hide from the world. But
actually, a device like the Pocketalk could allow you to hide out
from many annoying phone calls. No more dinnertime calls from
telemarketers with their scripted employees who call back
repeatedly even after you hang up on them. No calls from your
brother-in-law asking to borrow money. It is the equivalent of a
private line, where only those you really want to hear from can
contact you. Darn, I gave the number to my editor.

CYBERLAW JOURNAL  
 NO RUSH TO UPDATE COPYRIGHT LAW, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is poised to pass a complex new law to protect the
owners of music, art and prose from the evils of mass duplication
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But I. Trotter Hardy, a law professor who recently concluded a
government-financed study of the problems of copyright protection
in the digital age, thinks the new law is a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush to legislation concerns me,'' said Hardy, a professor
at the College of William and Mary School of Law in Williamsburg,
Va., and a well-respected Internet scholar. In a recent interview,
he said he believed the current copyright law, which is written in
general terms, is ``broad enough'' to combat today's Internet
copyright pirates as well as the unforeseen rogues around the
technology bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``An amended copyright law creates complexity and invites
further amendments'' from special interest groups, Hardy said.
``After a point, it becomes very hard for average people to keep up
and know what the new law means and how the new parts are related
to the old parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a calm and unpretentious academic, added that the
proposed law passed by the House earlier this week singles out the
new technology of the Internet -- digital information. ``That's a
mistake because technology evolves,'' Hardy said. ``In time the new
law may become unstable.'' .
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed by the House on
Aug. 4, ratifies international copyright treaties on digital
information signed at the World Intellectual Property
Organization's Geneva conference in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the House bill grants Internet service
providers like America Online immunity from copyright infringements
made by their customers, so long as the ISP had no knowledge of the
misdeeds. It also makes it a crime for someone to create or sell
any technology that could be used to crack a copyright protection
device, like an encryption system, although the bill includes an
exemption for certain encryption researchers.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate version of the bill, passed last May, differs from the
House bill in some respects, including the exemption for encryption
research. Congress will have to smooth out the wrinkles before
submitting the legislation to President Clinton for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's two-year study, ``Project Looking Forward: Sketching the
Future of Copyright in a Networked World,'' was financed by the
U.S. Copyright Office. He said concern about a new technology's
potential for mass copying, which he calls ``decentralized
infringement,'' is not a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In his 304-page report, he pointed out that technological or
social change sometimes can bring about a situation where the
``cost'' of engaging in behavior defined as copyright infringement
goes down. When that happens, the ``incidence of the behavior goes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, for example, it was common for
``hit-and-run'' theater groups to travel to small towns in the
United States and give unauthorized performances of plays. The
technology of communications and transportation in those
pre-telephone, pre-airplane days, Hardy wrote, ``was such that it
was hard for a rights organization in, say, New York, to learn of a
traveling troupe performing for one or two days at a small town in
the Midwest in time to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, photocopy machines in the 1950s and 1960s and home
audio- and videotape recordings beginning in the 1970s frustrated
the ability of copyright holders to enforce their rights.
</P>
<P>
   How should the legal system respond to the challenge of new
duplication methods? Hardy said he believed the best answer is a
``technological fix'' that makes unauthorized copying a lot harder.
In the Internet realm, he said he favors the use of encryption,
digital watermarks and other tools that foil would-be copiers, be
they pirates or innocent but misguided Internet users. He also
believes that the principles of current copyright law already
enable copyright owners to go after many Net pirates and anyone who
has substantially assisted them in making copies.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that government could increase the penalties for
unauthorized copying in an attempt to deter the mass behavior, or
throw in the towel and declare certain copying activity lawful.
``But I don't see the need to do those things,'' Hardy said,
``because technology may change tomorrow'' and a new, efficient
preventive measure may become available.
</P>
<P>
   If copyright owners cannot perfectly police the market, Hardy
said he, for one, can live with the leakage. ``We live with a lot
of decentralized infringement now -- just look at photocopying, for
example,'' he said. The gap in enforcement provides an incentive to
develop new technologies to trump infringers, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy is not a newcomer to law and technology issues. Before
attending law school at Duke University, he worked as a computer
programmer and standards troubleshooter for 10 years. After
clerking for a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit, he began teaching at William and Mary in 1982. About five
years ago, he launched a popular and busy electronic mailing list
devoted to cyberlaw issues. He is also editor and founder of The
Journal of Online Law, an electronic publisher of scholarly essays
on law and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In researching his report, Hardy interviewed more than 80
corporate and government leaders involved with the Internet. That
experience did more than help him to recommend a ``go slow''
approach to fiddling with copyright laws, he said. He also came
away from the project with a healthy respect for the unknowable
future. Indeed, the two lessons go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned, I guess, that nobody really knows where the Net is
going,'' he said. ``I talked to a lot of scientists. They were so
busy trying to figure out today's problems. Nobody had a
perspective on three to five years in the future.''

EDUCATION 
 WAR STORIES BECOME LESSONS FOR COMPUTER STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie debut scheduled for tonight will not be in a glamorous
Hollywood theater. No actors will step out of limousines to the
flash of news cameras. And it is unlikely that reviewers will give
their thumbs up or down to the production.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be plenty of drama at the Digital Clubhouse in
Sunnyvale, Calif., where the stars will be a few unsung heroes of
World War II who have decided to let their stories be told in
mini-documentaries made on computers.
</P>
<P>
   The three-to-five minute movies cannot compare in scope and
budget with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Speilberg's homage to
the soldiers who participated in D-Day. Still, they are gripping
true-to-life tales wrested from a war that engulfed much of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Harold C. Schauer's story. Now an 81-year-old
retired businessman, he was a U.S. Air Force pilot captured and
held in a German prisoner of war camp in Poland. Then there's Rose
M. Lesslie, who as a teen-ager helped build parts for surveillance
blimps, while waiting 39 months for the soldier who she ultimately
married to return home from the Pacific. There's the woman who grew
a Victory Garden, so more food could be spared for the war effort;
the former Red Cross worker, and the ex-Navy man who remembers a
visit from Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard his troop carrier.
</P>
<P>
   They and others have contributed their recollections to the
World War II Memories Project, which seeks to link veterans and
others who lived through the conflict with tech-savvy young people
who are preserving their stories in short movies created on
computers with editing and graphics software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought: 'War War II is the defining moment of the 20th
century. Let's see if we can use 21st century technology to
document it,''' said Warren Hegg, executive director of the Digital
Clubhouse Network, a nonprofit organization that teaches digital
literacy through free and low-cost programs.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the young people working on the project will
not only hone their computer skills, but also learn something about
the magnitude of the war that happened so many years before they
were born.
</P>
<P>
   Hegg says the idea for the effort was conceived long before
``Private Ryan'' was released, when, two years ago, a Clubhouse
volunteer asked his grandfather to work with him on a mini-movie
about the older man's experience of being wounded at the grueling
Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Hegg decided there must be many others, veterans and civilians,
who had similarly important or moving stories to preserve, and that
if these tales were not recorded soon they would die off with the
aging generation that lived through them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the Clubhouse began to seek people from the
World War II era to share their stories _ advertising at senior
centers and other places with a poster showing the familiar Uncle
Sam pointing his finger and saying ``We Want You Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, nine of them began working with small production
crews, including teams of Clubhouse volunteers as well as students
from two computer classes at nearby Cogswell Polytechnical College,
who elected to participate in the project as part of their
coursework.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer, meanwhile, enthralled his producers with a story that
began when he was a 24-year-old B-24 pilot on a mission to destroy
a German munitions factory in Hungary. It was the summer of 1944.
Schauer, a second lieutenant, led a crew of 10 men whose plane was
shot down. One man was lost; another, who ultimately lost a leg,
was hospitalized and later repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer parachuted out of the plane about 70 miles from
Budapest. Like seven others who were aboard, he eventually ended up
in a prisoner of war camp _ in Schauer's case, one for American,
British and other officers near what is now Wroclaw, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer spent the next nine months of his life in the hands of
the Germans, convinced, like his fellow prisoners, that the Allies
would win the war but always wondering when. He and his fellow
inmates _ who he says were treated relatively well by their captors
_ followed the progress of the war by listening to BBC news reports
from a smuggled-in radio at night. It wasn't until April 1945 that
the prisoners, then in a camp in Germany, were liberated by
soldiers from Patton's army.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing mood, Schauer says, was not fear, but boredom.
``We'd walk the perimeter of the camp and think a lot about what
was the first meal we'd have when we got home,'' he recalled. In a
world where bread, cereal and Red Cross-issued tins of Spam were
the standard diet, Schauer said, he pined for steak and French
fries.
</P>
<P>
   Amy R. Jones, one of the producers of Schauer's story, is a
23-year-old studying computer and video imaging at Cogswell. She
said that learning his story gave her a sense of the idealism that
must have prevailed during the war years and that is somehow
missing in the 1990s. ``They wanted to go and fight because they
felt strongly about it,'' Jones said. ``You look around today and
no one feels strongly enough about something to say: 'OK. I want to
go into battle and risk my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the producers, John C. Matuk, said he felt an
immediate bond with Schauer, because he, too, is a veteran, having
served in the Navy during the Persian Gulf war. One aspect of
Schauer's story that interested him, Matuk said, was the ingenuity
of the prisoners, who were able to do things like fashion a small
stove out of the tin cans that held their rations.
</P>
<P>
   The movie about Schauer will feature a photograph of that stove,
as well as a picture of the cover on the menu the prisoners made
for their Thanksgiving 1944 dinner _ a picture of a can of Spam
looking slightly like a turkey.

 PROTEST AIMS TO PAINT THE WEB GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ann Stretton is angry, she sees gray instead of red.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton is infuriated when the graphics she creates and
displays online are copied and reproduced elsewhere on the Web
without proper acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blatantly plagiarized, mimicked and ripped off,''
Stretton fumed in a telephone interview from her studio in Madison,
Wis. ``Sometimes it just makes you want to pull everything off''
the Web, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton, an artist who freelances as a Web designer, is a
member of the Digital Divas, an online organization of 50
tech-savvy women. When talk on their message board turned to
copyright violations earlier this year, Stretton suggested making a
Web-wide gesture that would promote respect for the intellectual
property of the artists, musicians, authors and programmers who
post their creations on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As conversations continued, the idea for Grey Day was born. The
Digital Divas are asking adherents to their cause to replace the
opening pages of their Web sites with gray pages for a 24-hour
period on October 1. The pages will be a monochromatic metaphor for
``pulling everything off'' as a protest against those who copy and
disseminate original work without permission, credit or
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The action is intended to demonstrate that the Web would be as
colorless and dull as an empty gray browser window without the
fluorescent images, bluesy melodies, purple prose and silvery code
supplied by the creative community.
</P>
<P>
   Through little more than a word-of-mouth campaign since the
event site was launched in late April, Grey Day has gained more
than 2,500 supporters, according to Timmi Sommer, a graphic artist
and Web designer in Lancaster, Calif. To expand the reach of the
effort, the site's home page offers information in a dozen
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the supporters to date are individuals, but there are
some notable exceptions, including Microsoft in Australia, the
Internet directory Bigfoot and the rock band drivin n cryin.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Young, who designed the Atlanta band's site, said, ``When
you maintain rare pictures, people are apt to copy them without us
ever knowing it. I've come across pages where they use an image off
our page even though we explicitly state that permission must be
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not conceived as such, the event represents
another example of the evolving tension between those who seek to
maintain the anything-goes spirit of the early Internet and those
who are conscious of the more commercial nature of the mass medium
it is rapidly becoming.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the Digital Divas are not proposing a particular
solution to the problem of copyright infringement other than
education, hoping that an increased awareness of the value of
intellectual property will reduce the number of violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is just plain ignorance,'' Stretton said. ``I
don't mean ignorance as a bad word. They (copyright violators) just
don't know. Mainly, those are the people we're targeting. You can't
change someone who's decided to be a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer actually opposes legislative attempts to deal with the
issue, preferring a more personal approach. ``We do not want some
fool up in Washington making legislation that will turn the Net
into something it was not built to be,'' she said. ``We can police
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer recently discovered that all of the images from one of
her online art galleries had been republished, in modified form, on
a Swedish site. ``They were giving them away,'' she recalled. ``And
then it's the domino effect. The people who visit there take them
and it goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than retain a lawyer, she contacted the couple
responsible for the site. After an exchange of e-mail messages, the
Swedes apologized and her material was removed.
</P>
<P>
   As always, she said, common courtesy could have prevented the
</P>
<P>
   episode. ``You write the artist, you ask permission,'' she
explained. ``Nine out of 10 times, that person will say yes. Most
people respond to direct communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when she uncovers a violation of her copyright, a
polite request to take down the graphics generally does the trick.
``In the three years I've been on (the Web), I haven't had one
(violator) that's refused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been scant resistance to the initiative, Faith
Kaminsky, a Manhattan attorney and aspiring Web artist, said a few
have accused her Diva colleagues of promoting censorship, a charge
she said misrepresents the group's goals.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony DeGidio, a lawyer in Toledo, Ohio, has a different
concern than censorship.
</P>
<P>
   DeGidio represents the Online Guitar Archive, commonly known as
OLGA. The Internet-based repository for user-submitted song chords
and lyrics was shuttered on June 9 after a large music publisher
threatened legal action over alleged copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   DeGidio conceded that few could quibble with the concept of
respecting intellectual-property rights. But he also argued that
the financial interests of the individual artist should not
necessarily prevail over the benefits a creative work provides to a
wider society. In some interpretations, sharing copyrighted
material is a ``fair use'' under the law that encourages further
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet turns gray, one should not dwell so much on
the poor authors who have lost their income from licensing and
royalties,'' DeGidio said. ``They should more importantly consider
the loss that society has suffered by not having the Internet that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was itself inspired by a color-oriented antecedent.
Since 1995, supporters of the Day Without Art Web Action have
recognized World AIDS Day by blackening their pages on December 1.
Many artists also support the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
anti-censorship campaign by displaying a blue ribbon on their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton said the Digital Divas expect the event to become an
annual one. To give proponents a visual means of showing their
support, she designed a simple logo, a black button, that can be
added freely to Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The button now appears on many of the 2,500 sites. Ironically,
Stretton receives no credit for the design, a situation she happily
accepts.
</P>
<P>
   But another development has probably served to remind her of the
need for the online event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is,'' she said, ``I've seen the button being
used in ways that don't link it to Grey Day.''

SHE MAKES OPPONENTS CRY UNCLE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Her 81-year-old grandmother and three of her
younger cousins watched her play for the first time Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For years, they've been hearing about the family's first
professional athlete, but it wasn't until the Corel WTA Tour made a
stop at Babson this week that members of the Shaughnessy clan
finally got to see Meghann play tennis. She beat Australia's Nicole
Pratt, 6-2, 6-0, and today plays Corina Morariu in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, I am Meghann's uncle and
there will be nothing objective about this column. Having been on
vacation for three weeks, I figured I'd take the easy route back
and interview someone who's not a threat to bash me over the head
with a Louisville Slugger. My 19-year-old niece seemed like safe
subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Meghann is ranked 14th in the US and 84th in the world. She may
not be quite ready to beat Martina Hingis and Monica Seles just
yet, but our planet is a big place and there's a lot of competition
out there.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tickle to have a professional athlete in the family,
particularly when you make a living covering sports. Shaughnessy
family members are trained to check the small type in the back of
the sports page every week. That's how we learn that Meghann played
Irina Spirlea in Berlin and Henrietta Nagyova in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Most families have children who play sports. How many parents of
Little League ballplayers dream about Joey Junior getting to the
majors and smacking one over the wall at Fenway? How many mothers
of tiny gymnasts imagine they're looking at the next Kerri Strug?
How many New England skating dads wonder if the 4-year-old on
double runners might someday be Nancy Kerrigan?
</P>
<P>
   What are the odds of making it this far? The Corsi family of
Newton knows the answer. Ditto for the Merlonis of Framingham, the
Curleys of Duxbury, the Wolterses of Holliston, and the Amontes of
Hingham.
</P>
<P>
   Meghann is just starting to make her way in the pro tennis
world, but she's already played in the main draw of the US Open and
will be there again late next month. In junior competition, she won
the US Tennis Association 16-and-under Clay Court Championship when
she was 14 and made it to the Frech Open final three years later.
Her rank has been going up steadily for the last six months, and
she hopes to ultimately break into the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Her gene pool gave her a nice jump start. Meghann's dad played
four years of college baseball and basketball and hit for the
Orleans Cardinals in the Cape Cod League in 1968. Her mom is a
former model and a professional nutritionist.
</P>
<P>
   I see Meghann now _ a 5-foot-11-inch world traveler who looks
great in skirts and hits her serve harder than Randy Johnson throws
his fastball _ and I remember a tiny baby born in a tiny town in
Virginia in 1979. It was Walton's Mountain stuff. She was a
droopy-eyed blond toddler, always trying to keep up with two older
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 2 1/2 years old, Meghann and her mom visited my
wife and me in Washington. We took her to the Smithsonian and went
to great lengths to explain the importance of a Conestoga wagon.
Meghann said, ``Who cares?'' and ran off. Saying goodbye that day,
my wife bent down and asked Meghann for a ``smack.'' Showing early
signs of a strong forehand, Meghann busted her aunt right in the
chops.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Arizona, she was an unusually talented and
competitive girl. When she was 8, she regularly beat me in games of
HORSE on her driveway basketball court. By the time she was 10,
Meghann was traveling around the country as a finalist in
NBA-sponsored pop-a-shot competitions.
</P>
<P>
   But tennis was her love. I remember kicking her butt on a
hardcourt surface when she was about 4 1/2 feet tall and thinking
to myself, ``This is the last time I'm ever going to beat this
kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she travels around the world with her coach, Rafael Font de
Mora, playing 35 tournaments annually and spending the rest of the
time in Florida, working on her shots and upper-body strength. She
loves Paris and Spain but doesn't think much of England because
``the food is terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lifetime prize money is $105,926, but that hasn't nearly
covered three years of expenses, and Meghann figures she won't be
operating in the black until she cracks the top 50. Morariu, her
opponent today, is ranked 35th in the world and has beaten her in
past competition.
</P>
<P>
   I'll keep my distance. The kid's already dealing with enough
pressure, and there's no cheering in the press box. But if Meghann
Shaughnessy wins the Boston Cup, Steve Burton, Bob Lobel, Mike
Barnicle, and Bud Collins can stay home.
</P>
<P>
   I get the inside scoop.

TRAVEL LOG  
 AN ANSWERING MACHINE ON YOUR BELT 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is becoming impossible to hide. Advances in wireless
communication keep us in touch no matter where we are. The latest
wonder or intrusion, depending on your point of view, is the
Pocketalk portable answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Pocketalk is like a pager on steroids that allows your callers
to leave messages in their own voices. Its functionality is like
that of a regular answering machine, except that you don't need a
phone to retrieve your messages, and you can clip it to your belt
or drop it in the bottom of your purse. Conxus Corporation provides
the service based on a unit designed by Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of Pocketalk is that you know who called. The
frustration of a pager, even an alphanumeric one, is that you only
get a phone number or a short text message. If you don't recognize
the phone number, or the message is cryptic, you are not sure how
urgent the call was. Newer cellular phones come with voice mail
service, but that's an extra charge on top of the monthly fee and
the per-call charge. Pocketalk fills the gap for people who want
something more than a pager but don't need or can't afford a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   You purchase the Pocketalk unit for $49 and then pay a monthly
fee of $19.95 for unlimited messages. As with cellular service, the
fee covers reception in your local calling area, which can be quite
large. For example, the service in New York City covers a good
chunk of Connecticut, New Jersey, Long Island and the northern
suburban communities. The service isn't available everywhere yet,
but it covers most of the major metropolitan areas. Later this year
nationwide service will be available for an additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   I tested the unit recently and found that it worked as
advertised. I got a phone call from a friend who was lost and
needed directions for our meeting. In the middle of his message, he
said, ``Wait a minute, I'm going through a tunnel.'' It turns out
he was calling my wireless answering machine from his wireless cell
phone. I called him back from a regular old wired telephone and
gave him the correct directions.
</P>
<P>
   As with a pager, you can choose to be notified of an incoming
call by an audible tone or vibration. There are buttons on the unit
for replaying messages, adjusting the volume of playback, stepping
through messages, deleting messages and locking messages so they
can't be deleted. Conxus says that you won't miss any of your
messages if you leave the calling area, because the company stores
them in its computers and will download them to your unit as soon
as you return.
</P>
<P>
   The Pocketalk unit will only hold three minutes of messages. If
you don't lock an old message, it may be overwritten when the time
limit is reached. In your outgoing message, it's probably best to
tell your callers to be brief.
</P>
<P>
   My other minor complaint about the Pocketalk is that it uses a
9-volt battery for power. I always carry a supply of AA and AAA
batteries to power everything from my portable CD-ROM drive to my
Palm Pilot. The 9-volt varieties are the size of four AAAs and take
up too much room. Why don't I just use a rechargeable battery? In
some locations, like a small village in Senegal for example, it's
not easy to recharge batteries. And yes, I was able to buy
Duracells in that same village, but they didn't have 9-volts.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, technology is making it harder to hide from the world. But
actually, a device like the Pocketalk could allow you to hide out
from many annoying phone calls. No more dinnertime calls from
telemarketers with their scripted employees who call back
repeatedly even after you hang up on them. No calls from your
brother-in-law asking to borrow money. It is the equivalent of a
private line, where only those you really want to hear from can
contact you. Darn, I gave the number to my editor.

CYBERLAW JOURNAL  
 NO RUSH TO UPDATE COPYRIGHT LAW, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Congress is poised to pass a complex new law to protect the
owners of music, art and prose from the evils of mass duplication
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But I. Trotter Hardy, a law professor who recently concluded a
government-financed study of the problems of copyright protection
in the digital age, thinks the new law is a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush to legislation concerns me,'' said Hardy, a professor
at the College of William and Mary School of Law in Williamsburg,
Va., and a well-respected Internet scholar. In a recent interview,
he said he believed the current copyright law, which is written in
general terms, is ``broad enough'' to combat today's Internet
copyright pirates as well as the unforeseen rogues around the
technology bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``An amended copyright law creates complexity and invites
further amendments'' from special interest groups, Hardy said.
``After a point, it becomes very hard for average people to keep up
and know what the new law means and how the new parts are related
to the old parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a calm and unpretentious academic, added that the
proposed law passed by the House earlier this week singles out the
new technology of the Internet -- digital information. ``That's a
mistake because technology evolves,'' Hardy said. ``In time the new
law may become unstable.'' .
</P>
<P>
   The Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed by the House on
Aug. 4, ratifies international copyright treaties on digital
information signed at the World Intellectual Property
Organization's Geneva conference in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the House bill grants Internet service
providers like America Online immunity from copyright infringements
made by their customers, so long as the ISP had no knowledge of the
misdeeds. It also makes it a crime for someone to create or sell
any technology that could be used to crack a copyright protection
device, like an encryption system, although the bill includes an
exemption for certain encryption researchers.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate version of the bill, passed last May, differs from the
House bill in some respects, including the exemption for encryption
research. Congress will have to smooth out the wrinkles before
submitting the legislation to President Clinton for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy's two-year study, ``Project Looking Forward: Sketching the
Future of Copyright in a Networked World,'' was financed by the
U.S. Copyright Office. He said concern about a new technology's
potential for mass copying, which he calls ``decentralized
infringement,'' is not a new phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   In his 304-page report, he pointed out that technological or
social change sometimes can bring about a situation where the
``cost'' of engaging in behavior defined as copyright infringement
goes down. When that happens, the ``incidence of the behavior goes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, for example, it was common for
``hit-and-run'' theater groups to travel to small towns in the
United States and give unauthorized performances of plays. The
technology of communications and transportation in those
pre-telephone, pre-airplane days, Hardy wrote, ``was such that it
was hard for a rights organization in, say, New York, to learn of a
traveling troupe performing for one or two days at a small town in
the Midwest in time to do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, photocopy machines in the 1950s and 1960s and home
audio- and videotape recordings beginning in the 1970s frustrated
the ability of copyright holders to enforce their rights.
</P>
<P>
   How should the legal system respond to the challenge of new
duplication methods? Hardy said he believed the best answer is a
``technological fix'' that makes unauthorized copying a lot harder.
In the Internet realm, he said he favors the use of encryption,
digital watermarks and other tools that foil would-be copiers, be
they pirates or innocent but misguided Internet users. He also
believes that the principles of current copyright law already
enable copyright owners to go after many Net pirates and anyone who
has substantially assisted them in making copies.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that government could increase the penalties for
unauthorized copying in an attempt to deter the mass behavior, or
throw in the towel and declare certain copying activity lawful.
``But I don't see the need to do those things,'' Hardy said,
``because technology may change tomorrow'' and a new, efficient
preventive measure may become available.
</P>
<P>
   If copyright owners cannot perfectly police the market, Hardy
said he, for one, can live with the leakage. ``We live with a lot
of decentralized infringement now -- just look at photocopying, for
example,'' he said. The gap in enforcement provides an incentive to
develop new technologies to trump infringers, he believes.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy is not a newcomer to law and technology issues. Before
attending law school at Duke University, he worked as a computer
programmer and standards troubleshooter for 10 years. After
clerking for a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth
Circuit, he began teaching at William and Mary in 1982. About five
years ago, he launched a popular and busy electronic mailing list
devoted to cyberlaw issues. He is also editor and founder of The
Journal of Online Law, an electronic publisher of scholarly essays
on law and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In researching his report, Hardy interviewed more than 80
corporate and government leaders involved with the Internet. That
experience did more than help him to recommend a ``go slow''
approach to fiddling with copyright laws, he said. He also came
away from the project with a healthy respect for the unknowable
future. Indeed, the two lessons go hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned, I guess, that nobody really knows where the Net is
going,'' he said. ``I talked to a lot of scientists. They were so
busy trying to figure out today's problems. Nobody had a
perspective on three to five years in the future.''

EDUCATION 
 WAR STORIES BECOME LESSONS FOR COMPUTER STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The movie debut scheduled for tonight will not be in a glamorous
Hollywood theater. No actors will step out of limousines to the
flash of news cameras. And it is unlikely that reviewers will give
their thumbs up or down to the production.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be plenty of drama at the Digital Clubhouse in
Sunnyvale, Calif., where the stars will be a few unsung heroes of
World War II who have decided to let their stories be told in
mini-documentaries made on computers.
</P>
<P>
   The three-to-five minute movies cannot compare in scope and
budget with ``Saving Private Ryan,'' Steven Speilberg's homage to
the soldiers who participated in D-Day. Still, they are gripping
true-to-life tales wrested from a war that engulfed much of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Harold C. Schauer's story. Now an 81-year-old
retired businessman, he was a U.S. Air Force pilot captured and
held in a German prisoner of war camp in Poland. Then there's Rose
M. Lesslie, who as a teen-ager helped build parts for surveillance
blimps, while waiting 39 months for the soldier who she ultimately
married to return home from the Pacific. There's the woman who grew
a Victory Garden, so more food could be spared for the war effort;
the former Red Cross worker, and the ex-Navy man who remembers a
visit from Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard his troop carrier.
</P>
<P>
   They and others have contributed their recollections to the
World War II Memories Project, which seeks to link veterans and
others who lived through the conflict with tech-savvy young people
who are preserving their stories in short movies created on
computers with editing and graphics software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought: 'War War II is the defining moment of the 20th
century. Let's see if we can use 21st century technology to
document it,''' said Warren Hegg, executive director of the Digital
Clubhouse Network, a nonprofit organization that teaches digital
literacy through free and low-cost programs.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the young people working on the project will
not only hone their computer skills, but also learn something about
the magnitude of the war that happened so many years before they
were born.
</P>
<P>
   Hegg says the idea for the effort was conceived long before
``Private Ryan'' was released, when, two years ago, a Clubhouse
volunteer asked his grandfather to work with him on a mini-movie
about the older man's experience of being wounded at the grueling
Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   Hegg decided there must be many others, veterans and civilians,
who had similarly important or moving stories to preserve, and that
if these tales were not recorded soon they would die off with the
aging generation that lived through them.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, the Clubhouse began to seek people from the
World War II era to share their stories _ advertising at senior
centers and other places with a poster showing the familiar Uncle
Sam pointing his finger and saying ``We Want You Again.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, nine of them began working with small production
crews, including teams of Clubhouse volunteers as well as students
from two computer classes at nearby Cogswell Polytechnical College,
who elected to participate in the project as part of their
coursework.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer, meanwhile, enthralled his producers with a story that
began when he was a 24-year-old B-24 pilot on a mission to destroy
a German munitions factory in Hungary. It was the summer of 1944.
Schauer, a second lieutenant, led a crew of 10 men whose plane was
shot down. One man was lost; another, who ultimately lost a leg,
was hospitalized and later repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer parachuted out of the plane about 70 miles from
Budapest. Like seven others who were aboard, he eventually ended up
in a prisoner of war camp _ in Schauer's case, one for American,
British and other officers near what is now Wroclaw, Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Schauer spent the next nine months of his life in the hands of
the Germans, convinced, like his fellow prisoners, that the Allies
would win the war but always wondering when. He and his fellow
inmates _ who he says were treated relatively well by their captors
_ followed the progress of the war by listening to BBC news reports
from a smuggled-in radio at night. It wasn't until April 1945 that
the prisoners, then in a camp in Germany, were liberated by
soldiers from Patton's army.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing mood, Schauer says, was not fear, but boredom.
``We'd walk the perimeter of the camp and think a lot about what
was the first meal we'd have when we got home,'' he recalled. In a
world where bread, cereal and Red Cross-issued tins of Spam were
the standard diet, Schauer said, he pined for steak and French
fries.
</P>
<P>
   Amy R. Jones, one of the producers of Schauer's story, is a
23-year-old studying computer and video imaging at Cogswell. She
said that learning his story gave her a sense of the idealism that
must have prevailed during the war years and that is somehow
missing in the 1990s. ``They wanted to go and fight because they
felt strongly about it,'' Jones said. ``You look around today and
no one feels strongly enough about something to say: 'OK. I want to
go into battle and risk my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the producers, John C. Matuk, said he felt an
immediate bond with Schauer, because he, too, is a veteran, having
served in the Navy during the Persian Gulf war. One aspect of
Schauer's story that interested him, Matuk said, was the ingenuity
of the prisoners, who were able to do things like fashion a small
stove out of the tin cans that held their rations.
</P>
<P>
   The movie about Schauer will feature a photograph of that stove,
as well as a picture of the cover on the menu the prisoners made
for their Thanksgiving 1944 dinner _ a picture of a can of Spam
looking slightly like a turkey.

 PROTEST AIMS TO PAINT THE WEB GRAY 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Ann Stretton is angry, she sees gray instead of red.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton is infuriated when the graphics she creates and
displays online are copied and reproduced elsewhere on the Web
without proper acknowledgement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been blatantly plagiarized, mimicked and ripped off,''
Stretton fumed in a telephone interview from her studio in Madison,
Wis. ``Sometimes it just makes you want to pull everything off''
the Web, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton, an artist who freelances as a Web designer, is a
member of the Digital Divas, an online organization of 50
tech-savvy women. When talk on their message board turned to
copyright violations earlier this year, Stretton suggested making a
Web-wide gesture that would promote respect for the intellectual
property of the artists, musicians, authors and programmers who
post their creations on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As conversations continued, the idea for Grey Day was born. The
Digital Divas are asking adherents to their cause to replace the
opening pages of their Web sites with gray pages for a 24-hour
period on October 1. The pages will be a monochromatic metaphor for
``pulling everything off'' as a protest against those who copy and
disseminate original work without permission, credit or
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The action is intended to demonstrate that the Web would be as
colorless and dull as an empty gray browser window without the
fluorescent images, bluesy melodies, purple prose and silvery code
supplied by the creative community.
</P>
<P>
   Through little more than a word-of-mouth campaign since the
event site was launched in late April, Grey Day has gained more
than 2,500 supporters, according to Timmi Sommer, a graphic artist
and Web designer in Lancaster, Calif. To expand the reach of the
effort, the site's home page offers information in a dozen
languages.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the supporters to date are individuals, but there are
some notable exceptions, including Microsoft in Australia, the
Internet directory Bigfoot and the rock band drivin n cryin.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Young, who designed the Atlanta band's site, said, ``When
you maintain rare pictures, people are apt to copy them without us
ever knowing it. I've come across pages where they use an image off
our page even though we explicitly state that permission must be
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was not conceived as such, the event represents
another example of the evolving tension between those who seek to
maintain the anything-goes spirit of the early Internet and those
who are conscious of the more commercial nature of the mass medium
it is rapidly becoming.
</P>
<P>
   As a group, the Digital Divas are not proposing a particular
solution to the problem of copyright infringement other than
education, hoping that an increased awareness of the value of
intellectual property will reduce the number of violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is just plain ignorance,'' Stretton said. ``I
don't mean ignorance as a bad word. They (copyright violators) just
don't know. Mainly, those are the people we're targeting. You can't
change someone who's decided to be a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer actually opposes legislative attempts to deal with the
issue, preferring a more personal approach. ``We do not want some
fool up in Washington making legislation that will turn the Net
into something it was not built to be,'' she said. ``We can police
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer recently discovered that all of the images from one of
her online art galleries had been republished, in modified form, on
a Swedish site. ``They were giving them away,'' she recalled. ``And
then it's the domino effect. The people who visit there take them
and it goes on and on and on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than retain a lawyer, she contacted the couple
responsible for the site. After an exchange of e-mail messages, the
Swedes apologized and her material was removed.
</P>
<P>
   As always, she said, common courtesy could have prevented the
</P>
<P>
   episode. ``You write the artist, you ask permission,'' she
explained. ``Nine out of 10 times, that person will say yes. Most
people respond to direct communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when she uncovers a violation of her copyright, a
polite request to take down the graphics generally does the trick.
``In the three years I've been on (the Web), I haven't had one
(violator) that's refused,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been scant resistance to the initiative, Faith
Kaminsky, a Manhattan attorney and aspiring Web artist, said a few
have accused her Diva colleagues of promoting censorship, a charge
she said misrepresents the group's goals.
</P>
<P>
   But Tony DeGidio, a lawyer in Toledo, Ohio, has a different
concern than censorship.
</P>
<P>
   DeGidio represents the Online Guitar Archive, commonly known as
OLGA. The Internet-based repository for user-submitted song chords
and lyrics was shuttered on June 9 after a large music publisher
threatened legal action over alleged copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
   DeGidio conceded that few could quibble with the concept of
respecting intellectual-property rights. But he also argued that
the financial interests of the individual artist should not
necessarily prevail over the benefits a creative work provides to a
wider society. In some interpretations, sharing copyrighted
material is a ``fair use'' under the law that encourages further
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet turns gray, one should not dwell so much on
the poor authors who have lost their income from licensing and
royalties,'' DeGidio said. ``They should more importantly consider
the loss that society has suffered by not having the Internet that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The event was itself inspired by a color-oriented antecedent.
Since 1995, supporters of the Day Without Art Web Action have
recognized World AIDS Day by blackening their pages on December 1.
Many artists also support the Electronic Frontier Foundation's
anti-censorship campaign by displaying a blue ribbon on their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton said the Digital Divas expect the event to become an
annual one. To give proponents a visual means of showing their
support, she designed a simple logo, a black button, that can be
added freely to Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   The button now appears on many of the 2,500 sites. Ironically,
Stretton receives no credit for the design, a situation she happily
accepts.
</P>
<P>
   But another development has probably served to remind her of the
need for the online event.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is,'' she said, ``I've seen the button being
used in ways that don't link it to Grey Day.''

`WHAT'S BUGGIN' YOU?' MIKE BOHDAN KNOWS, AND HE TELLS ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What homeowner or apartment dweller, in the city or country, has
not been bothered, frightened, angered or eaten out of house and
home, at one time or another, by a pest?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a lot of pests around: ants, termites,
bedbugs, beetles, crickets, silverfish, and what many consider the
worst of all, cockroaches. Those are just the bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mice and rats, moles, gophers, even a stray
coyote or two, squirrels, birds, and chipmunks, which may be cute
but can raise the dickens in tha garden.
</P>
<P>
   Often when a home is invaded by such critters, the first
reaction is to call an exterminator.
</P>
<P>
   And that is where Michael Bohdan comes in. He is an exterminator
who lives and works in Plano, Texas, and has written a book,
``What's Buggin' You?'' his guide to home pest control.
</P>
<P>
   It is $12.95, a good buy because it contains 240 pages of
information on how you can battle the pest that happens to be
``buggin''' you. If you can't get it in a bookstore, you can get it
from the publisher, Santa Monica Press, PO Box 1076, Santa Monica,
CA 90406-1076; &UR;  &LR; telephone 800-784-9553.
</P>
<P>
   Being a pest control man, Bohdan knows just about everything
there is to know about pests and how to deal with them. There's
nothing wrong with his ego, either, when he says, ``Heck, I may
just be the world's most famous exterminator,'' thanks to
appearances on the ``Tonight Show'' and in other media.
</P>
<P>
   He is also proprietor of the Cockroach Hall of Fame in Plano,
which is featured in the book. So are a lot of funny stories Bohdan
spins throughout the book.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to pests, he is all business, and his advice
is above all, practical. He is also not against using insecticides,fungicides, and other chemicals when and where they are needed. As
with all chemicals, he says, follow the label instructions, use
great care, and protect yourself. He is an enthusiastic supporter
of diatomaceous earth, which kills insects by cutting their
exoskeletons and causing death by dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Bohdan starts out with idea of prevention, and low-impact
treatment, sometimes before the pest becomes a pest. For instance,
seal all entry points to keep the critters out. Caulk suspected
joints, fix window cracks and openings, fix broken screens. Fill
weep holes and other small openings with copper mesh or copper
wool, which will keep out bugs but allow the holes to do their
thing, such as provide drainage.
</P>
<P>
   It seems hopeless to try to cover or fill every opening, but it
is possible, and the more you do the more you will keep out bugs
and other critters; after all, rodents such as mice and rats can
enter very, very small openings, Bohdan says.
</P>
<P>
   Keep down humidity; insects thrive on it, says Bohdan. Control
temperatures, too.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors, he adds, is a good place to continue your fight
against pests. Shrubs and flowers circling your house are pleasing
to the eye, but also to the thousands of bug eyes scouting for a
good meal or breeding ground.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, install a band of pea gravel or sand at least 12
inches wide along your foundation to act as a barricade against
insect entry. Try to avoid planting broad-leafed ivies around the
perimeter. Their wide, shade-giving leaves provide a fine honeymoon
suite for amorous black widow spiders, rats, mice, roaches, and
carpenter ants.
</P>
<P>
   General sanitation in the garden _ keeping lawns mowed, old
plants clipped, and picking up debris _ will go a long way in
discouraging insect pests.
</P>
<P>
   Bohdan devotes two full pages on protecting your pantry, partly
because pantry pests are difficult to control and eradicate (there
is no magic bullet to use indoors), and partly because pantries
contain foods, the stuff you live on.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilate your cupboards to keep humidity down, says Bohdan.
Regularly wipe or vacuum shelves. Keep crumbs off surfaces and out
of those little nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   Opened packages of old food are probably the biggest source of
pantry bug infestations. All stored food should be in containers
with tight-fitting lids. Check packaged items weeky during the
summer and monthly in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Know what you are up against: Beetles feed on prepared cereals,
biscuit mixes, herbs and spices, dried fruits and flour; weevils
prefer rice, unmilled wheat, and dried beans and peas. Mites eat
just about anything. Cheese skippers like cheese, fish, and cured
meats. Moths don't consume foods, but their larvae are fond of
dried fruits, nuts, cornmeal, and other grains.
</P>
<P>
   Store only what you will use in a few months. And as gross as it
may be, pull out your refrigerator and stove once in a while to
sweep out the gunk, junk, crud, and spuds that have fallen back
there. There's nothing a bug likes more than a dimly lit, romantic
meal under a major appliance. Of course, don't try to pull out a
gas stove.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I don't mean to scare you here, but I will,'' says
Bohdan. ``Even if you make sure all food in your kithen is sealed
off from bugs, you still may not be bug-free. A lot of things
around the house are edible for bugs: spices, Christmas dough
ornaments, `popcorn' packaging material, medication, stuffed
animals, even table centerpieces made with dried flowers and seed
pods. So, if you can, inspect these items regularly for signs of
insect life. You _ and your teddy bear _ will be glad you did.''
</P>
<P>
   With all this information under your belt, you might ask, why
bother with an exterminator?
</P>
<P>
   Bohdan answers that despite being a pest control operator, ``I
can remain objective when it comes to the right and wrong times to
call a pro. ... After all, anyone can lay down a few roach
stations, if that's the solution of your insect troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time to be brave, macho, or cheap. If you don't
feel confident treating your problem on you own, it's worth the
extra few dollars to bring in a pest control operator rather than
bungling the job yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of common sense.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can do it yourself, Bohdan says he applauds your efforts
and wishes you well.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200 pages of the book make up an encyclopedia of home and
garden pests, including ants (nine types are listed), beetles (also
nine), cockroaches (eight), flies (seven), moths (four), rodents
(six), and termites (four). Altogether, 95 pests are listed.
</P>
<P>
   With each critter, Bohdan describes it and tells us its size
range, then lists preventative and low-impact treatment, and
chemical treatment. Where there is no chemical treatment, he says
so.
</P>
<P>
   The material is helpful and, above all, practical, with a large
dose of common sense.

GUM DISEASE LINKED TO MUCH OF WHAT AILS US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the more than 200 types of bacteria that live in the
human mouth may be responsible for more than bad breath and
unsightly smiles.
</P>
<P>
   The same common bacteria that eat away enamel and gums are being
linked to heart disease, stroke, diabetes and spontaneous pre-term
births.
</P>
<P>
   When studies linking periodontal disease with what we
traditionally think of as more serious medical problems began
trickling in about 18 months ago, many dentists asked permission to
doubt or at least to wait for more proof before sounding the alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But, last week The Compendium of Continuing Education in
Dentistry published a special supplement, ``Periodontal Aspects of
Systemic Health,'' that points up why we all need to take oral
hygiene seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence adds up to warrant serious consideration of the
internal damage that the buildup of bacterial plaque on the teeth
can cause. Without being overly dramatic, it looks like periodontal
disease _ which is really an infection of the gums _ can be a major
threat to our general well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The compendium is published monthly and approved by the American
Dental Association and the Academy of General Dentistry to provide
continuing-education credit for dentists, including periodontists,
the specialists in dental surgery who treat the gums, bones and
other structures that support the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The link between periodontal disease, the most common of all
human diseases (about half of all adults show signs of gum disease)
and certain systemic diseases is not really new, but evidence
continues to accumulate, says Dr. Walter Cohen, chancellor of
Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now reached a period in our history when research is
bringing medicine and dentistry closer together with data that is
cogent to physicians and dentists and, most importantly, to our
patients,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the need for physicians to stop using tongue depressors
simply to look past the oral structures into a patient's throat and
for the dentist to learn more about the systemic diseases that lie
beyond the teeth and gums.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show, for example:
</P>
<P>
   _The bacteria that cause gum disease can cause blood clots that
can trigger heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   _When you reduce or eliminate oral infections in diabetic
patients, you can reduce their insulin requirements.
</P>
<P>
   _Any infection, including periodontal infection, can impair
fetal growth. One recent study estimates that gum disease in the
mother may be responsible for many of the low-birth-weight,
premature births for which there is no other explanation _ up to 10
percent of the estimated 250,000 premature babies born weighing
less than 5.5 pounds each year.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of studies was published after a symposium at
which the country's top periodontal disease researchers reported on
their work. The meeting was sponsored by the Colgate-Palmolive
Technology Center in Piscataway, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like it's time to get serious about flossing.

 McGWIRE'S WOES DON'T AMOUNT TO A HILL OF BEANIE BABIES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The elderly man wrote to the St. Louis Cardinals
requesting a bat. Well, not just any bat. A Mark McGwire bat.
</P>
<P>
   To use as a prosthetic.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and his fellow players should be happy people are taking
such a healthy interest, considering how fresh the scars are from
the last time baseball played its fans for suckers. Instead,
McGwire waffles between thanking the fans for embracing him
everywhere he goes and wishing they would give him space enough to
avoid feeling like a ``caged animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans show up to the ballpark hours before Cardinals
games to watch McGwire take batting practice. Some of them have the
bad manners to boo when he neglects to launch any baseballs toward
Uranus. McGwire decided one day last week to give himself a break
from the wear and tear that it takes to wage a candidacy for Home
Run King. To 25,969 people at Milwaukee's County Stadium that day,
it was like showing up for Tony Bennett and getting Tony Danza.
</P>
<P>
   The fans booed and heckled McGwire's understudy, John Mabry, on
sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think I paid $80 to watch you hit?'' one fan yelled at
Mabry, who later would deposit a ball into the outfield seats. Home
Run King for a day, which is a lot different from holding down the
job for a year.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing day, the wait of the baseball world seems to
drag down McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr. a little more. Roger Maris
dethroned Babe Ruth with 61 home runs in 1961, losing clumps of
hair from stress in the process. Maris had to do it the hard way,
against the wishes of a public that deemed him an unworthy
successor to Ruth or competitor to Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Griffey play to adoring crowds, yet they seem
anything but poised to break the record. They bristle at the
unrelenting expectations and scrutiny, not realizing how small they
actually are in the scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Smoochy the Frog, Stretch the Ostrich and Pinky the
Flamingo, Griffey and McGwire are nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe knowing the country is more into Beanie Babies than
three-run blasts would help put things in perspective for McGwire
and Griffey. Griffey and the Seattle Mariners are the No. 2 road
attraction in the American League, drawing an average of 30,579
fans per game entering Tuesday. The Cardinals are the third-biggest
road draw in the National League, with 31,801 fans per game.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies promotions have brought in more than 39,000 fans
per game this season in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Collectors have been paying upwards of $5,000 for some of the
retired Beanie Babies. The Beanie Babies page on the Internet
reports more than 1.9 billion hits. Devotees breathlessly click in
to see the diary entries of Beanie Baby of the month, Whisper the
Deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an awesome day already!'' Whisper reported in a 6:39
a.m. entry Tuesday. ``I know for sure that we're having buckwheat
pancakes for breakfast! That always starts my day off right! ...
Early (the robin) woke me up so I could watch the sun rise with her
and Strut (the rooster). It was really awesome to watch. I love
sunrises. Don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, it's a miracle anybody has time to
notice McGwire or Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have scheduled a Smoochy the Frog giveaway for
Friday _ the same day the San Diago Padres are bringing Waves the
Orca Whale out of retirement. Two days later, the Cincinnati Reds
are luring Rover the Dog out of retirement. The Atlanta Braves may
be drawing more than 41,000 fans per game at home, but that isn't
stopping them from staging an Aug. 19 Chip the Cat giveaway. Three
days later, the New York Mets are giving the public more of what it
wants _ namely, Curly the Bear.
</P>
<P>
   And the Beanie Babies phenomenon is hardly a fluke. Frankly,
Americans will take a doll over a historical home run chase any
time. The Postal Service recently circulated ballots for events to
be featured in an upcoming series of stamps. One of the 1960s
winners was Maris, with 342,958 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Barbie Doll got 350,115 votes.
</P>
<P>
   If only Maris had known: More people were interested in what
Barbie was wearing than in whether he could top 60 homers. When
Maris did hit No. 61 off Tracy Stallard on the final day of the
season, it was before a crowd of 23,154.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is power, so McGwire and Griffey should relax. Stop
fighting themselves and the attention they get. Be happy that
people are interested, and rooting for them. There are worse things
in life than fielding a daily dose of questions along the lines of,
``So, do you think you can do it?'' Try being the one asking those
questions, or coming up with alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's manager, Lou Piniella, likens the daily home run watch
to ``a nagging wife _ or husband. You come in and know they're
there. There's no escape.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as that's the mind-set, look for Griffey to continue to
slide. Griffey has homered once in 17 games, giving him 41. He's on
a pace to finish with 57.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, for his part, had homered once in 11 games before going
deep against the New York Mets' Bobby Jones on Tuesday night. What
was a 70-something pace has shrunk to 65. The Chicago Cubs' Sammy
Sosa has 46 homers, leaving him one behind McGwire. Sosa has
managed to get this far without approaching each day as a root
canal-in-waiting. In a related development, Sosa had gone deep nine
times in the past 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure is shining shoes and washing cars to support my
family,'' said Sosa, who grew up in the Dominican Republic. In the
scheme of things, the problems of a prospective Home Run King
simply don't amount to a hill of Beanie Babies.

   BOMBING-EMBASSIES _ TEL AVIV, Israel _ In the wake of the tragic
week-old bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, the U.S. State Department
has heightened security at embassies around the world. From
Swaziland to Egypt to Malaysia, the paranoia gripping emabssies
appears to be inescapable. President Clinton Wednesday ordered a
report on the safety of U.S. embassies in order to ask Congress for
emergency funding after deadly bomb attacks. What's being done to
make the embassies at least appear more secure? Are some of our
most important embassies really secure? Also, just how are embassy
employees coping with the knowledge that they are being likened to
``No. 1 with a bullet on the terrorist Hit Parade?'' (Kaplow
w/foreign staff, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-SCANDAL-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through
Whitewater despite a public that often preferred to hear less
rather than more about presidential scandal. They weathered the
backlash of the Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance
from fellow reporters and their own publications. Now the handful
of journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies
for six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever
appearance by a president before a criminal grand jury. The
persistence of fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely
responsible for keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the
country. (Malone, Cox News Service)

NEW LEAGUES FACE JUMP BALL FOR FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three new professional basketball leagues, including
two with prospective franchises in Boston, are shooting to be up
and running by November 1999, rivaling the NCAA for the best
players in the country and preparing them to play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the most talented high school players in the
country academically ineligible for college play, and an increasing
number foregoing most or all of their college eligibility to jump
to the big time, the leagues are seeking to garner many of the best
young players in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But will corporate America ante up the necessary sponsorship
fees and other financial support to make the leagues viable?
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Collegiate Professional Basketball League, The
National Rookie League and the International Basketball League are
scurrying to find out. And the CPBL and the Rookie League are
attempting to establish franchises in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a young male basketball player in this country who
seeks to play at the professional level, you have access either to
a league where the average pay is $2.4 million or another league
where the average pay is $15,000 and there is no in between,'' said
Andrew Brandt, a vice-president at Woolf Associates. ``I think
there is a market in this country for more than the National
Basketball Association and the Continental Basketball Association
on a professional level, and this fills the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether all three of them survive, that is a different
question,'' Brandt said of the start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate support is especially important because officials of
the three nascent leagues say that, at least at the beginning,
television revenue or fan support will not generate enough revenue
to operate.
</P>
<P>
   All three leagues are hoping to patch together successful
business plans in part by borrowing strategies from other sports _
minor league baseball is expert at appealing to niche markets;
European soccer clubs have survived on the public sale of stock;
NASCAR racing emerged as one of the country's most popular sports
after long years of operating with no national television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   While several corporate spokesmen and their representatives said
they understand the potential for a new basketball league, most
interviewed said they would likely wait before signing on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with a start-up league that is difficult for us, and
for corporate America, from an evaluation standpoint is the lack of
history _ especially when there are already other leagues playing
the sport,'' said Tom Haidinger, vice-president of Capital Sports
Inc. of Darien, Conn., which represents companies active in sports
sponsorhips like Bic, TIG Insurance and Naya Spring Water. ``It's
tough to just jump right in, because basketball is so popular, and
assume there will be fan, and television, and sponsorship interest.
With leagues like these we tend to take a wait-and-see attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some buzz about these new leagues, but it is
not as if there is a hot property out there that people are vying
to jump on,'' said Eric Kraus, who handles sports marketing
projects at Gillette Co. ``They are going to have to work very hard
to tap corporate sponsors who are currently involved in other
sports. You're not only competing against other basketball
properties, you are competing with all sponsorship opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of all three leagues say that part of their purpose
is to fill a low-cost entertainment niche for families and
``basketball fanatics,'' while offering a place for quality, young
players to prepare for life in the NBA. But there is more to their
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had the feeling with basketball, specifically,
that there is a little bit of abuse going on,'' said Paul McMann,
founder and president of the College Professional Basketball
League, and an assistant professor of accounting at Babson College.
``The colleges generate a tremendous amount of wealth from their
programs and the athletes generally walk away with nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The spurious hope of ``hoop dreams'' is well documented across
the country. According to NCAA statistics, less than 40 percent of
NCAA Division I basketball players graduate, the lowest proportion
of degree recipients in any sport. Only one in 10,000 of all high
school players make it to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   While some critics have long advocated that especially bigtime
college athletes ought to be paid, the NCAA and most colleges and
universities reject the notion. Also rejected, to date, are
proposals to lengthen the degree eligibility of college athletes
from five to six years, so that athletes can spead out their
academic workload, and even continue studies for a year or more
after their playing days have ended.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, an increasing number of talented high school
basketball players eschew college entirely and jump immediately to
the NBA. The list includes Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers,
Kevin Garnett of the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jermaine O'Neal of the
Portland Trailblazers, Al Harrington of the Indiana Pacers, Rashard
Lewis of the Seattle Supersonics and Korleone Young of the Detroit
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the start-up leagues would, in their own way, offer some
money for a college education, at a time when the athletes are
ready to attend. They also would provide some training for life and
for conducting themselves as professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The International Basketball League values education and will
implement a program which will further develop players' skills on
an off the court,'' said Richard Lapchick, the founder of the
Center for the Study of Sports in Society at Northeastern
University, who will design and implement the educational programs
for the league. ``Keeping in mind that less than half of collegiate
players who use their college eligibility actually graduate, this
program offers distinct elements that will ensure their success
with or without basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's response to date has been muted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leagues may in fact be a viable alternative for basketball
players who may not be academically perpared to handle the load at
the college level and who want to play basketball,'' said Wally
Renfro, a spokesman for the NCAA. ``The big fear is that some
plyers who are academically qualified will pass up that opportunity
for a short cut to the pros.''

   NY-ETHNIC-ENTERTAINMENT (New York) _ If all New Yorkers share
one experience, it's the sensation of suddenly feeling like a

could be in Tokyo or Timbuktu, with strangers chatting in an
unknown language while intriguing scents waft from a kitchen. New
York is Dakar north and Budapest east; there are contingents from
Ireland and Uzbekistan, Lebanon and Peru. And they hold on to the

PLANE-CRASH INJURIES DIDN'T END JANE FROMAN'S CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have been trying to find this out for years: Whatever
happened to my favorite singer, Jane Froman?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Froman died at age 72 on April 22, 1980, in Columbia, Mo.,
the city where she went to college and later spent her retirement
years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular radio and film singers of the '30s and
'40s, Froman was seriously injured in a Feb. 22, 1943, plane crash
in Lisbon, Portugal, that killed 25 of 39 on board.
</P>
<P>
   After eight years of recovery requiring numerous surgeries,
Froman was the subject of a 1952 film ``With a Song in My Heart''
and host of ``The Jane Froman Show'' on TV for three years in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Froman created a foundation that established a children's
hospital at the Menninger Clinic and retired from performing in
1962.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the name of the fake movie that director John Landis
works into each of his films?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.T.D., Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   A: Landis works a throwaway reference to ``See You Next
Wednesday'' into his movies, usually on a poster or a theater
marquee.
</P>
<P>
   There is a script by that name penned by Landis as a teen-ager,
according to the ``frequently asked questions list'' of the
rec.arts.movies discussion groups on the Internet. He never plans
to film it.
</P>
<P>
   ``See You'' appears in the following films, among others: ``An
American Werewolf in London,'' ``Blues Brothers,'' ``Coming to
America,'' ``Innocent Blood,'' ``Into the Night,'' ``The Kentucky
Fried Movie,'' ``Shlock,'' ``Spies Like Us'' and ``Trading
Places.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the actor Elyssa Davalos, who played Nikki Carpenter in
``MacGyver,'' also play Hillary Grant in the series ``How the West
Was Won''?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: She did _ her other credits include the movies ``Herbie Goes
Bananas,'' ``The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again'' and ``A House in
the Hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Davalos recently finished filming ``Between the Sheets'' with
numerous members of the DeLuise family: Dom, Carol, Peter, Michael
and David.
</P>
<P>
   Mail to her can be sent in care of SBB, 1801 Avenue of the
Stars, Suite 902, Los Angeles, CA 90067.

   As people age, they tend to suffer memory loss. Glicksman
discusses the three types of memory _ long-term, intermediate and
short-term _ and how each is affected by the aging process. She
also offers strategies on how to keep one's memory sharp. ``Much
like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning,'' she writes. (slugged:

   ``Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the

   Millions of senior citizens and their offspring wrestle with the
difficult and often heartrending problem of where the elderly
should live when they can no longer cope alone at home. These days
nursing homes or moving in with the children are not the only
options. Daniel looks at some of the alternatives he and his wife

home sharing, assisted living and continuing care. (slugged:

 By FLORENCE FELDMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

 c.1997 McCall's 
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement
communities without leaving your house? How about chat with others
or find out what events and classes are scheduled in your area? You
can do all this and more at this informative site. Best of all,
there are hundreds of links to other useful Web sites focusing on
travel, health and wellness, social security, services for the
aging and more.
 &HT;    + The American Association of Retired Persons (www.aarp.org).
Here's the place to find out where the AARP stands on issues of
importance to seniors. There's also a wealth of information on such
topics as health and aging, money management, wills and living
trusts, and grandparents raising grandchildren. AARP members can
get discounts on car rentals, hotels, airlines and even online
services (800-424-3410).
 &HT;    + SeniorNet (www.SeniorNet.com). This nonprofit organization's
site offers chat rooms and discussions on politics, travel,
gardening and health, with links to senior organizations and
publications on the Web. SeniorNet also teaches adults (age
50-plus) to use computers and the Internet at more than 140
learning centers nationwide. Call 415-495-4990 for information on
courses.
 TRAVEL  
 &HT;    + CyberRentals (http://cyberrentals.com). Planning a vacation?
Visit this site that lists homes, condos, chalets and other real
estate available for rent. Booking a beach house in the Virgin
Islands or a waterfront cottage on Lake Michigan has never been
easier. Each listing includes a description and photo of the
accommodations, rates and contact information.
 &HT;    + Yahoo! Seniors' Travel Pages
(www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Travel/Seniors/Airline_Programs/). If you
need to make an airline reservation, be sure to stop by this site
first. You'll find information about special fares as well as links
to several major airlines' senior citizen discount programs. Other
features of this Web site include car rental and hotel
accommodations information plus a mechanism for checking flight
times.
 HEALTH AND NUTRITION  
 &HT;    + Mayo Health Oasis (www.mayohealth.org). For information on
health, nutrition and exercise, the Mayo Clinic's site is terrific.
The Medicine Center pages are particularly useful; you can look up
8,000 prescription and over-the-counter medications to learn about
side effects, interactions with other drugs and so on. You can also
post questions to Mayo Clinic physicians and search the site by any
subject.
 &HT;    + OnHealth.com (www.onhealth.com). What ails you? This excellent
Web site lets you check an extensive disease database, gives you a
set of tools to retrieve and save important personal health
information, and keeps you up-to-date on the latest news in
medicine.
 FINANCE  
 &HT;    + AOL's Personal Finance Channel. America Online members will

and obtain expert advice on retirement planning, insurance and
more.

publication brings you national and international news, plus
coverage of the arts, politics, money and technology. The site is
searchable, so you can quickly key in on just those articles that
interest you. There are lots of opportunities to contribute as
well, through polls and surveys.
 HOBBIES  
 &HT;    + Amazon.com (www.amazon.com). With 3 million titles, this site
beats any bookstore, hands down. Here you can read book and music
reviews, purchase these items in a secure ordering environment and
search an extensive database for books on any subject you desire.

engines (like Yahoo!, Excite and InfoSeek) have pages such as this
one. Type in the word ``hobbies'' in the search field and you'll
come up with a page of links to hobby sites. Just about every
leisure time activity has a site somewhere on the Web, be it
astronomy or woodworking, gardening or ham-radio operation. If you
don't find links for your particular hobby on Yahoo!'s page, try

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

 &HT;    GROUP WEDDINGS IN WEST BANK PROMOTES ISLAM, FUELS HAMAS
 &HT;    With photo to be placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server by The Palm Beach Post.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Aug. 15 And Thereafter.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox Newspapers 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank _ On the soccer stadium stage, behind the
multi-colored disco lights and with fireworks streaking above, this
is their moment of glory.
</P>
<P>
   They were 35 Islamic grooms, holding above their heads
red-covered Korans and green flags of Islam. They looked out at a
crowd of about 15,000 people, men on the field in front and women,
including their brides, on the bleachers in back.
</P>
<P>
   This recent rally was the second annual Islamic wedding in
Nablus. This large city in Israel's West Bank is one of several
that has come under Palestinian control after Israel began
withdrawing from land it captured in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding itself is a showcase for Islamic values and, nearly
as important, provides an affordable marriage for couples. Weddings
here usually require the groom to spend thousands of dollars on
gifts and parties -- a test of suitability that is hard to meet in
today's West Bank recession.
</P>
<P>
   But, the event is also informally called the ``Hamas wedding,''
for the group that helped pay the $10,000 to hold it and, according
to some observers, reaps the biggest benefit from generating
interest in fundamentalist Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas, a group known for its opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the terrorist bombings
committed by its military wing, has built a local reputation as a
guardian of Islamic purity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, Hamas is not just the military wing,'' said
Jordan-based Hamas spokesman Ibrihim Ghosheh, who said similar
weddings have been held in Amman. ``These Muslims are the raw
material for Hamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosheh vowed that Hamas' military wing is still seeking to
commit attacks against Israelis, but has been stymied by its rival,
Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   In support and institutions, Hamas is still far behind the
Arafat's Fatah movement, the largest Palestinian party.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the group wedding, kindergartens, health
clinics, universities and even a soccer team, have helped Hamas
gain a reputation for good works compared to the corruption often
cited in Arafat's secular party.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, most of the grooms do not wear the beards of
religious Muslims. They include businessmen and students who rode
to the stadium from a mosque nearby on horses -- the horseman being
a mythical Islamic archetype.
</P>
<P>
   The event illustrates the sometimes unclear crossover between
fundamentalist Islam and Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   They note that the bill was paid by several local charities and
the crowd is composed of all kinds of Palestinians -- religious,
secular, old and young.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a Hamas wedding. Hamas is part of the Palestinian
people and these are Palestinians,'' said Sheikh Hamed Betawi, the
organizer who is a fiery anti-Israel sermonizer and Hamas
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Israeli Jews running the sound system at the event,
Betawi said it shows that Palestinians oppose Israel's policies,
not its people.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding is supposed to be an example for secular
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Betawi said Palestinian weddings are getting too western. Men
and women mix, dance and drink alcohol. None of that will go on in
their weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the west has prospered economically,'' Betawi said.
``But their behavior in the west has disconnected them from their
ties to God.''
</P>
<P>
   These 35 couples had their legal marriages conducted before the
rally, part of a lengthy, multi-step process that culminates with a
small ceremony weeks later when the groom takes the bride to spend
their first night together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have girlfriends,'' explained groom Iqab Jamil, a
25-year-old television repairman, adding that good Muslims do not
date casually, but select a woman and arrange a marriage through
their families.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not a Hamas supporter, but simply a ``a Muslim
without any organization.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Another groom, Wael Hashash, is a 28-year-old student and
teacher of Islamic studies who spent time in Israeli jails for
Hamas activity. He said he approves of Hamas's terror attacks
because the Israeli army has killed Arab civilians.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the group wedding because it was affordable and showed
that fundamental Islam can be fun. His sister helped him choose his
wife, another religion student at his university.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is to show people the other side of Islam,'' he adds, on
stage amid the balloons and a troupe of Arabic vocalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting a week later at a small wedding celebration near his
house -- held in two separate houses for men and women -- he
explains the courtship of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   They barely spoke until their families approved of their
engagement 17 months ago. Hashash would not accept a woman who
would speak to suitors before they were engaged.

YEARLING SALE OFFERS A GLIMPSE OF WHO'S HOT, WHO'S NOT IN GLOBAL
MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ You want to know where the global
economy is headed? Go to the renowned annual yearling sale at the
Saratoga Springs Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
   When oil prices were sky-high, Middle Easterners dominated the
auction. When Japan's economy was hot, the Japanese were the
players to watch. But oil is not as expensive as it once was and
Japan is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, experts say, it's the Europeans' turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around you can see the changing economic power,
without having to read The Wall Street Journal,'' Henryk
deKwiatkowski, owner of Calumet Farm of Lexington, Ky., said
Tuesday afternoon. ``You can come to Saratoga ... and see a good
barometer of the economy as is stands today. You don't see the
Middle Eastern and Japanese buyers as much, and the European
economy is better.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Fasig-Tipton Co. auction this week, the Middle Eastern
and Japanese buyers who have made a splash in the past decade were
replaced by Irish and British business people.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's opening night session, the Thoroughbred Corp. spent
$1.7 million on a chestnut filly sired by Storm Cat out of a Gone
West mare, Gone to Venus, topping last year's highest sale price of
$1.4 million. The owner of the Thoroughbred Corp. is Ahmed bin
Salman of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   A chestnut colt fetched $900,000 from Shadwell Estate Co. Ltd.
of Thetford, England.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino spent $200,000 on a chestnut
colt.
</P>
<P>
   The yearling sale director, Bill Graves, said the high sale
prices signaled a strong start.
</P>
<P>
   People in the industry anticipated a strong showing as well from
another significant horse buyer: the American. ``The clique of
Irish and English buyers might come in and buy the top 5 percent of
the horses, but the vast majority, the 95 percent, of the horses
will be purchased by Americans,'' said Walter Burke, owner of
Valley View Farm in Ocala, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of Tuesday night's bidding, the auctioneers hoped for
a 10 percent boost in last year's $27.7 million gross sales,
according to Terence Collier, marketing director of Fasig-Tipton.
</P>
<P>
   He was hopeful that several horses would bring between $1
million and $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish players, whom Collier called the most powerful in the
world, have established a thriving conglomerate of stud farms
throughout Europe, North America and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Horse buyers and sellers from the United Kingdom have always
figured prominently in American sales, more visibly so in the early
1980s. However, their dominance was supplanted by the horse-buying
flurry of wealthy, oil-rich Arabs. The Japanese soon came on strong
as well, thanks to the strength of their market. But, Collier said,
the Arab purchasers are less apt to do so because they already have
the yearlings they need to start their own breeding industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are still alive in American sales, as evidenced by
the recent $4 million purchase of a yearling by an entrepreneur
from that country, and the first-ever yearling sale in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But economic vulnerabilities in Asia and the Mideast have left a
wider berth to the Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's only in the last year or so since the Japanese economy
has taken a bit of a setback,'' said Collier. He cautioned that the
cycle will likely shift once more when the European conglomerates
have all the studs they need.

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) The Los Angeles Daily News plans to move the following stories
today for use by NYTimes News Service clients. They will move in
the ``e'' entertainment news file. For questions, contact Jimmy
Johnson at the Daily News, (818) 713-3695. 
. 
GROOVE-MOVIE (Los Angeles) _ ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back''
didn't set out to be the film that turned the tables on one of
Hollywood's most cherished (think Bogey and Bacall) sexist
traditions. The second novel by ``Waiting to Exhale'' author Terry
McMillan to be adapted to the big screen, the story of a successful
40-year-old divorcee who finds happiness with a Jamaican man half
her age was loosely based on the writer's own experience. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
NUDE-GROOVE (Los Angeles) _ Another advantage of playing the mature
female partner in a movie romance: You don't have to get naked for
the love scenes. ``I didn't want to take all my clothes off and
show it up on a big ol' screen for all the world to see,'' says
Angela Bassett, star of the sensual romance ``How Stella Got Her
Groove Back.'' ``Especially not after `What's Love Got to Do With
It,' and all the attention I got based on my physicality in that
movie. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
STURGES-FILM (Los Angeles) _ Comedic screenwriter/director Preston
Sturges receives his due with a centennial tribute that,
coincidentally, follows his snub from the AFI's top 100 American
films of all time. By Bob McCarthy. 
. 
STELLA-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Like its predecessor ``Waiting to
Exhale,'' ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is a luxuriously
appointed soap opera with just enough sass to make it seem like
something more. 3 Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
SLUMS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ This story about a father who moves
around apartment to apartment to keep his three kids in Beverly
Hills schools is a kooky family comedy that mainly obsesses with
women's breasts. 1{ Stars. By Glenn Whipp. 
. 
RETURN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ ``Return to Paradise'' pokes, prods
and nudges you throughout its two hours, practically begging you to
answer the question: What would YOU do? Sad to say, though, the
filmmakers have decided that the core moral dilemma isn't enough to
sustain interest and have added creaky plot contrivances and the
year's worst tacked-on love story to dilute what could have been a
pretty good film. 2{ Stars. By Bob Strauss. 
. 
REGEN-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ Intelligent and more complex than it
appears, Gillies Mackinnon's adaptation of Pat Barker's acclaimed,
World War I novel ``Regeneration'' comes at a most felicitous time.
While ``Saving Private Ryan'' is showing filmgoers the effect
combat has on fighting soldiers, ``Regeneration'' brings out their
internalized responses to the horrors of war. 3{ Sstars. By Bob
Strauss. 
. 
POP-BEAT (Los Angeles) _ Singer-guitarist Juliana Hatfield says
times are hard for new artists. ``It's so sad,'' she said. ``New
bands don't have a chance to develop and if they don't have a hit
right off the bat, they're finished even before they've started.''
By Fred Shuster. 
. 
DISCS-MUSIC _ Brian Setzer's 17-piece big band is one of the
longest-running and best of the premillennium swing outfits.
Instead of taking a purist, archival approach, the jazz-tinged
rockabilly guitarist-singer adds a postmodern vibe to such
standouts as the Louis Prima hit ``Jump Jive an' Wail,'' the
grinder ``Sleepwalk'' and Rosemary Clooney's ``This Old House''
with ``The Dirty Boogie.'' By Fred Shuster. 
. 
LEBOWSKI-VIDEO (Los Angeles) _ ``The Big Lebowski,'' the latest
from the Coen brothers (``Fargo''), is out on video this week, and,
along with ``There Something About Mary,'' is the funniest film of
the year, a loopy, entertaining and, yes, even warn and fuzzy
takeoff on film noir, Busby Berkley musicals, male fantasies and
almost anything else the Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) can jam in.
By Rob Lowman.

SETZER JIVES WITH `THE DIRTY BOOGIE'

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
BRIAN SETZER ORCHESTRA/``The Dirty Boogie'' (Interscope)
<TEXT>
<P>
   Setzer's 17-piece big band is one of the longest-running and
best of the premillennium swing outfits. Instead of taking a
purist, archival approach, the jazz-tinged rockabilly
guitarist-singer adds a postmodern vibe to such standouts as the
Louis Prima hit ``Jump Jive an' Wail,'' the grinder ``Sleepwalk''
and Rosemary Clooney's ``This Old House.'' A charged remake of the
Stray Cats hit ``Rock This Town,'' thrilling album-opener ``This
Cat's on a Hot Tin Roof'' and a campy duet with No Doubt's Gwen
Stefani on ``You're the Boss'' put the Setzer orchestra's third
record among the most plainly enjoyable pop discs of the year.
Setzer's no slouch on guitar, either. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``L.A. County Line: A Country Compilation From the City of
Angels'' (Strawdog)
</P>
<P>
   This eye-opening compilation of local country-rock outfits
associated with Ronnie Mack's long-running weekly Barndance event
makes for a nice introduction to a thriving but little-known scene
deserving of wider recognition. The influence of the Byrds and Gram
Parsons runs through these 19 tracks like old Route 99 cuts through
Bakersfield, spiritual home to this high lonesome sound. The
quality here is generally high, while outstanding cuts include
offerings from the always-interesting Rosie Flores backed by a
group of high-profile session players, the wry Trailer Park
Casanovas, guitar maverick Deke Dickerson, singer-songwriter Annie
Harvey and up-and-coming post-punk bluegrass quintet Cousin Lovers.
3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DR. JOHN/``Anutha Zone'' (Pointblank)
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal idea to hook up New Orleans gris-gris wizard
and pianist Dr. John (Mac Rebennack) with Paul Weller and members
of such top British bands as Spiritualized, Portishead, Supergrass,
Primal Scream and Ocean Colour Scene. Surreal because Rebennack's
music is generally so earthbound and funky while many of these
Brits create floaty, neo-psychedelic soundscapes. But this alluring
musical meeting of the bayou and Camden actually provides plenty of
surprises. The common ground is groove on memorable tracks like
``John Gris'' and ``Hello God,'' both utilizing the space guitar of
Spiritualized's Jason Pierce and a gospel choir. Another goodie is
the haunting ballad ``Party Hellfire'' with Weller. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
JENNIFER PAIGE/``Jennifer Paige'' (Edel America/Hollywood)
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta native Paige's self-titled debut was issued this week on
the heels of her irresistible top 10 smash, ``Crush,'' which opens
the proceedings here. That seductive and refreshing blue-eyed soul
gem clearly dominates the disc, but other tracks hold up nearly as
well. Working with hitmaker-songwriter Andy Goldmark, Paige reveals
a distinctive approach and flexible gospel-inspired vocal range on
such strong material as ``Busted,'' ``Between You and Me'' and
``Always You.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOUNDTRACK/``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' (Flyte Tyme/MCA)
</P>
<P>
   Produced and co-written mostly by hitmaking duo Jimmy Jam and
Terry Lewis, this soundtrack is an r&AMP;b-heavy package of superstars
and rising stars with new tunes from Mary J. Blige, K-Ci &AMP; JoJo,
Boyz II Men, Diana King and others. Jazzie B. offers the opening
and closing tracks while the newly reunited Soul II Soul perform
the radio-ready ``Free Again.'' Another selling point is a Stevie
Wonder/Wyclef Jean version of Wonder's ``Mastablasta '98.'' 2{
Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CORNELL DUPREE/``Uncle Funky'' (Kokopelli)
</P>
<P>
   Dupree's distinctive Texas phrasing and soulful Telecaster tone
made him one of the most sought-after r&AMP;b session cats of the '70s,
backing Aretha, King Curtis, Donny Hathaway and other greats. On
this terrific set of instrumentals cut six years ago at Gotham's
Lonestar Roadhouse, Dupree slips and slides through a warm
repertoire of originals like ``Duck Soup'' (covered previously with
former band Stuff) and ``Southern Comfort,'' plus top-flight
readings of ``Ode to Billy Joe'' and ``Signed, Sealed, Delivered
I'm Yours.'' Backed by such high-profilers as bassist Will Lee and
keyboardist Richard Tee, Dupree's fretwork here can make you say
``uncle.'' 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHERMAN IRBY/``Big Mama's Biscuits'' (Blue Note)
</P>
<P>
   Alto saxophonist Irby's sense of humor extends to his music. On
top of that, the guy has lung power to spare and blows through
originals like ``Conversing With Cannon,'' ``'Bama'' and ``Aunt
Dorothy'' like a freight train. Irby gets sturdy support here from
guitarist Ed Cherry during a cover of Stevie Wonder's ``Too High''
and other tracks. Trumpeter Roy Hargrove lends a hand to the title
track. 3 Stars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
PETER GREEN with Nigel Watson/``The Robert Johnson Songbook''
(Artisan)
</P>
<P>
   Bad news. Green should never have been dragged out of his long
retirement. His chops are a thing of the past, not that he ever
attempts to use them on this tepid collection of Robert Johnson
covers. Pull out your copy of Fleetwood Mac's ``Blues Jam at
Chess'' or the Green-Otis Spann album instead. 1 Star. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIOUS/``Jazz a Saint-Germain'' (Higher Octave)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has been to Paris and spent some time nursing a
bottle of wine in one of the Saint-Germain district's famous cafes
will love this compilation of torch songs, jazz and world music.
There are some nice surprises here, from the duet between French
chanteuse Francoise Hardy and punk forefather Iggy Pop on the
wonderful standard ``I'll Be Seeing You'' to the moving nostalgia
of ``These Foolish Things,'' sung by Jane Birken and Jimmy Rowles.
There's a reggae-tinged ``God Bless the Child'' and a version of
``Summertime'' that has been reimagined as a tribal folk song. This
is a marvelously eclectic collection of styles and cultures, just
like the city it salutes. 3{ Stars. &QL; 
_ Glenn Whipp!off! &QR; 
 &QL; 
SARAH VAUGHN Vaughan/``Sarah Vaughan Sings the Mancini Songbook''
(Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Vaughan could sing the Spice Girls songbook and make it
interesting with her distinctive, intense voice. Here, though,
she's often overwhelmed by some of the heavy orchestral
arrangements, such as on rather syrupy versions of ``Days of Wine
and Roses'' and ``Charade.'' Where Vaughan cooks is on Mancini's
swinging numbers like the themes to ``Mr. Lucky'' and ``Peter
Gunn.'' This reissue is a mixed bag, but one Vaughan enthusiasts
will probably want to add to their collections. 2{ Stars. &QL;

IT'S NO `BED' OF ROSES FOR NEWCOMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Singer-guitarist Juliana Hatfield says times are
hard for new artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so sad,'' she said. ``New bands don't have a chance to
develop and if they don't have a hit right off the bat, they're
finished even before they've started. The competition is so
fierce.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's self-produced new album, ``Bed'' (Zoe), due out Aug.
25, was just issued. Last year, she released a one-off indie EP,
``Please Do Not Disturb'' (Bar/None).
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Hatfield stepped out of Boston's jangle-pop Blake
Babies, the group she founded with other students from the
prestigious Berklee School of Music.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, ``My Sister,'' a track from Hatfield's solo
album, ``Become What You Are'' (Mammoth/Atlantic), set the tone for
a generation of female alt-rock singer-songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Hatfield's new album came together after she left
Mammoth/Atlantic. She'd been associated with those labels since her
earliest days as a musician.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to get off Atlantic,'' Hatfield, 31, said.
``The whole regime of people who I'd known for so long had left. I
didn't feel a lot of excitement about me anymore at the label.''
</P>
<P>
   MADCAP DREAMS: Dreams are coming true for local pop-rock trio
Madcap.
</P>
<P>
   The band, which formed three years ago, is about to release a
new album, ``On My Own'' (Pardigm).
</P>
<P>
   Madcap _ which appears at 7 p.m. Saturday in a free record
release show at Backside Records (139 N. San Fernando Blvd.,
Burbank) _ has toured throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the local scene is pretty friendly,'' said Madcap
bassist Lee LeBaigue, 23, of Reseda. ``There's a group of bands
that like to play together and we have some support there.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBaigue said Madcap's primary influences range from Crass to
the Beatles to Capt. Beefheart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a pop-punk band without that annoying little kid
sound,'' he said. ``We're a little more grown up.''

PULLING OUT ALL STOPS FOR PRESTON STURGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Preston Sturges' smart comedy wasn't lost on the
censors of his day, who gave the writer-director a wider berth than
most.
</P>
<P>
   He was clever, intelligent, pushed the limits and got away with
subjects that remained taboo topics in the 1940s, such as sex,
pregnancy and the single girl. These coalesced in ``Miracle on
Morgan's Creek,'' netting Sturges an Academy Award nomination for
his original screenplay. It brought him the second of three Oscar
nominations in a brilliant writing career that ran from 1933
through the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   His extraordinary talent was recognized by Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences members, who in 1940 gave him the Oscar
for ``The Great McGinty,'' which he also directed. Sturges has a
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a building on the Paramount lot
that bears his name, and both the Writers Guild of America and
Directors Guild of America bestow a Preston Sturges Award on the
industry's elite writer-directors.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, when the American Film Institute released its list of the
greatest American films of all time, Sturges' name was nowhere to
be found. But this month, he receives his due with a series of
screenings and events celebrating the 100th anniversary of the
birth of the playwright-turned-screenwriter acknowledged by Writers
Guild Foundation president Tom Schulman as ``one of a kind'' with a
mastery of language and physical gags.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences leads off this
timely retrospective with a centennial tribute at 8 p.m. Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Film clips and people who knew and worked with Sturges,
including his widow, Sandy, actor Eddie Bracken and Paramount
producer A.C. Lyles, will offer a perspective to the program at the
motion picture academy, 8949 Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills. Tickets
cost $6 for general admission, $4 for academy and WGA members. Call
(310) 247-3600 for information.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Thursday and running through Sept. 7, the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art is hosting a retrospective of Sturges films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great McGinty'' and 1931's ``Strictly Dishonorable'' (his
Broadway play adapted for film that changed the course of his
career) are on the marquee at 7:30 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ``Remember the Night'' and ``Christmas in July'' will
screen. On Saturday, the bill includes ``The Lady Eve'' and ``The
Good Fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   All screenings will be in the Bing Theatre at LACMA, 5905
Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles. Tickets are $4 for museum, WGA and AFI
members, $6 for others. For information, call (213) 857-6010.
</P>
<P>
   For those who can't make it out, don't worry. Universal Studios
Home Video has released four Sturges films _ ``Easy Living,'' ``If
I Were King,'' ``Imitation of Life'' and ``Never Say Die'' _ and
re-released what are regarded as his finest _ ``Hail the Conquering
Hero,'' ``Sullivan's Travels,'' ``The Great McGinty'' ``Christmas
in July,'' ``The Great Moment,'' ``Remember the Night,'' ``The Lady
Eve'' and ``The Palm Beach Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal is doubly honoring Sturges with the Universal Laughter
Series of films that will tour this summer, including Los Angeles,
San Francisco and New York. And the University of California Press
will publish a third volume of his screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   TO THEIR CREDIT: The second Hollywood Film Festival is a wrap
and was, by all accounts, a winning weekend. It certainly was for
Craig Saavedra of Northridge and Eric Tuchman of Tarzana, whose
film ``Rhapsody in Bloom'' made its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra directed and co-produced the independent feature
written by Tuchman, and which starred Penelope Ann Miller (``The
Shadow'') Ron Silver (``Reversal of Fortune'') and Craig Sheffer.
</P>
<P>
   This comedic drama about ``the art of avoiding life'' has Miller
playing a woman who puts her life on hold to care for her widowed
brother and his kids. When he meets another woman and announces
their engagement, his sister has to find an apartment, a job and
encounter the uncertainties of life and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best compliments I've gotten is it feels like a
James L. Brooks comedy-drama with characters that make you laugh
and care,'' said Saavedra. ``It's something I aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from hoping a domestic distributor will pick up his film,
he sincerely wants audiences to see what he considers Miller's best
performance yet as the free-spirited title character Lilah Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's intelligent, she's beautiful, she's honest, and she
bears a lot of herself emotionally in this film,'' she says about
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The festival judges certainly agreed. Miller was presented with
Best Acting in a Feature award at Monday night's closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rhapsody in Bloom'' marked the directorial debut for Saavedra,
who left as president of Becker FilmWorks to pursue feature
filmmaking. Tuchman wrote the script for Fox's animated
``Anastasia'' and was head writer for TV's ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   REACHING THROUGH THE WALL: Troma Entertainment's live Webcast
from the set of its feature ``Terror Firmer'' turns fans loose this
weekend to tell the director, actors and crew what they want to see
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Today through Sunday, anyone with a 28.8-speed modem or faster
can observe the production in progress, directed by Lloyd Kaufman,
president of Troma and creator of ``The Toxic Avenger.''
Suggestions sent via the Web site (www.troma.com) or e-mail will be
hustled to the cast and crew as they work, thus giving the
production a fully interactive quality. If your idea's a good one,
you'll see it for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Troma promises that fans can follow their favorite
characters and choose how they die. Comforting thought, huh?
</P>
<P>
   Troma Entertainment's theatrical releases include ``The Chosen
One: Legend of the Raven,'' starring Carmen Electra, ``Tromeo and

THE COENS STRIKE AGAIN WITH `BIG LEBOWSKI'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When first we encounter Jeff Lebowski (Jeff
Bridges), it's late at night in an empty Los Angeles supermarket,
and he's checking out the milk. Dressed for bed (complete with
floppy slippers), he furtively looks around and then opens a carton
and takes a sip.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we see him at the cash register making out a check for all
of 89 cents. This is clearly a man who doesn't live on the edge but
around the edges of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Lebowski,'' the latest from the Coen brothers
(``Fargo''), is out on video this week, and is, along with
``There's Something About Mary,'' the funniest film of the year _ a
loopy, entertaining and, yes, even warm and fuzzy takeoff on film
noir, Busby Berkeley musicals, male fantasies and almost anything
else the Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) can jam in.
</P>
<P>
   Set during the Gulf War, the film is often in danger of spinning
out of control with its crazy plot twists, but the Coens always
redeem themselves with eye-opening visuals and off-the-wall humor.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bridges' Lebowski is not the big guy of the title.
This Lebowski is a long-haired refugee from the '60s who would
rather be referred to as Dude and whose life revolves around
bowling, getting high and listening to whale sounds to soothe his
(un)complicated existence. But this comes to an end when a couple
of thugs break into his apartment and rough him up, saying that his
wayward wife hasn't paid up on the gambling debts she owes porn
king/mobster Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazarra). Eventually, it dawns on
them that the Lebowski they want is rich and Dude isn't. They leave
him a present, however, by urinating on his throw rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rug really pulled the room together,'' declares Dude's
friend and bowling partner, Walter (John Goodman), a Vietnam War
veteran with a hair-trigger temper. So, with Walter's incessant
urging, Dude heads off to find the other Lebowski and get
compensation for his rug.
</P>
<P>
   The big guy of the title turns out to be another Jeff Lebowski
(David Huddleston), a wheelchair-using millionaire, and the Dude's
visit to him plunges him into a complicated kidnapping mystery (too
complicated to go into here).
</P>
<P>
   The gambling debts and the millionaire in a wheelchair echo the
plot of the Humphrey Bogart classic ``The Big Sleep,'' which itself
has a complicated plot that still has film buffs scratching their
heads. Only this time, instead of a sharp Philip Marlowe on the
trail of the truth, we have a clueless Dude who's still groggy from
his big sleep from reality.
</P>
<P>
   But if the story turns in ``The Big Lebowski'' are maddening
though fun, the acting turns are sublime, starting with Bridges,
who is so convincing in his lethargy and spaciness that you wonder
if you're seeing the real Jeff Bridges here. Bridges doesn't so
much act the role as inhabit it. But those who have followed the
versatile actor's career from when he first burst upon the scene in
``The Last Picture Show'' (1971) know that he's been
underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman _ the veteran of other Coen films, ``Raising Arizona''
and ``Barton Fink'' _ is wonderful as the manic-depressive Walter,
who always looks as if he's about to explode at any minute. To this
mix, add the always superb Steve Buscemi as the dim-witted third
member of the bowling team; a laconic and amused Sam Elliot as the
cowboy-narrator; John Turturro in a pink jumpsuit as Jesus, their
archenemy in bowling and a convicted pedophile; and Julianne Moore
as the Big Lebowski's daughter Maude, an artist and sex enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in a gang of black-clad nihilists, a famous TV
scriptwriter in an iron lung, an attack marmot, a hilarious funeral
scene and a great soundtrack _ from Bob Dylan to Kenny Rogers to
the late Townes Van Zandt _ and you have one of the most original
films in a while. Originality and offbeat ideas have never been a
problem with the Coens, although making films that have a heart has
at times. But, in ``The Big Lebowski'' the Coens surprisingly add
some warm colors to their absurdist palette, and what the
cowboy-narrator says about the Dude's story can be said about the
film: ``This is how the whole darn human comedy perpetuates
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   SPEAKING OF SURPRISING: The idea of Adam Sandler in a
sweet-natured romantic comedy may seem like an incongruity, but
somehow we have ``The Wedding Singer,'' which came out on video
last week. Sandler, who showed signs of breaking out of the
adolescent humor trap in ``Happy Gilmore,'' plays a failed rocker
turned wedding singer who is dumped by his fiancee and falls for a
waitress (Drew Barrymore). Set in the '80s, the film has a fun
soundtrack and, unlike with most of Sandler's films, you don't have
to be under 14 to enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   DVD WATCH: The last two major studios are joining the DVD camp.
Fox and Paramount have announced that they are releasing their
first digital video disc titles this fall. Fox will release ``Hope
Floats'' and James Cameron's ``The Abyss'' among its first six
titles, while Paramount will offer 10 films, including ``Star Trek:
First Contact'' and ``Face/Off.''

ALL MONICA'S CHILDREN:SCANDAL GIVES BIRTH TO SOAP OPERA IDEAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The world has turned nearly 250 times since Monica
Lewinsky joined the cast of our long national soap opera. Unlike a
story line on a real soap, the Monica Lewinsky/Linda Tripp/Bill
Clinton saga appears headed for a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   How many more days of our lives will pass before it all ends?
And how will the end come?
</P>
<P>
   Since the president has employed television producer and
director Harry Thomason as his own personal script doctor, ``The
Arizona Republic`` asked other television professionals to pitch
their own treatments for the ongoing melodrama. (Its title?
``Leaves of Grass,'' of course.) We asked each writer how they'd
untangle such an implausible plot.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Esensten, co-head writer for the CBS daytime drama
``Guiding Light,'' instantly filled in some of the missing
back-story. In Esensten's (obviously fictional) version, Lewinsky
would be revealed as the initial pursuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was the complete gentleman with her,'' said Esensten.
``She was getting more and more frustrated. She knew and felt that
the man had had so many affairs. But he kept telling her that she
misunderstood. She finally said, `You either capitulate to my
attention or I'm going to say you did anyway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Please don't do that. That would be a terrible
mistake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She did it anyway. Now, for the soapy flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Bill took such an interest in her in the first
place, the reason he'd been protecting her all along, the reason
that he's been telling the truth and knows that she's been lying,''
said Esensten, ``is that she's his illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we'd do. We'd play the hell out of it. It would
take months to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guiding Light'' might not play the hell out of a certain, uh,
seedy aspect of the real-life soap, said Esensten. The dress, the
DNA-carrying stain _ that whole tangent may be too sordid even for
daytime television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think we'd have to handle it more gingerly,'' said
Esensten. ``When you get to something so specific, we have what we
call the `ick' factor. We can show all kinds of sexual acts and
allude to all kinds of double-entendres, but when you feel
something is wrong in the pit of your stomach, that's the `ick'
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some places we draw the line. I think we'd play
lipstick on a shirt. Semen on a dress? I think we'd draw the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   In Esensten's drama, Lewinsky's character would get to shirk
some of the responsibility for her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a soap writer, I would probably play up the way she grew up
and the household she grew up in, and I would probably make the
mother the villain of the piece,'' she said. ``We are all a product
of where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   As for The Man from Hope, he'd make a ``fabulous'' soap opera
character ``because he is the kind of character women always
forgive,'' Esensten said. ``If one is to believe that he's not been
true to his wife, that makes him a villain in the eyes of most
women. There are some men who will forever be forgiven. Whatever it
is he's got, it works on soaps, and, apparently, in the polling
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cast him in a second for our show. In fact, I might
suggest it to him if he's going to be out of a job soon.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Page Turner &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the FBI will discover that there has been a vast
conspiracy against President Clinton _ not by the so-called `right
wing,' as Hillary mistakenly believes, but by forces far more
devious and dangerous,'' said Philip Taylor, a Scottsdale, Ariz.,
resident and veteran television writer.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor shot his detailed (but plainly farcical) take on the
tale, through which he weaves a media mogul and the box office fate
of a major motion picture, to us via e-mail. It can be read in its
entirety on the ``Republic's'' online annex, Arizona Central
(www.azcentral.com).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who's recently done scripts for the syndicated
action-adventure drama ``Soldier of Fortune'' and the CBS series
``The Magnificent Seven,'' concocted a terrible secret for
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In his scenario, Lewis had a ``brief fling with an Atlanta
businessman'' while on a long-ago promotional tour for one of her
tawdry books, Taylor said. ``The result of this liaison was a
rather chubby baby called Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   The businessman: Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, it was Turner who pulled a few strings behind the
scenes, and got Monica a job as a White House intern,'' Taylor
said. ``Monica did not want to work in the White House. In fact,
she wanted to be a television anchorperson, but Turner insisted
because he had a darker purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The darker purpose: An anonymous ``inside source'' to improve
CNN's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica was instructed to get as close to the president as
possible, bring him gifts, endear herself to him in every way,''
said Taylor. ``Unfortunately, Monica did her job too well, and
became thoroughly obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   After her transfer to the Pentagon, Turner schemed to turn
Monica's relationship with the president into a promotional stunt
for the January release of the film ``Wag the Dog.'' (Produced by
New Line Cinema, one of Turner's many media holdings, ``Wag the
Dog'' tells a story frighteningly similar to the real events of
Monicagate. Now we know why.)
</P>
<P>
   Turner convinced Monica to play along by A) revealing that he
was her father and B) promising her Bernard Shaw's anchor chair.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp and literary agent Lucianne Goldberg eventually make
an appearance in Taylor's treatment, of course, as does the
infamous dress. (Which actually belongs to Hillary Clinton, who
last wore it the night of a Barbra Streisand concert.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Taylor's dark design, the July resurgence of the
Lewinsky story was engineered to hype the video release of ``Wag
the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turner's conscience does bother him now and again,'' said
Taylor. ``But whenever it does, he donates a huge sum of money to
the United Nations, and he feels better right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript, Taylor calls his interpretation of events
``pure speculation, salted with a few known facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just goes to show how rumors start,'' he said. ``When
those `anonymous sources' begin blabbing, even the president finds
it hard to come clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if you see Monica Lewinsky with her own talk show,
and Marcia Lewis and Linda Tripp on The ``New York Times''
bestseller list, just remember: some writers will do anything to
see their name in print _ including me!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Beach' parties  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fans of NBC's ``Sunset Beach'' know that a shadow version of
Monicagate has been unfolding on the soap for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Tomlin, executive producer of the Aaron Spelling property,
said his show jumped on the story almost immediately. There's a
Monica character (Sara Cummings), a Clinton character (a mysterious
U.S. congressman named Blythe, as in William Jefferson Blythe
Clinton and with whom Cummings has had an affair) and a conniving
Linda Tripp character (who secretly tapes Sara's confession of the
affair).
</P>
<P>
   Where does it say that satire has to be subtle?
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot of Blythe hugging a beret-wearing Cummings has played
an important part in the ``Sunset Beach'' subplot. And the Linda
Tripp character's name? Melinda Fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Tripp/Fall character is played as a tacky dresser who's
``very sort of harsh and over-the-top,'' said Tomlin. Her
motivation is that ``this woman herself was in love with the
congressman all these years and never made a move,'' Tomlin said.
``She assumed he was a happily married man, and was betrayed by her
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty outrageous. All through this thing, we've
portrayed (the Tripp character) as a woman who's totally out for
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monica/Sara has been written as ``sweet and young and
all that stuff,'' said Tomlin. ``Our Monica character is not
written perhaps as opportunistically as the real Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Her future, in fact, likely revolves around a hometown love
interest closer to her own age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll strive for now is getting the most mileage as we
can out of the love story,'' said Tomlin. ``We've got a young girl
who has been essentially wronged by these people in Washington. She
goes to Washington as a total innocent, she was used by this guy
and this woman, and she's suffering the consequences. She just
wants to get on with her life. She's not at all looking to get
anything out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking to do is a love story, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Feedback from viewers ``has been fairly positive, because
they're having fun with it. We're not playing it like a
dead-serious story,'' Tomlin said. ``You do get the line, `We're
tired of it in real life, why are you putting it on the show?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming soap opera plot twists are at least as carefully
guarded as grand jury testimony, so Tomlin couldn't exactly say how
Congressman Blythe will pay for his sins, if at all. In fact,
``Sunset Beach'' may just wait until reality writes an ending for
this particular subplot, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the soap's characters _ including Monica/Sara
and Tripp/Fall _ spent last week trying to escape from a sinking
cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   As of this past Friday's episode, a full accounting of survivors
wasn't yet possible, and sharks had been sighted circling the
lifeboats. &QL;

NEW `AIR BUD' HAS SOME CHARMING MOMENTS AS FAMILY FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can you not love a big yellow dog who wears a goofy football
jersey and helmet and looks pretty weird catching a spiral pass?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Air Bud is back, and this time he's tackling the role of
wide receiver instead of chasing Michael Jordan on the basketball
court.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he's also being pursued by more than a sports
agent; it seems Russian circus wrangler Natalya (Nora Dunn) needs a
star attraction for her floundering animal show.
</P>
<P>
   As long as ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' keeps its eye on the
ball, not the villainess and her moronic right hand man, this
second installment in the life of the sports-loving golden receiver
and his human ``best friend,'' Josh Framm (Kevin Zegers), is
charming family fare. It's only with its old lemon of a sub-plot
that things lag and Air Bud's charismatic tail fails to wag.
</P>
<P>
   Josh is moping around because his recently widowed mom, Jackie
(Cynthia Stevenson), is going on dates with a handsome new vet,
Patrick Sullivan (Gregory Harrison). Air Bud takes to Dr. Sullivan
as much as mom, so Josh is feeling doubly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, his school football team is failing dismally. Just as
things hit an all-time low, Air Bud decides to switch sports. He's
tired of playing around with basketball players like Blue Edwards
and Lee Mayberry and he's found some new friends in the form of
Seattle Seahawks Warren Moon and Joey Galloway (who have small
roles in the film), and who are happy to show their four-legged pal
the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud joins Josh's flailing team, and makes the news in the
process. But his ability to catch a pass also catches the eye of a
Russian circus owner who decides the dog will revive her dwindling
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The original Air Bud died of cancer, so the canine hero is now
played by six golden retrievers, each handling a different facet of
the dog's personality and talent. Since ``Air Bud: Wide Receiver''
is a sweet comedy about growing up and dealing with loss and
tragedy, it's suitable homage to the first pup who made the
character popular. There's a nice rapport between Kevin Zeger, the
young actor who plays Josh and who has a no-nonsense screen
presence, and his canine companion.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't trust their humanistic
little core story and had to mess it all up with the broad _ and
out-of-place _ slapstick humor of the Russian circus subplot to
keep the film from feeling too sad and perhaps, intense, for kids.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a movie that feels disjointed in tone and doesn't
have the continuity to completely sustain itself. Still, it's
enjoyable because the family scenes and the sports action are
touching and a lot of fun. Only with the off-kilter silliness
provided by Nora Dunn does it go ``woof.''
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver. Directed by Richard Martin. Written by
Paul Tamasy, Aaron Mendelsohn. Cast: Kevin Zegers, Gregory
Harrison, Cynthia Stevenson, Nora Dunn. Dimension Films. 91
minutes. Rated G.

`RETURN TO PARADISE' IS A PLEASANT SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's extremely rare these days to have a star-heavy Hollywood
movie that revolves around a clear and perhaps
impossible-to-reconcile moral dilemma. For this reason alone,
``Return to Paradise'' comes as something of a pleasant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is no slam dunk by any means. The reach of its script
definitely exceeds its grasp, it never makes us completely believe
its bizarre situation and it doesn't quite click into place as
something more than a TV problem-movie-of-the-week.
</P>
<P>
   But it's full of surprises every step of the way, it carries a
powerful emotional punch and it serves as an engaging star vehicle
for Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche _ who make their sketchily written
characters come alive, and develop an appealing romantic chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a trio of young Americans _ Sheriff (Vince
Vaughn), Tony (David Conrad) and Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) _ who, as
the film opens, are having a summer of tropical fun in Peninsular
Malaysia, with a liberal amount of hashish involved.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to two years later. Sheriff is back in New York driving a
limousine; Tony is an apprentice Manhattan architect; and neither
has heard anything from Lewis, who stayed on in Malaysia to work
for an orangutan protection project in Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   One night, a young attorney (Anne Heche) hires Sheriff's limo
and drops a bombshell on him: It seems Lewis was arrested with
their collective hash stash shortly after the other two left, and
has spent the last two years in an unspeakably awful Penang prison.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Malaysian authorities intend to hang him in a
matter of weeks, unless either he or Tony or both come back to
tesify that he was not a dealer, and shoulder part of the blame.
The deal is three years for each of them, or six years if only one
can be convinced to return.
</P>
<P>
   So the movie becomes this no-win moral dilemma in which the two
men are asked to make an extraordinary sacrifice for someone they
barely know _ egged on by this persistent and mysterious woman who
seems willing to go to any length to convince them.
</P>
<P>
   As this plays out, the script _ which was adapted from Pierre
Jolivet's 1989 French-language drama, ``Force Majeure'' _ seems to
have more than a few pieces missing, and never really tells us
enough about any of its characters to work as a cogent drama.
</P>
<P>
   It also never quite convinces us that: a) the U.S. State
Department would completely ignore the execution of a young
American with no criminal record; b) Malaysia would pose such a
deal to stay the execution; or c) anyone would ever be noble enough
to go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   But if you can jump over this considerable credibility gap,
``Return to Paradise'' is often a riveting movie, fueled by the
usual solid direction of Joseph Ruben (``Dreamscape''), top-notch
production values, and an especially poignant love story that
develops credibly in the midst of the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a film that forces us to question what we might do in
such a nightmarish situation; and thus becomes a sobering
cautionary tale. Like ``Red Corner'' and ``Midnight Express,'' it
tells us that being an American carries no special privileges in an
increasingly draconian Third World.
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise. Directed by Joseph Ruben. Screenplay by
Wesley Strick and Bruce Robinson. Cast: Vince Vaughn, Anne Heche,
Joaquin Phoenix, David Conrad, Jada Pinkett Smith. Polygram. 109
minutes. Rated R for drug scenes and mature subject matter.

</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton was the complete gentleman with her,'' said Esensten.
``She was getting more and more frustrated. She knew and felt that
the man had had so many affairs. But he kept telling her that she
misunderstood. She finally said, `You either capitulate to my
attention or I'm going to say you did anyway.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Please don't do that. That would be a terrible
mistake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She did it anyway. Now, for the soapy flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Bill took such an interest in her in the first
place, the reason he'd been protecting her all along, the reason
that he's been telling the truth and knows that she's been lying,''
said Esensten, ``is that she's his illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we'd do. We'd play the hell out of it. It would
take months to resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Guiding Light'' might not play the hell out of a certain, uh,
seedy aspect of the real-life soap, said Esensten. The dress, the
DNA-carrying stain _ that whole tangent may be too sordid even for
daytime television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd think we'd have to handle it more gingerly,'' said
Esensten. ``When you get to something so specific, we have what we
call the `ick' factor. We can show all kinds of sexual acts and
allude to all kinds of double-entendres, but when you feel
something is wrong in the pit of your stomach, that's the `ick'
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some places we draw the line. I think we'd play
lipstick on a shirt. Semen on a dress? I think we'd draw the
line.''
</P>
<P>
   In Esensten's drama, Lewinsky's character would get to shirk
some of the responsibility for her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a soap writer, I would probably play up the way she grew up
and the household she grew up in, and I would probably make the
mother the villain of the piece,'' she said. ``We are all a product
of where we came from.''
</P>
<P>
   As for The Man from Hope, he'd make a ``fabulous'' soap opera
character ``because he is the kind of character women always
forgive,'' Esensten said. ``If one is to believe that he's not been
true to his wife, that makes him a villain in the eyes of most
women. There are some men who will forever be forgiven. Whatever it
is he's got, it works on soaps, and, apparently, in the polling
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would cast him in a second for our show. In fact, I might
suggest it to him if he's going to be out of a job soon.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Page Turner &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the FBI will discover that there has been a vast
conspiracy against President Clinton _ not by the so-called `right
wing,' as Hillary mistakenly believes, but by forces far more
devious and dangerous,'' said Philip Taylor, a Scottsdale resident
and veteran television writer.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor shot his detailed (but plainly farcical) take on the
tale, through which he weaves a media mogul and the box office fate
of a major motion picture, to us via e-mail. It can be read in its
entirety on the ``Republic's'' online annex, Arizona Central
(www.azcentral.com).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who's recently done scripts for the syndicated
action-adventure drama ``Soldier of Fortune'' and the CBS series
``The Magnificent Seven,'' concocted a terrible secret for
Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In his scenario, Lewis had a ``brief fling with an Atlanta
businessman'' while on a long-ago promotional tour for one of her
tawdry books, Taylor said. ``The result of this liaison was a
rather chubby baby called Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   The businessman: Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, it was Turner who pulled a few strings behind the
scenes, and got Monica a job as a White House intern,'' Taylor
said. ``Monica did not want to work in the White House. In fact,
she wanted to be a television anchorperson, but Turner insisted
because he had a darker purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The darker purpose: An anonymous ``inside source'' to improve
CNN's ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica was instructed to get as close to the president as
possible, bring him gifts, endear herself to him in every way,''
said Taylor. ``Unfortunately, Monica did her job too well, and
became thoroughly obnoxious.''
</P>
<P>
   After her transfer to the Pentagon, Turner schemed to turn
Monica's relationship with the president into a promotional stunt
for the January release of the film ``Wag the Dog.'' (Produced by
New Line Cinema, one of Turner's many media holdings, ``Wag the
Dog'' tells a story frighteningly similar to the real events of
Monicagate. Now we know why.)
</P>
<P>
   Turner convinced Monica to play along by A) revealing that he
was her father and B) promising her Bernard Shaw's anchor chair.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Tripp and literary agent Lucianne Goldberg eventually make
an appearance in Taylor's treatment, of course, as does the
infamous dress. (Which actually belongs to Hillary Clinton, who
last wore it the night of a Barbra Streisand concert.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Taylor's dark design, the July resurgence of the
Lewinsky story was engineered to hype the video release of ``Wag
the Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Turner's conscience does bother him now and again,'' said
Taylor. ``But whenever it does, he donates a huge sum of money to
the United Nations, and he feels better right away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a postscript, Taylor calls his interpretation of events
``pure speculation, salted with a few known facts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it just goes to show how rumors start,'' he said. ``When
those `anonymous sources' begin blabbing, even the president finds
it hard to come clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if you see Monica Lewinsky with her own talk show,
and Marcia Lewis and Linda Tripp on The ``New York Times''
bestseller list, just remember: some writers will do anything to
see their name in print _ including me!'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Beach' parties  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fans of NBC's ``Sunset Beach'' know that a shadow version of
Monicagate has been unfolding on the soap for several months.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Tomlin, executive producer of the Aaron Spelling property,
said his show jumped on the story almost immediately. There's a
Monica character (Sara Cummings), a Clinton character (a mysterious
U.S. congressman named Blythe, as in William Jefferson Blythe
Clinton and with whom Cummings has had an affair) and a conniving
Linda Tripp character (who secretly tapes Sara's confession of the
affair).
</P>
<P>
   Where does it say that satire has to be subtle?
</P>
<P>
   A snapshot of Blythe hugging a beret-wearing Cummings has played
an important part in the ``Sunset Beach'' subplot. And the Linda
Tripp character's name? Melinda Fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Tripp/Fall character is played as a tacky dresser who's
``very sort of harsh and over-the-top,'' said Tomlin. Her
motivation is that ``this woman herself was in love with the
congressman all these years and never made a move,'' Tomlin said.
``She assumed he was a happily married man, and was betrayed by her
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty outrageous. All through this thing, we've
portrayed (the Tripp character) as a woman who's totally out for
herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monica/Sara has been written as ``sweet and young and
all that stuff,'' said Tomlin. ``Our Monica character is not
written perhaps as opportunistically as the real Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Her future, in fact, likely revolves around a hometown love
interest closer to her own age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we'll strive for now is getting the most mileage as we
can out of the love story,'' said Tomlin. ``We've got a young girl
who has been essentially wronged by these people in Washington. She
goes to Washington as a total innocent, she was used by this guy
and this woman, and she's suffering the consequences. She just
wants to get on with her life. She's not at all looking to get
anything out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking to do is a love story, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Feedback from viewers ``has been fairly positive, because
they're having fun with it. We're not playing it like a
dead-serious story,'' Tomlin said. ``You do get the line, `We're
tired of it in real life, why are you putting it on the show?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming soap opera plot twists are at least as carefully
guarded as grand jury testimony, so Tomlin couldn't exactly say how
Congressman Blythe will pay for his sins, if at all. In fact,
``Sunset Beach'' may just wait until reality writes an ending for
this particular subplot, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the soap's characters _ including Monica/Sara
and Tripp/Fall _ spent last week trying to escape from a sinking
cruise ship.
</P>
<P>
   As of this past Friday's episode, a full accounting of survivors
wasn't yet possible, and sharks had been sighted circling the
lifeboats. &QL;

DRIVER'S PERFORMANCE IN `THE GOVERNESS' MAKES IT WORTH SEEING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Governess,'' a gothic romance novel of a film about one
woman's journey toward sexual self-knowledge and identity, is more
visually adventurous than anything.
</P>
<P>
   It features an odd, sometimes bold, performance by Minnie Driver
in her first star vehicle. Whether you can suspend disbelief for
wild flights of fancy will depend entirely upon your feelings about
Driver herself as an actress.
</P>
<P>
   She's in virtually every scene of Sandra Goldbacher's first
feature. Goldbacher was a successful commercials director in London
and her talent with a camera certainly can't be disputed.
Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the film's soap opera of
a story, which is over-the-top, unfocused and lacks plausibility.
</P>
<P>
   In England during the Victorian Era, a young Jewish woman,
Rosina DaSilva (Driver), learns, after the sudden death of her
father, that his excesses have left her mother and sister
penurious. Rosina boldly decides to find work so she can support
her family and pay off their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing she'll be at a disadvantage in the Christian
community, she changes her name to Mary Blackchurch and secures
employment on the Isle of Skye as a governess for the eccentric
Cavendish family.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cavendish (Tom Wilkinson) is an inventor. He's engrossed in
finding a fixative for photographic developer, an obsession he
invites the bright Rosina to share. She soon falls in love with the
middle-aged man, embracing him with torrid emotional abandon. The
two embark on a heated affair, much to the agony of the young heir,
Henry Cavendish (Jonathan Rhys-Meyer), who has come home from
Oxford and promptly becomes obsessed with his sister's exotic
governess.
</P>
<P>
   There is a potentially intriguing triangle between father, son
and governess at play but the film never delves into psychological
depths that might have made it more interesting and original. ``The
Governess'' stays mainly on the surface of the characters'
motivations.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it feels like Goldbacher became confused over what
she really wanted to convey. The film takes convenient liberties
with Rosina's search for a place in Christian society as well as
the story of a strong-willed woman's struggle for emancipation.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a true romance, as was Jane Campion's cunning ``The
Piano,'' a film it resembles. Instead it's indecisively
non-committal, even opting for an ``I Am Woman'' ending that
sabotages and negates the complicated, intriguing setup.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, as a statement on women's freedom and struggles, the
real moments in the film go to the marvelous English stage actress
Harriet Walter. She plays Mrs. Cavendish, a shallow, uninventive
society wife who has suffered from exile in a lonely place as well
as from her husband's inattention. More comment is made about a
woman's heart through her pursed, pained face than with all of
Driver's uncorseted, ``liberated'' sexual writhings with the master
of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The Governess. Directed and written by Sandra Goldbacher. Cast:
Minnie Driver, Tom Wilkinson, Harriet Walter, Jonathan Rhys-Meyer.
Sony Pictures Classics. 100 minutes. Rated R for nudity, sexual
content.

`MARIUS AND JEANNETTE' IS HARD TO RESIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ghost of the great French writer and filmmaker Marcel Pagnol
hovers happily over ``Marius and Jeannette,'' a hard-to-resist
French romantic comedy that moves into the Varsity today for a
one-week run. The film was nominated in seven categories at the
1998 Cesar Awards, France's version of the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Pagnol receives no credit, but the film's title seems to be a
tribute to his most famous character, Marius; it's set in that
character's working-class section of Marseilles; and it's infused
with Pagnol's distinctive flavor and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   This updated Marius (Gerard Meylan) is a watchman at a cement
factory that used to be the main employer of this part of the
Estaque section of Marseilles, but has since been abandoned for
unknown economic reasons and is about to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
   Jeannette (Ariane Ascaride) is a big-hearted, loud-mouthed,
twice-wed, single mother of two children who lives nearby, and is
just about to lose her job as a store checker by blowing off steam
at her stuffy boss (Pierre Banderet).
</P>
<P>
   The pair _ both in their 40s _ meet cute one day when Jeannette
sneaks into the factory and steals two cans of paint. Marius
catches her in the act, but lets her go, and then impulsively drops
the paint off at her house. A romance begins.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the Pagnolian neighborhood ensemble, there's two
other couples who play a large part in the story: a battling
husband-and-wife (Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Frederique Bonnal),
and a retired teacher in love with a communist concentration camp
survivor (Jacques Boudet and Pascale Roberts).
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Robert Guediguian (who grew up in the Estaque)
dedicates the film to working people, and most of his characters
are marginal communists and socialists trying to keep the faith in
a post-communist world and an increasingly right-wing France.
</P>
<P>
   The film's political subtext is extremely subtle, however, and
the director paints his scenes with the lightest of brushstrokes _
making sure to quickly puncture his more poignant moments or bleak
observations of life with jabs of cheerful humor.
</P>
<P>
   The characters of ``Marius and Jeannette'' are all especially
well cast. And star Ascaride (director Guediguian's wife) generates
just the right earth-mother charm and panache to carry the film.
She deservedly won the 1998 best actress Cesar for her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Marius and Jeannette. Directed by Robert Guediguian. Screenplay
by Guediguian and Jean-Louis Milesi. Cast: Ariane Ascaride, Gerard
Meylan, Pascale Roberts, Jacques Boudet. New Yorker Films. 102
minutes. In French with English subtitles. Unrated.

INTEL PROMOTION STIRS ETHICAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Think the World Wide Web is slow? Intel Corp. is
paying mainstream Web publishers to make it even slower.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to sell more chips with more power, the Santa
Clara, Calif.-based computer chip maker is pumping money into a
program to entice _ some say pressure _ Web site creators to post
large, complicated graphics on their sites. Web content creators
are heeding the call.
</P>
<P>
   The program, dubbed ``Optimized Content,'' encourages Web sites
to use large, complicated graphics that slow down a computer's
processor when they are downloaded from the Internet. An
accompanying message informs a user that a faster, Pentium II
microprocessor would make those pictures run smoother and faster.
</P>
<P>
   Optimized Content is also another ember in the slow-burning
debate over the mixing of advertising and editorial content on Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're asking us to do is turn our sites into a
demonstration of their products,'' said Peter Horan, a senior vice
president of Boston-based IDG, publisher of computer magazines like
Computerworld and PC World, the ``for Dummies'' how-to book series
and their related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to optimize our content for our readers, not for
Intel,'' Horan said.
</P>
<P>
   The program, formally called ``Intel Inside Optimized Content,''
subsidizes advertising on sites that post large, complicated
pictures and special effects. According to Intel, the program is
designed to encourage Web sites to design content that ``on a
faster processor provides a perceivable benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheri Maat, manager of Intel's ``Intel Inside'' program, said
the company is not interested in controlling a site's content.
``We'd be a lot smoother if we were going to do that,'' she said,
adding that the program is meant to seduce a user into buying a
faster processor.
</P>
<P>
   Intel normally reimburses PC makers 50 percent of their
Web-based advertising costs when they use the ``Intel Inside'' logo
on Web-based ads. Under the Optimized Content program, Intel kicks
in 75 percent of a PC maker's ad costs if the Web site features
complicated graphics. The qualifying sites have to contain wording
that says a Web page is better viewed with Intel's faster Pentium
II-equipped machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hell of an incentive,'' said one Web editor who asked
not to be named. ``PC companies are going to advertise on sites
where they pay only 25 percent of the costs, as opposed to sites
where they have to pay for half of the ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, launched last September, was updated July 15. The
program has been embraced by many of the giant Web publishing
concerns, including Wired Digital, Ziff-Davis, C/Ne, and CMP Media.
Web sites that use the program say it's simply a way to help
introduce cutting-edge technology to Web users.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never, absolutely never, compromise our editorial
integrity,'' said Dan Farber, vice president and editor-in-chief of
ZDNet, the on-line presence of Ziff-Davis publications. ``The whole
basis of our success is the quality and respect of our journalistic
ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber said Ziff-Davis joined the Intel program after creating
an elaborate three-dimensional site map for the ZDNet Web site.
Farber points out that there is a simpler site map available for
users and that no other pages in the ZDNet Web site are optimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that that particular site map qualifies us for
the program,'' Farber said. ``No content is being altered for it.
No user is being forced to have their experience of ZDNet slowed
down. This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Andrew De Vries, spokesman for Wired Digital, said the
Intel program was used briefly last year, but a major Wired Digital
site, fully qualified under the Intel program, is slated to unwrap
soon.
</P>
<P>
   `Generally, we design content that's good for our readers,'' De
Vries said, ``but we also keep advertiser considerations in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Horan said the seduction of ad dollars can cloud editorial
judgment at Web sites.``They don't view it as a conflict,'' he
said, ``but IDG does. How much of a site is inconsequential? Either
you cross that line or you don't.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the inaugural issue of the media watchdog magazine Brill's
Content, Web sites, especially the giant portal pages of Yahoo and
Excite, were criticized for failing to indicate which advertisers
paid to be designated as recommended links.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has raised eyebrows when it began a smart Web search
feature that automatically recommends sites to users that in some
cases and without notice are financial partners of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things start small,'' Horan said, ``but they grow. We
have to start openly discussing them before it ruins the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a discussion that could happen sooner rather than later.
According to Ad Age magazine, Intel devotes an estimated $7.5
million to subsidized Web site advertising. Maat said 60 percent of
subsidized Web advertising goes to optimized Web sites.

SOMEBODY DO SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first realized something was terribly, terribly wrong when a
Fox News producer called me yesterday. She wanted me to opine about
the scandal on Sunday, when the cable news channel will do a
Flytrap marathon in anticipation of the president's testimony. Her
call was fishy for two reasons: 1) I am not usually first, or
second, or last on any TV booker's guest list; and 2) she said the
following to me, imploringly: ``We're really looking for something
different. Can you be different?''
</P>
<P>
   (Well, I thought to myself, of course I can be different. My
mother always told me I was ``different.'')
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of wretched excess in Flytrap--a pursuit in which
Slate has eagerly participated--is producing some unfortunate
results. One is the rising popularity of preposterous conspiracy
theories. The Punditry Crisis is another. Not since the late-O.J.
era has America faced such an alarming moment. Is there anything
left to say?
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is, at bottom, a market failure. Ratings demonstrate
that TV viewers (never mind their protestations) want to hear about
Flytrap all the time. The gross appetites of CNN, MSNBC, and Fox
must be sated. ``Crossfire'' must have fire. ``Hardball'' must be
hard. ``Face the Nation'' must have someone to face. But there's
not enough supply to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   As Aug. 17 approaches, Flytrap is in an information blackout.
The White House is silent, and Starr's office has stopped leaking.
Every hypothesis has been hypothesized. Every theory theorized.
Every spin spun. Each tiny nugget of new information is chewed,
swallowed, regurgitated as cud, and chewed again. Pundits are
reduced to flogging thirdhand and fourthhand rumors. Can any TV
watcher endure another Jonathan Turley sermon or Lanny Davis ``wait
and see'' or Laura Ingraham huff?
</P>
<P>
   Too much demand, too little supply. TV producers are on a
desperate, futile quest for someone--or something--different to put
on the air. (This crisis is not, of course, limited to television:
Those of us in the print and e-media are thrashing through the same
news vacuum.)
</P>
<P>
   I really don't know what pundits will do. We have six days to
fill. And there's nothing,'' warns Time's Margaret Carlson. ``If I
had even one new fact, I would lock it in a vault until I could use
it (in a column or on television). If I had even one new
observation, I would not breathe a word about it until I could use
it. One piece of real news would eat all this (blather) up like
kudzu.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every pundit is worrying about the crisis. Some Panglossian
commentators claim there is no crisis at all. One compares Flytrap
to World War I trench battles: ``No one is getting overrun, but
steady progress is being made.'' In fact, he says, plenty of
fascinating new details emerge every day. (When asked for an
example of such a detail, he suggests, halfheartedly, ``what Monica
ate for lunch.'')
</P>
<P>
   And for freshly minted Flytrap pundits such as Turley, there is
no crisis, either. This is their moment. No topic is so stale that
it cannot be reheated: After all, it gets you air time. And
besides, say the Panglossians, no matter how much Flytrap nothing
is being spewed, think how much worse it would be if there were no
scandal at all. At least it's something to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   But should we simply relax and let the Punditry Crisis grow into
a catastrophe? Right-thinking people can agree: We should not.
Stuart Taylor Jr., in a moment of high-minded optimism, proposes
that pundits take advantage of the information vacuum to talk about
first principles. Instead of jabbing fingers over Monica's dress,
for example, they should discuss the fundamentals of sexual
harassment law. I'm not sure Taylor's worthy solution is possible
but, whether it is or it isn't, I think we can all concur that that
the Punditry Crisis requires immediate action. Well, maybe not
action, but definitely a lot more talk.

TEMPERANCE KILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN RAUCH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, to prevent any misunderstanding, the warning: Alcohol,
when abused, is vicious, dangerous stuff. Each year about 100,000
Americans die alcohol-related deaths. No one should drink and drive
or drink to excess. Some people--teen-agers, people on
contraindicated medications, pregnant women, and those who have
trouble controlling their consumption--should avoid alcohol,
period. And all that you know already.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you may not know--or may know only fuzzily. For
most people of middle age and beyond, one drink a day helps prevent
heart disease and makes you less likely to die prematurely. After
one or (for men) two drinks, bad effects swamp the good--dosage is
everything! But on average the positive cardiovascular effect of
moderate drinking is not small, and it is not in dispute.
Epidemiologists figure that if all Americans became teetotalers
tomorrow, about 80,000 more people might die each year of heart
disease. So there are lives on both sides of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   One of those lives might, just as an example, belong to my
father. He is 69, has mild hypertension (controlled with
medication) and, but for the rare social occasion, doesn't drink.
He has read some news reports suggesting moderate alcohol use may
yield benefits, but his doctor has never mentioned such benefits,
and my father has never given a thought to changing his drinking
habits. And, in the standard view of public health officialdom,
that is as it should be: People should not be encouraged to drink,
even in moderation, and alcohol should not be linked with better
health.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that moderate drinking is linked with better
health. We don't know exactly why; some evidence suggests
alcohol--of whatever sort, by the way, not just red
wine--stimulates ``good'' (HDL, for high density lipoprotein)
cholesterol and may help prevent blood clotting. But we do know the
effects: On average, if you're over about 40, a drink a day will
reduce your chances of heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the association between smoking and lung cancer, I
think this is the most consistent association I've seen in the
literature,'' says Eric Rimm, a Harvard epidemiologist. Research
has shown heart benefits consistently since the 1970s with, Rimm
guesses, 70 or 80 studies of 30 to 35 countries by now. Not
surprisingly, he has a drink on most days.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol also causes harm, of course. It can increase chances of
breast cancer, cirrhosis, accidents, and so on. Heart disease,
however, is an enormous cause of death; improve those odds, and the
net effect is significantly to the good. Last December, the New
England Journal of Medicine reported the results of the biggest and
probably best mortality study yet conducted, one that followed
almost half a million people over nine years. It found that, after
netting out all causes of death, moderate drinkers over 30 were 20
percent less likely than nondrinkers to die prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a lot of people like my father out there:
uninformed or vaguely informed or not thinking about it. In 1995, a
free market advocacy group called the Competitive Enterprise
Institute commissioned a survey asking people whether they believed
``that scientific evidence exists showing that moderate consumption
of alcohol, approximately one or two drinks per day, may reduce the
risk of heart disease for many people.'' Only 42 percent of those
who responded said they did, and a majority of those believed,
wrongly, that the potential benefits come only from wine.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence on alcohol and health is now more than 20 years
old--so why the confusion? Two groups have a stake in getting the
word out, but one of them, the alcohol industry, is effectively
forbidden to do so. Every bottle of alcohol carries a government
warning label, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has
never permitted ads or labels to carry any health claims, even mild
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the government restricts health claims even for
innocuous foods such as orange juice and eggs, it's reasonable to
decide that booze merchants are the wrong people to entrust with
public education about drinking. That leaves only one other
constituency for getting the word out: the public health community.
Its approach, however, might charitably be called cautious--or,
less charitably, embarrassed mumbling.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the authors of the aforementioned New England
Journal study characterized their finding of a 20 percent mortality
reduction as ``slight.'' The accompanying editorial called it
``small.''
</P>
<P>
   I phoned Michael J. Thun, one of the study's authors and an
epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society, and asked him
whether a 20 percent mortality reduction is indeed small in the
world of epidemiology. ``It's a sizable benefit in terms of
prolonged survival,'' he said. Why not say so? ``Messages about
alcohol don't come out the way you say them when they're
broadcast,'' he replied. ``There's been a very long history in
society of problems with alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The British health authorities, in their 1995 guidelines
(``Sensible Drinking''), say that people who drink very little or
not at all and are in an age group at high risk for heart disease
should ``consider the possibility that light drinking might benefit
their health.'' But American authorities balk even at such a modest
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   And so the U.S. official nutritional guidelines say just this
about potential benefits: ``Current evidence suggests that moderate
drinking is associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease
in some individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   They then go on to recite a litany of risks. Similarly, the
American Heart Association's official recommendation advises, ``If
you drink, do so in moderation.'' It goes on to say heart disease
is lower in moderate drinkers but then warns of other dangers and
cautions against ``guidelines to the general public'' that
encourage drinking. See for yourself, but I think the message most
people would get from both sources is ``Drinking isn't all bad, but
eschew it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked Ronald Krauss--a doctor who, as the immediate past
chairman of the American Heart Association's nutrition committee,
helped write that statement--whether it was aggressive enough. ``We
don't have much leeway around that 'one or two drinks a day,''' he
said, and what isn't known is whether encouraging moderate drinking
will also encourage excessive drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The public health people understandably dread creating more
drunks, more broken marriages, more crime, more car wrecks. ``When
somebody calls you up saying, 'You're putting out a message to
people to drink, and my daughter just got killed last night because
of some drunk,' that's the other side of the equation,'' Thun says.
``There are substantial numbers of people out there who are looking
for justification to drink more than they should.''
</P>
<P>
   A real worry. But there are lives, again, on both sides of the
equation. The question, then, is what would happen if the public
health folks ran a campaign saying, for example, ``Just One Drink''
or ``Drink a Little--Not a Lot.'' Would people's drinking habits
improve, or would we create a nation of drunks--or what? The answer
is: Nobody knows. What is surprising, given the public health
community's usual eagerness to save lives, is that no one is trying
to find out. It is simply assumed that too many people will do the
wrong thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a very hard time with complicated messages,'' says
Thun. No doubt some people do. But is it really so hard to
understand that a glass a day may help save your life if you're of
middle age or beyond, but that more than that is dangerous?
Presumably an avoidable heart attack is equally tragic whether the
cause is too much alcohol or too little. To continue today's policy
of muttering and changing the subject verges perilously on saying
not just that too much alcohol is bad for you but that ignorance is
good for you.

BABY-SITTING THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAUL KRUGMAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago I read a story that changed my life. I think
about that story often; it helps me to stay calm in the face of
crisis, to remain hopeful in times of depression, and to resist the
pull of fatalism and pessimism. At this gloomy moment, when Asia's
woes seem to threaten the world economy as a whole, the lessons of
that inspirational tale are more important than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The story is told in an article titled ``Monetary Theory and the
Great Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op Crisis.'' Joan and Richard
Sweeney published it in the Journal of Money, Credit, and Banking
in 1978. I've used their story in two of my books, Peddling
Prosperity and The Accidental Theorist, but it bears retelling,
this time with an Asian twist.
</P>
<P>
   The Sweeneys tell the story of--you guessed it--a baby-sitting
co-op, one to which they belonged in the early 1970s. Such co-ops
are quite common: A group of people (in this case about 150 young
couples with congressional connections) agrees to baby-sit for one
another, obviating the need for cash payments to adolescents. It's
a mutually beneficial arrangement: A couple that already has
children around may find that watching another couple's kids for an
evening is not that much of an additional burden, certainly
compared with the benefit of receiving the same service some other
evening. But there must be a system for making sure each couple
does its fair share.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Hill co-op adopted one fairly natural solution. It
issued scrip--pieces of paper equivalent to one hour of
baby-sitting time. Baby sitters would receive the appropriate
number of coupons directly from the baby sittees. This made the
system self-enforcing: Over time, each couple would automatically
do as much baby-sitting as it received in return. As long as the
people were reliable--and these young professionals certainly
were--what could go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it turned out that there was a small technical problem.
Think about the coupon holdings of a typical couple. During periods
when it had few occasions to go out, a couple would probably try to
build up a reserve--then run that reserve down when the occasions
arose. There would be an averaging out of these demands. One couple
would be going out when another was staying at home. But since many
couples would be holding reserves of coupons at any given time, the
co-op needed to have a fairly large amount of scrip in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Now what happened in the Sweeneys' co-op was that, for
complicated reasons involving the collection and use of dues (paid
in scrip), the number of coupons in circulation became quite low.
As a result, most couples were anxious to add to their reserves by
baby-sitting, reluctant to run them down by going out. But one
couple's decision to go out was another's chance to baby-sit; so it
became difficult to earn coupons. Knowing this, couples became even
more reluctant to use their reserves except on special occasions,
reducing baby-sitting opportunities still further.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the co-op had fallen into a recession. Since most of
the co-op's members were lawyers, it was difficult to convince them
the problem was monetary. They tried to legislate recovery--passing
a rule requiring each couple to go out at least twice a month. But
eventually the economists prevailed. More coupons were issued,
couples became more willing to go out, opportunities to baby-sit
multiplied, and everyone was happy.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, of course, the co-op issued too much scrip, leading
to different problems.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this is a silly story, a waste of your time, shame
on you. What the Capitol Hill Baby-Sitting Co-op experienced was a
real recession. Its story tells you more about what economic slumps
are and why they happen than you will get from reading 500 pages of
William Greider and a year's worth of Wall Street Journal
editorials.
</P>
<P>
   And if you are willing to really wrap your mind around the
co-op's story, to play with it and draw out its implications, it
will change the way you think about the world.

 (NO DATELINE: about the world.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   For example, suppose that the U.S. stock market was to crash,
threatening to undermine consumer confidence. Would this inevitably
mean a disastrous recession? Think of it this way: When consumer
confidence declines, it is as if, for some reason, the typical
member of the co-op had become less willing to go out, more anxious
to accumulate coupons for a rainy day. This could indeed lead to a
slump--but need not if the management were alert and responded by
simply issuing more coupons. That is exactly what our head
coupon-issuer Alan Greenspan did in 1987--and what I believe he
would do again. So as I said at the beginning, the story of the
baby-sitting co-op helps me to remain calm in the face of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose Greenspan did not respond quickly enough and that the
economy did indeed fall into a slump. Don't panic. Even if the
head-coupon issuer has fallen temporarily behind the curve, he can
still ordinarily turn the situation around by issuing more
coupons--that is, with a vigorous monetary expansion like the ones
that ended the recessions of 1981-82 and 1990-91. So as I said, the
story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the story of the co-op tells you that economic slumps
are not punishments for our sins, pains that we are fated to
suffer. The Capitol Hill co-op did not get into trouble because its
members were bad, inefficient baby sitters; its troubles did not
reveal the fundamental flaws of ``Capitol Hill values'' or ``crony
baby-sittingism.'' It had a technical problem--too many people
chasing too little scrip--which could be, and was, solved with a
little clear thinking. And so, as I said, the co-op's story helps
me to resist the pull of fatalism and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   But if it's all so easy, how can a large part of the world be in
the mess it's in? How, for example, can Japan be stuck in a
seemingly intractable slump--one that it does not seem able to get
out of simply by printing coupons?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if we extend the co-op's story a little bit, it is not
hard to generate something that looks a lot like Japan's
problems--and to see the outline of a solution.
</P>
<P>
   First, we have to imagine a co-op the members of which realized
there was an unnecessary inconvenience in their system. There would
be occasions when a couple found itself needing to go out several
times in a row, which would cause it to run out of coupons--and
therefore be unable to get its babies sat--even though it was
entirely willing to do lots of compensatory baby-sitting at a later
date.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve this problem, the co-op allowed members to borrow
extra coupons from the management in times of need--repaying with
the coupons received from subsequent baby-sitting. To prevent
members from abusing this privilege, however, the management would
probably need to impose some penalty--requiring borrowers to repay
more coupons than they borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   Under this new system, couples would hold smaller reserves of
coupons than before, knowing they could borrow more if necessary.
The co-op's officers would, however, have acquired a new tool of
management. If members of the co-op reported it was easy to find
baby sitters and hard to find opportunities to baby-sit, the terms
under which members could borrow coupons could be made more
favorable, encouraging more people to go out. If baby sitters were
scarce, those terms could be worsened, encouraging people to go out
less.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, this more sophisticated co-op would have a
central bank that could stimulate a depressed economy by reducing
the interest rate and cool off an overheated one by raising it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Japan--where the economy slumps despite interest
rates having fallen almost to zero? Has the baby-sitting metaphor
finally found a situation it cannot handle?
</P>
<P>
   Well, imagine there is a seasonality in the demand and supply
for baby-sitting. During the winter, when it's cold and dark,
couples don't want to go out much but are quite willing to stay
home and look after other people's children--thereby accumulating
points they can use on balmy summer evenings. If this seasonality
isn't too pronounced, the co-op could still keep the supply and
demand for baby-sitting in balance by charging low interest rates
in the winter months, higher rates in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that the seasonality is very strong indeed. Then in
the winter, even at a zero interest rate, there will be more
couples seeking opportunities to baby-sit than there are couples
going out, which will mean that baby-sitting opportunities will be
hard to find, which means that couples seeking to build up reserves
for summer fun will be even less willing to use those points in the
winter, meaning even fewer opportunities to baby-sit ... and the
co-op will slide into a recession even at a zero interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the winter of Japan's discontent. Perhaps because of
its aging population, perhaps also because of a general nervousness
about the future, the Japanese public does not appear willing to
spend enough to use the economy's capacity, even at a zero interest
rate. Japan, say the economists, has fallen into the dread
``liquidity trap.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what you have just read is an infantile explanation of
what a liquidity trap is and how it can happen. And once you
understand that this is what has gone wrong, the answer to Japan's
problems is, of course, quite obvious.
</P>
<P>
   So the story of the baby-sitting co-op is not a mere amusement.
If people would only take it seriously--if they could only
understand that when great economic issues are at stake, whimsical
parables are not a waste of time but the key to enlightenment--it
is a story that could save the world.

   NY-ETHNIC-ENTERTAINMENT (New York) _ If all New Yorkers share
one experience, it's the sensation of suddenly feeling like a
tourist without leaving the city. Take an alternate route, turn an
unfamiliar corner, peek into an open doorway, and suddenly you
could be in Tokyo or Timbuktu, with strangers chatting in an
unknown language while intriguing scents waft from a kitchen. New
York is Dakar north and Budapest east; there are contingents from
Ireland and Uzbekistan, Lebanon and Peru. And they hold on to the
places they left behind by gathering for music, theater or movies
from the old country, wherever that might be. By Jon Pareles.

<P>
   NY-SARATOGA-HORSES (Undated) _ One finds worlds within worlds in
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a fabled watering hole for high hats and
hot tipsters over the better part of the last two centuries. There
are the ancient mineral springs, the Revolutionary War sites, the
New York City Ballet and the National Museum of Dance, the hushed
forests and cricket-echoing parks, and the signposts of a civic
history involving blinkered cads, visionary patrons and some of
America's most prominent family dynasties. From the last week of
July through the first week of September, however, the Saratoga
story narrows down to a phrase: horse racing. By Mindy Aloff.

alchohol-free concert that ends by 7:00 p.m. and lets children
under 12 in for free just isn't a real concert experience. By
Andrew Revkin.

   WEST-POINT-NOVEL (West Point, N.Y.) _ When Lucien Truscott's
first novel, ``Dress Gray,'' was published 20 years ago, the
potboiler of homosexuality and scandal at West Point scandalized
the military establishment and made its author a pariah at the
academy. Now, he's published another steamy tale of academy life,
``Full Dress Gray,'' but this time he's being invited back for book
signings, coffee and dinner with the superintendent. By Frank

SILICON VALLEY EXEC AGREES TO SETTLE CASE WITH SEC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The founder of the biotechnology companies Alza
Corp. and Affymax NV settled insider trading charges related to the
1995 sale of Affymax by agreeing, along with several friends and
family members, to pay $1.85 million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Zaffaroni, 75, was fined $552,021 while five other
defendants agreed to pay a total of $1.3 million in a settlement
reached with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Zaffaroni told three friends in California and
Mexico and two family members in Uruguay in January 1995 that he
was in the final stages of selling Palo Alto-based Affymax to
London-based pharmaceutical giant Glaxo PLC, now known as Glaxo
Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   Those defendants, according to the SEC, bought Affymax
securities and profited when those shares appreciated after the
sale was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not every day that a chief executive officer
and member of the board of directors of a Silicon Valley company
engages in insider trading,'' said Peter Bresnan, assistant chief
litigation counsel with the SEC in Washington. ``We are sending an
important message to Silicon Valley companies that insider trading
laws apply to everyone at all levels of a company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresnan said the SEC had settled another insider trading case
involving a secretary at Affymax.
</P>
<P>
   Although the complaint against Zaffaroni was resolved to the
SEC's satisfaction, the charges did not directly accuse the former
executive of knowingly passing on the information or personally
benefiting from any of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni, who recently retired as chairman of Alza, known for
its popular nicotine patch, could not be reached for comment. But
his lawyer said he had agreed to the settlement because he did not
want to spend his time fighting the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact they're not charging he acted knowingly or
intentionally makes this a very unusual case,'' said Michael
Shepard, an attorney with Heller Ehrman White &AMP; McAuliffe in San
Francisco. ``He reached the settlement because he wanted to devote
his time to science and charity.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said that when Zaffaroni, a native of Uruguay, called
his sister in Uruguay for her 80th birthday, he had explained he
could not visit her because of the impending sale of Affymax. He
said the sister shared this with her guests, some of whom used the
information to buy the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni's nephew, Pedro Zaffaroni, agreed to pay $746,973,
while his niece, Ines Romero, will pay $71,639. Eugene Farber, of
Portola Valley, was fined $230,510, while San Mateo resident
Nicholas Vida will pay $83,510, and Alba Rosa Arzate of Mexico is
to pay $165,809. Zaffaroni's former sister-in-law, Yolanda Rocca,
was charged but not fined.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Burrill, chief executive of Burrill &AMP; Co., a San
Francisco merchant bank, said he had known Zaffaroni for many years
and did not believe the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Alex allegedly did sounds pretty innocent,'' he said.
``He is a leader in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries.
You're talking about a guy who is one of the genuine luminaries of
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni received a doctorate in biochemistry from the
University of Rochester in 1949 and joined the chemical company
Syntex Corp., leaving as president in 1968 to form Alza Corp., a
leading company in drug delivery methods.
</P>
<P>
   He founded Affymax in 1988 to develop ways to reduce the time
and cost needed to identify compounds for treating diseases. In
1995, Zaffaroni received the National Medal of Technology, the
highest award in the United States for technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Zaffaroni recently retired as chairman of Alza, but he maintains
an office at the company to help fund and support start-up
companies.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Air Bud: Golden Receiver G
</P>
<P>
   If you're under 8, this ``Bud's'' for you. In this sequel to
``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden retriever, and his
boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers) trade basketball for football. Scriptwise,
it's little more than a glorified after-school special, but there
hasn't been much around for younger kids recently and it handles
its messages well. And so what if the movie is essentially a series
of Stupid Pet Tricks? In his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy
looks more athletically heroic than Bruce Willis. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The world, interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon'' never lets the threat of global annihilation get in
the way of fun. It's a space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and
Ben Affleck saving the world for Liv Tyler. As a summer popcorn
movie, it's more enjoyable than that big-lizard flick ``Godzilla.''
And you'll see the reported $165 million budget onscreen in the
impressive effects and mammoth sets. But is the movie good for you?
Probably not. Rated PG-13 for sci-fi disaster action, implied sex
and profanity. 2 hours, 24 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman play stylish crime fighters John
Steed and Emma Peel in this big-screen update of the 1960s TV
series. Sean Connery co-stars as the pair's megalomaniacal nemesis,
Sir August De Wynter. Not reviewed at press time.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: NR
</P>
<P>
   BASEketball R
</P>
<P>
   Thank heaven for the rude boys of summer. In the wake of the
Farrelly Brothers and ``There's Something About Mary,'' here come
``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone in another
zesty, disgusting, laugh-out-loud comedy. Parker and Stone play two
slackers who invent a hybrid of baseball and basketball that
becomes a national sport. The movie manages to be racist, sexist,
homophobic and just about everything else. But it does so in a way
that kiddingly tweaks the very notion of political correctness.
Rated R for profanity, gross-out humor. 1 hour, 43 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B

<P>
   Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss R
</P>
<P>
   Harmless, mildly entertaining and completely disposable, this is
the movie equivalent of Richard Simmons. A cute, funny,
romantically minded photographer named Billy (Sean P. Hayes) falls
for a gorgeous hunk (Brad Rowe) who may or may not be gay but who
keeps himself tantalizingly available. (Though for what? Friendship
or love?) Rated R for language, sex and drug references. 1 hour, 32
minutes. (ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo 66 NR
</P>
<P>
   Don't shuffle off to this ``Buffalo.'' Former Calvin Klein
underwear model Vincent Gallo wrote, directed and stars in this
uneven fable about an ex-con who kidnaps a voluptuous teen
(Christina Ricci) to pose as his wife while he visits his parents
(Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston). The first half is amusingly
bonkers, thanks to the cast, but overall, the film is all over the
place _ self-pitying and sardonic, arty and maudlin. Not rated but
includes strong language, graphic violence and nudity. 1 hour, 46
minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing Behavior R
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly lame. This teens-in-peril flick is a high-concept
pitch with zero follow-through _ it's ``The Stepford Teens'' with a
touch of ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers.'' James Marsden plays a
newcomer to a smalltown high school who encounters a band of
frighteningly clean-cut students. With the help of the school
psychiatrist (Bruce Greenwood), these fascist Archies ``recruit'' a
new classmate into their group every few days. Rated R for
profanity, violence and sex. 1 hour, 23 minutes. (SM) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Ever After PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Re-inventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens more than Barney grads, the movie stars
Drew Barrymore as its spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her
scheming stepmother and Dougray Scott as a Prince who's more than
just another trophy husband. Jeanne Moreau, doyenne of the French
New Wave, contributes a classy cameo. Rated PG-13 for emotional
situations (death of a father) and some violence. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A

<P>
   The Governess R
</P>
<P>
   Where's Mary Poppins when you need her? In the 1840s, a young
Jewish woman (Minnie Driver) poses as a Christian to secure a job
with a wealthy family on a remote Scottish island and help her own
debt-stricken family. The film tries to deliver a treatise on
religious bigotry, plus a dollop of feminism within the context of
a fevered bodice-ripper. What evolves is an over-busy movie with
under-realized potential. Rated R for sexual scenes and nudity. 1
hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20 R
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Lee Curtis returns in this unsurprising 20th anniversary
sequel to John Carpenter's 1978 frightfest ``Halloween.'' Now,
she's a single mom to 17-year-old John (Josh Hartnett). Also back
is Michael Myers, the maniac who stalked Curtis all those years
ago. You can easily guess who'll survive and who'll get cut out of
the picture, literally. But when Curtis pulls a Sigourney Weaver, a
la ``Aliens,'' stalking Michael instead of fleeing him, the movie
finally gets some juice. Rated R for profanity, violence, gore,
alcohol use. 1 hour, 22 minutes. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   High Art R
</P>
<P>
   Former Brat Packer Ally Sheedy gives us a stunning lesson in the
high art of acting as a once-famous photographer who becomes
involved, both personally and professionally, with an ambitious
young editor (Radha Mitchell) at a chi-chi manhattan magazine. In
the film's pivotal role, Sheedy is all wired intensity and wary
irony. Rated R for language, drug use, nudity and sex. 1 hour, 42
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   How Stella Got Her Groove Back R
</P>
<P>
   The screen version of Terry McMillan's novel tries to distract
us from its lack of plot with visual opulence. Angela Bassett plays
a fortysomething investment banker who takes a trip to Jamaica with
her best pal (Whoopi Goldberg), where she falls for a 20-year-old
local (Taye Diggs). Luckily, Bassett roots the picture with a
glowing performance, sharing with us Stella's unexpected moments of
emotional rediscovery. Rated R for sexual situations, nudity,
language. 2 hours, 4 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Lethal Weapon 4 R
</P>
<P>
   The latest in director Richard Donner's cheerfully chaotic
blow-em-up series re-pairs Mel Gibson's hothead cop Riggs, and
Danny Glover's long-suffering partner Murtaugh. Shaggy and amiable,
Number 4 hardly bothers to get its real plot going for its first
hour. More than ever, the film is an excuse to give its crack
supporting cast, including Joe Pesci and Chris Rock, a series of
comic riffs. Rated R for violence and profanity. 2 hours, 5
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably faithful and fun adaptation of the beloved series
of children's books about a precocious red-headed orphan living in
a girls' school. Set in the relatively uncomplicated 1950s and
breathtakingly filmed in Paris, it's fast-paced enough to appeal to
kids (even little boys should take to the motor scooter-riding
rascal Pepito) and just nostalgic enough for adults. Rated PG for
comic violence. 1 hour, 29 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Derring-do done right. Our men in black are Anthony Hopkins and
Antonio Banderas who double our swashbuckling pleasure and double
our fun as dual Zorros, saving California and Hopkins' beautful,
spirited daughter (stunning newcomer, Catherine Zeta-Jones) from
the evil schemes of one Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). It's an expert
blend of panache, romanticism and supple, tongue-in-cheek humor.
Rated PG-13 for violence. 2 hours, 16 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Negotiator R
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator for the Chicago police department who is framed
for embezzlement and murder. Desperate to clear his name, he takes
four members of the department hostage, then asks another
negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as a mediator between himself and
his fellow officers. The film's main kick is the engrossing duel of
bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and Jackson. They make us
believe in the high stakes of the situation. Rated R for violence
and profanity. 2 hours, 15 minutes. (SM) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Parent Trap PG
</P>
<P>
   Wisely deviates little from the plot of the 1961 Disney film
that made 15-year-old Hayley Mills a star. This time Lindsay Lohan
plays the dual role of separated-practically-at-birth identical
twins who meet and switch identities in the hopes of reuniting
their divorced parents. Young kids may fidget at the length and
several kissing scenes. Rated PG for mild profanity and alcohol
use. 2 hours, 7 minutes. (Jill Vejnoska) Grade: B
</P>

   (pi) R
</P>
<P>
   Warning to anyone whose math paranoia dates back to 8th-grade
algebra: Darren Aronovsky has your number(s). In his technically
and intellectually brilliant film, a solitary math prodigy (Sean
Gulette) stumbles onto a number that could be the key to everything
unknowable in the universe, be it the stock market or god. Named
best director at Sundance, Aronovsky is clearly a talent to be
watched; hopefully, next time, he'll wed his head-trip images to a
more involving script. Rated R for vulgar language and grotesque
violence. 1 hour, 25 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of woman, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. It's
prurient ``ho''-some entertainment. Don't get played by it. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Polish Wedding PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Though it's playing the art-house circuit, this is more like a
``Moonstruck'' wannabe than anything Christina Ricci has done
lately. In Detroit, a large first-generation Polish family wrestles
with everything from adultery to teen pregnancy. And they're not
dysfunctional, just unchicly Old World. Director Theresa Connelly
debut film may be shaky and cliched, but her strong cast (Lena
Olin, Gabriel Byrne, Claire Danes) comes to her rescue. Rated PG-13
for sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Return to Paradise R
</P>
<P>
   Hardly paradise. Three guys party hard together in Malaysia. Two
(Vince Vaughn, David Conrad) return home and find out, two years
later from a lawyer (Anne Heche), that the third (Joaquin Phoenix)
has been jailed on drug charges since they left and will be hanged
in eight days unless they return to share the responsibility. But
that also means sharing the jail time. It's a terrific,
what-would-you-do moral dilemma that's squandered by an inept
script. Rated R for language, drug references and a brief sex
scene. 1 hour, 49 minutes. (ER) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Saving Private Ryan R
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad (and excellent
ensemble cast) on a mission to find a private (Matt Damon) whose
three brothers have already been killed in combat. Hanks'
performance is a miracle of decency and subtle emotion, but kudos
all 'round here. And the opening D-Day sequence is the most
powerful combat footage ever created on film. Rated R for extreme
violence and some vulgar language. 2 hours, 50 minutes. (ER) Grade:
A
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Smoke Signals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A bittersweet coming-of-age comedy about two Native Americans
who leave their dilapidated reservation to go to Arizona to fetch
their father's (one biological; the other spiritual) body. Rambling
and rough around the edges, with a honed casualness that suggests
the early '70s, Chris Eyre's debut film is still definitely worth a
look. Rated PG-13 for vulgar language and alcohol abuse. 1 hour, 30
minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Snake Eyes R
</P>
<P>
   Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage and Brian De Palma are always worth
gambling on; while they don't come up total winners here, they're
hardly losers either. Cage plays a crooked Atlantic City cop who
finds himself in the middle of an assassination plot during a
heavyweight boxing match. Part detective story, part
action-thriller, the picture loses steam near the end, but De
Palma's wired camerawork and Cage's strutting energy help hold it
together. Rated R for violence and language. 1 hour, 42 minutes.
(ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   There's Something About Mary R
</P>
<P>
   Rude, crude and hilarious, this comedy by the ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber''
team of Peter and Bobby Farrelly definitely isn't a family film.
Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
very particular bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his
prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years
later, he hires a lower-rung gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her
down. The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.
But the easy-to-offend should find something more polite to watch.
Rated R for strong comic sexual content and language. 1 hour, 58
minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM)

A DIALOGUE ON BLACK DIALECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   G.J. Savage's e-mail is heavy on statistics and racial buzz
words, light on logic and tact. He was one of a great many to
respond, some in adulation, others in stark anger, to last month's
essay addressing black American dialect, slavery's effects on
language, Magic Johnson's recently axed late-night talk fest, and
that old reliable potboiler, race.
</P>
<P>
   Quips G.J., with a snarl, if such can be picked up from words on
a computer screen: ``I guess, what with me being white, 75, and
male, I just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   What irks G.J. is the idea that a black American dialect exists,
and that it represents yet another form of racial separation by
black folk _ who ought to be, in his estimation, utterly ecstatic
to slip quietly into the splendid ways of European Americans.
</P>
<P>
   G.J. was humming along quite nicely, actually, writing of Martin
Luther King Jr.'s call for integration and such, until he wrote
that ``descendants of slaves should be thankful that it (slavery)
happened in the South, as opposed to Africa, because if their
ancestors hadn't been traded by their black captors they would have
been killed instead, and there would be no descendants enjoying the
great benefits of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   There were others like that one, but you get the general,
miseducated idea. Jose and Elizabeth Hawkins of Arlington. Texas,
were struck by other things, though, suggesting, among others, that
``The origins of the English spoken by the descendants of African
immigrants should be a field of serious study'' if the language I
described exists and has really been handed down from past
generations. It does, and it has.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that a black vernacular, shaped and sharpened through
an all- black existence, whether through forced separation,
economic hardship or ideology and culture, has nothing to do with a
lack of education in ``proper English.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams, who is black, agreed. ``I, too, have the same
situation where we `talk the talk' when we are around our
brothas,'' he writes. ``But we do have jobs where we have to use
the `proper English.' I work in a university setting, and proper
English is appropriate when speaking to students and colleagues.
But I find myself resorting to `black English' when speaking to the
brothas.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 30-something and raised in what he describes as ``a
Dallas ghetto,'' says he did have a choice. But to him, it was
``change or be subject to criticism and lost opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   James Kirchner, a white linguistics professor at Wayne State
University in Detroit, worked in factories for years with lower- to
lower-middle-class blacks and has had enough exposure to the
dialect ``that I can produce it in spurts during which people tell
me it sounds like some other person's voice is coming out of my
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an experience gives him some credibility when explaining
structural principles to students or to schoolteachers who often
have to deal with students who speak in the black English
vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main point I make is that this is not simply `lazy
speech,' but like all dialects of all language, it has regular,
complex rules and structure and can be spoken correctly or
incorrectly.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets less resistance to this idea from white students than
black. ``My black students tend to be deeply embarrassed by the
mere existence of this dialect (at least publicly),'' he writes,
``and draw their social distinctions largely based on it.''
</P>
<P>
   What surprises him most is the very idea that knowing and
speaking more than one dialect makes someone some kind of cultural
sellout. ``America seems to be one of the few places in the world
where anyone feels this way. In Germany, France, Italy and hundreds
of other countries, it's a foregone conclusion that people have to
learn a second (standard) dialect in order to function in the
larger society.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Irish, too, was ``amazed at how quickly the white guys (in
the military unit he was based in)'' picked up ``dis'' and ``dat''
and ``ax'' ( for ask).
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the country doesn't become too homogenized and we lose
our regionalisms and ethnic slang. I know as an Anglo Hispanic of
age 62, I still lapse into barrio slang (in Spanish) depending on
the association.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a black man,'' writes Chris Lark, ``I feel African-American
culture has got to grow beyond `whassap, brah?' Building on a
street culture is fine, but where is this street taking us to? Why
aren't there other ways of keeping us `black' than just bad use of
language?''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hammock goes deeper, with a warning. ``Language usage and
accent unfortunately stereotypes people ... Becoming `bilingual' is
one answer. But doesn't doing that perpetuate prejudice and, in the
case of blacks, racism? I can't think of a good answer.''

`RETURN TO PARADISE': AT THE MERCY OF FOOLISH FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production Notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sybaritic Malaysian idyll at the start of ``Return to
Paradise'' leaves a nightmarish aftermath throughout the rest of
the story. In this brooding drama of friendship and moral
responsibility, directed with somber intelligence by Joseph Ruben
(``Sleeping With the Enemy,'' ``The Stepfather''), three friends
endure the life-threatening consequences of a foolish mistake.
Sheriff (Vince Vaughn), Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) and Tony (David
Conrad) cap off their post-college frolicking with a carelessness
that ensnares Lewis. When the story picks up again, two years
later, Lewis may have only eight more days to live.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff, the cavalier member of the trio, is the one most
responsible for Lewis' fate. It was Sheriff who wrecked a rented
bicycle, causing its owner to summon Malaysian police. And it was
Sheriff who tossed a small brick of hashish into Lewis' trash bin,
not realizing the police would find it. Although Lewis was the only
one of the trio who planned to stay in Asia and do worthwhile work
(with orangutans), he finds himself imprisoned as a drug dealer.
Unless his friends come forth and accept their legal culpability,
Lewis will surely hang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Paradise'' is loosely based on a 1990 French film
called ``Force Majeure,'' which is not to be confused with the
Bruce Wagner novel of that title. But the film's tone is often
darkly cynical in ways that bring a writer like Wagner (``I'm
Losing You'') to mind. As written by Wesley Strick with the actor
and filmmaker Bruce Robinson (``Withnail and I''), the film zeroes
in on subtle negotiations between Lewis' erstwhile friends and his
fiercely dedicated lawyer, played in another sharply etched
performance by Anne Heche. The film's cool, sober texture and its
clever characters are often more interesting than the larger plot.
</P>
<P>
   As Sheriff, Vaughn (like Michael Keaton, whom he sometimes
resembles) projects a deep-seated skepticism and chilliness that
give the story its suspense; he seems quite capable of keeping his
distance and leaving Lewis to die. And Phoenix, though not often
seen after the film's vivid Malaysian prologue, conveys the
terrible pathos in Lewis' situation. But as Ms. Heche's formidable
Beth Eastern does her best to manipulate the other characters on
Lewis' behalf, ``Return to Paradise'' takes on the abstract
weightiness of an ethnical debate rather than the visceral urgency
of a thriller. Though the clock ticks relentlessly enough to
sustain the story's tension, the film finally seems to be a
character study in search of a gripping plot.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben has assembled a fine cast down to the secondary characters
(Vera Farmiga briefly rivets attention as Tony's savvy fiancee) and
has given the film a haunting exoticism, especially in its richly
detailed Asian scenes. Like ``Red Corner,'' it devotes considerable
attention to the courtroom manners and unforgiving judicial code in
an Asian country. One curious footnote: the hellish Malaysian jail
that is seen here (and was also a setting for ``12 Monkeys'') is
actually a derelict penitentiary in Philadelphia. Lewis' prison
cell is modeled on the real one that housed Al Capone.

`CHAMBERMAID ON THE TITANIC': A SENSUAL STORY THE HEART TELLS THE
HEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our need for stories _ and not just any old anecdotes but
transporting tales of passion, heroism and loss _ may be as
essential to our well-being as our need for food. It is an appetite
that embraces not just the classic fairy tales and adventure
stories that are handed down through the generations but our own
personal narratives. The little storm-tossed autobiographies we
compile help us explain and validate passions that might otherwise
have no meaning once they've died.
</P>
<P>
   As skeptical as we may be about the boastful tales others spin
about their romantic exploits, there is a part of us that hungers
to believe and to be imaginatively swept by the most far-fetched
fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   That is the profound notion explored by Bigas Luna's ``The
Chambermaid on the Titanic,'' whose title misleadingly suggests a
low-rent offshoot of James Cameron's blockbuster hit. The movie,
adapted from a novel by Didier Decoin, tells the story of Horty
(Olivier Martinez), an impoverished foundry worker in northern
France who wins a company athletic contest. First prize is a
round-trip ticket to Southhampton, England to witness the maiden
voyage of the Titanic.
</P>
<P>
   The ugly underside of the victory is its provision of
transportation and luxury hotel accommodations for only one. Horty
must leave behind his adoring wife Zoe (Romane Bohringer) on whom
his boss has sexual designs.
</P>
<P>
   Horty has barely settled into his Southhampton hotel room, when
there is a knock on his door. A beautiful young French woman in a
maid's uniform explains apologetically that she is a chambermaid on
the ship who needs a place to sleep because all the local hotels
are filled. Horty allows the woman, Marie (Aitana Sanchez Gijon),
to stay with him and donates the bed while he moves to an armchair.
</P>
<P>
   But in the middle of the night, Marie invites Horty to join her
and attempts to seduce him. Although he resists her advances, he
has such vivid erotic dreams that the following morning, when he
awakes and finds her gone, he wonders what transpired. Just as the
Titanic is about to set sail, he sees a photographer taking a
picture of Marie. Accosting the photographer, he retrieves the
picture as a souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to France, Horty finds himself promoted to a less
demanding job at the foundry and bitterly accuses his wife of
having given in to the boss. Shortly after the news of the
Titanic's sinking, Horty shows his fellow workers his photograph of
Marie. When they pester him for sexual details, he impulsively
begins concocting a feverishly erotic story of the ultimate
one-night stand with this dream lover who was lost at sea.
</P>
<P>
   As he elaborates the tale, day after day, it attracts growing
crowds, and eventually paying customers. Horty's life changes when
he is discovered by a flamboyant traveling actor and storyteller
named Zeppe (Aldo Maccione) who takes him on the road and
eventually into the theater with a glossy production designed
around his increasingly melodramatic tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chambermaid on the Titanic'' has great fun suggesting how
how good stories tend to get ``better'' over time. It also enjoys
playing tricks on us by flashing back to the one- night stand with
soft-core flashbacks that make us wonder if it's true.
</P>
<P>
   As time passes, Horty's fantasy becomes such a fixture in his
consciousness that it becomes true, even if it didn't happen. Zoe,
who follows him on the road and eventually plays Marie on stage, is
rightfully jealous of a dream she could never come close to
matching. The movie forcefully reminds us of the degree to which
any grand passion is rooted in fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But the film never finds a visual vocabulary to match the
elegance of its ideas. The flashbacks and fantasy sequences are
standard soft-core fluff. And although Martinez and Ms. Gijon, who
play the lovers, are splendid looking, they are both cool cookies
whose faces betray little genuine passion.
</P>
<P>
   Released in the wake of the ``Titanic'' phenomenon, the movie
also works as a mocking commentary on the hoopla surrounding
Cameron's film. A maritime disaster that took place 86 years ago
has consumed so much media attention it might just as well have
happened last year. Put a star-crossed pair at the epicenter of a
tragedy and you have a commercial formula that will never wear out
its welcome. &QL;

AS AMERICAN AS 19TH-CENTURY PIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ American 19th-century art is rarely as simple as it
looks. A Thomas Cole landscape seems straightforward enough, with
its mountains, forests and moody skies evoking an inspirational
lift, a nostalgic sigh.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, its impulses are urgent and unsettling, full of
personal disquiet, political directives, spiritual yearning.
</P>
<P>
   Few artists of the period offer challenges as deceptively
disguised as William Sidney Mount (1807-1868).
</P>
<P>
   Mount's subject wasn't the American landscape; it was the
American figure, or, more accurately, the American character, with
its multifarious virtues and defects, generosities and prejudices,
as viewed in the turning-point decades leading up to the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Mount more or less invented American genre painting, with its
emblematic narratives of everyday life. In doing so, he paved the
way for artists as varied as Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Edward
Hopper, Horace Pippin and Norman Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   But genre as a style was, until fairly recently, the last
underprivileged frontier of American art historical study. Perhaps
that explains why ``William Sidney Mount: Painter of American
Life'' at the New-York Historical Society is the first
comprehensive consideration of this artist's career in many years.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Deborah J. Johnson, president of the Museums at
Stony Brook on Long Island, where the bulk of Mount material
resides, the show of 50 paintings, drawings and prints is an ideal
size: big enough to capture the texture of a career, small enough
to let a visitor see everything and still feel fresh enough to go
back to the start and look again.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what one might be inclined to do with a show that
tells so suggestive a story of an artist and his time. Mount was
from Setauket, on Long Island, the son of a farmer who also
operated a tavern and a store. Plagued by ill health, he never
married, didn't travel much, mostly lived with relatives and died
where he was born.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't a recluse, though, or a hayseed. He was a
sophisticated painter who calculatedly played a country-cousin
role. An 1832 self-portrait shows an unpretentiously attractive,
intelligent face, the brow broad and clear, the eyes bright and
looking straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is the self-confident but unromantic demeanor of a young
professional _ he could be a city clerk or a small-town worthy _
who had already tasted success and knew that he had worked hard to
achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, like many early American artists, Mount started out in
a humble but respectable artisan trade, in his case as an
apprentice sign painter for one of his brothers in Manhattan. He
never forgot his roots in a vernacular tradition: he declared, with
democratic bravado, that he wanted ``to paint for the many, not for
the few.'' But he was ambitious, and other possibilities beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, naturally, was the European Grand Manner. As a
young man, Mount aspired to being a history painter, at the time
regarded as the noblest calling in the plastic arts. He enrolled at
the recently established National Academy of Design and pursued his
goal, as an early biblical painting inspired by the
Romantic-Classical work of Benjamin West reveals.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Christ Raising the Daughter of Jairus'' (1828), the
work caused a major flutter when he exhibited it at the Academy,
though it's hard to see why. It's a tired, bad, old-fogeyish piece.
The figures are stock creations; the emotions the stuff of cut-rate
melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he suspected that he was on the wrong track, working
against his own grain. For whatever reasons, he went back to Long
Island and, with frequent Manhattan excursions, stayed.
</P>
<P>
   And there he became the history painter he wanted to be, on his
own terms. He began to make, as the art historian Barbara Novak has
observed, something monumental of contemporary fact, not with
high-flown, borrowed rhetoric, but (as Mount himself said) ``with
the industry of a reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his academic interest declined; far from it. He just
slyly turned it on its head. He based a funky little 1830 painting
of fighting, bloody-nosed schoolboys, for example, on the heroic
figures in Jacques-Louis David's iconic ``Oath of the Horatii.'' A
lesson book in the painting titled ``Grammar Simplified'' lets us
in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   More important, he began to draw every incident and detail from
near at hand. For his first genre piece, ``Girl With a Pitcher''
(1829), he used his younger sister, Ruth, as his model, posing her
near a rough-hewn shed.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly later and hugely successful ``Rustic Dance After a
Sleigh Ride'' is set in a second-floor bedroom of his family's
home. His eye for the delicacies of quotidian design is tireless,
from the eyelash curl of a door fixture to the piping on the sleeve
of a shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the balance he was after between high and low began to
jell, as is clear in one of his best early paintings, ``Dancing on
the Barn Floor'' (1831). Two young people are engaged in a rustic
pas de deux _ the man has the upward-and-outward look of Mount's
self-portrait _ as a smiling fiddler plays, and you can almost hear
Scots-Irish jigs and reels charging the air.
</P>
<P>
   But what holds the eye is the barn itself, an elaborate
structural puzzle of interlocking planes and taut, flexed lines.
This is the first of Mount's paintings in which country
architecture becomes a character in itself, and one can sense him
struggling _ the endless perspective drawings he did in these years
are proof _ to get it exactly, effortlessly right.
</P>
<P>
   The barn's geometry _ solid, logical, built to last _ was a
reassuring emblem for a society still clinging to an agrarian
self-identity, especially as that identity was changing.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1830s, America's wilderness was all but mythical. Cities
were swollen with immigrants. A class of wealthy, bourgeois
merchants, many of them politically conservative, was on the rise.
The rift between North and South had appeared; slavery was an
inflammatory issue.
</P>
<P>
   All of this finds its way into Mount's narratives, which
increasingly become topical commentaries and morality tales. Some,
like ``Bargaining for a Horse,'' are gibes at the American
character, in this case its shrewd, close-to-the-chest business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the repellent ``Catching Rabbits (Boys Trapping),''
are editorials on party politics. The admonition here is that the
Whigs were catching gullible voters while the Democrats (with whom
Mount was at the time aligned) were in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The meanings of such images, obvious to Mount's patrons, who
basically hired him as a storyteller, must be teased out and
guessed at today. Yet beginning in the 1830s, he produced a number
of paintings, many of which show black Americans playing a central
role, that carry a deep, disturbingly ambiguous resonance today.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most famous of them is ``Farmers Nooning'' (1836), a
depiction of five farmers relaxing on a late-summer afternoon.
Three young men lounge in the shade of a tree. A sleeping black man
lies stretched out on a haystack in full sunlight. A boy in a
tam-o'-shanter leans over him, about to tickle his nose with a
blade of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Mount's Grand Manner preoccupations are in play: the pose of the
sleeping man recalls the image of a sensuous nude goddess by
Correggio then in wide circulation. And his fastidious structural
concerns are apparent. The diagonals of distant crisscrossed fence
posts and a leaning rake handle echo the sleeper's balletically
raised arm; the languid curve of his body is repeated in a scythe
hanging from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is one of the first sympathetic depictions of a
black figure in all of American art, but the scene is far from
being an idyll. The black man's figure is shown exposed,
unprotected, acted upon, as women traditionally were depicted in
painting. (Mount used a virtually identical image in the later
``Dance of the Haymakers,'' but here the figure is that of a
standing white man.)
</P>
<P>
   The art historian Elizabeth Johns, in her fascinating book on
American genre painting, has read him as a racial stereotype
typifying indolence, and the scene itself as an anti-abolitionist
statement. The nose-tickling child, borrowed from Dutch genre
painting, may stand for reformist forces threatening to awaken the
black slave to a dangerous self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Did the artist intend these racial and topical readings? It's
hard to say. He rarely wrote about his attitude toward race, though
he had an abiding affection for his black neighbors on Long Island.
His anti-abolitionist sentiments are a matter of record, but his
reasons for holding them seem to have been complicated rather than
merely knee-jerk.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reality, his depictions of blacks grew in
psychological depth, culminating in two of his finest works, both
from the mid-1840s. In one, ``The Power of Music,'' a middle-age
black man in overalls stands leaning against a barn door, absorbed
in the sound of fiddling inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the other, ``Eel Spearing at Setauket,'' a black woman stands
in the prow of a skiff, spear poised over the water, while a white
child steadies the boat with an oar behind her.
</P>
<P>
   This painting, with its eggshell sky and dun-colored landscape
is both a Luminist masterpiece _ a moment of time is frozen in
light _ and a memory piece, commissioned by the New York lawyer
George Washington Strong as an evocation of his own youth.
</P>
<P>
   It is Mount's only picture of a black woman, and here the
artist's commentarial impulses seem, for once, to be in abeyance.
The result is history painting, American-style, perfected: laden
with sociological data but as still as a classical frieze.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1850s, Mount painted some half-length pictures of black
musicians, like the portrait of a violinist titled ``Right and
Left.'' They depicted their sitters with an animated dignity. But
their references were to minstrel shows and cliched associations of
blacks with music. Conceived as designs for prints, they were meant
to appeal to the European taste for American exotica.
</P>
<P>
   These works aside, Mount's output from the 1850s shows a talent
in decline. Pictures tend to look fussy or bland, as if he had lost
his self-confidence, and with it his touch. By this time, the vogue
for genre-as-history that Mount pioneered was in eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   The task of providing an American self-image had landed
decisively on the landscape machines of Hudson River School artists
like Frederic Edwin Church, whose star was high when Mount died at
60.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson River painters are, of course, crucial to any
understanding of what made America tick before and after the Civil
War, and they have the advantage of being conceptually opaque and
malleable. You can take them as you wish, as mirrors and shapers of
political sentiment, as searching philosophical statements, or,
collectively, as a kind of lulling transcendentalist mood music.
</P>
<P>
   Mount's work is different. His art is not one of high ideals but
of observations and of opinions, which range from middle of the
road to reactionary. The world he painted, even at its quietest,
jangles with human tension. It is peopled with party animals and
gawky lovers, practical jokers and upright yeomen, demure lasses
and contentious drunks.
</P>
<P>
   The faces of his Long Island folk may be as fresh as apples, but
they hide mundane corruptions: resentments, self-serving
assessments, the dark stuff behind the hearty American ``Hi!''
</P>
<P>
   What you think you see in Mount's work is, in sum, rarely what
you are actually getting. Every situation and gesture is coded (and
because history adds its own input, now double- and triple-coded).
</P>
<P>
   Some of the meanings are probably lost for good; others just
don't matter anymore. But from all of the culturally specific
hustle and bustle, Mount distilled a handful of big-thinking and
unanswering pictures.
</P>
<P>
   In them he really did capture something of America's youthful
but uninnocent heart. And he got at issues, large and small _ race,
political morality, the double-edged power of popular culture _
that are still right on the table, unresolved. What (italics)he(end
italics) made of all of this, he doesn't really say. And in the
end, his willingness to let his art be casually inscrutable _ to
keep a faint ``I know what I know'' reserve behind its homely,
bucolic cheer _ is the most provocative thing about him. &QL;

`AIR BUD': A GRIDIRON HERO WHO BARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't tell the new Air Bud, aka Buddy, but he doesn't look all
that good in a football uniform. Maybe it's the shoulder pads.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' is a fine sequel to
``Air Bud,'' last summer's sentimental children's movie in which
the title dog metamorphosed from abused clown's assistant to adored
family pet to basketball star. But this time around it's the boy's
story; the dog's mastery of a new sport is almost a subplot.
</P>
<P>
   Josh (Kevin Zegers, the only major cast member from the original
film still around) is in the eighth grade now and looking good,
living happily with his young widowed mother (Cynthia Stephenson)
and his preternaturally adorable baby sister (Alyson MacLaren) in
the idyllic town of Fernfield. Then a new veterinarian comes to
town. Dr. Patrick Sullivan (Gregory Harrison) seems like a nice
enough guy, but Josh reevaluates him when he starts dating Mom. He
knows it's serious when he learns she has given the doctor a place
on her telephone's speed dial.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason Josh takes up football is to get away from this
budding romance. And his team, the Timberwolves, needs all the help
it can get. Buddy's ability to catch a pass in his mouth and run
like the wind for a touchdown may save them, or it may be their
new-found confidence and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   But into every pet star's life a bad guy must fall, trying to
steal him. In this film, there are two and they're driving an
ice-cream truck. Natalya (Nora Dunn of ``Saturday Night Live'') and
Popov (Perry Anzilotti) are Russian circus people looking for a new
main attraction. They do this in the style of Boris and Natasha of
``The Bullwinkle Show.'' This is not a criticism. In fact, it's
delicious when Ms. Dunn announces, ``That was our boy and dog,''
because it sounds just like ``moose and squirrel.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other ridiculous grown-ups for young moviegoers to
laugh at _ the school principal whose screeching soprano murders
``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' bumbling referees, Tim Conway and
Dick Martin in cameos as game announcers _ but the adult leads are
treated with respect and affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Bud: Golden Receiver'' is a simplistic movie. You can see
the plot developments coming a mile away. And the exposition isn't
always graceful (yes, we need to see the newspaper clipping about
Josh's father's death, but what is a framed 8-by-10 of Dad doing in
the garage?). But the film is pleasantly sweet and occasionally
sharp. (``We'll be the laughingstock of the league,'' one player
complains when it's suggested that they put a dog on the team.
Another boy points out that they already are.)
</P>
<P>
   Buddy (played, according to the cast list, by four golden
retrievers: Rush, Zak, Chase and Chance) is in excellent form. And
if the sight of juvenile football players celebrating touchdowns by
rolling over on their backs and kicking their limbs in the air (in
imitation of Buddy's usual joyful response) doesn't make you smile,
you're a big old grouch.

`HOW STELLA GOT HER GROOVE BACK': SHE'S 40, HE'S 20 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is far from the first
Hollywood movie to flaunt the look and attitude of a glitzy travel
brochure. But it may be the first to blatantly portray a tropical
paradise as a sexual mecca beckoning tired American businesswomen
to shed their clothes and inhibitions and roll around with the
local talent.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she plops herself down at a luxury hotel in
Jamaica, Stella (Angela Bassett), a beautiful, in-shape 40-year-old
San Francisco stockbroker and divorced mother of one, is pursued by
an impeccably courtly 20-year-old hunk named Winston (Taye Diggs).
</P>
<P>
   If Winston has nothing better to do than lounge around hotel
swimming pools waiting for the perfect older woman to appear and
make his indolent life more exciting, he is definitely no gigolo.
The handsome, well-mannered, soft-spoken (and presumably brave,
clean and reverent) son of an affluent local surgeon and his
haughty wife, Winston is biding his time before possibly going to
medical school. He also happens to have the body of a god. And at
various points in the film, which is the directorial debut of Kevin
Rodney Sullivan, the camera pans droolingly over the young man's
well-toned flesh.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent preview screening of the movie, such moments
elicited a collective gasp and squeal from women in the audience.
These soft-core flourishes aren't half as revealing as what a male
strip club might provide, but they still give the movie the flavor
of a Chippendales-in-the-Caribbean promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, adapted by Terry McMillan from her
semi-autobiographical novel, is pointedly boundary-breaking in its
positive portrayal of a May-September relationship between a
younger man and an older woman. And while it presents the rosiest
possible view of such a relationship, it doesn't completely shy
away from the downside. When Winston impulsively introduces Stella
to his parents, the young man's mother, who is just a year older
than Stella, is brutally condescending.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Winston goes to live with Stella in her gorgeous
home in Marin County, he is more interested in playing video games
with her 11-year-old son, Quincy (Michael Pagan), and consuming
junk food than in following grown-up pursuits. Then there is the
financial discrepancy. Winston appears to have some means (he
produces some pretty expensive gifts for Stella), but even after
she loses her job with a brokerage house, he can't compete with her
level of spending, and he begins to resent it.
</P>
<P>
   In a halfhearted subplot intended to double the movie's suds
quotient, Stella's oldest friend and traveling companion, Delilah
(Whoopi Goldberg), who works in window display (and pulls stunts
like stuffing the crotches of the mannequins modeling Calvin Klein
underwear), is diagnosed with liver cancer but doesn't tell her
friend. A mawkish death-bed scene awkwardly tries to camouflage the
movie's basic lack of interest in Delilah, whom Ms. Goldberg plays
with her customary down-home gusto. That twinkling crocodile grin
hasn't lost its power to charm, shtick though it may be.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bassett's Stella is the best thing in the movie. Proud,
combative and fiery, but also quite vulnerable, she is the farthest
thing from a predatory sensualist in search of kicks. Ms. Bassett
portrays this high-strung superwoman with such intensity that she
makes her almost believable.
</P>
<P>
   Diggs imbues Winston with an easy grace and dignity. But his
performance is too soft-spoken and embellished with too many vacant
smiles for his character to emerge as anything more than a misty
romantic fantasy. Even when he loses his temper, Winston is
impossibly, reassuringly nice.
</P>

`SLUMS OF BEVERLY HILLS': A GIRL FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE GLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tamara Jenkins' playfully autobiographical ``Slums of Beverly
Hills'' begins with the spectacle of Murray Abramowitz (Alan Arkin)
overseeing the purchase of his daughter Vivian's first bra. It's a
moment, like many in the film, that leaves Vivian (Natasha Lyonne)
wide-eyed and aghast, incredulous over what goes on in her family.
</P>
<P>
   And no matter how such a father-daughter episode might play
today, the film is set in a 1976 that it remembers as a more
innocent time. In this atmosphere, Murray's behavior is simply
overbearing and nosy beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   With a wry air of having been here and done this, Ms. Jenkins
(who developed her story at the Sundance Director's Lab) then leads
her audience on a guided tour of the nomadic habits of the
Abramowitzes, whom she has described as ``Jewish Joads.''
</P>
<P>
   No ``Grapes of Wrath'' setting here, though: the film's
characters simply wander from one garishly named apartment to
another on the fringes of Beverly Hills, where the divorced Murray
is determined to keep his daughter and two sons. He claims he's
doing this for the sake of a good school district, and Arkin makes
his stubborn, meddlesome character so utterly ingenuous that it's
possible to believe him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to show the sweetness and weirdness of people who
will do anything to maintain their dignity,'' Ms. Jenkins has said.
And her idiosyncratic family story does exactly that, while also
chronicling every embarrassment that heralds Vivian's sexual coming
of age. Unusually frank in this regard, the film (which makes ample
use of body doubles) watches Vivian tentatively experiment with the
boy next door, a guy named Eliot (Kevin Corrigan), who is proud of
his Charles Manson T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes Vivian's amazement at the way Rita (Marisa Tomei),
her zany, glamorous cousin who is just out of rehab, flounces about
in the buff, even in the Abramowitz living room.
</P>
<P>
   Since Vivian isn't one to flounce, she experiences a sexual
awkwardness that is very much akin to her family's socioeconomic
uncertainty. She's an outsider everywhere, and the film treats her
predicament with affectionate humor. Ms. Lyonne (the young narrator
in Woody Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love You'') makes this smart,
rueful young woman a beacon of sanity in the midst of the film's
well-drawn eccentrics, who congregate most hilariously in a variety
of dinner-table episodes.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these scenes, Jessica Walter plays a perfect Beverly
Hills specimen whom Murray is trying to date. In another, Carl
Reiner and Rita Moreno play Rita's parents, who frankly let Murray
know which Abramowitzes are wealthy and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know what's coming next in a film that devotes one
sequence to breast-reduction surgery and a couple of others to
Vivian's discovery of the vibrator (courtesy of Rita).
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Jenkins, who makes her writing and directing debut with
wit and confidence, keeps the small surprises frequent and the
coming-of-age perspective sharp. (One surprise is how little the
film shows of Beverly Hills, except when the Abramowitz family
piles into a car to flee from one apartment to the next.) She makes
the most of an especially ingratiating cast, with Ms. Tomei very
charming and funny as Rita, Corrigan as slyly flirtatious as a
Manson fan can be, and David Krumholtz as the wisecracking brother
who fits right into the Abramowitz ethos.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, especially Ms. Lyonne and Arkin, project a crazy
sincerity that turns this personal and nostalgic comedy into a very
true story indeed.

FATHER OF PUBLIC RELATIONS IS SUBJECT OF STARTLING BOOK

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You may not know Edward Bernays, but he certainly knew you.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no other person, dead or alive, has influenced the
American public so much, yet is known by so few.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his famous uncle, Sigmund Freud, Bernay is unlikely to be
mentioned in schoolbooks. Yet his influence over Americans' daily
habits and thoughts in the 20th century is profound.
</P>
<P>
   Did you have eggs and bacon for breakfast (or at least dreamed
you had)? Thank Eddie Bernays.
</P>
<P>
   Did you take up smoking to stay slim, ladies? Bernays thought up
that concept.
</P>
<P>
   Did you support the Persian Gulf War? You probably didn't know
that some rich Kuwaitis hired Hill and Knowlton to rally the
American public into fighting Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The
public relations firm learned how to do that from Bernays, the
Father of Public Relations .
</P>
<P>
   Bernays is profiled in a thought-provoking book titled ``The
Father of Spin: Edward L. Bernays and the Birth of Public
Relations'' (Crown, 306 pages, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Author Larry Tye, who took a year's leave from The Boston Globe
to write the book, did ample research on his subject. In addition
to a personal interview before Bernays died in 1995, Tye
interviewed more than 100 relatives, friends and co-workers of the
spinmeister.
</P>
<P>
   Tye also sorted through the more than 800 boxes of personal and
professional papers in which Bernays outlined the strategies and
tactics for the cases he handled. He left the boxes to the Library
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this research is a richly detailed portrait of a
man whose influence is felt worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernays demonstrated to an entire generation of budding PR men
and women the enormous power that lay within their grasp,'' Tye
writes. ``If housewives could be guided in their selection of soap,
so could husbands in their choice of a car. And voters in their
selection of candidates. And candidates in their political
posturing. Indeed, the very substance of American thought was mere
clay to be molded by the savvy public relations practitioner, or so
it seemed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernays' revolutionary ideas were based on discovering trends
and capitalizing on them. He called it ``crystallizing public
opinion,'' and it proved to sell products ranging from soap and
hair nets to presidential candidates and war.
</P>
<P>
   Those concepts came indirectly from his famous psychiatrist
uncle, Freud, Tye concludes. The Father of Psychoanalysis and his
quick nephew had numerous long discussions while walking in the
Viennese woods at the beginning of Bernays' career during the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much as Freud had revolutionized the way the world thought
about individual behavior, so Bernays was able to transform
attitudes toward group action,'' Tye writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used his uncle's ideas in the commercial realm to predict,
then adjust, the way people believed and behaved. Never mind that
they didn't realize it. In fact, all the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus Bernays came up with slogans such as ``Reach for a Lucky
(cigarette) Instead of a Sweet'' to entice women to become smokers.
He organized massive soap-sculpting contests to get children
interested in Ivory soap. Representing Mack trucks, he lobbied
Congress for billions of dollars to construct a national highway
system.
</P>
<P>
   The latter became a model for lobbying by powerful political
action committees today, Tye writes.
</P>
<P>
   Many readers will feel uncomfortable with such a documented and
detailed look of how the American public became so malleable.
</P>
<P>
   Tye is quick to point out that some issues in the book are
larger than Bernays.
</P>
<P>
   His book is not just about Bernays, but about America, Tye
writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is about how public thought is routinely shaped or, some
might say, manipulated by singular powers in our culture,'' he
writes. ``And so it is by necessity a book about democracy in the
era of the spinmeister.''

`REGENERATION': DOCTOR AND POET TRANSFORMED BY WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After serving heroically during the first part of World War I
and winning a medal for bravery, British poet Siegfried Sassoon
famously experienced a change of heart. In 1917, feeling that the
war was no longer one he could sanction, he wrote a declaration
that cited his objections, a document that was read aloud in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, Sassoon faced a choice between being
court-martialed or being sent to a mental hospital. Urged to do the
latter by his comrade Robert Graves, he entered Craiglockhart
Hospital, a castle just outside of Edinburgh, with his defiance
undimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Booker Prize-winning novel by Pat Barker and
adapted thoughtfully by Allan Scott, Gillies Mackinnon's
``Regeneration'' is about the experiences of Sassoon and a number
of shell-shocked soldiers in this institutional setting. It's also
about the profound ways in which the doctor who treats them, Dr.
William Rivers (Jonathan Pryce), is affected by what he sees and
hears.
</P>
<P>
   Initially confident of the rightness of his views toward
warfare, and of his mandate to cure the soldiers and send them back
into battle, Rivers is greatly changed by his debates with Sassoon
and several other patients. One of them is Wilfred Owen (Stuart
Bunce), encouraged by Sassoon to write the stinging war poetry for
which he became posthumously celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Regeneration'' has been ready for a while (I first saw
it more than a year ago), it now arrives alongside ``Saving Private
Ryan'' to delve vividly into the experience of the battlefield and
the moral questions that combat engenders.
</P>
<P>
   And if this literate, subtly acted film also pales somewhat in
comparison to its more spectacular Hollywood counterpart, it stands
out as a stirring and articulate exploration of warfare and its
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   With battle remembered by the traumatized soldiers as a panorama
of muddy horrors, and hauntingly captured by Mackinnon,
``Regeneration'' addresses difficult questions about what these men
can and should do with their futures.
</P>
<P>
   The film presents a catalog of psychic war wounds, from the
sudden muteness and memory loss suffered by Billy Prior (Jonny Lee
Miller of ``Trainspotting''), a tough and embittered working-class
soldier, to the damage that subjects another soldier to
electroshock therapy. (A long, graphic depiction of the latter is
one of the most wrenching sequences here.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, these men also attempt to make sense _ or, in Owen's
case, even art _ of what they have been through. And Rivers finds
himself increasingly shaken in his certitude that he can cure such
deep-seated injuries or even that he should. The film's best
moments present the intense debate that rages between Sassoon and
the doctor throughout their shared interlude.
</P>
<P>
   James Wilby, best known here for his starring role in
``Maurice,'' gives Sassoon a dignity and forcefulness that lend
urgency to his qualified pacifism, and he makes Sassoon's stature
as a poet easy to believe.
</P>
<P>
   And Pryce makes a thoughtful, moving Rivers, a man whose crisis
of conscience rises to a par with that of the famous poet. Bunce
readily conveys the sensitivity and keenness that distinguished
Owen's writing, while Miller seethes formidably as the bitterly
rebellious Billy Prior.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the cast is Tanya Allen as Sarah, a young woman who has
lost one lover to the war, and whose tenderness becomes part of
Billy's cure.
</P>

DISNEY'S NEWEST KINGDOM SUFFERS FROM HEAT, HUMIDITY, UNCOOPERATIVE
ANIMALS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by ANIMAL KINGDOM-BOX) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Long before you reach the park, you glimpse the
145-foot-tall Tree of Life that serves as the centerpiece of
Disney's ambitious Animal Kingdom. Even from a mile away, its
majesty is evident, and the closer you get the more impressive the
tree becomes.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the Tree of Life is six steel columns from an oil
rig. The steel is wrapped in Styrofoam and covered with additional
layers of concrete and plaster. A team of 11 sculptors spent 12
months carving 325 individual animal shapes into the
concrete/plaster ``bark,'' and they were fine craftsmen. The detail
in each carving is beyond belief, and the resulting images achieve
photo-ready perfection surpassing the powers of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair to guess that most visitors to Animal Kingdom since
the park opened this spring consider the Tree of Life their fondest
memory. After all, they probably had an hour or more to study it in
detail while they waited in the soggy Florida heat to see a 3-D
show about bugs in a theater under its ``roots.'' At least the
carved animals on the tree hold still for a Kodak moment. The real
animals in the park, more interested in shade and privacy than
posing, are far less cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reason Animal Kingdom so far is as much tarnish on
the Disney crown as an additional, sparkling jewel. Disney's
reputation is founded on make-believe, taking visitors into fantasy
worlds that are fun and impervious to any sort of unpleasantness.
All the corporate millions it has poured into Animal Kingdom can't
prevent rhinos from voiding their bowels within sight and smell of
the paying customers _ if the customers even see the rhinos.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the adjacent Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and MGM/Disney
Studios, Animal Kingdom opens for the day at 7 rather than 9 a.m.,
with good reason. Animals are more likely to move around in the
early morning when it's cool.
</P>
<P>
   First-time visitors will be struck by the immensity of Animal
Kingdom: at 500-plus acres, it is five times the size of Magic
Kingdom or Disneyland. Many have correctly likened the park layout
to the face of a clock. Entrance Plaza is at 6; Safari Village,
with restaurants and gift shops clustered about the Tree of Life,
is in the exact center of the clock face. Dinoland is at 4, Asia at
1, Africa at 11 and Camp Minnie-Mickey at 8. To get anywhere in the
park, it is necessary to begin in Safari Village and cross bridges
to reach another section. Only Asia, still to be completed, and
Africa are on the same ``land mass''; an elaborately-designed
river/moat encircles Safari Village and forms the basis of the
Discovery River Ride that invariably requires 60-120 minutes of
waiting in line and 20 minutes of floating about looking at trees,
shrubs and places where interesting animals might have been spotted
had they chosen to show their snouts in public.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the worst idea to be at the park for its 7 a.m.
opening. The animals are more lively, but that's not the primary
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdom's attractions are divided among fake and real
things. The 3-D It's Tough to Be a Bug! show under the Tree of Life
and Dinoland's Countdown to Extinction, a phony-but-fun thrill ride
reminiscent of MGM/Disney's ``Star Wars'' wow-a-thon, are perfect
to the ``nth'' detail and habituated by people and polythene
figures that perform on cue. At any given time during the day,
you'll wait in line to get into them: Fifteen minutes seems like
the shortest duration, with 30 minutes common and, in the case of
It's Tough to Be a Bug!, an hour to 90 minutes by early afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But line up for the Kilimanjaro Safari or Discovery River Ride
any time after 8:30 or so, and you might as well resign yourself to
a minimum hour wait, with two hours distinctly possible. Because
these rides are supposed to feature the ``real'' animals, they are
where early arrivals rush _ only to find there often aren't that
many animals to see.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Animal Kingdom doesn't abound in furry or feathered
creatures. But its sheer size, necessary to reproduce the animals'
natural habitats, works against convenient proximity to guests.
Disney has imported 4 million native trees and shrubs from around
the globe; what corporate imagineers saw as stage props turns into
camouflage for hoofed and winged ``cast members.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, after a 90-minute wait finally ends with the
boarding of an open-air jeep, Kilimanjaro Safari turns out to be a
20-25 minute ramble through reconstructed African veldt and a
chance to see some giraffes, small elk, a zebra or two and,
perhaps, a brief glimpse of rhino or elephant anatomy. A chart on
the inside of the jeep alerts riders to look for lions, leopards
and other more exciting creatures, but their appearances are,
apparently, sporadic to the point of rumor.
</P>
<P>
   This strains the imaginations of teen-age ``safari guides,'' who
are reduced to chirping, ``Look, there are more giraffe!'' when it
is obvious the twisting tour road is simply bringing the jeep back
by the same bored-looking trio of leaf-chewers that have been
sighted previously.
</P>
<P>
   How to perk up a much-ballyhooed ride that fails to live up to
its advertised excitement? Disney falls back on artificiality. At
the end of Kilimanjaro Safari, there is a hokey ``help catch
poachers'' add-on that concludes with a teen-age ``park ranger''
pointing a plastic gun at some mannequins in a truck. Surely the
corporate imagineers can do better than this.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery River is worse. It has the longest wait times, and
once aboard an open, flat-bottomed boat, there's nothing to do for
15 minutes but listen to the guide assuring passengers the flora
and fauna they're seeing is ``just like'' the real jungle.

`THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT': REVIVING A SUNNY FRENCH
CONFECTION  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As psychedelic in its way as the Beatles' album ``Sgt. Pepper's
Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' which was released in the same year
(1967), the French musical ``The Young Girls of Rochefort'' is a
garish but charming curiosity that pushes giddy Gallic romanticism
to the brink of camp. Created by Jacques Demy with the composer
Michel Legrand (the same team that concocted ``The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg'' three years earlier), the movie is a sun-drenched,
candy-colored, singing and dancing valentine to the Hollywood
confections of Vincente Minnelli.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Deneuve and her sister Francoise Dorleac (who died
shortly after the film was completed) play beautiful, talented twin
sisters named Delphine and Solange, both waiting for true love to
sweep them into the land of happily ever after. Delphine (Ms.
Deneuve) is a dance teacher whose prince charming, a dreamy-eyed
artist and sailor named Maxence (Jacques Perrin) with dyed blond
hair, has already painted a picture of the true love he has yet to
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Solange (Dorleac), a composer of frilly pianistic kitsch, falls
in love at first sight with a touring American concert pianist
named Andy (Gene Kelly). Solange and Andy first collide in a music
shop run by Simon (Michel Piccoli), the long-lost true love of the
twins' mother, Yvonne (Danielle Darrieux), a local cafe owner who
refused to marry him because his last name was Dame. This modern
fairy tale doesn't just rain happy endings, it pours them.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in the French coastal city of Rochefort, the movie
features several sweeping dance numbers through the sunlit streets
(Kelly is too old for his role but still dances brilliantly), as
well as a lovely but much too insistent theme song that is known
today by the title ``You Must Believe in Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   With its overdubbed vocals and tinny orchestrations sometimes
augmented with wordless bubbly Swingle Singers-style vocals, the
score belongs very much to the period. But as it goes along, the
movie, which has been carefully restored, works its way under your
skin, and you root for those happily ever afters, inevitable though
they may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Young Girls of Rochefort'' is playing at Film Forum, 209
West Houston Street, South Village. Information: (212) 727-8110.
Tickets: $8.50; $4.50 for Film Forum members.

ORLANDO, Fla.: the real jungle. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hours of line-waiting are exacerbated by the sheer effort it
takes to move from one part of Animal Kingdom to another. The park
is huge _ as it should be. Maybe the animals don't cooperate, but
Disney has given them all the room they need to wander. (Last fall,
Disney received considerable bad publicity when animal-rights
adherents protested the deaths of 29 animals that were either en
route to Animal Kingdom or briefly in place in the still-unopened
park.)
</P>
<P>
   But Animal Kingdom's immensity means guests, even families with
small children and/or older visitors, have to walk long stretches
just to get from one place or another. Besides strollers for
toddlers, there's no means of transportation other than on foot.
Magic Kingdom veterans are used to turning a corner between
Fantasyland and Tomorrowland. Walking from Dinoland to Camp
Minnie-Mickey seems like an Anaheim-to-Orlando trek by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Physical exertion is compounded by the steamy Florida weather.
Most of the time, it is uncomfortably muggy at best. Factor in
1998's sizzling summer, and by midafternoon in Animal Kingdom, it
feels as though you're moving around with your entire body wrapped
in a soggy towel.
</P>
<P>
   Disney hasn't failed to notice. The company traditionally
equates ``free'' with ``sinful,'' but at various points in Animal
Kingdom there are stands giving away paper cups of ice water. Small
cups, to be sure, but still free.
</P>
<P>
   Except for installing moving sidewalks or providing trams, there
isn't much Disney can do to reduce the amount of walking Animal
Kingdom requires. But adding those amenities would badly detract
from the authentic wilderness atmosphere the company has spent
hundreds of millions to create.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sore feet, overheated brows and uncooperative animals are all
part of the Animal Kingdom experience, but only part. The park has
a lot of good things going for it; these are just easy to overlook
because of the obvious discomforts.
</P>
<P>
   Besides whiny kids and grouchy grown-ups, the Animal Kingdom
pathways teem with colorful performers. African storytellers
conjure all sorts of exotic jungle visions to those who'll stop
long enough to watch and listen. Strolling bands play unusual
instruments, producing engaging if unfamiliar tunes. Some sort of
odd-looking bird-men stride along on stilts. It's a fabulously
bizarre bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   The stage shows, especially ``Journey Into Jungle Book,'' are
first-class, from costuming to sound. These are generous both in
length and entertainment, full-blown Broadway-quality fun. The
20-30 minutes you spend enjoying them in the covered outdoor
theaters offer a welcome respite from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail's staggered dioramas offer
better chances to glimpse various animals than the overhyped
Kilimanjaro Safari. True, the gorillas and their other hairy
cohorts aren't much in evidence. But there is plenty of colorful
signage and peripheral exhibits _ charts, models and so forth _ to
make you feel the 20-30 minute stroll has been worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible there has never been any 3-D show better, or at
least more enjoyable, than It's Tough to Be a Bug! In the cool
theater under the Tree of Life, all the special effects are
dazzling. 3-D-glasses-wearing audience members guffaw, shriek and
applaud as they experience being splashed with bug acid, stung by
hornets, buzzed by bees and gassed by stink bugs. It sounds
moderately awful but is nothing but sheer fun. Yes, there are a few
interesting facts offered by a plastic ant narrator. But mostly
it's slapstick, an eight-minute serving of welcome folderol.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdom is marketed by Disney as a great opportunity for
educational adventure. Those terms needn't be incompatible. Epcot
Center has thrived precisely because kids are brought there by
parents or other adults to learn and have fun at the same time. But
even Epcot doesn't rely on real wild animals. By striving for
authenticity, Animal Kingdom falls short on convenience. This can
work at a zoo, but Disney patrons want more cooperation for their
money.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company seems to poll every second visitor to the
park, Disney is undoubtedly aware of the mixed response from most
Animal Kingdom visitors. It has some plans for immediate change _
new attractions are due to open soon in the Asia area, for
instance. There will undoubtedly be more pretend stuff like It's
Tough to Be a Bug! and Countdown to Extinction, prime entertainment
operating under rigid human control.
</P>
<P>
   But animals are going to follow their own instincts, not Disney
dictates. Walt Disney World spokeswoman Jennie Hess says attendance
so far has surpassed expectations, although Disney never reveals
specific figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call (Animal Kingdom) a new species of theme park,'' Hess
says. ``It's not a zoo. It has sheer entertainment and other
elements of Disney woven in with a whole new adventure with
animals. That's what we want to do _ let people know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney understands its challenge is to reconcile the
expectations of park visitors to the vagaries of animal behavior.
Either it will, or a few years from now comedians will probably
begin referring to Animal Kingdom as EuroDisney II.

   Animal Kingdom observes Disney park tradition by outnumbering
rides, exhibits and other attractions with ubiquitous gift shops
and restaurants. The T-shirts, backpacks, picture frames and other
insignia-festooned souvenirs are pricey but of decent quality.
</P>
<P>
   The food, sadly, also reflects Disney park history. It is
overpriced and most of it doesn't taste very good. Sandwiches at
the Flame Tree Barbecue restaurant cost almost $7, and that's
without chips. A grilled chicken salad is about six bucks, or one
dollar per shred of chicken. Drinks from vendors are at least $2.
Figure each member of your party will go through $20 just for one
meal and some snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Kingdom's hours are 7 a.m.-8 p.m. daily. Adult admission
is $42 plus tax; Disney defines ``adult'' as age 10 or older.
Children ages 3-9 get in for $34. For information, call (407)

<P>
   UNDATED - It was my husband who saw it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he said, leaning toward the TV. ``Isn't that your old
boyfriend?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question he asks me a lot, especially if he's watching
``Cops'' or ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, just because some guy on the news walks out of a
trailer without a shirt on, has a beer in his hand and is being
questioned by the police doesn't mean I've dated him,'' I shouted
from the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the guy who had the snakes,'' he yelled back.
</P>
<P>
   A thin shiver coiled up my spine. The snakes. They belonged to
my first boyfriend, a big guy with a mohawk, since this was during
the mid-80s and boyfriends with snakes and mohawks were just part
of the deal. I even pretended that I liked the snake, named (I'm
embarrassed to say this part) Sid Vicious, a 13-foot reticulated
python.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, I learned to hate Sid. I understand the food chain and
the order of nature, but actually witnessing a fat, sluggish
reptile attack an ordinary field mouse was more than I could
stomach. It very easily could be equated to the terrifying vision
of Linda Tripp ripping into a deli ham on rye.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially horrified when Mary, a small white mouse I had
named after the blind, pretty sister on ``Little House on the
Prairie,'' was in the process of being digested. She had bravely
managed to survive for nearly two weeks, hiding in a hollow knot of
the tree branch that rested in Sid's cage. I really thought she was
going to make it, she was very quick and managed to roam freely
about the cage without catching the snake's attention. I was
devastated when she was eaten, my black, liquid eyeliner running
down my cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went down in two bites,'' he said as softly as he could.
``Will you help me shave my head now?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so totally sad,'' I persisted, sobbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I told you, you gotta quit naming them, dude,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so not a dude,'' I reminded him.
</P>
<P>
   He kept nodding.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of summer, the boyfriend came home with 13 rats in
box. ``I'm gonna breed 'em,'' he insisted, and I just turned away
as he placed all of them in an aquarium in the bedroom closet. That
night I had a nightmare my mom was scratching at the window. When I
woke up, I realized it was only the sound of the closet rats
tearing up the newspaper in the aquarium, and made the boyfriend
move them to the laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I entered the kitchen just as the boyfriend
was on his fifth trip to the trash can, holding a limp rat by the
tail. ``There's no vent in here!'' he said, standing in front of
the dryer and the steamed-up aquarium. ``Six of them are dead!''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the remaining seven rats. ``Ma and Pa are gone,'' I
cried hysterically. ``So are Carrie, Almanzo and Mary II!''
</P>
<P>
   The boyfriend put the rats outside in the carport to give them
some air, but then promptly forgot about them after a meeting with
his bong. By the time he remembered, the sun had shifted and was
directly overhead, causing a magnifying-glass-and-ant scenario
within the aquarium. I couldn't bring myself to look as Laura,
Nellie and Miss Beadle met the fate of their previously expired
friends.
</P>
<P>
   My hate was sealed and delivered one night as I was walking down
the dark hall and something batted me in the head and I saw it
waving in mid-air, like the trunk of a circus elephant. I
immediately flipped the light switch, and that's when I saw the
first 6 feet of Sid, whipping around like a firehouse 4 feet off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The snake had managed to escape from the cage, had squeezed
through a tiny space in between the door jamb and a bedroom door
and was trying to free itself. The boyfriend solved the problem by
taking an ax and a crowbar to the doorjamb, trashing the dream of
getting our security deposit back.
</P>
<P>
   My aversion to reptiles of all sorts was dully confirmed several
years later when a hippie suddenly put a 4-foot iguana on my head
one night at a restaurant. My head quickly bowed under the 15-pound
weight of the lizard, but when the hippie tried to remove his scaly
pal, the iguana dug its claws into my scalp and refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes, the hippie and three of my friends each took a
leg and worked non-stop to get the lizard off, creating a slight
commotion as 30 onlookers watched, including my then-current
boyfriend (the snake boyfriend and I broke up when he got an
underage girl pregnant). Finally the animal pooped on my head and
relaxed enough to release its claws, but I couldn't move my neck
for a week, was forced to wash my hair repeatedly with liquid Tide
and my then-current boyfriend dumped me for the girlfriend of the
hippie. They ran off together for Oregon in a van.
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about that when my husband called again from the
living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurry!'' he shouted. ``This guy on TV has a snake tattoo on
his neck, too! It's got to be him!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he do?'' I asked, coming into the living room just
before the news segment ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won the Powerball,'' my husband said. ``Are you going to
leave me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm sure he's bought a triple-wide mobile home, a
hydroponics system and a big screen TV by now,'' I assured him,
``that thing on his neck wasn't a tattoo. It was moving all on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The front door to their trailer looked like someone had
attacked it with an ax,'' my husband added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet it did,'' I answered. &QL;

`HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER 2': THAT'S JUST HIS MANNER. 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)

<P>
   The minute Louisa (Carri Levinson), the young bespectacled
schoolteacher, walks in the door, you know she's too prim and
repressed not to mean trouble. By the end of the movie, she's bound
either to blossom into a ravenous sexual being or to kill somebody.
Too bad the same thing isn't as clear about Henry (Neil Giutoli).
</P>
<P>
   Audiences at ``Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer 2'' know about
Henry from the beginning because his first scene is a calm
nighttime murder of a woman in the woods. But seen later having
dinner and sleeping at a shelter for the homeless, Henry looks
harmless. He is, in fact, completely capable of being creeped out,
even putting his head under the covers when in the bed next to his,
an elderly man makes an unwelcome sexual visit to another.
</P>
<P>
   So it's understandable that Kai and Cricket, the couple Henry
meets when he takes a job delivering portable toilets, invite him
home for meatloaf and to stay a while until he can get a place of
his own. Pretty soon Kai (Rich Komenich) has also invited Henry to
join him in his work moonlighting as a hired arsonist.
</P>
<P>
   And pretty soon after that, Henry has shown Kai how emotionally
satisfying killing somebody can be after a hard day of being
treated like an insignificant slug. Early in the film, Kai asks
Henry, ``Is cleaning out toilets for $40 a day all you want out of
life?'' Little does he know.
</P>
<P>
   None of the people in this movie seem to have given a lot of
thought to their ethical standards. They're petty criminals, drug
dealers who slip LSD into other people's drinks, parents who beat
up other parents over their children's disagreements. But Cricket
(Kate Walsh) at least has limits.
</P>
<P>
   When she notices the growing bond between Henry and Louisa, her
live-in niece, Cricket tells Kai to give him his walking papers.
The film then asks the question, ``What do you do when you want the
serial killer staying at your house to leave?'' Predictably the
results include stabbing, dismemberment and blood gushing from
mouths and throats.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a sequel to John McNaughton's ``Henry: Portrait of a
Serial Killer'' (1990), which earned some positive reviews, if only
for cinematic technique. But no major players in the earlier film
have returned for this one. The writer and director (Chuck Parello)
is new, as are the producer, cinematographer, editor and cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry 2'' is a passable psychological slasher movie for fans
of the genre, but Giutoli makes Henry's coexisting woundedness and
amorality fascinating to watch. It's even believable when after one
character shoots herself in the head in front of him, he's visibly
upset.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If all New Yorkers share one experience, it's the
sensation of suddenly feeling like a tourist without leaving the
city. Take an alternate route, turn an unfamiliar corner, peek into
an open doorway, and suddenly you could be in Tokyo or Timbuktu,
with strangers chatting in an unknown language while intriguing
scents waft from a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   New York is Dakar north and Budapest east; there are contingents
from Ireland and Uzbekistan, Lebanon and Peru. And they hold on to
the places they left behind by gathering for music, theater or
movies from the old country, wherever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those events invite outsiders, like ``The Last
Empress,'' a lavish Korean music-theater spectacle currently at the
New York State Theater. Most others serve their own constituencies,
unrecognized by the city's self-described mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   They flourish from midtown Manhattan to the fringes of the other
boroughs, and they generally greet outsiders with curiosity,
indifference or mild amusement. Still, a performer never minds
seeing a new face in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The places and events below offer possibilities for cultural
globe-trotting in the city. Some are large public events, some
neighborhood haunts. And if you feel as if you've wandered off the
subway into another country, well, that's how you know you're in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Homesick Brazilians head for the center of Greenwich Village on
Monday nights, when two weekly events take place a few blocks
apart.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cafe Wha, a basement club that has persisted on Macdougal
Street through eras of hippies and yuppies, the Monday night draw
is a band that usually features the buoyant singer Vanessa
Falabella. The house band plays Brazilian pop hits from the last
three decades, featuring material by the songwriters of Brazil's
tropicalia pop revolution.
</P>
<P>
   This is some of the most casually sophisticated music (and
lyrics, for those who speak Portuguese) of the 20th century. While
various singers and instrumentalists take turns in the spotlight,
and the audience joins in on favorite refrains, the crowd divides
its attention between music and shmoozing.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd pours down the staircase, packing the room by midnight;
conversation buzzes but doesn't overwhelm the music. In true
Brazilian style, every greeting is an embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Things are more boisterous around the corner at the Elbow Room,
which used to be the Bleecker Street Theater. The club's Monday
nights feature Ogans, a band from Bahia with 11 members, 9 of them
drummers, that's modeled on a Bahian band, Timbalada. The dancing
starts as D.J. Binho warms up the crowd with recent Brazilian hits,
and it explodes when the band takes the stage at 11:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As the beats of sambas, Bahian sambareggae and the peppy new
Bahian pop called axe boom from the stage, impromptu line dancing
takes over the front of the room while couples on the sidelines
explore sinuous hip-to-hip maneuvers. To tell the Brazilians from
the Brazilophiles, see who's singing along in Portuguese and watch
the light, double-time quick-stepping of true samba dancers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belly Dancing and Kebabs
</P>
<P>
   Cedars of Lebanon in Manhattan is a restaurant most of the week,
but on Saturdays it turns into a Middle Eastern supper club, with a
fixed-price menu ($35 for eight appetizers and a kebab entree) and
a performance that brings Hollywood glitter to belly dancing.
</P>
<P>
   A good Arabic pop band starts playing around 10 p.m., working up
momentum with oud, vocals and kinetic drumming. Then the stage is
extended into the middle of the room, and out come the three belly
dancers in satin and sequins, with veils and, in one number,
glittering red canes.
</P>
<P>
   The audience watches with studied impassivity as the women shake
and shimmy, though there's an appreciative murmur when one of them
comes out to dance with a three-tiered candelabrum on her head.
After an audience member showers bills on the dancers, the
bartender steps up to the stage with a feather duster to sweep the
money into a neat pile.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Fantasies
</P>
<P>
   One of the few old New York movie theaters that hasn't been
turned into a multiplex is the Eagle Theater in Jackson Heights,
Queens, an Art Deco-style survivor with about 700 seats. And
although its marquee is blank, the theater is still active.
</P>
<P>
   It's a showcase for popular Indian films from the hyperactive
movie studios of Bombay, affectionately known as Bollywood, as well
as some films from Pakistan. The theater also occasionally presents
local Pakistani musicians performing pop, folk and light classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   Samosas, Indian dumplings, are sold at the Eagle's refreshment
stand alongside popcorn and nachos, and early arrivals head for the
back section of seats, the better to take in the large screen and
cope with the over-amplified sound.
</P>
<P>
   A typical Bollywood film is a genre-bending combination of
comedy, musical and action; the plot pauses for madcap production
numbers, as high-concept as music videos, with the actors
lip-syncing to the voices of ``playback singers'' who have become
famous in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   In the film playing now, ``Pyaar To Homa Hi Tha,'' a slapstick
comedy-romance-musical, there's one nutty sequence on a tilting
airplane that even includes a ``Macarena'' parody. The movie
doesn't have subtitles, but every so often the actors switch to
English for a line or two, and the frothy plot isn't hard to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentallly, one of India's top playback singers, Asha
Bhosle, is to perform Saturday night at Alice Tully Hall. With
12,000 songs in her catalog, she claims to be the most recorded
singer in history. Her sweet, smooth, girlish voice doesn't reveal
any wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Another side of South Asian culture in New York can be sampled
Friday night at S.O.B.'s in SoHo when D.J. Rekha and others take
over the turntables for an all-night bhangra dance party. Bhangra
combines traditional music from the Indian subcontinent with
up-to-date dance music in ever-shifting East-West hybrids. It gives
young South Asians a taste of home in a modern context.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Russian Revelry
</P>
<P>
   The nightclubs of Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, offer a perpetual,
slightly surreal Russian wedding party in settings that trumpet
their opulence. It's all there: the fancy-dressed families that
look like someone's in-law's cousins, the towering platters of food
and steady drinking, and the band that tries to please everyone
from grandma to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   Groups arrive and settle in for fixed-price banquets, working
their way through acres of smoked fish, bushels of pierogi and seas
of vodka, periodically hitting the dance floor to try to work off
the effects.
</P>
<P>
   Two leading Slavic nightclubs are the Odessa and the National.
The Odessa, a few blocks beyond the main Brighton Beach strip, has
the feeling of a ballroom on a cruise ship: medallioned ceilings,
crystal chandeliers, compass points inlaid in the dance floor and
swags everywhere. Of course, there are disco lights, too.
</P>
<P>
   The band, with a synthesizer at its core, plays schmaltzy
ballads growled in Russian, blippy quasi-disco dance music and,
every so often, a hora that has the men dancing with arms around
one another's shoulders, kicking high into the air, while the women
gingerly join them, doing the best they can in high heels.
</P>
<P>
   The National, which offers valet parking, aims for a Las
Vegas-circa-1976 look, with white gauze and artificial vines
interlacing the ceiling and multicolored lights on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Late one recent Saturday night, after two women in the band had
sung ``Happy Birthday'' _ in Spanish! _ an actual wedding party
from the private room upstairs gradually dispersed, offering the
spectacle of the bride, still in her gown and train, trying to
squeeze through the revolving doors. The Russian accordion heritage
came in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Parisian Tango
</P>
<P>
   La Belle Epoque is a restaurant with a French name and
turn-of-the-century-style French decor, complete with a
wrought-iron staircase and Parisian street signs. But on Friday
nights, it dedicates itself to the elegance, sensuality and
suppressed menace of the tango; after all, Paris has long been a
tango stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Argentines and other serious tango aficionados gather to dance
to a live band, with the traditional bandoneon (tango accordion) at
its core.
</P>
<P>
   A few novices take advantage of the early-evening tango lessons.
But once they're over, people who know their tango crowd the tiled
dance floor. Recently, a woman in a skin-tight red dress danced
with a suave man in a gray suit, welded with him hip to hip or
suddenly cocking one knee to twitch a pointed toe in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In another couple, the woman leaned on her partner, to be
dragged across the floor for a few bars of music, then shared a
deep dip like a controlled swoon.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, silver-haired men shared quiet conversations,
occasionally taking an impassive look at the dancers. Even when the
band took a break, and tango records were played, the dancing
continued. If it's not a classic tango palace _ there are no knife
fights or crimes of passion in the shadows _ the couples on the
dance floor were too intent on their steps, and their partners, to
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Jigs and Reels
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's national symbol is a harp, and more than a few of New
York's bars with Irish names present music regularly, from rowdy
rock to ardent singer-songwriters.
</P>
<P>
   A mainstay of Irish traditional music has been the Friday night
series at the Blarney Star in TriBeCa, a long, narrow basement room
where inexpensive bar food and foaming pints are served. The
acoustic-tile ceiling, though not handsome, helps the sound of each
instrument come through clearly; the beauty of Irish music is in
its details of trills and slides.
</P>
<P>
   At the Blarney Star, musicians visiting from Ireland and Celtic
traditionalists from the New York area delve into the abundant
heritage of jigs and reels, hornpipes and slow airs. When Moving
Heart, from County Clare, played the Blarney Star two weeks ago,
its members carefully explained the provenance of each tune,
sometimes noting regional variations.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, mostly a generation older than the musicians,
listened intently, and when the dance tunes revved up, feet started
to tap, decorously but firmly.
</P>
<P>
   Irish music fans will be out in force this weekend at Lincoln
Center Out of Doors, which is presenting a day of Irish music
Saturday beginning at 2 p.m. The best-known performer is Tommy
Makem, appearing both in the afternoon and at 9:20 p.m., who will
have the crowd singing along on old ballads and rebel songs.
</P>
<P>
   DJs in the Garden
</P>
<P>
   New York has subcultures of affinity as well as ethnicity. One
subculture that rarely gathers by daylight, the
fashion-art-collegiate-dance nexus, is making an exception this
summer at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, the art and performance
space in Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   A Saturday afternoon series, ``Warm Up,'' that continues through
this month, offers music by disk jockeys and occasional live
musicians. Sponsored by the designer Agnes B., ``Warm Up'' presents
some DJs who aim for dance-music propulsion, others who prefer to
generate atmosphere and noise.
</P>
<P>
   They fill the courtyard with anything from ratcheting
drum-'n'-bass dance music to untempered noise, which goes nicely
with the sound of the subways rumbling nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Thin, nonchalant, carefully accessorized people in their 20s,
with cryptic T-shirts or jokey handbags, sit at the feet of the
disk jockeys or wander in the courtyard amid towers of castoffs
built by an art group called Gelatin. (``Climb at your own risk,''
a sign says.) Kebabs and corn on the cob sizzle on a grill.
</P>
<P>
   A few wander into P.S. 1 for an exhibition of drawings and
projects by Gordon Matta-Clark, the architectural visionary who
suggested, among other things, buildings held aloft by balloons.
His ``Open House,'' a Dumpster divided into rooms, is also in the
courtyard. The coolest of the cool find their way inside a tower
made of old refrigerators; look for the door of a beige Hotpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Salsa's Midtown Citadel
</P>
<P>
   As radios and boomboxes proclaim, New York is one of salsa's
world capitals, as much a center of Latin music recording and live
performance as Miami or any point south. And the quintessential
salsa experience is to dance to a live band, driving home its
mambos or merengues with horns and percussion.
</P>
<P>
   The Copacabana, a famous name even at a different Manhattan
location, is a state-of-the-art salsa club, booking major names
from Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and, of course,
New York, and presenting them with a superb sound system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The setup is like a large disco, with hefty bouncers outside
checking ID's and dress _ jeans and sneakers are frowned upon _
before guests pass through a metal detector. The club has a huge
oblong dance floor with tables around the perimeter where big
spenders order bottles of rum or champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling is covered with disco lighting rigs; behind the
stage, a glittering backdrop generates endless golden starbursts.
</P>
<P>
   Between songs, a disk jockey mixes salsa and dance music sung in
English, but the bands stick to salsa, merengue and Latin pop. And
the dance floor is, invariably, packed, with men in jackets or
designer sportswear and women in tight dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Couples whose ages range from their 20s to their 50s share dance
after dance. Sharply dressed men approach unattached women and
guide them, with hands raised, into the graceful crowd. In case of
overflow, there's a second bar off the main room, with its own
tennis-court-size dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Opera
</P>
<P>
   There's an opera house in midtown that's not part of Lincoln
Center. It's the Taipei Theater, tucked into the McGraw-Hill
Building, and for seven years it has been offering Chinese opera,
sponsored by the Chinese Information and Culture Center, a group
connected to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The theater's regular season features Chinese opera, with its
grand costumes, stylized acting and athletic feats. But this
weekend it has a different program. The Formosa Aboriginal Song and
Dance Troupe, with members from various tribes of the island, is
presenting two rituals: the Ceremony of the Short Men,
commemorating the Saisat tribe's near-genocide of the Short Men
tribe, and songs of the Ami tribe to solemnize, among other things,
news gathering and headhunting.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican Spirit and Fire
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican reggae has long since conquered the world, leaving its
backbeat in rock and country music, spawning reggae bands from
Japan to Brazil. But its largest, most dedicated audience is still
from Jamaica, and since the 1980s reggae has re-emphasized its
origins by turning toward dancehall, with rapping in a thick
Jamaican patois that can leave non-Jamaicans uncomprehending.
</P>
<P>
   A daylong festival at the Forest Hills Tennis Stadium on Sunday
will survey some of reggae's finest current performers, notably
Buju Banton, who has moved from dancehall boasting to positive
thinking and fuses the reggae groove with all sorts of outside
styles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also includes the romantic crooner Beres Hammond, the
hip-hop-influenced toasters (rappers) Bounty Killer and Shaggy, the
long-running vocal group Steel Pulse, the South African reggae
singer Lucky Dube and, as a bonus, a handful of soca (soul-calypso)
singers from around the West Indies. Together, they should cover
the spectrum from romance to righteousness.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Korean Pageant
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Empress,'' at the New York State Theater, is musical
theater filled with national pride. It's about nothing less than
the transition for Chosun, Korea's old name, from isolation and
traditionalism to modernity, ending with a takeover by the Japanese
and a vow to rise again.
</P>
<P>
   (Korea did survive, of course.) It's like a reply to Stephen
Sondheim's ``Pacific Overtures'' and, with the cagey, determined
and ultimately doomed Empress as its heroine, an Asian version of
``Evita.''
</P>
<P>
   Hints of older Korean pop and traditional music merge with
show-tune pomp; every scene is a grandly costumed tableau, with
supertitles to help the half of the audience that doesn't speak
Korean. It merges the dignity of Asian theater with Broadway
razzle-dazzle, satisfying both Asian and American tastes.
</P>
<P>
   A Mexican Cantina
</P>
<P>
   The shortest land route across Latin America might just be
Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, which spans Mexico and
Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic. The area around 82nd
Street is lined with Hispanic stores, restaurants and clubs, geared
primarily to the people who live and work in the neighborhood. The
area is so compact that children selling roses to couples on the
town work the entire strip, end to end.
</P>
<P>
   Plaza Garibaldi could be a cantina in a small Mexican city; it
serves modestly priced food to a working-class crowd, mostly groups
of men interspersed with a few couples. But unlike most Mexican
restaurants, it has a stage that's a stucco fantasy, resembling a
cave with a view over mountains.
</P>
<P>
   There, a band plays until 4 a.m. each night, moving from
clip-clopping cumbias and the oom-pah beat of rancheras to ardent,
lovelorn boleros. Unfortunately, it has a synthesizer instead of an
accordion.
</P>
<P>
   There's a small dance floor in front of the stage, but on a
recent Friday night it stayed empty; the audience applauded the
singers but preferred to ruminate over heartbreak and hard work at
their tables.

   West Indian Carnival
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn turns into the West Indies every Labor Day when the
annual West Indian-American Carnival parades down Eastern Parkway
for a crowd of up to a million people. This month, the preparations
grow feverish. Ornate costumes are being sewn and steel-drum
orchestras are rehearsing as the latest crop of party tunes arrives
from the English-speaking Caribbean and from Brooklyn's own
recording studios.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekend before Labor Day, there are major concerts, on
the grounds of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, of steel bands, reggae
and calypso; those lineups are still being arranged. But many
performers are already in town.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at Roseland in Manhattan, the World Soca Monarch
Competition will bring together top singers from many islands,
competing for an $8,000 prize. Soca, or soul-calypso, is the
modernized, faster and, sometimes, less thoughtful version of
calypso, which has traditionally merged wry social commentary with
dance music.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Sparrow, the pioneer of modern calypso who won so
often that he is out of the competition, is on the bill, which also
includes Ronnie McIntosh, Iwer George and Denyse Plummer from
Trinidad and Tobago, along with competition winners from recent
carnivals in Barbados, Antigua, Grenada and St. Vincent.
</P>
<P>
   They will be singing about local and international politics,
about preserving island culture and about the best ways to party.
</P>
<P>
   Steel-drum, or pan, bands emerge at carnival time, carrying on a
tradition that dates back to World War II, when Trinidad was a
naval refueling port and musicians hammered leftover oil barrels
into ringing, resonant instruments. While steel bands go marching
by during the carnival parade, their practice sessions offer a
chance to hear them up close and at length in some of the world's
most jubilant music.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One session takes place on Sunday evenings at Volume II, an
outdoor setup in the middle of a Caribbean neighborhood in
Flatbush, Brooklyn. It's an asphalt lot ringed by chain-link fence
and razor wire, decorated with the plastic pennants used for
gas-station openings. Neighbors come out on stoops and sidewalks
across the street, listening to the music while skipping the
admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   At one end of the lot, a booming mobile sound system is set up,
with a disk jockey playing island hits through the afternoon and
early evening while people sip beer and occasionally give in to the
rhythm and dance.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:30 last Sunday, the Casym Steel Orchestra took over for a
half-hour medley of this year's repertory. Most of the band members
are teen-agers, with a front line of girls who bent
conspiratorially over their drums when the music decrescendoed,
then straightened up, grinning, as the melodies swelled and pealed.
The beat, tapped out on drums and cowbells and brake shoes, was
irresistible; even the band members danced as they played.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like this music?'' a gray-bearded man asked an obvious
outsider. When the answer was an enthusiastic yes, he smiled and
danced away with the rump-shaking strut Trinidadians call
``wining,'' a preview of the carnival to come. &QL;

`WHEN I WAS A GIRL': TEMPESTS OF ADOLESCENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fred Koehler is such a natural in ``When I Was a
Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout'' you forget now and then that the
play is not about him.
</P>
<P>
   As the title broadly suggests, the comedy-drama, by the Scottish
writer Sharman Macdonald, is, among other things, a bittersweet
look back at the turmoil in the life of a confused teen-age girl.
But Koehler, playing Ewan, a drifting young slacker unimpressed by
any satisfaction of life that doesn't involve the physical, draws
disproportionate attention to Ewan's plight with a canny,
effortlessly honest performance. It's endearing in spite of itself.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which made its debut in 1984 at the Bush Theater in
London, is having its American premiere in a production by the John
Montgomery Theater Company, under the direction of Patricia
Minskoff. With a cast that also includes the excellent Roberta
Maxwell as a self-involved matriarch who remains a bit of an
adolescent herself, the play gets the intelligent handling it
deserves. The intimate space in which it is being staged, on the
12th floor of an office building on West 26th Street, fairly
duplicates the cramped quarters of the Bush, a tiny innovative
theater above a pub on the outskirts of central London.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I Was a Girl'' will feel to some women like some aspect
of their own story. Ms. Macdonald fills the work with the kind of
memoir-specific characters and places that endow it with a
comforting authenticity. It's actually two distinct narratives:
one, a present-tense tale of grown-up Fiona (Robin Morse), reunited
with her mother, Morag (Ms. Maxwell) and her childhood friend Vari
(Juliet Pritner) on a tense vacation in the Scottish coastal town
where she grew up, and the other, the coming-of-age story of
Fiona's lonely, scarring upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   The two strains intertwine in the murky details of Fiona's
disastrous pregnancy at the age of 15, a condition the young girl
conspires to achieve in a misguided scheme to punish her mother and
a perverse effort to assert her independence.
</P>
<P>
   Although the events leading to Fiona's babymaking are plainly
documented onstage _ in one of the coldest and clumsiest seductions
in the annals of modern romance, Fiona all but entraps the eager if
unwitting Ewan in furtherance of her plan _ Ms. Macdonald remains
intriguingly vague as to the aftermath. These melodramatic aspects
don't interest her.
</P>
<P>
   The play, in fact, is largely about the question of control, of
one's own body and others' hearts; in a series of flashbacks to
their pre-adolescent and teen-age years, Ms. Morse and Ms. Pritner
perform childish examinations of one another, giggle over bodily
functions and drill on the particulars of sex. The scenes between
adult Fiona and Morag, both deserted by Fiona's father, extend the
mother-daughter struggle of their earlier life together; it's a
measure of the sophistication of Ms. Macdonald's script that they
ultimately wrestle to a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maxwell is never less than a pleasure to behold as the
egocentric Morag, a mother who appears alternately tender and
buffoonish, seeking her child's acceptance even as she obsesses
over her own desirability: ``Cut my head off, I'd look 19,'' she
says. But Ms. Morse, who struggles with a Scottish accent, and Ms.
Pritner, who does better with hers, never seem to be performing on
the same stage; they act at such different pitches, it's as if they
were broadcasting on separate radio frequencies. They never achieve
the joined-at-the-hip intimacy their parts demand.
</P>
<P>
   They might take some pointers from the flawless Koehler. He does
wonders with the incidental (and quite tricky) role he's been
handed. The sleep-deprived gaze, the cold-climate pallor, the
stooped shoulders: They're touches that enliven the lump Ewan is
supposed to be. In the sequel, as in real life, you'd surely be
curious to know what happens to him.
</P>

 &HT;    A light-as-gossamer Hollywood `Kiss'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss'' is a flirty little film that's
about as substantial as a vacation fling. It has a good heart and
an appealing manner, but there's no staying power.
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Sean P. Hayes) is a movie-struck photographer from the
Midwest who has recently moved to Los Angeles. But, as he points
out in his droll introduction, all anyone notices about him is that
he's gay.
</P>
<P>
   Billy is also a romantic, still looking for that special guy. He
thinks he's found him when, one day in a coffee shop, he meets a
young waiter named Gabriel (Brad Rowe, a gorgeous-boy blend of Brad
Pitt and Rob Lowe circa 1985).
</P>
<P>
   But is he or isn't he? Gay, that is. Gabriel keeps talking about
his girlfriend back in San Francisco and doesn't seem to have, as
Billy puts it, ``the show-tune gene.'' But as Billy's friend Perry
(Richard Ganoung) says, ``He talks straight, but every once in a
while, you get a vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A vibe,'' it seems, is all Billy can get as hunky Gabriel
keeps himself tantalizingly available without ever committing to a
real relationship or admitting his true sexual orientation. Things
come to a head when Gabriel is hired for a swimsuit shoot on
Catalina Island by a famous _ and flaming _ fashion photographer
(Paul Bartel) and Billy can't keep himself from checking up on his
new friend.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Tommy O'Haver calls his movie ``a trifle,'' the
way Spike Lee calls his films ``a joint.'' True enough. ``Billy's''
is a flyweight at best. More problematical, it's all too familiar.
We've seen Billy before in too many gay romantic comedies: the
lovelorn nice guy who's more cute than drop-dead good-looking and
who inevitably falls for some seemingly unattainable hunk.
</P>
<P>
   The title comes from Billy's proposed photo series in which gay
men re-create famous clinches from the movies. For instance,
Gabriel and former Andy Warhol stalwart Holly Woodlawn imitate Burt
Lancaster and Deborah Kerr on the beach in ``From Here to
Eternity.'' There're also several movie-themed fantasy sequences
featuring an overacting trio of lip-syncing drag queens.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is all very ``like me! like me!'' And pastel-themed.
And unthreatening. And instantly disposable. ``Billy's Hollywood
Screen Kiss''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean P. Hayes. Directed by Tommy O'Haver. Rated R for
language, sex and drug references. At Phipps. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Harmless, mildly enjoyable and instantly
disposable.

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The director Frank Darabont had an experience common
to many filmgoers this summer when he was watching Steven
Spielberg's wrenching World War II drama, ``Saving Private Ryan.''
He found himself mesmerized by the character of Jackson, the
Bible-quoting sniper with an angular face and an ambiguous
humanism.
</P>
<P>
   Darabont was so impressed that he quickly offered the actor who
plays Jackson, the little-known Barry Pepper, a part in ``The Green
Mile,'' a new film he wrote and is directing about a group of
guards on Death Row in 1935 and their unusual prisoner. Darabont,
whose last film, ``The Shawshank Redemption,'' won several Oscar
nominations, had Pepper read for the role of the guard Percy, who
is a misfit and a loner. But he found that the role did not fit the
actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an innate sweetness and a real soulful light in his
eyes,'' Darabont said of Pepper, who is 28. ``It wasn't working.
But he was a perfect Dean, who's maybe the most sensitive of the
guards. Barry can play anything, but it's much harder to be an
interesting good guy than an interesting bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors can quickly become hot after a compelling performance,
but usually not this quickly. Pepper has been acting just a few
years, and he has suddenly won a prominent part alongside, for the
second time, Tom Hanks, who plays the head guard in ``The Green
Mile,'' which is based on a novel by Stephen King. The film is
being shot on the Warner Brothers lot here and is expected to be
released next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to meet Frank originally on Percy because I knew
if he offered it to me I'd have to take it, and I feared being
typecast as a sort of evil character,'' Pepper said. ``It was a
difficult choice, but I decided to leave my ego at the door and do
what I always do, which is bring a little of my dad to my
character. I was so totally flattered that they saw some
sensitivity and asked me to do Dean.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepper credits his unusual upbringing and his father's
adventurousness for giving him the inner strength that comes
through in Jackson and got him the part as Dean. He grew up in
Canada, eating largely wild game, like moose, venison and duck.
When he was 5, his father built a 50-foot sailboat and packed up
the family; they sailed for five years throughout the South
Pacific. Pepper was educated partly by his parents and partly at
schools where they stopped, in places like Rarotonga and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper and his family eventually moved to the west coast of
Canada, where his parents built a farm. He found his calling in
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to play the victim,'' he said. ``I look for the
choices the character makes for himself. Even if you play a
villain, you do an injustice to him if he's just, like, programmed
to do those things. It's always more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Death and Life &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brest saw ``Death Takes a Holiday,'' the 1934 film, some
20 years ago and felt he always wanted to make a movie about how an
encounter with death, fully personified, might tell you something
about life. It took a little longer than he expected, and he has
kept busy directing movies, including ``Scent of a Woman,''
``Midnight Run'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' but now Brest has
finally shaped his figure of that profound force, and it looks a
lot like Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Brest's loose interpretation of ``Death Takes a Holiday,''
called ``Meet Joe Black,'' is really a sort of cinematic essay that
might be called ``The Education of Death.'' The living and the dead
learn a few things about love and life in this film, which takes an
unusual approach to the subject at a time when most movies are
absorbed by gritty realism, not metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' which is being released by Universal on Nov.
13, pits the powerful head of a media empire, William Parrish,
played by Anthony Hopkins, against the mysterious Joe Black, played
by Pitt. The issue for Parrish is coming to terms with the end of
his life, while the issue for Joe is coming to terms with Parrish's
daughter, Susan, played by Claire Forlani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, I saw the original movie and thought about
doing something,'' Brest said. ``Fifteen years ago, I wanted to
remake it. Ten years ago, I began in earnest to work on a script.
But I ultimately decided I didn't want to do a remake, just to deal
with the same core subject matter.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``I didn't want to do this fish-out-of-water story
about death because that can tend toward the sophomoric. The
problem was when you think about making death real, you're faced
with a lot of heavy-handed choices. It took us a long time to get
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Brest said his movie also went against the grain of many films
these days by using no special effects, in spite of the
supernatural subject matter. The story, he said, relied solely on
Pitt's wide-eyed exploration of his character and Hopkins' slow
coming to terms with what he is up against. ``It's very
minimalistic,'' Brest said. ``It's all about the interaction of the
characters. Anthony created a sort of universal father figure. We
wanted to go for a certain elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   Brest said the real trick was to focus on the notion that death
cannot be described as what comes after life, as a portal to an
afterlife, but as the sum of a life, with the rest unknown. That
straightforwardness was ultimately how Joe Black was defined. ``I
don't believe in an angel of death,'' Brest said. ``Brad solved the
problem and played him as a sort of blank slate. That seemed like
death.''

   If you want to get a good idea of the sort of humor that makes
``Permanent Midnight'' a dark comedy, as the producers describe it,
the opening credits are a great place to begin. In a cheerful
script, the title is slowly written out on a white background, as
though it were blood being squirted from a junkie's syringe.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Hollywood of the television writer Jerry Stahl,
the protagonist, played by Ben Stiller, of this unsentimental
rendezvous with self-destruction, and welcome to a world of
filmmaking that tries to elevate the viewer's consciousness by
following a junkie on his descent into the darkest recesses of
heroin addiction, and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent Midnight,'' which will be released by Artisan
Entertainment on Sept. 18, is based on the autobiography of Stahl.
It is not an easy film to watch, even with the presence of
Elizabeth Hurley and Maria Bello. But then David Veloz, the writer
and director, did not intend it to be just a thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could have conveyed some of the bleakness of Jerry's
addiction to heroin without being so graphic _ in one desperate
scene, Jerry is shown shoving a needle directly into his neck,
while his baby cries in the car beside him _ Veloz insisted that
averting the camera's gaze might have romanticized this terrible
habit and made the story a mere hallucination rather than a living
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earlier versions were much more brutal and in your face,''
said Veloz, 36, one of the writers of ``Natural Born Killers.''
``We don't show him doing some of the other, much worse stuff that
he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, the movie has something in common with two
other grimly realistic movies out this summer, ``Saving Private
Ryan'' and Neil LaBute's independent film ``Your Friends and
Neighbors,'' also starring Stiller. These films all offer moral
credos whose power comes not from images of how such principles can
shape a better life, but of how horrific life can be when the world
slips its moral bearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broader the audience you try to reach,'' Veloz said, ``the
more diluted and homogenized the message.'' Still, he added, the
movie, which presents a jaundiced view of Hollywood, does offer a
sort of redemption, since Jerry kicks his habit. He becomes a
cliche on talk shows, but, Veloz said, ``he comes out a whole
man.''

`THE SILVER CASTLE': FUNNY BUT SOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clive James' last novel, ``The Man From Japan,'' was amusing,
energetic and oddly affecting. His new novel, ``The Silver
Castle,'' is amusing, energetic and oddly condescending. It aspires
to be a kind of ``Candide'' set in contemporary India. It reads
more like a comic book, penned with a self-satisfied sneer.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``The Silver Castle'' not only takes its cue from
hundreds of earlier bildungsromans, but also specifically recalls
``The Man From Japan'' and James' own 1981 autobiography,
``Unreliable Memoirs.'' Once again we are introduced to a poor
young man equipped only with some pluck and good luck. And once
again we are meant to follow this young man as he meets a curious
assortment of strangers who will introduce him to an exotic new
world and lead him into a series of improbable, picaresque
adventures.
</P>
<P>
   When we first meet James' hero, Sanjay, he's a penniless
pavement dweller living in the mean streets of Bombay. He has a
cruel, drunken father; a sad, prematurely aged mother; innumerable
brothers and sisters, and an improvised home made of rags, bags and
dirt. To Sanjay, a taste of Thums Up, a kind of local cola, is an
amazing treat; a blanket, an almost unimaginable luxury.
</P>
<P>
   As a young boy, Sanjay has caught a glimpse of ``the Silver
Castle,'' a Bombay movie studio that cranks out dozens of
melodramas and action films, and that glimpse of a magical land of
make-believe will fuel his secret dreams. He becomes an ardent
reader of movie magazines and hones his own acting skills by
practicing his charm (his ``soulful look'') in front of a mirror.
It's not long before Sanjay has left home to become a beggar and
petty thief in downtown Bombay, and begun a series of liaisons with
wealthy men and beautiful women that will eventually bring him back
to the Silver Castle as an extra and bit player.
</P>
<P>
   James sketches in the rigors of Sanjay's life on the streets
with a smattering of telling details. The reader quickly learns
about the pecking order among the beggars and gangs of Bombay, and
the tricks employed by scam artists intent on ripping off gullible
tourists _ like refilling empty mineral water bottles with tap
water and passing them off as new.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy Indians and tourists in search of poverty chic are
agilely skewered as well. ``He reminds me of what my life was like
before,'' says one movie star of Sanjay. ``Simple. The life of the
senses.'' Another new friend, visiting Sanjay's home in the slums,
exclaims: ``This place does wonders for my nostalgie de la boue.''
</P>
<P>
   James also displays his customary narrative panache in
extracting humor from Sanjay's bumbling efforts to get ahead by
parroting movie dialogue and magazine captions to everyone he
meets. ``Your sexiness triggers procreation in the world,'' Sanjay
tells a girl he likes, adding, ``Life without you is like a
cactus.''
</P>
<P>
   So much of the humor in ``Silver Castle'' comes at the expense
of Sanjay, however, that the reader begins to suspect that James
has some sort of grudge against his hero. He is constantly mocking
Sanjay's difficulties with English (a trick used more effectively
in ``The Man From Japan''), and his snooty narrator _ who is fond
of using the royal ``we'' _ has an annoying habit of interrupting
the story with blase, been-there-done-that asides that treat Sanjay
as an ignorant buffoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sense of value is not one that young men, be they ever so
precocious, can be expected to possess,'' the narrator observes of
one of Sanjay's earliest romances. ``Even if deprived, they haven't
lost enough. It takes time to build regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   As the novel progresses and Sanjay's fortunes rise _ by the time
he's gotten a few character parts as a tough guy, he is also
romancing two of the Indian cinema's leading ladies _ the narrator
grows increasingly impatient, as though Sanjay were getting above
himself: wanting too much, dreaming too fast, appreciating too
little. ``The unusual integrity of her personality remained a
mystery to him,'' the narrator says of one of Sanjay's girlfriends,
``because his own personality had no integrity of its own. It was
fragmented, and so could never focus its appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel's brutal shock ending not only attests to James'
determination to punish his hero for his hubris in wanting a better
life, but also provides his narrator with an opportunity to
moralize about the meaning of Sanjay's life and the lives of others
like him ``stuck there at the fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us, James argues, are obliged to accept the fact that
``the things we know do not form a complete picture,'' that they
are just bits of a jigsaw puzzle picture of ``a lost ship, called
Western Civilization; of a radiant long cloister called the Grace
of God; or of a glittering, variegated procession called the Ascent
of Man.'' We can see the edges of the picture ``even though there
are whole patches of sky, sea and earth missing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the young Sanjay, even at his brightest, could see no
edges,'' James continues. ``For him there was no picture. The
pieces of the puzzle were never together on the table in front of
him. They were never in the same room, or even in the same house.
They were scattered through time and space, never to be joined even
potentially. In view of that cruel fact, he did well, and his
story, though sad, should give us cause for hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks suggest that James has as patronizing an attitude
toward his hero as the oh-so-smug rich people he means to satirize
in this funny but very sour book.

`BABE RUTH': BASEBALL'S ENDURING ENIGMA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty-three years after his major-league career ended, 50 years
after his death, Babe Ruth remains a contemporary baseball
presence. He is invoked daily this summer. His Yankees are once
again trampling everything in their path. Fans and politicians
jabber about the future of the ball park that was built on his
exploits. And as several sluggers bang out home runs at a
prodigious pace, they endure constant comparisons with Ruth, who,
whatever the record book says, remains the heart's champion.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a fitting moment to revisit the man still widely revered
as the best ballplayer of them all. HBO does just that on Sunday
night, with an hourlong documentary, ``Babe Ruth.''
</P>
<P>
   The familiar story lopes along _ from the Baltimore bad boy to
the Sultan of Swat to the fallen hero lying in state at Yankee
Stadium _ told through the expected blend of archival film and
talking heads. If you care about Ruth, you've been here.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the story is just too familiar. Here's the Babe with the
Red Sox, a successful pitcher beginning in 1914 who is moved to the
outfield because he is an even better hitter. He is sold to the
Yankees in 1919. (Why did Boston give up this miracle player? We're
not told.) He makes history. He makes friends, although he can't be
bothered learning anybody's name and calls nearly everyone ``kid,''
which he pronounces ``keed.'' He makes money, although he spends it
as fast: on food, drink, women and other things he enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to wade into an adoring crowd, especially when a camera
is handy. Here are scenes of Babe with children, with a dog, with a
cow. But hardly anyone, it seems, thought to film him playing
baseball. There are a couple of often-seen shots of his swing and
his home run trot, with the doff of the cap as he rounds third.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, Yankee Stadium opens to accommodate the throngs he
attracts. He hits home runs in numbers never dreamed of, reaching
60 in 1927. In the third game of the 1932 World Series he seems to
point to the stands then hits a homer. Was his gesture a fearless
promise, quickly kept? No one knows.
</P>
<P>
   His skills eventually decline with age. In 1935, the Yankees
have no more use for him. He's heartbroken, and plays one last
season with the Boston Braves. By then, the only thing he knows how
to do is be Babe Ruth, so he works as a glad-hander. In his last
years, less interesting but more copiously filmed, he is honored
finally by the Yankees. Prematurely old in his 50s, a man who
started playing big-league ball before the jerseys bore numbers, he
watches as his No. 3 is ceremonially retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe Ruth is the only guy that lived up to his reputation,''
says Tommy Henrich, a Yankee of a later era. But who can provide
deeper insight? Not the other aging men who sit before the camera
here. Even redoubtable wordsmiths like Heywood Hale Broun, Studs
Terkel and Pete Hamill are reduced to platitudes. ``To me, the Babe
is still alive,'' says the veteran sports broadcaster Bill Mazur.
Yes, but why?
</P>
<P>
   What was it about this vulgar childlike barrel of a man that
connected physically with a baseball and emotionally with the guy
in the top row of the bleachers? Maybe the question will never be
answered. Maybe that's why people still care.

 &HT;    FROM BEIRUT TO MOSCOW TO MEXICO, U.S. EMBASSIES REVIEWING
SECURITY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In Beirut, where bombers struck twice in the 1980s,
all U.S. embassy staff live on an isolated 14-acre compound
surrounded by walls and roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Jerusalem, the U.S. consulate compound sits close to a
crowded downtown road where Israeli security guards try to keep
traffic moving and inspect the bottoms of parked cars with mirrors
attached to long handles.
</P>
<P>
   Staff at both sites, one representing the new fortress-like U.S.
missions and the other displaying the problematic urban
circumstances of the older ones, are reviewing their so-called
``security posture'' after the bombings at embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, the mood at many American embassies around the
world appears to be one of forced calm, as most try to take a
``business-as-normal'' approach to their jobs while dealing with
``a heightened state of alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy told reporters at a
briefing this week that security was being beefed up at embassies
worldwide, while several are temporarily shutdown following serious
threats that had been received from Kuala Lumpur to Cairo to
Mbanane.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance cameras, security staffing and physical barriers
are among a host of things being studied. ``We're talking about
procedures; we're talking about people; we're talking about
physical changes, technical upgrades. There's a full panoply,''
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   About $400 million is allotted for embassy security and
maintenance each year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, following the bombing of the U.S. Marine compound in
Lebanon a task force set up to study security at U.S. embassies
abroad recommended $3.5 billion in improvements -- of which
Congress has appropriated less than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Since the report, 27 new buildings have been constructed to meet
these standards, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign service workers are used to being careful. In many
places, they must ride in bulky armor-plated Chevrolet Suburbans or
face restrictions about areas of their towns that are off limits.
The U.S. Department of State receives about 30,000 threats a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreign service is also a close worldwide community.
Those killed or injured in Kenya served other places with diplomats
in Tel Aviv and elsewhere. Also, embassies tend to resemble each
other in form -- the walls, the guard houses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that the U.S. embassy in Amman, Jordan is a
new, fortress-like compound, isolated and surrounded by two walls,
embassy press officer Stephen Thibeault said, ``We see the TV
coverage . . . It's easy to imagine that could be us instead of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt, a country with one of the largest U.S. missions and
also a possible source for the Africa bombers, embassy staff
working in dispersed sites have been consolidated in the main
compound.
</P>
<P>
   A taped message at the U.S. embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
asks for ``increased vigilance on the part of all Americans'' and
tells them keep a low profile, vary the times and routes they
travel, and watch out for suspicious mail.
</P>
<P>
   In Swaziland, where the U.S. embassy in this land-locked African
monarchy received the second telephone bomb threat in three days
Thursday afternoon security concerns have been heightened since
bomb blasts.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official called the 2:20 p.m. call a
``crank,'' however, and said it was considered a copycat of one
received Tuesday morning when the embassy was evacuated. After
Tuesday's telephoned bomb threat, the embassy was ordered to close
a little after 4 p.m. by the State Department for precautionary
reasons. It operated as usual Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy occupies the top two floors of a bank building on a
busy downtown street.
</P>
<P>
   Mbabane police responded to the afternoon threat and for the
second time this week had bomb-sniffing dogs comb the building for
possible bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Khisimusi Ndolvu, regional commander of the Mbabane police
force, said that security at the embassy property has been
increased to 24-hour guard since last week's blasts. ``Security is
up to its highest levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, security outside the sprawling U.S. embassy compound
was noticeably tighter Thursday, with an increased presence of
Russian police.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy compound covers a city block and fronts the 12-lane
Garden Ring road, one of the busiest thoroughfares in Moscow. This
week, Russian police cars blocked the curbside lane closest to the
embassy and more security personnel appeared on the sidewalk in
front of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its proximity to the busy road, which encircles the
center of the city, the embassy is ranked by the State Department
among the most vulnerable U.S. missions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   A new embassy is under construction on a site adjacent to the
current embassy and will be built with modern security features --
including buildings set back from the street and reinforced walls,
doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombings in Africa, the embassy issued a warning to
its employees, urging them to be aware of security concerns and
report anything suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been reminded of the risks, and since we're all in
the foreign service we know them pretty well. But I'd say the
bombings (in Africa) have definitely had their affect on people and
made us all more alert,'' said an embassy employee who asked not to
be named.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials would not comment on additional security steps
that have been taken this week, however.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would they in Mexico City, where the U.S. has one of its
largest embassies. ``If we tell you, we tell the bad guys,'' one
source said.
</P>
<P>
   But sources there did say there is a feeling that the building,
which houses busy visa application offices and various diplomatic
missions, is generally safe -- although it is not set very far back
from Reforma Avenue, one of Mexico City's main thoroughfares.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in London said
business was ``normal'' in the aftermath of the attacks in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the London spokesman, speaking on the condition that his
name would not be used, refused to comment about whether any
additional security measures had been implemented since the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course everybody has been apprehensive here, but we know
that these things happen,'' he said. ``We've been through this many
times. But we know we're being taken care of as well as can be.''

HOME VIDEO: GRIT, TOIL AND TROUBLE; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Videos arrive from all points on the compass, which always makes
for interesting contrasts. This month, for example, a generally
humdrum assortment of mainline movies gets a nice spin from two
different kinds of films that themselves come from very different
places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother's Kiss,'' recently released by BMG, is an example of a
smaller movie project that went out and made as much of itself as
it possibly could, attracting some big-name talent like Marisa
Tomei, Rosie Perez and Cathy Moriarty on a relatively modest
budget.
</P>
<P>
   A collaboration between actor Nick Chinlund and director Seth
Zvi Rosenfeld, it tells the story of two brothers reared in New
York's East Harlem, the younger of whom, Mick (Michael Raynor),
survives after a fashion as a police officer and the older, Lex (
Chinlund), succumbs to drugs and other destructive tendencies
despite his brother's loyal attempts to save him.
</P>
<P>
   The movie unfolds ``as a series of finely observed scenes of
Lex's deterioration,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times
when ``Brother's Kiss'' opened last year. Chinlund, who is in his
mid-30s, spent part of his childhood in East Harlem as the son of
an Episcopal priest who ran drug rehabilitation programs. He
commissioned Rosenfeld, who also had spent time there, to write a
one-act play based on what they had seen of life in the area. Later
it was turned into a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shot the film in my neighborhood,'' Chinlund said. ``My
mother's house was the home office.'' He and Rosenfeld also mined
their contacts. ``Seth knew John Leguizamo and we both knew
Marisa,'' Chinlund said. ``We met Rosie at the Sundance directors'
lab.''
</P>
<P>
   Leguizamo plays a drug dealer, and Ms. Tomei is a drug-torn
young woman who takes up with Lex. Ms. Perez portrays Lex's wife
and the mother of his child. ``But Cathy Moriarty was first,''
Chinlund said. Ms. Moriarty plays the brothers' alcoholic mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother's Kiss'' had good reviews and a decent theater run.
``It's about a man who can't ask for help but has to do everything
for himself,'' Chinlund said. ``That's a common thing these days,
and it's not talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritty personal films often work on video, but from another
quarter entirely this month comes the kind of film that has always
worked spectacularly. Thirteen years after its theatrical release,
Disney is issuing the 1985 animated feature ``The Black Cauldron''
for the first time on videocassette.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what took so long? To grow new crops of young
viewers, the studio regularly shuttles its big animated films in
and out of video. But ``The Black Cauldron,'' which earned bad
reviews when it opened and was one of the least successful of the
studio's major animated titles, has been withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's not so surprising. ``Oh, you're so, so, so
boring,'' a princess tells Taran, a would-be knight who strives to
keep the magic cauldron from the evil horned king. That might have
been one problem, and there were others, ranging from a darker mood
to a failed early attempt to integrate ``Star Wars''-type special
effects into animated films.
</P>
<P>
   Disney doesn't elaborate on the delay. ``We wanted to fit it
into the schedule at an appropriate time,'' a studio spokeswoman
said this week.

 &HT;    'BLACK THURSDAY' IN MOSCOW AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO NOSEDIVE
 &HT;    EDs: With optional add.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Panic again swept through Russia's rickety financial
markets Thursday forcing a temporary freeze in trading of stocks
and foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   The continued sell-off by investors prompted the nation's
Central Bank to take urgent steps to protect the ruble in a day of
market turmoil that the state-owned ORT television called ``Black
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russian stocks and bonds in a weeklong freefall, some
analysts questioned whether the government, struggling to prevent
bankruptcy, would be able to restore confidence in its fledgling
markets and avert a devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's main stock index dropped more than 10 percent in the
first hour of trading. After a 45-minute halt, trading resumed and
the exchange ended the day down 6.5 percent to its lowest level
since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, ``It
is critical that the Russian government act quickly to restore
confidence in their economy, and that is something we have
communicated with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has a big stake in seeing that
Russia gets their economy moving in the right direction,'' he told
a briefing, adding that Treasury undersecretary David Lipton, had
flown to Moscow this week to meet with Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko, and officials from the finance ministry and the central
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing frustration in government attempts to stem the
bleeding, Kiriyenko told reporters Thursday: ``Unfortunately what's
happening on the markets belongs in the realm of psychology. There
are at present no financial grounds for a deterioration in the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko conferred by telephone with President Boris Yeltsin,
who is on a fishing vacation in Russia's north. He also met with
opposition leader Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov agreed to proceed with an emergency parliamentary
session next week to consider austerity measures sought by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``An absolutely urgent situation has arisen,'' Zyuganov said.
``If there is devaluation of the ruble and a collapse of banks, the
impoverishment of the people will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the market slide means little to most Russians.
Financial trading is almost exclusively a bazaar for the very rich
and for risk-taking foreign investors. It has not been felt among
consumers, as prices remain stable and the ruble has edged up only
slightly, trading at nearly 6.3 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But the erosion of investor confidence has complicated the
cash-strapped government's predicament as it seeks simultaneously
to pay state workers, bolster the currency and make its scheduled
repayments on foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
   A $22.6 billion loan package arranged by the International
Monetary Fund this summer was designed to give the government
several months to seek economic reforms, improve tax collections
and avert a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But it has failed to calm the tumultuous markets, whose decline
has made a bad situation worse for Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank has been forced to fortify the ruble by dipping
into its hard currency reserves, which it said fell by $1.4 billion
last week to $17. billion. It also placed new rules on commercial
banks which restricts currency trading, designed to protect the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia has about $20 billion in debt payments due to
foreign banks due this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation has been worsening because of the prospect of
what some officials call 'default,' or official admission of
bankruptcy by the government,'' said Andrei Illarionov of the
Economic Analysis Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that under the current pressure the
government must revalue its currency to attract more dollars and
other strong currencies to its weakening markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The meltdown in Russian financial markets has reached the
terminal phase,'' George Soros, a closely watched international
financier who has heavily invested in Russia, wrote Thursday to
Britain's Financial Times newspaper. He urged a ruble devaluation
accompanied by Western aid for Russia to stabilize the currency.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts differ over just what affect a devaluation would
have. While it could brighten the government's financial outlook,
it also send shock waves through the economy, producing
hyper-inflation and social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``A devaluation of the ruble 'would have severely negative
consequences' for the economy,'' the international credit-rating
service Moody's said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poors downgraded their investment
rankings for Russia, reflecting the eroded confidence in the
financial markets.

<P>
   Kundun
</P>
<P>
   Martin Scorsese's account of the early life of the 14th Dali
Lama is essentially two films. The first unfolds as a dazzling
union of Tibetan settings and religious imagery joined by the
synergy between Roger Deakins' glorious cinematography and Philip
Glass' ethereal electronic score. The second film is a somewhat
less satisfying chronicle of the Dali Lama's youth until 1959, when
he was forced to flee Tibet ahead of Chinese invaders. Characters
remain at an emotional arm's length, especially the young leader,
named Tenzin Gyatso when he is discovered at age 2{. A bright and
mischievous child, played at various ages by four Tibetan actors
(including Tulka Jamyang Kinga Tenzin, above), he never fully
emerges from behind tutors and protectors. ``To call `Kundun' the
most religiously stunning storybook ever filmed,'' Stephen Holden
wrote in The New York Times, ``is not to say it's a great movie.''

   The Borrowers
</P>
<P>
   Around the Lenders' household, the disappearance of small items
like gloves and Monopoly cards signals another foray by the
Borrowers, a family of tiny people who live under the floorboards
and emerge to explore and help themselves to the materials they
need for, say, scaling the side of a refrigerator. But Borrowers
and Lenders have a mutual problem in the person of Ocious P.
Potter, a comically odious lawyer (played to the hilt by John
Goodman) who wants both families evicted but gets a comeuppance
straight from ``Gulliver's Travels'' in a film that ``enjoys the
sheer ingenuity of its little heroes'' (Janet Maslin).

   Moving on from the likes of ``Slacker'' and ``Dazed and

about three brothers (Matthew McConaughey, Skeet Ulrich and Ethan
Hawke) who, while not being particularly daring, dangerous or
demented about it, just sort of fell into robbing banks because it
was fun to do and seemed like a smart business move. That leads to
a gentler genre piece than one might have expected from Linklater,
who ``seems simply to want to tell a story that looks like a junior
`Sting.''' (Maslin). 1998. Fox. $104.16. 122 minutes. Closed

the teen-aged Marcy (Robin Tunney) acts explosively and
unpredictably, swilling bourbon and gulping any pills she can get
her hands on. Her meek companion, Seth (Henry Thomas), can only
blame extreme parental abuse for his own problems in a story that
belongs to Ms. Tunney, whose performance ``is a tour de force so
uncompromising that your sympathy for the character periodically
gives way to a sickening sense of disgust'' (Holden). &QL;

 &HT;    'BLACK THURSDAY' IN MOSCOW AS MARKETS CONTINUE TO NOSEDIVE

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Panic again swept through Russia's rickety financial
markets Thursday forcing a temporary freeze in trading of stocks
and foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   The continued sell-off by investors prompted the nation's
Central Bank to take urgent steps to protect the ruble in a day of
market turmoil that the state-owned ORT television called ``Black
Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   With Russian stocks and bonds in a weeklong freefall, some
analysts questioned whether the government, struggling to prevent
bankruptcy, would be able to restore confidence in its fledgling
markets and avert a devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's main stock index dropped more than 10 percent in the
first hour of trading. After a 45-minute halt, trading resumed and
the exchange ended the day down 6.5 percent to its lowest level
since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, White House spokesman Michael McCurry said, ``It
is critical that the Russian government act quickly to restore
confidence in their economy, and that is something we have
communicated with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community has a big stake in seeing that

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Paris is a kick on the road
eastward
 &HT;    (Eds: First in a series of reports from Europe.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Just in time for my arrival, 1 million cheering
Frenchmen, women too, had turned the Champs Elysees into a sea of
Gaullic humanity, garlic too.
</P>
<P>
   For me?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the French had finally won something _ the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the cheer: ``Today the World Cup _ Tomorrow the World
Saucer!''
</P>
<P>
   Loses something in translation, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   There hadn't been such a turnout in Paris since the last time
the Germans paraded.
</P>
<P>
   (My favorite French-American joke: New Orleans has such a French
influence that recently when the mayor learned that a delegation of
some dozen German government officials were arriving, he
immediately drove to the airport and surrendered the city.)
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup, lest we forget, is soccer _ what the French call,
zee keek ball.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why more Americans don't follow the game of soccer.
It's not that complicated:
</P>
<P>
   You kick the ball, you chase the ball, a riot breaks out and
1,200 fans are hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   That's oversimplification, but you get the general idea.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it's the low-scoring aspect of soccer that turns
Americans off, what with the game's 24-minute shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, on this particular day, it seemed that all the world
were soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   I've been on Times Square at New Year's Eve. I'd been in the
Baghdad airport when the last plane out of Iraq was boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Never seen such a crowd before.
</P>
<P>
   Young people were hanging from street lamps and traffic lights.
Heaven knows where the old folks were. Most likely trampled into
the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   It was like being caught up in a violent ocean. Suddenly you'd
find yourself being swept one way and then another.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a big guy in every direction, up and down and from side to
side. It was all I could do to stay on my feet, much less stay in
any one spot.
</P>
<P>
   Most everybody had their faces painted in an Indian style of war
paint that featured the French tri-colors, same as their flag: red,
white and blue stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Very symbolic for the French: Red is for red wine, white is for
white wine, blue is for Blue Nun.
</P>
<P>
   I was a short ways down the street from Arc de Triomphe, that
above-ground underpass Paris is so proud of. Thank goodness my
hotel was only half a block off the Champs Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   Nice location, nice hotel. Maybe you've heard of it, the Leonard
Earl.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, you wouldn't have, not by that name. The sign
outside says LE WARWICK.
</P>
<P>
   But some American friends and I never could figure out what the
LE stands for. We figured Leonard Earl is as good a guess as any.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, I usually stay in small hotels on the Left Bank. But
this trip I was on my way to Moscow, with a brief stopover in
Paris. I was treating myself. I already knew how I'd be treated in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The itinerary called for a couple of days in Moscow with
friends, then on to St. Petersburg, where the bones of the last
czar were being interred, and from there I'd be heading on to
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania before finally ending up in Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Eat, drink and be a soccer fan. For tomorrow I'll be in Russia.

   SPACE _ DAYTON, Ohio _ This week's flight test of a miniature
future space shuttle underscored the shifting emphasis in research
at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from aircraft to space vehicles.
The nearly full-size model was tested in New Mexico, but
Wright-Pat's recently reorganized Air Vehicles Directorate is a
partner in the effort. Structures, materials and electronics work
that used to focus on airplanes is supporting the research, which
could pave the way for an unmanned military space plane able to
maneuver in and out of the atmosphere, change orbits, and fly
itself back to its home base. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News). 8-10.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some relief from the recent heat will arrive in the Pacific
Northwest on Friday as a cold front approaches the coast. Highs
across western Washington will be nearly 10 degrees cooler than
Thursday. However, hot air will remain over the interior Northwest
and California, where ample sunshine will again boost readings to
near record levels. While a lonely shower may form over some of the
higher mountain peaks, it will remain dry in the valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Muggy air will cover much of eastern Texas and the Deep South.
Clusters of showers and thunderstorms with downpours will erupt
near and south of a stalled front that extends from the western
Gulf coast to the Carolina coast. Isolated storms will also
percolate Friday afternoon in the sultry air embracing Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of humid air flowing north through the Appalachians
will cause an increase in clouds along with scattered showers and
thunderstorms. Moist Atlantic air will cause clouds to expand from
the Middle Atlantic states to southern New England as strong high
pressure erodes to the east. Temperatures will average a bit below
seasonal levels.
</P>
<P>
   An eastward moving cold front will trigger a broken band of
strong thunderstorms from the western Great Lakes to the eastern
Plains on Friday. Noticeably cooler air will arrive in the wake of
the front. Elsewhere, the monsoon circulation will continue to
support scattered mountain thunderstorms in the central and
southern Rockies. Farther east, sinking air currents will promote
ample sunshine in the southern Plains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Summer Spate
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, 3.62 inches of rain deluged Burlington, Vt., breaking
the city's all-time 24-hour rainfall record for August. So far this
summer, 22.64 inches of rain have fallen, which is just shy of the
all-time summer mark set in 1892. With a persistent jet stream over
Canada, northern New England has been in the beaten path of
traveling disturbances. These jet stream disturbances have sparked
numerous thunderstorms which have affected Burlington. The summer
spate of rain has boosted the city's 1998 rainfall to 38.84 inches,
the greatest recorded total for the January through August period.

 Mindy Aloff is the dance critic for The New Republic.  
 By MINDY ALOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One finds worlds within worlds in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a
fabled watering hole for high hats and hot tipsters over the better
part of the last two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   There are the ancient mineral springs, the Revolutionary War
sites, the New York City Ballet and the National Museum of Dance,
the hushed forests and cricket-echoing parks, and the signposts of
a civic history involving blinkered cads, visionary patrons and
some of America's most prominent family dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   There is so much to learn and do that, for much of the year, it
might be observed that Saratoga's quadripeds of distinction are its
tourists, creeping toward their beds at the end of another
exhausting day of sightseeing, rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   From the last week of July through the first week of September,
however, the Saratoga story narrows down to a phrase: horse racing.
For major stakes races, 50,000 people a day attend the Saratoga
Race Course. Some are infants in arms, and even the youngsters are
occasionally tapped to handicap winners.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent brief Saratoga sojourn, I traveled back to New
York on the train in the company of a couple of racing enthusiasts,
one of whom told of overhearing a young mother at the track,
wondering in the presence of her toddler which mounts she should
bet on.
</P>
<P>
   ``One! Seven!'' the child cried out spontaneously. What was he
thinking? No one knew, but his mother, who had no other source of
advice, put down a few dollars on No. 1 to win and No. 7 to place.
Both horses were long shots individually, and the odds of the
exacta were astronomical. Nevertheless, she won $950: No. 1 won and
No. 7 placed.
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga offers three ways to study horses in tense competition.
You can watch them ``run as fast as they can run'' _ as one racing
fan put it _ in the stately grandeur of the racecourse, whose
origins go back to the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   You can watch them trot as fast as they can in the harness races
at the Saratoga Equine Sports Center, built in 1941. And you can
watch them do nearly everything a horse might be asked to do during
a cavalry charge _ trot, canter, gallop, make hairpin turns, rear
out of the way of disaster _ in the context of professional polo,
played in lush fields.
</P>
<P>
   I had never witnessed any of these spectacles live before; at
Saratoga, I experienced them all.
</P>
<P>
   Polo turned out to be the biggest surprise _ from my frame of
reference, virtuosic Lindyhopping raised to a martial power. At
dusk one evening, I bought a ticket to an exhibition game of
world-class players at Lodge Field, near the harness raceway, and
took a seat on bleachers next to a grassy hill.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered nearby were perhaps 75 spectators, mostly couples and
families. (More were seated across the field, under a festive
tent.) Some people had set up lounge chairs and spread out full
picnics over the grass, complete with wine goblets, as if they were
in their backyards watching a croquet game.
</P>
<P>
   Although the mallets and the hard ball of polo suggest elements
of croquet, as well as of golf, the sport itself is fast and
furious; when the ball flies in action it can be lethally hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse racing was polo's midwife and landlord, as it still is
to some extent at Saratoga,'' the historian Edward Hotaling wrote
in his comprehensive and deliciously readable 1995 saga, ``They're
Off! Horse Racing at Saratoga'' (Syracuse University Press).
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been an expensive, therefore elite, sport but is
no less dangerous for that, involving rare skills _ fast stops,
quick turns, powerful hitting _ and rough, often dirty tactics,''
Hotaling continued. ``Mere playboys couldn't play, nor could many
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this game between teams called the Cotswolds and the
Wildcats cost $5, not much more than the cover charge for a day at
the racecourse. Given the battlefield conditions of polo, however _
with 1,200-pound animals corkscrewing on a dime to avoid slamming
into one another, while mallets rain down about their heads and
riders belt out curdling screams _ it's amazing that any creature,
equine or human, could be persuaded to tolerate the situation for a
minute, much less the seven and a half minutes of a period, or
chukker. (There are six chukkers in a polo game, and players ride
different ``ponies'' _ actually, thoroughbred horses _ for each
period.)
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I got very close to polo indeed, as the ball
crashed over the low field barrier and smashed into a picnic basket
with a resounding crack. I found this somewhat alarming, yet the
basket's owner simply shrugged and threw the ball back into play.
Polo people are tough.
</P>
<P>
   They're also public spirited. When the game concluded, the
announcer requested the audience's help to replace the hundreds of
divots that the mallets had torn from the turf, and the audience
got right up and complied. It was kind of fun matching divot to
dirt patch, like working a jigsaw puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was this a crowd entirely made up of polo connoisseurs. I
asked the ticket taker what the rules of the game were, and she
answered: ``I have no idea. I just love to watch the horses.''
Whatever the rules, the score was Cotswolds 16, Wildcats 6.
</P>
<P>
   From Lodge Field, I walked across a parking lot to the Chariots
restaurant to watch the harness races at the Equine Sports Center.
Chariots, which overlooks the raceway's grandstand, serves its
patrons dinner as they follow the races through a picture window
or, in close-up, on television right at the table.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although other diners seemed to enjoy this arrangement quite a
lot, I found that I wasn't happy until I moved outside near the
track fence, where I could focus on the exquisite high-stepping
gait of the trotters absent an intervening barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Harness racing, with the drivers isolated in their sulkies from
the horses on a track that curves upward slightly at the sides, is
nowhere near as dramatic as the galloping unions of jockeys and
mounts on a flat course.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trotting racer, placing its hooves with pinpoint
precision in strict 4/4 time under the pressure of the clock, has
the dainty look of someone practicing the English quickstep, and
for a dance fan their races can be mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was at the raceway that I spotted the only live
ballet dancers I saw in Saratoga: two adolescent girls standing by
the fence, practicing fifth-position sous-sous in clunky sports
shoes _ their waist-length ponytails bobbing above their
filly-slender legs _ while they cheered out moral support to their
favored steeds.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet dancers and schooled horses have a long technical as well
as a poetic connection, going back to the academic step-vocabulary
and ornate floor patterns shared by court dancers and mounted
knights in the horse carrousels of Renaissance Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, an
illuminating video about equine anatomy extends the metaphor by
pointing out that a horse actually runs on the tips of its toes,
``like a ballerina,'' as the bones of its feet proper are located
above the hooves, which are the equivalent of toenails.
</P>
<P>
   I forgot to bet at the harness raceway, but on one of my three
visits to the Saratoga Race Course I walked up to a window and put
down $2 on each of two horses in sequential races.
</P>
<P>
   One of my picks, Star of Broadway, sort of buffed her hooves in
the stretch; in that race she was more Lamplight of Broadway. The
other horse, the Groom Is Red, also lost handily; in that race,
however, I almost achieved something. The bet was for a friend; in
making it, I deliberated between the two names I thought she might
like, the other being Cat Thief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I decided that since my friend was allergic to cats,
she wouldn't bet on a feline name. Cat Thief came in a brisk first.
</P>
<P>
   I'm an expert at almost winning. On a previous day, I had
intended to put down $2 on Financial Lady in the third, a horse
recommended by John Prizzi, a commentator and writer on racing, to
a crowd of about 100 during one of the free daily public
handicapping sessions offered at a nearby restaurant, Siro's.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Financial Lady won the race, though, that I
remembered I had wanted to bet on her, thereby teaching me an
important track rule: you can't win if you don't play.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the truth, I was so overwhelmed by the formal beauty and
intricate culture of the racecourse that it's a wonder I remembered
to bet at all. I wanted to learn everything about everything. I
took one of the hourly public tours of the far-stretch barn area
and another, guided walking tour of the course grounds.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, I arrived at 7:30 to eat a hearty buffet breakfast
in a restaurant near the grandstand, where I could also watch the
horses being exercised and listen to an analyst-historian's
commentary of racing's past and present.
</P>
<P>
   I even attended the races. There are nine daily races (except
Tuesdays) at the course, starting at 1 p.m. Each race takes about
two minutes, and the attendant procedures and ceremonies _ the
exhibition of the horses in the paddock, the reviewing parade
before the crowd, the weighing-in of the jockeys, the approach of
the contenders to the starting gate _ take about three-quarters of
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The moment I began to wait for was the instant when the pack
rounds the turn into the stretch, where the whole scale of the
picture up-ends and the race is theatrically transformed from an
ensemble of distant miniatures into a collection of individual
dynamos.
</P>
<P>
   The major dramas, of course, frequently take place at the finish
line, but not the major magic. If it's magic you seek in racing,
you win every time.
</P>
<P>
   It's the magic of racing, even more than the winning, that may
help to account for the presence of enthusiasts who have made their
way to the racecourse each August for six or seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   I met two such people: Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt II and his
friend Jane duPont Lunger. Over a lifetime of experience as
onlookers and participants in various aspects of racing, they have
formed ideas about what makes a winning race horse tick and what
helps a fan endure over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a good trainer, a horse with good bloodlines and a
lot of luck,'' Mrs. Lunger said, speaking as the owner of the
Christiana Stables in Maryland, whose distinguished mares and
fillies over 61 years have included the greathearted Go for Wand.
``And you've got to be optimistic. That's what keeps me going. Even
when you have a bad day, you've got to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt, the former chairman of the New York Racing
Association, attended his first horse race around the age of 12,
when he was taken to the track by his grandfather, and apart from a
few years when he was in the service during World War II, he has
followed racing avidly ever since, becoming an authority on the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many leading race horses he has owned was the
legendary Native Dancer _ inspiration for, among other things, a
Balanchine ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In making predictions, Vanderbilt wants to know this information
about a horse, in order: the names of the trainer, the jockey, the
owner, the sire and the dam. Cues to a horse's bloodlines may be
embedded in the name itself, he explained.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the ``n'' and the ``l'' of the horse named Handel
are clues to the parentage: Hansel and Secretarial Queen (by
Secretariat).
</P>
<P>
   I asked Vanderbilt what, about racing, had provoked his
immediate devotion as a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the races as a whole,'' he said, ``not the betting, not
the horses separately, but the whole thing: the people, the crowds,
the jockeys, the colors. I loved it. I just thought, wow! And I
still do.'' &QL;

ART WORLD NEWS AND NOTES

 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stores and theaters were hardly alone in suffering
from the collapse of an elevator support tower last month at the
Conde Nast building under construction at Broadway between 42nd and
43rd Streets. The International Center of Photography Midtown at
43rd Street and Avenue of the Americas was also forced to close the
day of the accident, and could not reopen until Tuesday, a full
three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Hartshorn, the director of the center, is now worried
that people will think the museum is still closed. Although the
entrance is clear, and photographs and signs about exhibitions
appear in the windows, scaffolding remains around part of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quandary is how to let people know we're open again,''
Hartshorn said, adding, ``We're losing money daily.''
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks the institution was paying salaries to staff
members who were not allowed to come to work, while going without
revenue from its $5-a-person admission fee or from bookstore sales.
The center lost about $20,000 in revenue, Hartshorn estimated, and
will lose more if people continue to think the center is closed.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is exhibiting ``Matthew Brady's Portraits: Images as
History, Photography as Art'' and ``A Bronx Family Album: The
Impact of AIDS'' by Steve Hart.'' The Brady show closes on Sept. 6
and the Hart show on Nov. 15. Hartshorn said neither would be
extended.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doubted that the center would recover its financial
losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can line up with everybody else in the area who suffered,
but I'd say getting anything back is unlikely,'' he said. ``And if
we do, it will take years.''
</P>
<P>
   Starry, Starry Tote Bag
</P>
<P>
   The National Gallery of Art in Washington is bracing for what it
predicts will be some of the biggest crowds in its history when
``Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces from the Van Gogh Museum,
Amsterdam'' opens on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The show, featuring the largest collection of van Gogh's
paintings to be seen in the United States in some 25 years, will
include 70 works lent by the Van Gogh Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The Amsterdam museum is lending the paintings because, beginning
on Sept. 1, it will be closed for eight months for renovations and
the addition of a wing.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings to be exhibited include ``The Potato Eaters'' (1885),
``The Bedroom'' (1888), ``Wheat Field with Crows'' (1890),
``Fishing Boats on the Beach at Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer'' (1888)
and ``Self-Portrait with Felt Hat'' (1887-88). These iconic images
will also appear on the widest range of merchandise ever offered at
the National Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   While the museum has generally been conservative in its
commercial offerings, for this show it will sell everything from
watches and vases to mouse pads and computer screen savers, in
addition to the standard selection of posters, postcards,
calendars, tote bags and wrapping paper. For the first time there
will be a special van Gogh shop in a gallery across the hall from
the show in the West Building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been produced under the auspices of the Van
Gogh Museum,'' said Keith Webb, head of business activities. ``They
have decided to go all out and create a line of products in
anticipation of their reopening. Normally we create our own
products; this is the first time someone else has done the hard
work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the show, which closes on Jan. 3, will not be easy:
Though admission is free, daily passes will be required. Beginning
on Aug. 30, advance passes will be available on Sundays from 11
a.m. to 6 p.m. and Mondays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
at the East Building pass desk at Fourth Street and Constitution
Avenue N.W.
</P>
<P>
   Advance passes will also be available beginning Aug. 30 through
Ticketmaster, with a $2.75 service charge for each pass and a $1.25
handling fee for each order. There is a limit of six passes per
order.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer to try their luck, the gallery will also
hand out a limited number of same-day passes every day the show is
open. These may be obtained on a first come, first served basis,
and the same limit of six passes a person applies. Those may be
picked up at the West Building pass desk, in the rotunda on the
main floor.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion at Stanford
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford University Museum of Art in Stanford, Calif.,
recently received $10 million from the late philanthropist B.
Gerald Cantor and his wife, Iris, for its $37 million expansion and
renovation, and will be renamed the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor
Center for Visual Arts at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   The Cantors have also given the university more than 180 works
by Rodin over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which has been closed since it was damaged in the
1989 earthquake, is being enlarged with a 42,000 square-foot-wing,
an enhanced Rodin sculpture garden and new outdoor sculpture-garden
areas. The wing, designed by James Stewart Polshek &AMP; Partners of
Manhattan, will house galleries for the museum's special
exhibitions and the modern and contemporary art collection, as well
as an auditorium, cafe and bookshop. The building is scheduled to
open in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan to become more active in the community and less
contained within the university,'' said Thomas Seligman, the
museum's director. ``This is a university museum but also a
regional museum, and now we will be able to offer education to
people in the Stanford area as well as to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's permanent collection includes about 20,000 objects
from ancient through contemporary. The emphasis is on contemporary
work, Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recent gifts to the museum are a Richard Diebenkorn
painting, ``Ocean Park No. 4,'' from Phyllis Diebenkorn, the
artist's widow, and a Claes Oldenburg sculpture, ``Soft Inverted
Q,'' which was given to the museum by Robin Quinn Gates, a
collector in the Bay area.

`COLLECTED STORIES': OF LOVE AND LITERARY BETRAYAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review. 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Some things you don't touch.''
</P>
<P>
   The simple sentence seems to bruise the air in the new
production of Donald Margulies' ``Collected Stories'' that opened
Thursday night at the Lucille Lortel Theater. The words aren't a
warning. It's too late for warnings by this time.
</P>
<P>
   The voice that shapes the declaration is raw and ravaged, as
deep and forbidding as an underground cave. The face of the
speaker, who has just told the story of a relationship with someone
long dead, is aghast, open and utterly unprotected looking. A
violation of something sacred, at least in one woman's mind, has
already occurred, and the aftermath is as unsettling as the sight
of a bleeding wound.
</P>
<P>
   The face and voice belong to Uta Hagen, and their status as
precision instruments, used for sounding subterranean depths of
character, has been confirmed time and again over the last six
decades. Ms. Hagen, one of the major American theatrical talents of
this century and a celebrated teacher of acting, is the woman who
won her first Tony Award for her 1950 performance in Clifford
Odets' ``Country Girl,'' who played Desdemona to Paul Robeson's
Othello and who created the role of the earthy, ego-shredding
Martha in ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet watching her in Margulies' two-character play about a
venerable fiction writer and her too-eager disciple, you don't
experience that self-conscious feeling that often arises in the
presence of living legends. Ms. Hagen refuses to coast on the aura
of her own history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at 79, she invests her role with the concentrated focus
and energy of a rising young star in a make-or-break performance.
There is some question, as there was when she spectacularly
returned to the New York stage several years ago in Nicholas
Wright's ``Mrs. Klein,'' as to whether this play, a lesser effort
from the author of such fine, probing works as ``Sight Unseen'' and
``The Model Apartment,'' is worthy of the love and attention she
has lavished on it. The effect sometimes suggests a 150-watt bulb
screwed incongruously into a small reading lamp. Still, one happily
takes Ms. Hagen wherever one finds her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collected Stories,'' first seen only a year ago in New York in
a Manhattan Theater Club production starring Maria Tucci, is a love
story of sorts, a chronicle of a relationship that reaches that
level of intensity at which its participants are all too capable of
injuring each other, perhaps irreparably. At least that's the play
that Ms. Hagen and her co-star, the talented Lorca Simons, are
performing under the direction of William Carden.
</P>
<P>
   On the page, ``Collected Stories'' seems far more facile and
formulaic, traits also evident in the director Lisa Peterson's
elegant interpretation of it for the Manhattan Theater Club,
despite the best efforts of a miscast Ms. Tucci. The work was
inspired, Margulies has said, by the debate surrounding David
Leavitt's 1993 novel ``While England Sleeps,'' which was obviously
patterned after the autobiographical writings of Stephen Spender,
the English poet. Spender sued, and the novel was revised by
Leavitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collected Stories,'' accordingly, could easily have taken the
title of Brian Clark's earlier (and unrelated) play, ``Whose Life
Is It, Anyway?'' Margulies' comic drama is set in the Greenwich
Village home of Ruth (Ms. Hagen), a fiction writer whose slender
but acclaimed output, as described here, brings to mind the stories
of Grace Paley. Ruth has established a ritualized, self-contained
existence in the well-worn, book-cluttered apartment (the generic
set is by Ray Recht) where she has lived for 30-some years.
</P>
<P>
   The balance of that life is disrupted when Ruth takes on Lisa
(Ms. Simons), her gifted and ungainly student in a creative writing
class at Columbia University, as her assistant. Lisa brings an
overwhelming devotion, curiosity and willingness to learn to the
job. During the six years over which the play occurs, Lisa elicits
the total confidence of her mentor and even gets the older woman to
venture into what had always been forbidden ground for Ruth: the
story of her sad love affair as a young woman with the
self-destructive poet Delmore Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   You can probably imagine to what professional use Lisa puts this
slice of personal history. There are, in fact, very few surprises
in ``Collected Stories,'' which emerges as a cross between ``All
About Eve,'' with its portrait of a star betrayed by her protegee,
and the high-culture soap opera of the ballet movie ``The Turning
Point.''
</P>
<P>
   Margulies carefully sets up the elements for the final, highly
wrought showdown between the two women. Throughout the play, Ruth
unwittingly sows the seeds for arguments that can and will be used
against her, from her declaration that writers must be
``scavengers'' of other people's lives to her casually asking, in a
conversation about Woody Allen's love affairs, ``Why is gossip so
delectable, anyway?'' It is also to the playwright's credit that he
doesn't overweight the work's central debate in one direction or
another.
</P>
<P>
   There is also, however, a gratingly naive quality in the way
these women talk about their work and the literary milieu they
inhabit, as though Margulies were taking a busload of tourists
through a theme park called Writer's World. There are callow
references to ``the muse'' and thuddingly dropped names that range
from E.L. Doctorow to the New York Times senior book critic Michiko
Kakutani.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   When Ruth, describing audience reactions to readings by writers,
comments on ``the self-indulgent laughter of people who want you to
know that they get everything,'' you realize that you have heard
just that sound throughout the performance of ``Collected
Stories.'' The one sustained example we are given of Lisa's
``mature'' writing is appallingly cliched, but then so is its
thinly disguised source, a memory monologue delivered by Ruth. You
have difficulty believing that either woman could ever have gotten
published.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the intensity and conviction of the performances
here burn right through the clunkier dialogue, which includes the
confrontational zinger, ``This isn't about you and me, and you know
it!'' Ms. Hagen and Ms. Simons sustain a rich subtextual dialogue,
between a woman in search of a daughter and a girl longing for a
spiritual parent, that is obviously the product of long,
investigative rehearsal, and it is impossible not to be moved by
it.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that, on some level, these actresses don't
serve Margulies' text as effectively as their predecessors, Ms.
Tucci and Debra Messing, did at the Manhattan Theater Club. Ms.
Simons never quite grows into the womanly confidence that Ms.
Messing chillingly conveyed at the play's end. And whereas Ms.
Tucci portrayed Ruth as dauntingly gruff and closed-off at the
work's beginning, Ms. Hagen brings a maternal warmth and
self-parodying wryness to the earliest scenes that make Lisa's fear
of her teacher seem way out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the emotional current between the performers takes
on a sweeping, electric life of its own. You find yourself paying
less attention to the dialogue than to the finely graded code of
gestures and vocal inflections with which these women chart the
rise and fall of a friendship. The sensation is not unlike what
happens when you listen to an opera in which the voices capture
ineffable shades of feeling that go way beyond the libretto.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you may be hard pressed after the play ends to remember
anything specific that Ms. Hagen's character has said. But you
won't forget the blend of pride and vulnerability that infuses her
every moment onstage.
</P>
<P>
   You'll remember the way she holds her head back to keep the
tears from rolling off her face; the quick, astonished inhalation
of breath that immediately turns into a self-protecting frostiness;
the exaggerated, supplicatory grandeur with which Ruth pours a
glass of wine for the young woman whose feelings she has just
inadvertently wounded, and, above all, the elegiac poetry, equal
parts defeatedness and hope, that Ms. Hagen brings to the basic act
of bolting and unbolting a door in the play's final scene.

ANIMATION MEETS CHARM IN WHIRLIGIGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn; Mass., Pa., Tenn., Nev.)   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Sunday, Skinner Inc. of Boston auctioned off an
Uncle Sam whirligig, or wind toy, for $12,650 at its sale of
American Furniture and Decorative Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In fine condition, the 72-inch-tall carved wood and sheet-metal
sculpture depicts Uncle Sam sawing a log resting on a sawbuck.
Standing beneath a flagpole, Stars and Stripes flapping away, this
Uncle Sam is quite the dandy.
</P>
<P>
   He has long, wavy blond hair and wears bold red-and-white
striped pants, a long blue tail coat and a white top hat with a
star-studded blue hatband. He braces his foot on a log meticulously
painted to show individual rings of growth. The log moves back and
forth as the wind hits an elaborate mechanism underneath, a
carousel of wind paddles.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on its complex design, Stephen Fletcher, the head of
Skinner's Americana department, said, ``It must have been made by
an engineer-savant.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike much early American folk art, this charming Uncle Sam is
dated and has a provenance. It was carved in 1900 by a bicycle
repairman from Wilmington, Mass., who was called Henry Wilson
Sargent but was always known as ``Henny Penny'' because he charged
a penny a minute for his repair work.
</P>
<P>
   Whirligigs, three-dimensional, wind-driven articulated toys,
have been created by artists, self-taught and otherwise, for more
than 200 years in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995 Viking Studio book ``Folk Art in American Life,'' by
Jacqueline Atkins and Robert Bishop (the late director of the
Museum of American Folk Art in New York), the authors try to
distinguish the weather vane from the whirligig. They write:
``These small, animated statues or structures were created strictly
for amusement, for, unlike weather vanes, they do no more than
signal that the wind is blowing or not blowing. They also allow a
great deal of scope for creative expression.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors write that no 18th-century examples seemed to have
survived, but that whirligigs were ubiquitous by the 19th century.
They quote a reference to one in Washington Irving's ``Legend of
Sleepy Hollow,'' from 1819: ``Thus, while the busy dame bustled
about the house, or plied her spinning wheel at one end of the
piazza, honest Balt did sit smoking his evening pipe at the other,
watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed
with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on
the pinnacle of the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few outstanding collections of whirligigs in museums
in this country, notably the Smithsonian, the Abby Aldrich
Rockefeller Collection at Colonial Williamsburg, and the Shelburne
Museum, in Shelburne, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The Shelburne boasts a whirligig trade sign: A woman seated at a
spinning wheel moves her foot up and down on the treadle as the
wind turns the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Bishop became close friends with the New Yorkers
Dorothea and Leo Rabkin, and they recently donated their
1,200-piece folk art collection, including several whirligigs, to
the Museum of American Folk Art. Rabkin, an abstract artist, has a
special take on the sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the innocence in the execution of the figures,''
he said. ``The men whittled as the women sewed quilts. They were
farmers. They didn't have TV or radio, so they carved.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring antique whirligigs today is far more difficult than it
was 40 years ago, when the Rabkins started. A few usually turn up
at the Americana sales in October at the auction houses, and
Christie's will have some examples in a single-owner folk art sale
in January, but folk art dealers rarely have many for sale.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Steve Miller American Folk Art Gallery, at 17
East 96th Street in Manhattan, has only one 19th-century whirligig,
a standing figure in a stovepipe hat. Miller said it was probably
what is known as a ``Sunday toy'' from Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pennsylvania Dutch were very religious, and thought it was
sinful for children to play with toys on the Lord's day,'' he
explained. ``The parents would mount the whirligigs on the lawn, so
the children could look outside and see them move in the wind. This
one is well carved, and good ones are scarce.'' The price is
$12,500.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aarne Anton, the owner of American Primitive, a gallery at 594
Broadway, in SoHo near Houston Street, also has only one
19th-century whirligig at the moment, a carved wood policeman with
a tiny star on his chest. His arms spin in the wind. He costs
$7,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wonderful is the animation achieved by the whirligig as
it spins,'' said Anton, who pointed out that whirligigs often have
a message. ``Sometimes they pay tribute, and sometimes they are
poking fun at the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Anton has 20th-century whirligigs, including one made with
abstract geometric forms and another with Barbie dolls. ``A lot of
whirligigs had propellers and complex movements,'' he said.
``Unfortunately, they were often the ones that would self-destruct
in a heavy wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Whirligigs appeal to contemporary artists, who tend to label
them kinetic sculpture. The Noyes Museum of Art in Oceanville,
N.J., outside Atlantic City, is currently showing 26 contemporary
examples in ``Blowin' in the Wind: A Juried Exhibition of
Whirligigs,'' through Aug. 30. The curator, Stacy Smith, said,
``It's fun, it's accessible artistically, and the sculptures are
clever.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara and Ted Alfred of Sevierville, Tenn., have some pieces
in the show, including ``Golfing on the Moon,'' in which an
astronaut hits a golf ball in front of a space ship. Alfred
recalled that he and his wife began to make whirligigs after his
retirement in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara accepted the responsibility of doing the sanding and
the art work,'' he said. ``It was up to me to do the wood work,
carving and the mechanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said whirligigs are often made by husband and wife
teams; one usually makes the sculpture and the other, the
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our First Ambassador to France,'' made by Janice Fenimore, an
artist from Madison, N.J., has Benjamin Franklin dancing a minuet
with a voluptuous French woman, peering over his spectacles at her
breasts, which are barely contained by her decollete gown.
</P>
<P>
   As their arms move, the two get closer together and his nose
nearly touches her cleavage. Another of her works, ``T.J. At
Home,'' is a model of Monticello, complete with columns. When the
propellers move, the dome is raised and Thomas Jefferson pops out
like a jack-in-the-box.
</P>
<P>
   Now whirligigs are going avant-garde. From Aug. 31 to Sept. 7,
more than 10,000 people are expected to congregate at the annual
Burning Man Festival in the Black Rock Desert in northern Nevada.
(It is called Burning Man because each year a five-story wood
figure is erected, then consumed in a bonfire on the final night of
the fair.)
</P>
<P>
   A free-form Woodstock-style festival focusing on art rather than
music, it attracts people who arrive with tents and sleeping bags
for a week of self-expression. This year, among other programs,
participants plan to construct a whirligig village called
Gigsville. (Tickets: $100 a person. Information: (415) TO-FLAME or
on the Internet at http://www.burningman.com)
</P>
<P>
   The Burning Man Festival expects a lot of interesting
whirligigs, but not too many Uncle Sams.

FORMOSA ABORIGINAL SONG AND DANCE TROUPE: SPINS AND CLAPPING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The culture and history of the nine aboriginal tribes
of Formosa, believed to be the original inhabitants of the island
of Taiwan, were fast disappearing when a group of young aborigines
decided to preserve them. In 1991, the group began to collect,
study and reconstruct the dances and songs of their elders. And so
the Formosa Aboriginal Song and Dance Troupe was born.
</P>
<P>
   The company returned to the Lincoln Center Out of Doors festival
on Wednesday afternoon, after a five-year absence, for an hourlong
performance on the Fountain Plaza stage. The program built toward a
rousing climax. But in general the material remained more ritual
than entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   How to bridge the gap and turn ceremony into theater without
betraying the quality and aims of the original? The Formosans
haven't solved that difficult problem yet. But the attention and
care brought to the work by the young performers and their tribal
instructors was evident and nearly carried the day.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the program was devoted the Little People's
ceremony of the Saisiat tribe. To untutored ears, the songs were
long, very even wails of chanted sounds. The gradual ranking and
circling of the singers' stately processionals was interesting, as
was the integration of spins and lilting pelvic thrusts into much
slower, simpler travel. The performers' red-and-white embroidered
shifts were handsome. And there was magic to the way the group
disappeared at the end. But there was little suggestion of emotion
or narrative, despite specific harvest and nationalistic themes.
</P>
<P>
   The song and dance that followed, abstracted from the Amis
tribe's celebration of New Year as practiced over several days by
Kiwit villagers, was comparatively, and enjoyably, raucous. Wearing
caps crowned with a few tall waving feathers, the men began by
bursting onto the stage and into the audience. Back on the stage,
they built quickly to a climax of driving bodies, ranked with
vividly costumed women who entered later, their upper torsos
dipping and straightening and their feet in fast, sometimes complex
sideways travel that ended in exciting shifting patterns and
rhythmic clapping. Yells peppered the air.
</P>
<P>
   The Formosans will perform again through Sunday, in somewhat
different programs, at the Taipei Theater, McGraw-Hill Building,
1221 Avenue of the Americas.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: THE HAYDN QUARTETS, PLAY BY PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 68 string quartets of Haydn present a classic
instance of great music more heard about than heard. For
generations, many commentators, historians and knowing musicians
have cited these works as among the greatest achievements in all of
music. My colleague Bernard Holland recently wrote that Haydn was
the supreme master of the string quartet, greater even than Mozart,
Beethoven and Bartok, and this assessment is shared by many.
</P>
<P>
   Then why are these works so neglected? Even young musicians who
should know better have taken them for granted. Just ask the
pianist Peter Serkin.
</P>
<P>
   Serkin comes from seven generations of musicians, including his
father, Rudolf Serkin. Naturally, growing up in a family with such
a reverence for the masters, and being a typical baby boomer,
Serkin felt compelled to rebel. Musically, the rebellion took the
form of an intense and very natural curiosity about contemporary
music.
</P>
<P>
   But when Serkin's father observed his young son immersing
himself in all the works of Webern and Stravinsky, and the string
quartets of Schoenberg, he got ``terribly upset,'' Peter Serkin
recalled once in an interview. His father admonished him, saying,
``But you don't even know the string quartets of Haydn!''
</P>
<P>
   While Serkin rejected this kind of linear musical thinking (the
idea that one must study Bach in order to move on to Beethoven,
Brahms and so on), he realized his father was right. He didn't know
the Haydn string quartets. So he got the scores and recordings,
started listening, was enthralled and has remained so ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, audiences should be grateful to the Mostly Mozart
festival for the current special series of 6 p.m. concerts at Alice
Tully Hall, which began July 29 and will present all 68 Haydn
string quartets over this summer season and next. The programs last
no more than an hour without intermission. There is open seating.
To date there have been 12 programs by five different ensembles
including the Takacs, Emperor, Vellinger, St. Lawrence and Amernet
String Quartets. Friday night and Saturday at 6 p.m., the Colorado
String Quartet will conclude this summer's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   It is a rare opportunity, and the two programs I attended
Tuesday and Wednesday by the Amernet were immensely satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   There were other composers' string quartets before Haydn's great
ones, but they were, mostly, part of a tradition of household
music, and played for private enjoyment. Whether the house was the
modest residence of a Viennese merchant or the palace of a prince
did not essentially change the function of the music.
</P>
<P>
   But Haydn composed almost all his string quartets for private
performances by exceptional musicians, including himself, usually
on second violin, in the employ of Prince Esterhazy, a wealthy
Hungarian nobleman who was a passionate music lover and amateur
string player. Still, Haydn did not want to sacrifice the fun of
playing chamber works. So there is a jocular, genial surface
quality to the music that is often mistaken by listeners today, and
even some performers, as being all there is.
</P>
<P>
   But to engage the players, Haydn filled his quartets with
invention, surprises, unexpected harmonic turns, skittish rhythmic
patterns and unabashed stretches of virtuosic passage work.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, however, Haydn was writing for his own
intellectual stimulation, and what engaged him most was the
technique of thematic development, whereby the first-stated ideas
of a piece (a melodic motive of just a few notes, or a rhythmic
figure) are germinal elements that generate every subsequent bit of
the composition. So a four-movement, 20-minute string quartet
emerges as a rigorous, interrelated and organic whole, as
substantive as any symphony.
</P>
<P>
   This is the aspect of Haydn's string quartet writing that his
good friend Mozart and his former student Beethoven marveled over.
Each of them dedicated six quartets to the acknowledged master.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem for audiences today is that when a Haydn quartet
is played at all, it is usually offered as merely a pleasant
curtain raiser for the real works to follow: quartets by Beethoven,
Brahms, Shostakovich and such. This is why the format of the
festival is so beneficial. Just two, or sometimes three quartets
are played as an entire program, so it is impossible not to listen
with fresh focus. Yet the early evening hour, the informality and
the brevity rescue these programs from pedagogical trappings.
</P>
<P>
   The Amernet concerts provided the special pleasure of
experiencing these works with gifted, eager young performers who
are, no doubt, still in the process of getting to know them. The
players, brought together at Juilliard in 1991 by their chamber
music teacher, Joseph Fuchs, are a wonderfully diverse group: Kyoko
Kashiwagi, an intensely focused violinist from Tokyo; Marcia
Littley de Arias, a violinist from Greenville, N.C.; Alabama-born
Anne Marie Hudson, a violist, and Javier Arias-Flores, a boyish
cellist from Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The Amernet, currently in residence at the Cincinnati
Conservatory, is already an accomplished and intelligent ensemble.
Their fine performances were most notable for the quality of
unjaded discovery that came through so vividly. Indeed, during the
Quartet in F (Op. 17, No. 2), Arias-Flores smiled nearly
continuously, as if he could still not get over how inventive the
wonderful cello part was.
</P>
<P>
   In two programs they played two quartets from Opus 17, which
were written in 1771 when Haydn was pushing 40, and two quartets
from Opus 64, written almost 10 years later. The music is
astonishing. The minuet of the Quartet in E from Opus 17 could not
seem more breezy on the surface, but just try to keep track of the
phrase structure in this long theme. Haydn disguises the internal
asymmetries with fairly regular four-bar units. The Adagio of the
Quartet in B Minor from Opus 64 is a radiant theme with three
extraordinary yet subtle variations. It points right to the sublime
slow movements of the late Beethoven quartets, and is every bit as
rich. Moreover, there is an economy of statement in this music that
perhaps only Stravinsky has equaled since.
</P>
<P>
   In its two concerts, the Colorado String Quartet will play two
more quartets from Opus 64, and three from Opus 17. And it was very
satisfying to read in the program notes by Peter A. Hoyt a tribute
to another overlooked musician, Haydn's right-hand man at the
Esterhazy court, a brilliant Italian violinist for whom Haydn
conceived the virtuosic first violin parts of the earlier quartets,
a man indispensable to Haydn's development as a string quartet
composer: Luigi Tomasini.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I admit, the spelling is not quite the same: Luigi's last
name lacks the extra ``m'' that appears in the byline of yours
truly. But I have always liked to think that our family trees
crossed roots back there somewhere. Mostly, I try to imagine what
it must have been like to be in some elegant sitting room at the
Esterhazy palace, hearing these musicians play Haydn's string
quartets when they were new.
</P>
<P>
   The Mostly Mozart series is providing as good a sense as we are
likely to get of what it must have been like.

MEATLOAF DINNER IGNITES A PROTEST AT SOUTH TEXAS JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Some 70 inmates, apparently upset at being
served meatloaf, staged a rowdy protest at a South Texas jail
Wednesday night and spent hours banging on cells and shouting
threats at guards, the sheriff said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There were no injuries and none of the prisoners escaped, but
dozens of extra guards were called in to restore order, Webb County
Sheriff Juan Garza said. At least four inmates were expected to be
charged with enticing a riot in a detention facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not their moms or wives who give them whatever they
want,'' Garza told a news conference, then served samples of a
jailhouse cheeseburger and broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no fire or disruption of property. It was noise,
yelling, screaming and making threats,'' Garza said. ``We consider
this a minor thing that could have escalated.''
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Ortiz, who is the county jail's head cook and a former
chef at the stylish La Posada Hotel in this city on the U.S.-Mexico
border, said he did not understand what all the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eat well here. The portions are fantastic,'' he said as he
oversaw the preparation of Thursday's lunch of cheeseburgers,
french fries and buttered broccoli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is the best,'' said Ortiz, who couldn't believe a
dinner of meatloaf with carrot sauce and vegetables would prompt a
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said the menus are approved by the local health department
and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give them first-class food and the price goes up, of
course we'll be criticized,'' said Garza, who estimated it costs
about $1.25 per inmate for each meal.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lunch sample, Garza produced a jail menu that
included such dishes as Salisbury steak, baked chicken and
spaghetti with meat sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Guards planned to meet with the inmates to discuss their
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   Garza said about 70 of the 550 inmates in the jail turned rowdy.
Of the 70, 16 were members of a known Texas prison gang, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the trouble started moments after the inmates, who eat
in their cells, were served the meatloaf Wednesday night. Some of
them refused to eat their meals, and their brown plastic trays were
removed and returned to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   There were no complaints at breakfast Thursday, the sheriff
said.

   BOMBING-EMBASSIES _ TEL AVIV, Israel _ In the wake of the tragic
week-old bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, the U.S. State Department
has heightened security at embassies around the world. From
Swaziland to Egypt to Malaysia, the paranoia gripping emabssies
appears to be inescapable. President Clinton Wednesday ordered a
report on the safety of U.S. embassies in order to ask Congress for
emergency funding after deadly bomb attacks. What's being done to
make the embassies at least appear more secure? Are some of our
most important embassies really secure? Also, just how are embassy
employees coping with the knowledge that they are being likened to
``No. 1 with a bullet on the terrorist Hit Parade?'' (Kaplow

   CLINTON-SCANDAL-REPORTERS _ WASHINGTON _ They slogged through
Whitewater despite a public that often preferred to hear less
rather than more about presidential scandal. They weathered the
backlash of the Clinton White House and sometimes faced resistance
from fellow reporters and their own publications. Now the handful
of journalists who have followed a trail of Clinton controversies
for six years are seeing their work lead to the first-ever
appearance by a president before a criminal grand jury. The
persistence of fewer than a dozen reporters has been largely
responsible for keeping the issue of Clinton's conduct before the
country. (Malone, Cox News Service)

   NEW YORK _ Although the horses dominate Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
at this time of year, there are many other attractions:
</P>
<P>
   The Waters
</P>
<P>
   Some historians conjecture that American Indian tribes
discovered the mineral springs running under what was essentially
swampland as early as the 14th century and made them a site of
pilgrimage. (Saratoga is a Mohawk word, meaning ``place of swift
waters.'')
</P>
<P>
   You can make a tasting tour of various springs, each with a
distinct flavor, from crusty to crystalline, by way of public
fountains reverentially positioned in Grecian-style pavilions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Lincoln Mineral Baths or the Crystal Spa, you can
marinate yourself in healing fluids; at Crystal, you can also be
wrapped in skin-restorative vegetation as if you were a very
precious pickle.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Gardens
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Saratoga Spa State Park, a national landmark that
harbors, among other amenities, the National Museum of Dance and
the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, summer home of the New York
City Ballet and the Philadelphia Orchestra, Saratogians themselves
consistently recommend a tour of the gardens of Yaddo, the colony
for writers and artists that was established by Spencer Trask and
his wife, Katrina.
</P>
<P>
   The Trasks also have a presence in lovely Congress Park, through
a sensuous fountain called ``The Spirit of Life,'' which Mrs. Trask
commissioned in her husband's memory from the architect Henry Bacon
and the sculptor Daniel Chester French, the team also responsible
for the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   French remembered the Apollonian head of his voluptuous Saratoga
naiad as ``the best thing of the kind I ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga's History
</P>
<P>
   The opulent Canfield Casino in Congress Park houses the
excellent displays of the Historical Society. The casino itself is
a lovingly maintained palace of chance from the 19th century, when
Saratoga was, among other things, an unregulated gambler's
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   An antiquarian book and print store called Lyrical Ballad is a
source of reading pleasure. And don't miss Saratoga's new public
library, a model of sensitivity to the area's tradition and to
human comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Its holdings include rare materials in the Saratoga Room, a fine
section on classical music and perhaps the largest collection of
racing mysteries by Dick Francis outside the author's own.
(Borrowing privileges are available for temporary visitors.)
</P>
<P>
   Creature Comforts
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Saratoga Springs is dense with small shops, historic
inns and restaurants. Some of the loveliest gifts, however, may be
found in the gift shops of the museums.
</P>
<P>
   Especially recommended: the Visitor Center for paper
reproductions of fanciful antique cards and fans.

NEW AND NOTEWORTHY FILMS  
 (JT)  
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend. Ratings and running
times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``ARMAGEDDON,''  &LR;  starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler
and Steve Buscemi. Directed by Michael Bay (PG-13, 144 minutes).
This big, showy, spirit-crushing summer extravaganza includes not a
single heartfelt moment, unless you count its sequence set in a
strip club. Imminent doom (courtesy of an approaching asteroid)
becomes the excuse for rampant flag-waving, gung-ho patriotism and
a notion of heroism that has nothing whatever to do with real
courage. Willis gets the film's noblest lines for the same reason
that he probably got the set's biggest trailer. Affleck tries
gamely to seem mad about Ms. Tyler, who serves as window-dressing
at NASA headquarters. Totally predictable elements _ loud noises,
frequent explosions and bright computer-screen colors _ seem as
inevitable and deadly as the asteroid while they create the
illusion of escapist fun (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``BASEKETBALL,''  &LR;  starring Trey Parker and Matt Stone.
Directed by David Zucker (R, 105 minutes). In David Zucker's funny,
gross-out spoof of professional sports, Parker and Stone are two
hapless post-adolescent dudes (the latest variation on Wayne and
Garth) who invent a silly driveway hybrid of basketball and
baseball that becomes a national obsession. The film is essentially
two movies stuck together. One is a dumber-than-dumb teen-age
comedy crammed with farcical sight gags and raunchy adolescent
humor. The other is a no-holds-barred satire of professional sports
and the greed, egotism and pomposity surrounding them. As in his
``Naked Gun'' series, Zucker's comic strategy is to fire off a
machine-gun volley of jokes of all shapes and sizes, trusting that
enough will land to keep the audience on the edge of a giggle
(Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``DR. DOLITTLE,''  &LR; starring Eddie Murphy and Oliver Platt.
Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 85 minutes). When this Dr.
Dolittle talks to the animals, they pile on the back talk, thanks
to the stellar cast of vocal talent (Ellen DeGeneres, Garry
Shandling, Paul Reubens, John Leguizamo) that keeps the wisecracks
flying. And Murphy plays straight man with hilarious aplomb. This
good-humored family film is formulaic but steadily funny (and a lot
less corrosive than ``The Nutty Professor''), thanks not only to
Murphy's understated timing but also to expertly computer-enhanced
performances from the animal cast (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVER AFTER: A CINDERELLA STORY,''  &LR; starring Drew Barrymore,
Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott. Directed by Andy Tennant
(PG-13, 120 minutes). The clever notion of reinventing Cinderella
as a self-motivated powerhouse who doesn't need a fairy godmother
to get ahead has been reduced into a bland mishmash of comedy and
soap opera. Drew Barrymore is appealing as Danielle, a plucky,
resourceful, slightly tomboyish 16th-century French girl who knows
how to stand up for herself. But her wimpish prince ( Scott) isn't
much of a prize to crow over. And why is Leonardo da Vinci (Patrick
Godfrey) traipsing around France with the ``Mona Lisa'' under his
arm, giving advice to the lovelorn? The most orthodox refugee from
the standard fairy tale is Anjelica Huston's haughty stepmother
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``EVEREST,''  &LR; directed by David Brashears with Greg
MacGillivray (not rated; 45 minutes). If life in New York City
doesn't provide enough in the way of thrills, those in search of a
vicarious near-death experience can make their way to the Sony Imax
Theater at Lincoln Square (1998 Broadway, at 68th Street) for a go
at ``Everest.'' There, images of the world's highest mountain _
29,028 feet _ find a frame worthy of the peak's spectacular, lethal
beauty: the 8-story-high, 100-foot-wide screen. This account
focuses mainly on the efforts of three people to scale the peak in
1996 despite yawning chasms of ever-shifting ice, thundering
avalanches, the perils of air so thin that it addles the brain, and
sudden, blinding storms. While this expedition was on the mountain,
as many articles and books were later to relate, other teams made
their way into the so-called death zone, at 25,000 feet, where a
violent storm overtook them. Eight people perished in the worst
single disaster on the mountain. ``Everest'' makes it possible for
armchair adventurers to share the risks and glory of the team's
climb toward heaven (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE GOVERNESS,''  &LR;  starring Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson.
Directed by Sandra Goldbacher (R, 114 minutes). It is the early
1840's, and Rosina (Minnie Driver), a headstrong young Sephardic
Jewish woman living in London, poses as a gentile to get a job as a
governess for the Cavendish family on a remote Scottish island.
Falling in love with the skittish, devoutly Christian head of the
household (Tom Wilkinson), a gentleman inventor with whom she has a
stormy affair, she becomes his collaborator in the invention of
photography. The ravishingly handsome film works on several levels:
as a proto-feminist fable, a meditation on still photography and
its relation to real life, and a portrait of lovers whose religious
difference becomes an unbridgeable emotional gap. Ms. Driver holds
the picture with a solid performance that falls short of great
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``GONE WITH THE WIND,''  &LR; starring Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable,
Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie McDaniel. Directed by
Victor Fleming (G, 220 minutes). There's still a lot of robust life
left in this 1939 David O. Selznick adaptation of Margaret
Mitchell's romantic novel of the Old South (possibly as it never
existed) just before, during and after the Civil War. Not a great
film but a satisfying one. The performances by Vivien Leigh, Clark
Gable and Hattie McDaniel are ravishing, and there's grandeur in
the meticulous physical production. The movie shows its age most
unfortunately in the uneven quality of the Technicolor prints,
which, though new, go sort of pinkish more often than they should
(Vincent Canby).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE LAST DAYS OF DISCO,''  &LR;  starring Kate Beckinsale and
Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Whit Stillman (R, 112 minutes).
Stillman's smart, fretful, patrician characters turn up midway
between ``Metropolitan'' and ``Barcelona'' in a film that
charmingly mixes post-college career worries with improbable
discomania. A delightful cast engages in nonstop flirtation and
hair-splitting debate, rendered with Stillman's usual acuity and
humor. Ms. Beckinsale, an English actress with a flawless American
accent here and diffidence that's just as perfect, holds court
beguilingly at the center of a bright and amusing crowd. The ideal
film for anyone willing to entertain the notion that the spread of
environmentalism was sparked by the revival of ``Bambi'' during the
disco generation's formative years (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``LETHAL WEAPON 4,''  &LR; starring Mel Gibson, Danny Glover and
Rene Russo. Directed by Richard Donner (R, 125 minutes). In the
full perspective-warping heat of the summer movie season, this
turns out to be one of the nicer blow-'em-ups around. The
characters are funny and likable, and they all live on earth. The
formula still has some zip. The stars, with the welcome new
addition of Chris Rock as a young detective who has literally
married into the ``Lethal Weapon'' family, play their roles with
breezy finesse. And the story, about slave smuggling and Chinese
gangsters, is a flamboyant, fight-filled adventure fueled by
kidding camaraderie and constant forward motion. Bear in mind that
this is still a film whose idea of high drama is watching a car get
pushed in front of an oncoming train (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``MAFIA!,''  &LR; starring Jay Mohr, Lloyd Bridges and Christina
Applegate. Directed by Jim Abrahams (PG-13, 86 minutes). This
sendup makes an offer you could probably refuse, but its
Mad-magazine-style hit-or-miss humor works well enough to be
reasonably bright. It's true, though, that a Mafia movie satire
without a single horse's head in a bed and without anyone who
sounds like Joe Pesci has left a few stones unturned. Concentrating
mostly on the ``Godfather'' films and ``Casino,'' Abrahams throws
in anything from canned meatballs by Spalding to vomit gags. Lloyd
Bridges, to whose memory the film is dedicated, has the role of a
dapper don and shows one last time how sporting and debonair he
could be (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE MASK OF ZORRO,''  &LR; starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony
Hopkins and Catherine Zeta-Jones. Directed by Martin Campbell
(PG-13, 130 minutes). Travel back to the days when swashbuckling
was serious business, when boyish adventure films still had their
innocence and when the bravado of thrilling stunt work was all a
movie needed in the way of special effects. Hopkins is marvelously
game as the film's dashing senior Zorro. Banderas was born to play
the aging hero's jokey, hotblooded protege. And he meets his match
in the story's heroine, whose beauty is inevitably described as
``beyond compare.'' This robust old-fashioned adventure should
appeal to older children, but beware of a few needlessly grisly
touches (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE NEGOTIATOR,''  &LR; starring Samuel L. Jackson and Kevin
Spacey. Directed by F. Gary Gray (R, 115 minutes). In a twist on
the Hitchcockian maxim, this thriller takes two extraordinary
actors and places them in surprisingly ordinary circumstances. In a
film whose title should have been plural, both stars play seasoned
hostage negotiators who are caught up in a by-the-numbers battle of
wits. Amazingly, both these shrewd, maverick actors are cast as
nice guys, team players and clean-cut family men. The movie's
brisk, familiar look of a police story, heavy with close-ups, that
escalates to a paramilitary operation will look right at home when
it comes to the video screen (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``NIGHTS OF CABIRIA,''  &LR; starring Giulietta Masina. Directed by
Federico Fellini (not rated, 117 minutes). Anyone dismayed by the
hyperkinetic emptiness of summertime film spectacles will find the
antidote in this 1957 Fellini masterpiece. It has been refurbished
and revived by the same team that brought back ``Contempt'' last
year, and they display the same acumen in reissuing a film of
special prescience; though it was shot in black and white amid the
poverty of postwar Italy, neither the style nor the searching of
``Cabiria' has grown dated at all. In a prize-winning and
heartbreaking performance, the star plays a scrappy Roman
streetwalker who drifts almost magically among the film's
astonishingly varied realms. There is more grace and courage in the
famous image of Masina smiling through her tears than in all the
fire-breathing blockbusters Hollywood has to offer (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE OPPOSITE OF SEX,''  &LR; starring Christina Ricci, Martin
Donovan, Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Directed by Don Roos (R, 100
minutes). Wicked, foulmouthed and very funny, this gleefully
acerbic comedy finds that Ms. Ricci has morphed enchantingly from
nasty little Wednesday of ``The Addams Family'' into Lolita's evil
twin. Voluptuous and scheming, her poisonous Dedee narrates this
film and announces immediately that she won't be developing a heart
of gold. Which is, of course, mostly a lie. The film brutally
skewers preconceptions about gay and straight life, then lets its
characters intermingle in sweetly unexpected ways. Donovan and Ms.
Kudrow, as unlikely comrades brought together by Dedee's treachery,
deliver the zingers from Roos' screenplay with deadpan panache
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PARENT TRAP,''  &LR; starring Lindsay Lohan, Natasha
Richardson and Dennis Quaid. Directed by Nancy Meyers and written
by David Swift, Ms. Meyers and Charles Shyer (PG, 128 minutes). A
super-cute remake of the old Hayley Mills hit, this time given a
privileged shelter-magazine gloss by the ``Father of the Bride''
team of Ms. Meyers and Shyer. Ms. Richardson and Quaid beam
appealingly as parents who somehow managed to separate their twins
at birth without a twinge of guilt, and who seem to have spent all
of the intervening 11{ years shopping. In her dual role as English
and American sisters (one lives in a grand London town house, the
other on a big Napa Valley vineyard; nobody lives in a coal mine),
the spirited Ms. Lohan commandeers the movie as if she had been
taking shrinking-violet lessons from Sharon Stone (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SAVING PRIVATE RYAN,''  &LR; starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom
Sizemore, Jeremy Davies, Edward Burns and Adam Goldberg. Directed
by Steven Spielberg (R, 168 minutes). Spielberg's soberly
magnificent new film is the finest war movie of our time. Turning
back the clock to restore passion and meaning to the genre, he
works in a spirit of urgent communication to look at war as if it
had not been looked at before. Tour-de-force battle scenes are
frank without sensationalism, and the same great storyteller who
made you believe there was an extraterrestrial hiding in the closet
has made this an irresistibly vibrant, gripping tale. Hanks
continues to astonish with admirable modesty, and the rest of the
casting is comparably inspired. As he did with ``Schindler's
List,'' Spielberg has made a landmark film of devastating power
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SMALL SOLDIERS,''  &LR; starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst,
Dennis Leary and Phil Hartman. Directed by Joe Dante (PG-13, 105
minutes). This ably animated film about action-figure toys who
virtually come to life should have been a sure thing. There are
innocent echoes of ``Toy Story'' and darker ones of the director's
own ``Gremlins'' pictures, which had the witty balance of mischief
and horror that ``Small Soldiers'' strangely lacks. The voice
talent here is extraordinary, with the casts of ``The Dirty Dozen''
and ``This Is Spinal Tap'' playing rival toy factions, and Tommy
Lee Jones and Frank Langella as their respective commanders. But
the story remains unfocused and grows too wan for horror, too
creepy for lighthearted fun. Another reason not to laugh is
Hartman's performance in the fatuous role that was his last
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``SNAKE EYES,''  &LR; starring Nicolas Cage and Gary Sinise.
Directed by Brian De Palma (R, 99 minutes). An assassination, a
fixed heavyweight boxing bout, and a perfectly timed hurricane
named Jezebel collide apocalyptically one night in Atlantic City
where hellfire rains over a hotel and casino appropriately called
the Millennium. Here is where Rick Santoro ( Cage), the sleazy
police detective in charge of security, discovers his best friend (
Sinise) could also be his nemesis and he has to make hard moral
choices. This entertaining pop fable, which recalls the director's
``Blow Out,'' isn't believable for a second, but it has a pulpy
energy that keeps on chugging (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE SPANISH PRISONER,''  &LR; starring Campbell Scott, Rebecca
Pidgeon, Ben Gazzara and Steve Martin. Directed by David Mamet (PG,
112 minutes). The most engaging of Mamet's cinematic puzzles begins
with an X-ray at an airport security check. And the audience will
wish it had a similar device for reading the characters' sneaky
minds. No such luck: the mystery here, in a handsome and
Hitchcockian film named for an elaborate con game, stays tricky to
the very end. Scott plays the inventor of a lucrative, stealable
scientific process, with Gazzara as the boss who's in no hurry to
compensate him for it. In an ensemble cast working entirely on the
calculating Mamet wavelength, Martin plays a rich, debonair mystery
man who tells the inventor all about his pretty young sister. In
her performance as a pert, unaccountably off-kilter secretary, Ms.
Pidgeon perfectly embodies the film's sleight of hand (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY,''  &LR; starring Cameron Diaz, Ben
Stiller and Matt Dillon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (R,
119 minutes). Sometimes Western civilization declines in
deliriously funny style. Hence this proudly obnoxious comedy is a
hoot in every sense, deserving a smidgen of disapproval and a whole
lot of helpless laughter. Set in motion by a prom, a crush and a
cruel, cruel zipper, this paean to low humor works ridiculously
well because it never stoops to being mean-spirited or (despite all
appearances) authentically inane. The principal cast is bright and
appealing, with Ms. Diaz at her most beautiful and blithe. Do note
that this film strives hard for something to offend everyone, and
that tolerance for the Farrellys' zit jokes is unfortunately
required (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TITANIC,''  &LR; starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and
Gloria Stuart. Directed by James Cameron (PG-13, 197 minutes). For
once, a much-touted event movie is exactly that: a glorious
throwback to the days when epic storytelling really filled the
screen. Despite the astonishing technological advances behind
Cameron's great visual spectacle, gimmicks are never allowed to
intrude on the film's central illusion, that the audience is drawn
back into the Gilded Age and intimately involved in the fateful
voyage. For all its painstaking historical detail, this ``Titanic''
proves anything but quaint, thanks to the phenomenal immediacy of
its sights and the pure Hollywood hokum of its story. As two young
lovers whose romance is skillfully interwoven with historical
detail, Ms. Winslet and DiCaprio are a duo with serious chemistry.
With his ``Gone With the Wind''-caliber ambitions, Cameron dared to
dream of the impossible and came up with the movie of the year
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE TRUMAN SHOW,''  &LR; starring Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and Ed
Harris. Directed by Peter Weir and written by Andrew Niccol (PG,
104 minutes). The ultimate in high-concept ingenuity. Hosannas and
cartwheels for this ingenious media-age fantasy are over the top,
but by comparison with Hollywood's usual notion of summer movie
fare, it's definitely a dazzler. Carrey, refreshingly free of
shtick, gives an instantly iconic performance as a guinea pig for
an entertainment-happy nation, a man whose whole life is a fraud
contrived by Harris' so-called ``televisionary.'' Carrey's innate
edge of volatility gives the material, from a screenplay of
transfixing sci-fi intensity, its trace of danger. Ms. Linney, as
the actress playing a wife whose bluff could be called at any
moment, is the story's spookiest character as well as its perkiest.
Weir unifies the story's many nuances with great finesse (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``WESTERN,''  &LR; starring Sergi Lopez and Sacha Bourdo. Directed
by Manuel Poirier (not rated, 121 minutes). What a tenderhearted
delight is ``Western,'' the best-kept secret in town. Don't be put
off by that misleading title: Poirier's road movie is actually set
in western France, where two funny and hapless outsiders wind up
joining forces and embarking on a wonderfully droll journey. The
story begins when a salesman from Spain is outsmarted by a wily
little Russian hitchhiker. It's an introduction that hardly has the
makings of a beautiful friendship. But that's exactly what develops
in a funny, romantic film filled with cozy intimacies and lovely,
wide-screen images of the French countryside. Looking for love,
these two lonely travelers find it in the most sweetly
unpredictable ways. Audiences are liable to fall in love, too
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE X-FILES,''  &LR;  starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson
and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Rob Bowman (PG-13, 115
minutes). Conspiracy theorists, consider this: what if the
hush-hush atmosphere and Internet mania surrounding the first
``X-Files'' feature film were part of a giant scheme to hide the
uneventfulness of a summertime sci-fi fizzle? It's as possible as
much of what this spinoff film has to offer. If devotees of the
television series approach the film with enough baggage for a
six-week safari, maybe they can deepen the experience of watching a
middling action-adventure with brand-name appeal. But this film
will strike true X-fanatics as watered down, and remains fairly
bewildering to the uninitiated. And, no, Scully and Mulder don't
quite take their working relationship to a higher plane (Maslin).

 CATCHING '30s NEW YORK WITH LIGHT AND SHADOW  
 (af)  
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New printmakers of the 1920s and '30s caught the
spirit of New York in that era with quite the pizazz of Martin
Lewis (1881-1962), an Australian who came to the city at 19 and
made it his own.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings, views, neighborhoods, street gangs, storefronts,
rooftops, shoppers, workers, idlers, relationships, even the
weather, seem especially staged for Lewis, who got it all down in
black and white, capturing people and architecture in the etching
and drypoint techniques of which he was a master.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best-known mood pieces is ``Glow of the City''
(1929), a night scene in which a woman, dressed in flapper fashion
with bobbed hair, stands on a fire escape, gazing dreamily at the
metropolis around her.
</P>
<P>
   Over her head are lines of drying clothes; lights shine from
nearby apartment windows, and in the distance looms a symbol of the
city's prosperity, an illuminated skyscraper that brightens the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The composition _ reminiscent of earlier work by John Sloan _
has the look of a 1920s Broadway stage set and a lyrical poignancy
that evokes Tin Pan Alley tunes of the period.
</P>
<P>
   That the Brooklyn Museum of Art owns one of the best public
collections of Lewis' prints seems a good enough reason for the
show it has assembled, ``Martin Lewis' World: Cityscapes on
Paper.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis is not the only artist represented: his world is
augmented with photographs from the period by other intense
urbanites like Berenice Abbott, Lewis Hine, Arthur Leipzig, Walter
Rosenblum and Adolf Fassbender. By means of strategic juxtaposing,
an attempt has been made to relate their subjects to those of
Lewis' prints.
</P>
<P>
   Although the time frame is from 1919 to the early 1950s, the
show's focus is on the '30s. Things were rough; the Great
Depression held the country in a stranglehold.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis, although all his life a Socialist, was not one to
dwell on the downtrodden in his work. What he appreciated most were
the streetscapes peculiar to Manhattan, and sometimes its boroughs
and suburbs. He particularly liked night scenes in which he could
use his skills at rendering light and shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spring Night, Greenwich Village'' (1930), for example,
passers-by cast long silhouettes on the sidewalk in the light cast
by storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   The feel of New York in the small hours is conveyed by ``2
a.m.''(1932), in which three cloche-hatted women cross an all but
empty avenue as a sanitation worker washes it down with a powerful
hose (shades of the past!).
</P>
<P>
   The dark bulk of the not-yet-completed Empire State Building,
stagily illuminated from behind, is the subject of ``Manhattan
Lights'' (1931), its starkness relieved by the relaxed presence of
two women and a child. Hanging next to it is Lewis Hine's 1931
photograph ``New York From the Empire State Building at Night,'' a
dramatic shot taken from high up through girders and cable supports
that frame an exhilarating city panorama far below.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of weather were also a Lewis specialty, maybe
influenced by Japanese prints. ``Stoops in Snow,'' a 1930 scene in
which bundled-up pedestrians slog past a row of brownstone stoops
capped in white, is streaked with lines of falling snow, as is the
1932 photograph paired with it, ``Trolley in Snow,'' by John Albok,
which shows a streetcar lashed by a heavy winter storm.
</P>
<P>
   And in ``Windy Day'' (1932), pedestrians on what looks like
Fifth Avenue are attacked by playful gusts that ruffle their
clothes and send scraps of litter flying.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, a commercial artist until his mid-'40s, when he took up
printmaking in a serious way, was one of the few artists to devote
himself almost exclusively to the graphic medium. At his best, he
was a wonderful illustrator and chronicler whose vision of the city
rings true; at its least, his work is a kind of corny urban
regionalism comparable to that of the Midwestern painters, his
contemporaries, who celebrated rural life in what they called
``America's heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, one of Lewis' great virtues is that he saw
New York as a heartland, too.
</P>
<P>
   As for the photographs in the show, standouts include Arthur
Leipzig's views of children playing games, Walter Rosenblum's shot
of adolescent rooftop recreation, D.J. Ruzicka's awesome glimpse of
lower Manhattan buildings through a pattern of crisscross cables
that enclose a high-up construction site, and Charles H. Zapata's
``Meeting'' (1940s), a couple of ordinary men in a street encounter
as seen from a nearby alley. You could cut the nostalgia here with
a knife, but it's a pleasant wallow.  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``Martin Lewis' World: Cityscapes on Paper'' remains at
the Brooklyn Museum of Art, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park,
through Oct. 25.(end italics)

MORE CRIMES WOULD BE SOLVED WITHOUT MIRANDA RULE, THINK TANK SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The so-called Miranda rule, which requires police
to tell suspects of their right to remain silent, has prevented law
enforcement officials from solving thousands of crimes every year,
according to a report released Thursday by a Dallas-based think
tank.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 crimes _ including robbery, larceny and
vehicle theft _ go unsolved every year because of Miranda, the
conservative National Center for Policy Analysis said in the study.
</P>
<P>
   Its author, Paul Cassell, a law professor at the University of
Utah, said the rule has meant that ``100,000 innocent victims
around the country are left without the assurance that the person
who committed the crime against them has been identified.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule grew out of a 1966 Supreme Court case, Miranda v.
Arizona, in which the justices decided 5-4 in favor of Ernesto
Miranda, who had confessed to kidnapping and rape charges after two
hours of questioning by police. The high court, in reversing
Miranda's conviction, said law enforcement officials must inform
suspects of their constitutional rights before questioning them.
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda warning, used throughout the country, says suspects
have ``the right to remain silent'' and that anything they say can
be used against them in court. It also says they may consult a
lawyer and have him or her present while they are being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that over the years courts have narrowed the
scope of the warning, Cassell said in a debate here staged by the
Dallas center that the number of crimes solved would be higher
without Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1995, he said, only 44 percent of violent crimes were
being solved. Before Miranda the figure was about 60 percent, his
study said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell's numbers were challenged by George Thomas III, a law
professor at Rutgers University. Other legal experts have not
accepted them as valid, Thomas said, charging that Cassell ``tosses
the numbers like they are real, but I don't think you can attribute
them as real.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Crawford, an FBI agent who teaches at the bureau's
academy in Quantico, Va., also criticized the Miranda rule. She
said that once a suspect asks for a lawyer, the criminal justice
process slows down. ``Maybe we'll get a confession,'' Crawford
said. But ``we have to pay for that confession (by bargaining).
When attorneys are involved, it's more: Make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Miller of Alexandria, Va., a criminal defense attorney
and a member of the National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers, argued for the rule. Suspects find themselves in a
``coercive atmosphere'' with police and may not know what their
rights are, he said, adding that once the police ``start to ask
questions using psychological ploys (the suspect) is at a
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Miranda protects the fundamental American belief
that suspects are innocent until proved guilty. ``We're here to
protect the rights of the innocent, and that means protecting the
rights of the guilty,'' he added.

THREE TIMES THE PAIN! THREE TIMES THE GAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE GLICKMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1982, the sport of triathlon was about as popular in the
United States as llama racing. But 11 hours into the fifth annual
Ironman Triathlon _ a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and
26.2-mile run _ the women's leader, Julie Moss, 23, wobbled down
Alii Drive on the Big Island of Hawaii and collapsed two miles from
the finish. Refusing medical attention, she picked herself off the
road, staggered a few more steps and crumpled again like a suit
slipping off a hanger.
</P>
<P>
   Her total body meltdown occurred on ABC's ``Wide World of
Sports'' and the audience was riveted. Would she still win? Could
she finish? Would she live? Somehow, she managed to struggle over
the remaining two miles. As she approached the finish line, she
began crawling, and Kathleen McCartney, the winner nobody
remembers, hobbled by. Thirty agonizing seconds later, Julie Moss
pulled herself across the line, becoming perhaps the most
celebrated second-place finisher of all time.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave it to the psychologists to explain why such a
wrenching display of self-flagellation captured the public's
imagination, but it put the young sport on the map. The next year,
the field doubled, and 12 million households tuned in and saw two
of the most aerobically fit men on earth, Dave Scott and Scott
Tinley, race virtually side by side for nine hours. This was the
flip side of ``the agony of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, millions have participated in thousands of
triathlons, which has come to mean any event that combines
swimming, cycling and running, usually in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon, which makes its Olympic debut in 2000 in Sydney,
Australia, is big in Japan, South America, New Zealand, Canada,
Mexico and Europe. While the Hawaii Ironman _ the sport's glamour
event _ takes the pros 8 to 9 hours and mere mortals 11 to 15
hours, there's a prolific calendar of shorter races around the
country that are demanding but doable for anyone who can swim, bike
and run.
</P>
<P>
   The Ironman, which requires nearly Herculean effort to prepare
for and complete, is another beast entirely. After all, it resulted
from a naval officer's bar bet trying to settle an argument about
who was fitter: the runner, cyclist or swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a friend cajoled me into entering a short-course
``tri'' in Northern New Jersey: a half-mile swim, 25-mile bike
race, 5-mile run. Setting up my gear in the transition area, a
roped-off space where the athletes would change after the swim and
bike, I was wowed by the rows of high-tech bicycles, some of which
cost as much as a used car. Many had ultralight disk wheels and
aero handlebars, which cut wind resistance by allowing the rider to
assume a forward, praying mantis position.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies that belonged to these sleek machines were also
striking. Unlike high-mileage runners who look perpetually hungry
and have little or no upper body mass, or hammerhead cyclists who
tend to have bulgy thighs that dwarf their lean torsos, or
wide-shouldered swimmers with skinny legs, these cross-training
``tri-geeks'' were both lean and proportionally muscular. Simply
put, they looked better than most of the single-sport devotees I
knew.
</P>
<P>
   The race's start was wild: 500 hyper athletes in swim suits,
goggles and bright red bathing caps thrashing over and around one
another like salmon spawning upstream. I survived the swim and
cycled competently, but when I donned my running shoes and
attempted locomotion, my thighs were so laden with lactic acid that
I ran like Frankenstein hustling to catch a bus.
</P>
<P>
   I did a few more triathlons, then stopped. The sport appealed to
me since it developed the total athlete, but training properly for
three disciplines was time-consuming. And having such a gadgety,
gear-intensive hobby would mean getting a second job (which first
would mean getting a first job). Triathlon, once the province of
southern California beach boys, had become the quintessential yuppy
sport. (In fact, a recent survey reported that the average annual
income of triathletes is $90,000.) When the $30 entry fees doubled,
I decided to sweat elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And yet each year as I watched the assembled field of endorphin
junkies try to go the distance at the Ironman, I'd get caught up in
the hyperbolic commentary, and fantasize about doing it, at least
until the telecast was over. This summer, while running in
Brooklyn's Prospect Park with a friend who has completed two Hawaii
Ironmans and is trying to qualify for a third, I found myself
promising to join him in July at a half-ironman triathlon in
Kingston, N.Y., 90 miles north of New York City. The hilly course
in the Catskills featured a 1.2 mile-swim, a 60-mile bike ride and
a 13.1-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   This was not my most sensible idea. I'd swum six times in the
previous six months and only cycled for transportation around town.
``How often are you running?'' queried my friend, a 50-year-old
architect who trains as much as 30 hours a week. ``Twice a week,''
I answered, ``but I have been kayaking a lot!'' ``Sounds like
you're ready!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the physiological distress I experienced in my first
triathlon, a month before the race I called Troy Jacobson, a
six-time Ironman and the fourth American finisher in Hawaii in
1997. Jacobson, 29 and a former collegiate football player, coaches
more than 100 clients in 30 states and five countries via the phone
and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We talked about my fitness background, allotted exercise time
and goals. ``To see significant changes, I like my athletes to
commit to a four-month program, but we can get you to the finish in
four weeks . . . I think,'' Jacobson said over the phone from
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, I received an e-mail with a custom-built
training schedule divided into day-by-day, sport-by-sport workouts.
``Remember,'' he said, ``let the plan guide you, not control you.''
</P>
<P>
   In normal life one rarely goes for a run right after a long bike
ride, much less a ride and swim. Jacobson's regime was intended to
condition you to do just that. During the week, I usually did two
of the three sports for about two hours in total. For example, on
Wednesday I'd do a 90-minute bike ride, take a 5-minute rest (five
minutes more than in an actual triathlon) and go for a 30-minute
run, a workout created to teach my legs to run with fatigue.
Thursday might include a swim in the morning and a two-hour bike
ride in the evening. Saturdays, the toughest day on the schedule, I
tried to do all three sports. Mercifully, Monday was a day off.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., on what was already becoming a hot July Saturday,
about 300 people stood on the rocky banks of the placid Hudson
River for the start of the Second Annual Hudson Valley Triathlon.
Waiting anxiously for the gun to sound, I remembered what Jacobson
had told me two days earlier. ``Experience the distance and be
conservative throughout the race,'' he cautioned. ``This is a
super-challenging event on a difficult course. When you feel like
you're overextending yourself, back off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson, a 6-foot 170-pounder who has about as much body
fat as a greyhound, also told me to stay focused: ``You want to
reach a level of intensity where your mind says slow down and the
body doesn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Having logged virtually no pool time prior to the race, I
started slowly and never sped up until I rounded the orange turn
buoy and realized that we'd been bucking a stiff current. When I
hit the beach running, the clock said I'd been in the water for 51
minutes, 16 minutes behind the lead swimmer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a helmet, cycling shorts and shoes, along with a bike
jersey loaded with packets of carbohydrate gel, I took to the road
to begin the longest leg of the race. To me, cycling is the most
enjoyable of the three sports. Passing slower riders, feeling the
jolt of energy when another cyclist comes whirring by, charging the
hills and pedaling hard down the other side at speeds of 30 and 40
miles an hour, I experienced the same thrill I felt riding my bike
when I was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles into the scenic ride, however, my rear sought a
lounge chair and my thighs a masseuse. All I could do was distract
myself, which I did by chatting with an Australian rugby player
turned New York City hair stylist. We averaged 19.7 miles an hour
and roughly three topics of conversation every 10 miles, covering
the 60 miles in 3 hours 2 minutes, 36 minutes slower than the
fastest rider.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrying into my running shoes, I left the transition area side
by side with the hair stylist, both of us looking decidedly
uncoifed. Considering that I'd just spent three hours on a bike, my
legs felt relatively fine, but heading up a nasty hill I had a side
stitch that sent pain through my gut with each step. Two miles into
the run, my companion said, ``No worries, mate!'' and pulled away,
leaving me to continue grimly on.
</P>
<P>
   At the six-mile mark I did what I hate to do in a race: I
walked, albeit for only 30 seconds. Plodding up the short, steep
hills was the worst. Over the last three miles I reminded myself
that the pain, while intense, stops virtually the moment you cross
the finish line. Managing pain is a part of endurance sports,
perhaps even the point.
</P>
<P>
   I completed the half-marathon in 1 hour 47 minutes _ 11 minutes
slower than the overall winner _ and crossed the line in 5 hours 48
minutes: 103rd out of the approximately 300 who started.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I hobbled around, eating bagels and drinking water
nonstop as a steady stream of competitors rounded the final turn.
One fellow I talked to sounded chagrined even though he finished in
the top 30. ``It was emotionally traumatizing,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Another chap, who'd placed 76th overall, was beaming. The secret
to his success, he said, was eating raw chopped beef and eggs:
``It's given me the strength and endurance to train and race
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   My architect friend _ who finished four minutes behind me _ met
me near a bowl of sliced oranges, and we discussed what we often
talk about: training, pain and the meaning of it all. When a lean
72-year-old man in a flowered bathing suit crossed the line, we
stopped to applaud. He'd been out there for just over seven hours.
``When you finish the Ironman in Hawaii, you've come close to
realizing your potential,'' said my weary architect friend. ``You
don't often get to do that in everyday life.''

 JANINE ANTONI and LIISA ROBERTS: IMAGES SHIMMER, INSTALLED IN THE(js )

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Installation pieces involving moving images, whether
film or video, are prominent among art's current staples, and the
number of women pursuing the medium is on the rise. So it barely
bends the law of averages to find two such installations at the
Whitney Museum of American Art: ``Swoon'' by Janine Antoni and
``Blind Side'' by Liisa Roberts. And it's not so surprising that
they play off each other in revealing ways.

   Ms. Antoni's work has been performance-oriented, usually
hammering home points about ``women's work'' and various female
compulsions, especially those to be clean, thin and well turned
out. She also often puns on male-dominated art styles. In ``Gnaw,''
she lampooned Minimalist perfection and dramatized various cravings
with a man-size cube of chocolate, a substance thought to be a
female aphrodisiac, that was noticeably chewed around the edges.
</P>
<P>
   She has made drawings by fluttering her mascara-laden lashes
across sheets of paper. And in an especially well-known performance
piece, she scrubbed the floor with her own hair dipped in black
dye, creating a kind of cleaning-day Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   But as with nearly every performance artist before her, Ms.
Antoni may have grown weary of putting her body on the line and
realized that she had to move on. ``Swoon'' is her first large work
in which the viewer does not see or sense the artist's physical
involvement, and it represents a big, largely successful step.
</P>
<P>
   Originally seen last summer at the Capp Street Project in San
Francisco, ``Swoon'' pursues the familiar theme of beauty and its
cost, but it abandons the domestic realm to concentrate on art,
specifically ballet. The viewer enters the piece through a darkened
rawly finished corridor accompanied by strange, slightly disturbing
sounds: heavy breathing, straining grunts and light thuds that can
make one think of sex or sports.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, in a darkened gallery, the source of these sounds is
revealed. Beneath a beautiful red velvet curtain that is lowered
almost to the ground, the bottom of a glowing screen is visible,
and on it are the dancing feet of a ballerina and her partner. As
they proceed through their steps, turns and lifts unaccompanied by
music, her toe shoes make sharp little thuds, the stays of her
costume creak, and the dancers' breath becomes increasingly
labored.
</P>
<P>
   In all, it's an audible account of the work, discipline and
suffering behind ballet's breathtaking illusion. The image is
doubled by a wall-size mirror opposite the screen, so that the
viewer's shadowy reflection becomes part of the image, adding
another layer of reality.
</P>
<P>
   One can walk around the screen to view its ``backstage'' side,
where the dancers are fully visible, along with the installation's
inner workings: the projection booth and video tracking numbers on
the screen. Yet more in the way of beauty, narrative and emotion is
also conveyed: the ballerina's white feathered costume suggests
``Swan Lake''; the dancers are performing the ballet's famously
sad, seductive final pas de deux, in which the lovers repeatedly
seem overwhelmed by feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Tchaikovsky's music for the ballet fills the gallery,
masking the sounds of effort, lifting dancer and viewer alike,
making one feel slightly swoonish. But the music lasts only a few
exhilarating moments before the sounds of reality take over again.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite so dramatic happens in Ms. Roberts' ``Blind
Side,'' a Structuralist effort that also uses a two-sided screen
and a mirror. In this case, a film of a well-appointed salon _
complete with formal antique furniture and oriental rugs and
punctuated by three big French windows _ is projected through a
translucent glass screen and reflected on a wall-size mirror on the
opposite end of the gallery. Entering this gallery, viewers are
thus sandwiched between mirroring life-size images, one that
reflects them, one that doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The camera never moves, but the scene changes; the light outside
moves from day to night and back again, in a 24-hour exposure
accelerated to less than 6 minutes. As the sky darkens, the room
disappears and only the windows remain, luminous rectangles through
which a busy city comes into sharper focus: the lights of
buildings, streets and cars speeding across an elevated highway
emphasize a fast, gritty urban world far removed from the quiet
unchanging formality of the room itself.
</P>
<P>
   This piece is a considerable improvement over Ms. Roberts' debut
last year at the Lehman Maupin Gallery in SoHo, a pointlessly busy
installation involving images of statues. ``Blind Side'' has
economy and understatement in its favor, although it may be almost
too stripped down.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to make deliberate reference to one of the landmarks of
Structuralist film, Michael Snow's ``Wavelength'' of 1967. In this
movie, the scene is a TriBeCa loft; the action consists of the
camera's executing a 45-minute zoom slowly and inexorably toward
the center point of a three-windowed wall. The light changes into a
series of lurid Warholian colors (achieved with filters); the
sounds of unseen street traffic intrude. Just as the camera seems
about to hit the wall, the zoom shot comes to an end, centimeters
from a postcard-size image of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if Ms. Roberts set out to rearrange the
components of Snow's film: in her work the light, and its changes,
are natural; the traffic is visible, the grungy loft, an industrial
space redolent of old-style manufacturing, has been traded for a
more genteel but equally old-fashioned setting, one whose stillness
contrasts with the industrious scene outside. As day turns to night
and the room fades into total darkness (like a theater), the three
windows come to resemble narrow movie screens and the racing
traffic the movement of film through the projector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blind Side'' might almost be said to out-structure the
structuralism of ``Wavelength.'' Ms. Roberts touches on the basics
of film _ time, light and movement _ using reality in a more
straightforward manner, and she tolerates even less narrative than
Snow, who teasingly created a fragment of traditional suspense by
having a couple walk past the camera talking about finding a corpse
in the loft. The only figures in ``Blind Side'' are the shadows and
reflections of the viewers (an effect, however, that evokes the
work of one of Snow's contemporaries, Paul Sharits.) A problem is
that too much of the work's interest lies in its dialogue with its
precedent, which limits its power for viewers not familiar with
Snow's film.

 &HT;    CDC survey: ``We are seeing too many kids at risk,''
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- More American teenagers are smoking marijuana - and
at a younger age - than just two years ago, according to a new
youth survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nearly one in five say they have carried a weapon,
driven a vehicle after drinking and considered suicide, the
national survey found.
</P>
<P>
   While most findings released Thursday differed little from a
similar survey conducted two years ago, health experts said the
survey highlights concerns about the incidence of teen automobile
deaths, suicides, tobacco and drug use, as well as dangerous sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing too many kids at risk,'' said Laura Kann, chief
of the Surveillance Research Section for the CDC. ``Too many kids
practice behaviors that place them at risk for unnecessary
mortality and morbidity,''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance,
which surveyed more than 16,000 U.S. high school students about
their activities in the past 30 days:
</P>
<P>
   -- 50 percent said they had at least one alcoholic drink, and 33
percent had five or more. Black students were significantly less
likely to report consuming alcohol, while alcohol use increased
with age in all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   -- 17 percent said they had driven after drinking, and 36
percent had been driven by a person who had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   -- 36 percent reported smoking at least one cigarette, and 16
percent reported smoking on at least 20 of those 30 days. 70
percent reported trying cigarettes, even ``a puff or two.'' White
students were found to be more likely to smoke than blacks or
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   -- 18 percent said they had carried a weapon such as a gun,
knife or club. Males were more likely than female to carry weapons.
Hispanics and blacks were more likely than whites to carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Surveyers, who asked teens at 151 schools nationwide to fill out
confidential questionnaires, also queried students about their
activities in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   It found that during the past 12 months, one in five teens said
they had seriously considered committing suicide, while 15 percent
reported coming up with a specific plan. Female students were
almost twice as likely to say they had contemplated suicide. In
addition, the CDC survey found 37 percent reporting being in a
physical fight, with the highest incidence among males, Hispanics
and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- 48 percent of all students said they had had sex; 16 percent
had four or more partners; and 7 percent had lost their virginity
by age 13. About 43 percent of sexually active teens reported not
using a condom the last time they had sex.
</P>
<P>
   -- 27 percent of students said they felt overweight, and nearly
40 percent were currently trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   -- 19 percent admitted to rarely or never wearing a seat belt.

THREE TIMES THE PAIN! THREE TIMES THE GAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication warning: also sent with `e' code) 
 (bl)  
 By JOE GLICKMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1982, the sport of triathlon was about as popular in the
United States as llama racing. But 11 hours into the fifth annual
Ironman Triathlon _ a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and
26.2-mile run _ the women's leader, Julie Moss, 23, wobbled down
Alii Drive on the Big Island of Hawaii and collapsed two miles from
the finish. Refusing medical attention, she picked herself off the
road, staggered a few more steps and crumpled again like a suit
slipping off a hanger.
</P>
<P>
   Her total body meltdown occurred on ABC's ``Wide World of
Sports'' and the audience was riveted. Would she still win? Could
she finish? Would she live? Somehow, she managed to struggle over
the remaining two miles. As she approached the finish line, she
began crawling, and Kathleen McCartney, the winner nobody
remembers, hobbled by. Thirty agonizing seconds later, Julie Moss
pulled herself across the line, becoming perhaps the most
celebrated second-place finisher of all time.
</P>
<P>
   I'll leave it to the psychologists to explain why such a
wrenching display of self-flagellation captured the public's
imagination, but it put the young sport on the map. The next year,
the field doubled, and 12 million households tuned in and saw two
of the most aerobically fit men on earth, Dave Scott and Scott
Tinley, race virtually side by side for nine hours. This was the
flip side of ``the agony of defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, millions have participated in thousands of
triathlons, which has come to mean any event that combines
swimming, cycling and running, usually in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Triathlon, which makes its Olympic debut in 2000 in Sydney,
Australia, is big in Japan, South America, New Zealand, Canada,
Mexico and Europe. While the Hawaii Ironman _ the sport's glamour
event _ takes the pros 8 to 9 hours and mere mortals 11 to 15
hours, there's a prolific calendar of shorter races around the
country that are demanding but doable for anyone who can swim, bike
and run.
</P>
<P>
   The Ironman, which requires nearly Herculean effort to prepare
for and complete, is another beast entirely. After all, it resulted
from a naval officer's bar bet trying to settle an argument about
who was fitter: the runner, cyclist or swimmer.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a friend cajoled me into entering a short-course
``tri'' in Northern New Jersey: a half-mile swim, 25-mile bike
race, 5-mile run. Setting up my gear in the transition area, a
roped-off space where the athletes would change after the swim and
bike, I was wowed by the rows of high-tech bicycles, some of which
cost as much as a used car. Many had ultralight disk wheels and
aero handlebars, which cut wind resistance by allowing the rider to
assume a forward, praying mantis position.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies that belonged to these sleek machines were also
striking. Unlike high-mileage runners who look perpetually hungry
and have little or no upper body mass, or hammerhead cyclists who
tend to have bulgy thighs that dwarf their lean torsos, or
wide-shouldered swimmers with skinny legs, these cross-training
``tri-geeks'' were both lean and proportionally muscular. Simply
put, they looked better than most of the single-sport devotees I
knew.
</P>
<P>
   The race's start was wild: 500 hyper athletes in swim suits,
goggles and bright red bathing caps thrashing over and around one
another like salmon spawning upstream. I survived the swim and
cycled competently, but when I donned my running shoes and
attempted locomotion, my thighs were so laden with lactic acid that
I ran like Frankenstein hustling to catch a bus.
</P>
<P>
   I did a few more triathlons, then stopped. The sport appealed to
me since it developed the total athlete, but training properly for
three disciplines was time-consuming. And having such a gadgety,
gear-intensive hobby would mean getting a second job (which first
would mean getting a first job). Triathlon, once the province of
southern California beach boys, had become the quintessential yuppy
sport. (In fact, a recent survey reported that the average annual
income of triathletes is $90,000.) When the $30 entry fees doubled,
I decided to sweat elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   And yet each year as I watched the assembled field of endorphin
junkies try to go the distance at the Ironman, I'd get caught up in
the hyperbolic commentary, and fantasize about doing it, at least
until the telecast was over. This summer, while running in
Brooklyn's Prospect Park with a friend who has completed two Hawaii
Ironmans and is trying to qualify for a third, I found myself
promising to join him in July at a half-ironman triathlon in
Kingston, N.Y., 90 miles north of New York City. The hilly course
in the Catskills featured a 1.2 mile-swim, a 60-mile bike ride and
a 13.1-mile run.
</P>
<P>
   This was not my most sensible idea. I'd swum six times in the
previous six months and only cycled for transportation around town.
``How often are you running?'' queried my friend, a 50-year-old
architect who trains as much as 30 hours a week. ``Twice a week,''
I answered, ``but I have been kayaking a lot!'' ``Sounds like
you're ready!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the physiological distress I experienced in my first
triathlon, a month before the race I called Troy Jacobson, a
six-time Ironman and the fourth American finisher in Hawaii in
1997. Jacobson, 29 and a former collegiate football player, coaches
more than 100 clients in 30 states and five countries via the phone
and e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We talked about my fitness background, allotted exercise time
and goals. ``To see significant changes, I like my athletes to
commit to a four-month program, but we can get you to the finish in
four weeks . . . I think,'' Jacobson said over the phone from
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, I received an e-mail with a custom-built
training schedule divided into day-by-day, sport-by-sport workouts.
``Remember,'' he said, ``let the plan guide you, not control you.''
</P>
<P>
   In normal life one rarely goes for a run right after a long bike
ride, much less a ride and swim. Jacobson's regime was intended to
condition you to do just that. During the week, I usually did two
of the three sports for about two hours in total. For example, on
Wednesday I'd do a 90-minute bike ride, take a 5-minute rest (five
minutes more than in an actual triathlon) and go for a 30-minute
run, a workout created to teach my legs to run with fatigue.
Thursday might include a swim in the morning and a two-hour bike
ride in the evening. Saturdays, the toughest day on the schedule, I
tried to do all three sports. Mercifully, Monday was a day off.
</P>
<P>
   At 7 a.m., on what was already becoming a hot July Saturday,
about 300 people stood on the rocky banks of the placid Hudson
River for the start of the Second Annual Hudson Valley Triathlon.
Waiting anxiously for the gun to sound, I remembered what Jacobson
had told me two days earlier. ``Experience the distance and be
conservative throughout the race,'' he cautioned. ``This is a
super-challenging event on a difficult course. When you feel like
you're overextending yourself, back off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobson, a 6-foot 170-pounder who has about as much body
fat as a greyhound, also told me to stay focused: ``You want to
reach a level of intensity where your mind says slow down and the
body doesn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Having logged virtually no pool time prior to the race, I
started slowly and never sped up until I rounded the orange turn
buoy and realized that we'd been bucking a stiff current. When I
hit the beach running, the clock said I'd been in the water for 51
minutes, 16 minutes behind the lead swimmer in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Donning a helmet, cycling shorts and shoes, along with a bike
jersey loaded with packets of carbohydrate gel, I took to the road
to begin the longest leg of the race. To me, cycling is the most
enjoyable of the three sports. Passing slower riders, feeling the
jolt of energy when another cyclist comes whirring by, charging the
hills and pedaling hard down the other side at speeds of 30 and 40
miles an hour, I experienced the same thrill I felt riding my bike
when I was a child.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles into the scenic ride, however, my rear sought a
lounge chair and my thighs a masseuse. All I could do was distract
myself, which I did by chatting with an Australian rugby player
turned New York City hair stylist. We averaged 19.7 miles an hour
and roughly three topics of conversation every 10 miles, covering
the 60 miles in 3 hours 2 minutes, 36 minutes slower than the
fastest rider.
</P>
<P>
   Hurrying into my running shoes, I left the transition area side
by side with the hair stylist, both of us looking decidedly
uncoifed. Considering that I'd just spent three hours on a bike, my
legs felt relatively fine, but heading up a nasty hill I had a side
stitch that sent pain through my gut with each step. Two miles into
the run, my companion said, ``No worries, mate!'' and pulled away,
leaving me to continue grimly on.
</P>
<P>
   At the six-mile mark I did what I hate to do in a race: I
walked, albeit for only 30 seconds. Plodding up the short, steep
hills was the worst. Over the last three miles I reminded myself
that the pain, while intense, stops virtually the moment you cross
the finish line. Managing pain is a part of endurance sports,
perhaps even the point.
</P>
<P>
   I completed the half-marathon in 1 hour 47 minutes _ 11 minutes
slower than the overall winner _ and crossed the line in 5 hours 48
minutes: 103rd out of the approximately 300 who started.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I hobbled around, eating bagels and drinking water
nonstop as a steady stream of competitors rounded the final turn.
One fellow I talked to sounded chagrined even though he finished in
the top 30. ``It was emotionally traumatizing,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Another chap, who'd placed 76th overall, was beaming. The secret
to his success, he said, was eating raw chopped beef and eggs:
``It's given me the strength and endurance to train and race
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   My architect friend _ who finished four minutes behind me _ met
me near a bowl of sliced oranges, and we discussed what we often
talk about: training, pain and the meaning of it all. When a lean
72-year-old man in a flowered bathing suit crossed the line, we
stopped to applaud. He'd been out there for just over seven hours.
``When you finish the Ironman in Hawaii, you've come close to
realizing your potential,'' said my weary architect friend. ``You
don't often get to do that in everyday life.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Nature is hinting that cool days are approaching
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cool mornings have given us delusions that summer is wearing
down and fall is imminent. I have my grandchildren to keep me
posted about school opening, but I look elsewhere for word on the
end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   As one who brags about Atlanta's weather because it is
constantly changing, I won't be reluctant to see some evidences of
fall. We already have it in those horticultural earlybirds, the
sourwoods. Little bushes on road banks turned red and gold when I
wasn't looking, and the big sourwood trees are laden with
end-of-summer panicles of bloom. (I hope the bees have noticed and
are stocking up for that best of all honeys, the glorious white
gold sourwood.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are summer delights that we all hate to give up. The
hot weather, hated by one and all, at least gave us something to
talk about, and when the rains started, city people were as
relieved and happy as if they had country gardens and fields to
worry about. I saw a woman on a MARTA train who said aloud to her
accompanying daughters, ``Thank God for thunder and lightning.''
</P>
<P>
   A summer thunderstorm, breaking the heat, can be welcome to some
of us. My mother, a fearless woman where most things were
concerned, rated thunder and lightning with snakes, and fled both
when she could. I remember that she hung quilts over the windows,
pulled the switch that controlled electricity in our house, got in
bed, and covered up head and ears. I kind of enjoy the
pyrotechnics, especially if accompanied by rain.
</P>
<P>
   The other morning I was having coffee on my back porch, when I
heard a scratching on the roof. Cats? Birds? Squirrels? It was the
first tentative fingers of a fine, lusty rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   In no time at all, the scratching had turned to a musical drum
beat and a trickle of icy water descended on my head. I began
pushing chairs around and moving cushions, but it was pointless. A
rainstorm knows my tin roof leaks and makes the most of it, dousing
everything. I don't mind. Sitting on a damp chair with your feet in
a puddle is very cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all food is to be found at all seasons nowadays, but
I think it appropriate to eat watermelons in summer only. And
blackberry pies ... ah, a summertime specialty. There's another
one, not known to legions of unlucky people _ mayhaw jelly. A
genius named Estella Brown, who lives in Quitman, sent a friend of
mine a case of her mayhaw jelly, and I lucked into a jar.
</P>
<P>
   It is the queen of jellies, made of those elegant little
apple-tasting fruits that grow in marshy places in South Georgia,
Florida and Alabama. I picked them as a child, filling my pockets
and feasting as I walked, but they are best made into jelly. Its
beautiful to look at, gleaming red gold on the pantry shelf _ if
you can put your one and only jar away that long. I keep mine on
the counter within reach when I have hot biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Figs are one of the bounties of summer. My tree, which I forgot
to prune last fall, is an ungainly, funny-branched specimen, but it
does have a few figs, smallish ones just right for jaybirds to
pick. The fat, opulent ones I remember from my childhood didn't
show this year, and I think I know why. Figs are said to be
sociable trees, which do better when they are close to the house
and can hear song and human conversation. I have been away a lot,
and putting the radio where the tree can follow the Braves' games
may not be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   A fig tree may be an opera buff instead of a Braves fan. I'll
experiment if summer will linger long enough to give me time.

 &HT;    A tasty new cookbook tours Georgia's farms and kitchens
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- t may be the first cookbook to come with its own food source.
</P>
<P>
   When you pick it up, you hear a noise you can't quite put your
finger on. It sounds dry and scratchy, like cat claws on a hardwood
floor or maybe sugar rasping around inside a packet. Opening the
spiral binding, you find the culprit: An envelope of watermelon
seeds glued to the inside back cover, alongside an invitation to
plant them in the good earth of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   What else would you expect of a cookbook from the state
Agriculture Department?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Best of Georgia Farms'' (CI Publishing, $18.95) was
inspired by the recipes that have run for years in the Farmers and
Consumers Market Bulletin, the homey newspaper that the agency
sends free every week to a quarter of a million Georgians. But the
322-page book is more than a statewide recipe swap. It has history,
personality profiles, literary excerpts, itineraries for food tours
like Apple Alley, the Peach Blossom Trail and the rice plantation
ruins of the coast. All that, and half a dozen varieties of seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make it participatory: Tour it, grow it, cook it,
eat it,'' says Fred Brown, a native Georgian who co-wrote the book
for the state with Sherri M.L. Smith. (The two recently
collaborated on another beautiful volume, ``The Riverkeeper's Guide
to the Chattahoochee.'') Brown, a longtime guidebook publisher,
caught the agriculture department's eye with a cookbook he did for
the Dillard House restaurant in Rabun County.
</P>
<P>
   The idea this time was to reconnect Georgians with their farming
past and present, the authors explain over a lunch of collards,
black-eyed peas and sweet potatoes at the Atlanta State Farmers
Market. It's easy to overlook, amid the asphalt sprawl of the
capital city, but agriculture remains Georgia's largest industry,
even if relatively few people still live on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   At Cagle's Dairy in Holly Springs, one of the many places the
authors visited, the city children who go for tours sometimes don't
even know where milk comes from, Brown says. ``They think it comes
from the supermarket.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, then, is remedial education for a state increasingly
dominated by its urban islands. Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   -- Classified ads from seven decades of the Market Bulletin
appear in the margins, telling the story of Georgia's changing
agriculture. One 1934 ad has the ominous headline: ``Kudzu Plants
Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Georgia's recent governors are represented with recipes from
Lester Maddox's skillet-fried chicken to Jimmy Carter's microwave
peanuts. The former president reminisces about his boyhood on the
farm, including his favorite chore (pruning watermelon vines) and
least favorite (''mopping'' cotton to kill boll weevils with
arsenic dripped from rag mops). He also contributed a sketch
showing the layout of the Carter farmstead, down to the three-hole
outhouse.
</P>
<P>
   -- Columbus artist Garry Pound illustrated the book with line
drawings of people, places and livestock that appear in color on
fold-out pages, like post cards for the palate.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch finished, the authors head out into the market stalls to
deliver a book to one of Pound's most colorful subjects. Virginia
Debard, a melon-shaped woman who's been selling produce here for
almost 30 years, examines the likeness, grins and pronounces it
``about as big as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown opens the book to another illustration that shows Debard's
stall with a sign touting ``white dirt, $1'' next to the Vidalia
onions. She's fresh out of it today, but she usually stocks plastic
bags of chalky white kaolin from Washington County. In keeping with
market regulations, she tells customers that it has many uses as a
pigment or stomach settler but is not, strictly speaking, a food.
``They still walk away eating it like ice cream,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that while ``Georgia Farms'' encourages
people to get reacquainted with the soil, it does not have any
recipes that call for dirt. The seeds, of course, are another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some favorites recipes from the book.

</P>
<P>
   Sawdust Pie
</P>
<P>
   Makes 8 servings Preparation time: 15 minutes Cooking time:

</P>
<P>
   Would this seem as interesting if it were called Pecan Meringue
Pie? We think not. Two Bulletin readers, Etta Gore of Walthourville
and Trilba Cordell of Wildwood, sent the recipe in about the same
time 3 1/2 years ago. The name? The pie looks like sawdust when
it's baked.

 &HT;    Book: Single woman are finding out that they do not need a man
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ours is a culture steeped in romance. From bodice-ripper novels
to bridal magazines, from kissing couples on the silver screen to
fairy tales that end ``they lived happily ever after,'' the message
is that it's preferable to be a twosome.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, however, is that an increasing number of women are
ending up like Scarlett O'Hara in the closing scene of ``Gone With
the Wind'': Without Rhett. And frankly, my dear, some of them don't
always give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   As Marcelle Clements recognizes in her new book, ``The
Improvised Woman: Single Women Reinventing Single Life'' (Norton,
$26.95), the numbers of single women over 18 in this country are on
the rise: from 38 million in 1990 to nearly 43 million now. Of
those, close to half have never married, and more than 11 million
each are widowed and divorced.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of women (almost 59 million) are married, but,
Clements writes, for every three married women in America two are
single. (Though her study did not cover single men, U.S. Census
Bureau figures show their numbers have risen from 31 million in
1990 to 36 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes about single women abound. They have been seen as
man-hungry spinsters, predatory divorcees, or lovelorn working
women who, as Clements puts it, would ``go out looking for Mr.
Right and come home with Mr. Goodbar.''
</P>
<P>
   Clements, however, senses ``that the desperate single belongs to
the past.'' In seven years of interviews conducted with a
``mosaic'' of more than 100 single women _ identified by first name
and last initial _ she found that many choose the single life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only that there are fewer single men than women, or
that the more educated or prosperous a woman is, the less likely
she is to marry or remarry. Gen-Xers like Ally McBeal want a career
first, divorced women may find they are happier alone or are too
busy raising kids to date, and older women often value their
independence. Like Valentine J., a 94-year-old widow, told
Clements: ``if a woman meets someone and she's older _ 60, say _ I
think she should have an affair. Not tie herself down to
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Some unattached women, to quote Daphne Merkin in a recent New
Yorker article about Clements' book and the popular novel ``Bridget
Jones's Diary'', may have ``a primal female fear of ending up
manless and alone.'' But most of Clements' subjects were more
ambivalent about the solitary life. Some day their prince may come.
Or he may not.
</P>
<P>
   Clements, 50 and single, discovered she preferred living alone
to going through another nasty breakup after she ended a long
relationship. Like many of her subjects, she didn't rule men out of
her life, but she wasn't looking either.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, critic and essayist noticed similar attitudes
among friends and decided to write a book. ``The Improvised Woman''
details her findings and comments from women about romance, family,
home, money, careers and old age, and touches on a spectrum of
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Billiana M. remarks that ``I was lonely in my marriage, and I
would prefer to be lonely alone.'' Many worry about financial
security in old age or ending up as bag ladies. For some, sexual
encounters have become regretfully rarer over time.
</P>
<P>
   Clements' most tantalizing conclusions have to do with politics
and the economy. ``The change in the status and psyche of single
women from Cosmo icon to powerful sociocultural player is one of
the most significant trends of the end of the American century,''
she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still fixated on the fact that women earn only 70
percent of what men do,'' she says. But that's often enough to
attract advertisers. Single women travel and buy jewelry, stereos
and cars, and nearly 54 percent who live alone own their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she admits that ``single women have no collective sense
of being a pivotal social force'' and characterize their decisions
as personal. That may be because their lives and needs are so
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Frey, a University of Michigan demographer, agrees
that the single-women factor is important in advertising, but
believes that marketers will want to differentiate.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of public attention, he says, has been focused on the
young single once represented by Mary Tyler Moore, and now by Ally
McBeal, with disposable income and lavish tastes. But with baby
boomers growing older, and women having greater life expectancies
than men, ``this older group will be an increasing force for
marketers, advertisers and politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, lonely singles may find little consolation in being
powerful sociocultural players and agree with Clements' married
friends who called the topic ``such a sad story.'' To be sure,
there's ambivalence among the women themselves. ``How would I feel
if Anna turned out to be single?'' muses the divorced Felicia C.
about her 11-year-old daughter. ``Sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clements found a buoyancy in her subjects and ``a sense of
hope and adventure even among the women who were scared.''
</P>
<P>
   And most seemed generally satisfied with their solitude.
Billiana M., noting that ``sometimes we're on the light side, and
sometimes we're on the dark side,'' admits remarriage is possible.
``But it would have to offer me something that's far better than
this,'' she says, ``and this is so damn good.''

BRONX MUSEUM: ONE MUSEUM, FIVE SHOWS AND A MILLION LIVES AND
PASSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bronx Museum of the Arts is one of the city's
more animated and resilient cultural spaces. A quick subway ride
from Manhattan, it stands on the Grand Concourse, surrounded by Art
Deco apartment buildings whose imposing facades are reminders of
days when the neighborhood was upscale and middle-class.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. The residents are now mostly working-class,
and though once white, are now black, Latino and Asian-American,
members of New York's fastest growing ethnic populations. And
because the Bronx Museum's exhibitions reflect its constituency,
this institution is an important player in shaping New York art of
both the present and the future.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's activities can be sampled in two separate venues
this summer. Four concurrent exhibitions are filling every
available corner of its Bronx headquarters. And in Manhattan, a
selection from its permanent collection is on view in the lobby
galleries of the PaineWebber building on the Avenue of the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the work in the PaineWebber show, which has been
organized by Marysol Nieves, consists of prints and photographs
gathered in loose thematic categories. A section devoted to
portraiture, for example, suggests the staggering variety that the
genre encompasses, from Byron Kim's abstract work using
flesh-colored makeup to Tseng Kwong Chi's photograph of himself in
a Mao suit at Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Images dealing with the interrelated ideas of labor and
servitude are equally diverse. They include Luis Jimenez's social
realist print of a Latino steelworker, Lynne Yamamoto's
hand-inscribed vellum scroll commemorating her Japanese
grandmother's life as a laundress in Hawaii, and a large-scale
woodcut by Willie Cole that transforms the shape of an ironing
board into a diagram of a slave ship.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show, such conceptual points are delivered with
persuasive understatement, whether in works by artists who show
regularly in Manhattan galleries (Glenn Ligon, Lorna Simpson,
Alison Saar, Carrie Mae Weems) and by others who do not.
</P>
<P>
   One of the outstanding entries is Ester Hernandez's ``Offering''
(1988), a silk-screen of the Virgin of Guadalupe tattooed on a
woman's back. Another is Dihn Q. Le's collage of Buddha heads,
Netherlandish Pietas and self-portraits, pieced together in a
mosaiclike grid of cutup photographs and tape.
</P>
<P>
   Works by Pacita Abad, Antonio Frasconi, Gerardo Suter, Kuozhong
Lee, Alberto Rey, Elizabeth Rodriguez, Carlota Espinoza and
Benjamin Varela round out a polished group. And nothing combines
formal beauty and ideological passion more seamlessly than a
hand-colored lithograph by Juan Sanchez in which the luminous face
of the Puerto Rican freedom fighter Pedro Albizu Campos is set
among spiraling Taino pictographs and Roman Catholic emblems of the
Sacred Heart.
</P>
<P>
   An installation by Sanchez, ``1898: Rican/Struction,
Multilayered Impressions,'' is on view at the Bronx Museum itself.
Lamenting colonial intrusion and fervently calling for national
self-determination for Puerto Rico, the piece includes paintings
and texts, videos and slide projections, with a continuous
soundtrack of recited poetry, television news reports and the sound
of weeping.
</P>
<P>
   All these elements run together with a kind of all-or-nothing
urgency, and if the separate strands are hard to unravel, that's
part of Sanchez's point.
</P>
<P>
   Two ambitious mid-career surveys can be found in larger
galleries. One, organized by Lydia Yee, is a selection of work by
Tomie Arai, a New York-born artist of Chinese and Japanese descent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Ms. Arai, then a member of the Asian-American art
collective known as the Basement Workshop, directed community mural
projects in Chinatown; in the mid-80s she shifted to printmaking, a
medium that has, like murals, traditionally dealt with topical
subjects and had a potential for widespread popular visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable color silk-screens in the show incorporate
portraits of the artist's family and friends as well as archival
pictures of other Asian-Americans. Ms. Arai often places the
figures against a gridlike map of Chinatown and surrounds them with
a constellation of culturally loaded images, from decorative gift
paper and eating utensils to examples of racial stereotypes drawn
from the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   The results are examinations, at once archival and critical, of
precious and embattled lives that often go unchronicled. And the
same recording impulse lies behind the show's most recent piece, a
room-filling installation, the result of Ms. Arai's work with the
Museum of Chinese in the Americas in Manhattan on an oral history
project.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Double Happiness,'' a Chinese idiom for marriage, it
consists of tables and chairs arranged for a Chinese wedding
banquet. Silk-screened portraits of the invited sitter appear on
the back of the chairs, along with their own comments on their
bicultural lives.
</P>
<P>
   The words speak more often of discontinuity and isolation than
of the bliss of bonding, but here, as in all of Ms. Arai's work,
mixed messages are delivered with a slow-acting formal grace.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On view in an adjoining gallery is a mid-career showcase of the
Uruguayan-born artist Rimer Cardillo, 54, including prints,
assemblages and large-scale installations. Like that of Ms. Arai,
his art is essentially about preservation and loss. But where her
concerns are predominantly urban and communal, his center on nature
and on the precarious status of indigenous species and cultures in
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   His hand-tooled boxlike constructions holding specimens of
butterflies and bits of wood look like elaborate reliquaries. And
the show's largest piece, ``Cupi IV,'' is a huge cone of dirt
sitting in the center of the gallery and studded with the terra
cotta casts of dead animals he found either while traveling in
South America or near his present home in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the larger installations in the show are overly
complicated, and lose coherence and impact. But when Cardillo
concentrates on a single, resonant image _ the photograph of a sea
turtle brought to market by Indians to be sold for food, the
sculptural form of an Aztec fertility goddess projected in
silk-screen on the museum's lobby windows _ the results are
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Installed in the basement gallery is the 18th annual ``Artists
in the Marketplace'' exhibition, always worth catching. The 36
artists, all of whom participated in a program of career-oriented
seminars at the museum during the last year, are a cosmopolitan
group, hailing from, among other places, Brazil, Cambodia, Finland,
Indonesia, Japan and Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Most are young, but they aren't exactly wet behind the ears.
Their work is sophisticated, carefully thought through and fully
aware (a trifle too aware in some cases) of current art trends.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, the art this year is compact in format,
personal and low-key in tenor. There is lots of photography of all
kinds, from portraits (Katharina Bosse, Anthony Goicolea, Caroline
Hastie) to still lifes (Alyshia Galvez's moving pictures of her
dead father's possessions and Ana Kariotakis' tiny, weird shots of
a lifelike doll), from abstract (Amy M. Bay) to setup (Suzy Kim) to
quasi-documentary (Khiang Han Hei, Daniel Mirer, Joseph Songco).
</P>
<P>
   And there are artists who are stretching the medium in all kinds
of directions and whose work is most accurately described as
photo-derived. Stephen Sollins, Francesco Simeti, Eiko Kijima, Amy
Eckert, Terry E. Boddie and Heidi I. Nash-Siedlecki are among them.
</P>
<P>
   In painting, Nicole Awai's images are big, bright and political,
but much of the other work is abstract, including mixed-media
pieces by Bushra Chaudry, Colleen Ho (a towering collage of paint
and doilies), Derek Weiler and Sonita Singwi (her beautiful little
paintings of brushy tracery are among the best things in the show).
And drawing takes a bow in Matthew Deleget's radiating Op-artish
abstractions and Daniel Feingold's smudgy, erased forms on a soiled
white ground.
</P>
<P>
   Sculpture this year favors similarly delicate, tentative
effects, with a distinct emphasis on craft techniques and domestic
images. This is most obvious in the crocheted pieces by Hildur
Bjarnadottir and Nancy Friedemann. But it is also true of the
little cushions of stitched organza by Leigh Winter; in the
organic, fruit-and-veggie forms of Beth Cora Lipman and Miggy Buck,
and in Elia Alba's twisting curtain of blood-red cloth shut in a
wire cage.
</P>
<P>
   Even installation, often reserved for big statements, speaks
with a quiet, often witty voice, particularly in Jennifer Krauss'
neat-as-a-pin upholstered sofa ensconced inside a Hotpoint
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Patton, Melissa Potter, Nadine Robinson and Brad
Rothrock all have things of varying interest to say in this genre.
And a piece by Xiomara De Oliver is a standout, not for its host of
filament-suspended, charred dolls, but for the accompanying, and
really arresting, collage-style poetry, which could easily take on
a life of its own.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lively, often accomplished selection, much of it more
than just promising. It is worth noting that several of the
prominent artists included in the PaineWebber exhibition _ Kim,
Ligon, Ms. Yamamoto _ as well as Ms. Arai, are Artists in the
Marketplace graduates. Their young and future peers are being
similarly nurtured at the Bronx Museum today, making this
institution a regular, mandatory stop on any art lover's
itinerary. &QL;

CAR COLLECTING: AT TOP SHOWS, AS GOOD AS NEW ISN'T NEARLY GOOD

   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Columnist Ellen Goodman once wrote that
some contestants in the Miss America Pageant owed their beauty not
to their Maker, but to their remaker: Miss Florida's nose came
courtesy of her surgeon. So did Miss Alaska's. Miss Oregon's
breasts came from silicone.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the stunning automobiles that win top honors at
high-profile collector shows _ like the Pebble Beach Concours
d'Elegance here Sunday _ owe their beauty not so much to the
companies that manufactured them, but to the well-heeled collectors
who have had the cars essentially remanufactured. Most of the cars
have been restored not to their original factory condition, but to
a level of perfection considerably above that. They are far better
than they were when new.
</P>
<P>
   This overrestoration of vintage cars is no secret. It has been
done for years, and since the 1970s it has virtually become a
requirement for car owners intent on winning trophies. Concours
judging has become a serious matter as the value of collector cars
has risen in the last two decades. But overrestoration is a
peculiarly American practice, since Europeans readily accept cars
that show the wear of regular use.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to define ``restoration,'' as the term is applied to
vintage automobiles, though it may include the refinishing of a
car's body and chassis, the rebuilding of any or all mechnical
parts and the refurbishing of the interior. Overrestoration is even
more difficult to pin down.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Heumann, who has served for decades as co-chairman of
the Pebble Beach Concours, acknowledges that concours-level cars
are overrestored today. He suggests that the trend began around
1975, in large part because of a rivalry between two prominent
collectors, J.B. Nethercutt, a cosmetics executive, and the late
Bill Harrah, who built the Harrah's casino company.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Harrah owned one of the world's largest collections
of vintage cars, some 1,400, many of which were publicly displayed
in Nevada. Nethercutt, the chairman of Merle Norman Cosmetics, also
owned (and still owns) one of the world's finest and most valuable
car collections, including the ``20 Grand'' Duesenberg. (Its name
derived from the considerable sum it cost when new in 1933.) Since
both employed staffs of full-time restorers and personally oversaw
the restoration work, they vied to outdo each other on the judging
field. This led to restoring cars to an ideal _ ``perfection,''
Heumann calls it _ rather than to authentic, original condition.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, restorers tried to bring cars back to the condition
they were in when they left the factory. In the cases of
custom-bodied Duesenbergs, Pierce-Arrows and 16-cylinder Cadillacs,
few people really knew what the original condition was like, so
Harrah and Nethercutt could go to extremes without raising
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   But in seeking cosmetic and sometimes mechanical perfection, the
two rivals set the standard for all auto restorations. Professional
restorers who did not meet or beat Harrah's gold-star standards
were unlikely to win trophies. And as time went on, the standards
moved higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Heumann points out that in the close-knit community of old-car
aficionados, competition is driven by an inseparable mix of money
and ego. Winning not only makes a car more valuable, but gives the
owner _ and his restoration shop _ bragging rights and an edge in
future competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Ema, a restorer and historian of Duesenbergs, Cords and
Auburns in Orange, Calif., said, ``If we were to take a brand-new
classic off the showroom floor'' and judge it in a concours, ``we
would probably give it between 85 and 90 points today.'' With
restoration standards as moving targets, cars that received 100
points in judging 10 years ago might get 95 points today.
</P>
<P>
   Overrestoration is fairly easy to spot. Carl Steig, the national
head judge of the Classic Car Club of America, said that flawlessly
painted or powder-coated frames and axles were now nearly
universal. Stamping and draw marks on mechanical components are
filled in and hidden under a mirror-like finish. Frames and axles
were not that well finished at the factory, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other common examples of overrestoration include smooth,
polished engine blocks that originally had textured surfaces and
minor flaws as a result of being cast in sand. Nuts and water
jackets are often chrome-plated, and wood screws are turned so that
the slots in the screw heads line up perfectly. The seams and
piping of upholstery are perfectly straight. Modern acrylic
urethane paints and clear-coat finishes give a smoother, wetter,
more plastic look than the varnishes and nitro-cellulose lacquers
of yesteryear, which are not now widely used because of
environmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Moser, chairman of the master judging committee of the Model
A Ford Club of America, said it was often easier to overrestore a
car than to bring it back to showroom condition. That is because it
is harder to find out how the car actually looked when it left the
factory than to simply make every detail as perfect as humanly
possible. Not only is good, honest research hard work, but an
authentic restoration, as opposed to an idealized one, might not be
as impressive to the car's owner or the concours judge.
</P>
<P>
   Several national clubs have established classes for original
automobiles _ that is, cars that have not been restored or have
perhaps been restored minimally. The Porsche Club of America and
the Ferrari Club of America now have preservation classes for
original cars. In these, cars with faded paint or slightly tatty
upholstery are judged separately from those with all-out
restorations. The problem, though, is that it is often difficult to
tell what is original, what was restored years ago and what the
owner has touched up recently.
</P>
<P>
   Although most major concours and car clubs do not deduct points
for overrestoration, the Model A Ford Club of America does. That
club has amassed a huge body of photos and other materials that
show what Fords looked like during and just after assembly. Paint
runs were common. Tacking strips used for attaching soft pieces
like fabric tops sometimes contained bent tacks.
</P>
<P>
   And when Ford upholsterers sewed 1,000 sets of seats a day,
seams went every which way. So at least with Model A's, the cars
that are judged closest to perfect are those that fall far short of
perfection, as the club's hefty book of judging standards spells
out.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, deducting points for overrestorations is rare.
Several years ago, a collector discovered an unrestored Duesenberg
Model J with its engine compartment untouched and totally original.
Suddenly, everyone realized just how overrestored most Duesenberg
engines had become. But the time and money had already been
invested in these beautiful classics, so there was little chance
that the clock could be turned back and standards would be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   It is that momentum _ that resistance to back-pedaling _ that
keeps restoration standards chugging ever upward. And the most
idealized restoration usually does win.

 &HT;    CDC survey: ``We are seeing too many kids at risk,''
 &HT;    By J. Matthew Aldag
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- More American teenagers are smoking marijuana - and
at a younger age - than just two years ago, according to a new
youth survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, nearly one in five say they have carried a weapon,
driven a vehicle after drinking and considered suicide, the
national survey found.
</P>
<P>
   While most findings released Thursday differed little from a
similar survey conducted two years ago, health experts said the
survey highlights concerns about the incidence of teen automobile
deaths, suicides, tobacco and drug use, as well as dangerous sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing too many kids at risk,'' said Laura Kann, chief
of the Surveillance Research Section for the CDC. ``Too many kids
practice behaviors that place them at risk for unnecessary
mortality and morbidity,''
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings of the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance,
which surveyed more than 16,000 U.S. high school students about
their activities in the past 30 days:
</P>
<P>
   -- 50 percent said they had at least one alcoholic drink, and 33
percent had five or more. Black students were significantly less
likely to report consuming alcohol, while alcohol use increased
with age in all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   -- 17 percent said they had driven after drinking, and 36
percent had been driven by a person who had been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   -- 36 percent reported smoking at least one cigarette, and 16
percent reported smoking on at least 20 of those 30 days. 70
percent reported trying cigarettes, even ``a puff or two.'' White
students were found to be more likely to smoke than blacks or
Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   -- 18 percent said they had carried a weapon such as a gun,
knife or club. Males were more likely than female to carry weapons.
Hispanics and blacks were more likely than whites to carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Surveyers, who asked teens at 151 schools nationwide to fill out
confidential questionnaires, also queried students about their
activities in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   It found that during the past 12 months, one in five teens said
they had seriously considered committing suicide, while 15 percent
reported coming up with a specific plan. Female students were
almost twice as likely to say they had contemplated suicide. In
addition, the CDC survey found 37 percent reporting being in a
physical fight, with the highest incidence among males, Hispanics
and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   -- 48 percent of all students said they had had sex; 16 percent
had four or more partners; and 7 percent had lost their virginity
by age 13. About 43 percent of sexually active teens reported not
using a condom the last time they had sex.
</P>
<P>
   -- 27 percent of students said they felt overweight, and nearly
40 percent were currently trying to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   -- 19 percent admitted to rarely or never wearing a seat belt.

HOPING TO STEM LOSSES, AU BON PAIN TO SPLIT, SELL CAFE CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Au Bon Pain Co. plans to split into two companies and
sell its Au Bon Pain chain of 263 cafes to a New York investment
firm for about $78 million.
</P>
<P>
   The move would allow the publicly traded company to focus on its
fast-growing suburban division, whose cafes operate under the names
St. Louis Bread and Panera Bread. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On completion of the transaction, the company- owned restaurants
and franchise business that go by the Au Bon Pain name would be
sold to Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &AMP; Co., a private investment
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the St. Louis Bread division to continue to
operate as a publicly traded company under the leadership of
co-chairman and chief executive Ron Shaich, who said he will unveil
a new name for the company at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Au Bon Pain cafes tend to be located in densely crowded urban
business disticts; they are designed to rapidly serve sandwiches
and baked goods to customers pressed for time. Many of the cafes
see a big falloff in business on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired in 1993, St. Louis Bread is a seven-day-a-week
operation aimed at suburbanites. With a similar but slightly
pricier menu than Au Bon Pain, the St. Louis Bread chain, with
shops in the Northeast and Midwest, strives for an atmosphere that
encourages customers to linger.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Louis Bread has shown great potential for rapid
growth, sales at Au Bon Pain cafes have been ``stagnant,'' said Kim
Galle, an analyst with Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shaich, both Au Bon Pain restaurants and St. Louis
Bread will benefit from the proposed sale.
</P>
<P>
   Under its new owner, Au Bon Pain restaurants will get capital
for the extensive remodeling needed to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   And as a stand-alone company no longer overshadowed by Au Bon
Pain, St. Louis Bread's ``extraordinary growth story will be
exposed to investors,'' Shaich said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive development,'' Galle said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaich said cash from the sale will be used to pay down the
publicly traded company's debt of about $55 million and rapidly
expand the St. Louis Bread division.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, franchisees have committed to open
about 450 of these stores, Shaich said; by the end of the year,
there should be 129 stores in the St. Louis Bread division.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Given Au Bon Pain's problems, it was unlikely that there were
many interested buyers, Galle said. Under the circumstances, $78
million seemed to be a reasonable price, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaich's company said it expects to record a loss of about $20
million on completing the transaction in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking St. Louis Bread away from Au Bon Pain will end a
17-year partnership between Shaich and his co-chairman Louis Kane.
</P>
<P>
   Kane will join the company that Bruckmann, Rosser plans to form
to run the Au Bon Pain restaurant division.
</P>
<P>
   Of his parting with Kane, Shaich said: ``This isn't a
personality story at all. We love each other. We're sad to do this.
But we think this is the best strategy to allow two very different
businesses in very different places in their growth cycles to
really fulfill their destinies.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly a morning business when it first opened in the early
1980s, Au Bon Pain later expanded its menu to include lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a sandwich shop now,'' said Ron Paul, president of
Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Because of intense competition, Paul added, ``It's very
difficult to make money in the sandwich business.''
</P>
<P>
   There are fewer players in the niche occupied by St. Louis
Bread, though that may soon change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Bruckmann, Rosser was not returned. According to
published reports, the firm owns large interests in the California
Pizza chain and a medical equipment company.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Au Bon Pain reported that it lost $779,381 in the
second quarter on revenues of $53.9 million. For the same quarter a
year ago, Au Bon Pain lost $165,605 on revenues of $54.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Nasdaq, shares of Au Bon Pain closed at 8 3/8, down 3/8.

   MARKET-SMALLSTOCKS-NYT (Undated) _ While the stocks of large
companies like Coca-Cola and Philip Morris have been battered for

   MUTFUND-FIDELITY-PERFORM-NYT (Undated) _ In the space of two

crow to having something to crow about. For the year ended June 30,
Fidelity's United States equity funds, weighted by asset size, were
the top performers among the industry's 10 biggest fund companies,
according to Kanon Bloch Carre, a fund consulting firm in Boston.

<P>
   PERSONAL-WEALTH-HEDGE-FUNDS-BLOOM (New York) _ With 1.1 million
millionaires created in the U.S. by this decade's bull market,
there are a lot more people interested in hedge funds. Hedge funds

<P>
   RATES-CONSUMERS-NYT (Undated) _ One side effect of the financial
crisis in Asia is incredibly low interest rates for American
consumers. Because of the region's malaise, demand for computers
and their components and a variety of other products is dwindling,
putting downward pressure on the earnings of many U.S. companies.

GEOCITIES AGREES TO FTC STRICTURES ON INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an effort to protect the privacy of Internet users, the
Federal Trade Commission has approved a consent decree with the
Internet-hosting company GeoCities. The decree settles an FTC
complaint alleging that GeoCities misused personal information
obtained from the company's two million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``GeoCities misled its customers, both children and adults, by
not telling the truth about how it was using their personal
information,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection. But GeoCities denies any wrongdoing, and
the decree does not constitute an admission of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC action comes two days after GeoCities went public on the
Nasdaq stock exchange. Shares of GeoCities fell $7 to $38 1/2
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   GeoCities is based in Santa Monica, Calif. The company runs an
Internet ``community'' where members create their own Web sites in
``neighborhoods'' shared by members with similar interests.
</P>
<P>
   CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover, Mass. owns 31 percent
of GeoCities. Guy Bradley, a partner in CMG's Internet investment
unit, said that the company had been caught up in the growing
controversy over the use of personal information gathered from the
Internet. ``Basically, GeoCities wasn't doing anything wrong, but
the FTC was looking around for somebody to make an example of,''
said Bradley. ``It feels a little like a storm in a tea cup.''
</P>
<P>
   CMG invests in several leading Internet companies, such as Lycos
Inc., an Internet search service used daily by millions of people.
Bradley said that CMG's control over these firms' privacy policies
varied by the size of CMG's investment in the companies. But, he
added, ``in all the companies I'm involved with, we try to avoid
doing anything which results in personal information being given
out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not how the FTC saw things. GeoCities collects personal
information about people who sign up for Web sites. According to
the FTC, GeoCities broke a pledge to share the information only
with advertisers selected by the member. In addition, GeoCities
provided outside marketing firms with such information as members'
marital status and education, though the company had promised that
such information would be released only with a customer's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also charged that GeoCities set up a children's Internet
club, which collected personal information about children. The
agency says that GeoCities concealed its ownership of the club, and
the fact that it was compiling information about the children who
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, GeoCities will promise not to engage in
these practices. In addition, the company will post a privacy
policy statement telling how it uses the information it collects.
GeoCities will also have to get parental consent before requesting
information from a child. The company will delete its database of
information about children, and give adults the option of having
their information deleted as well.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, praised the FTC action. But Rotenberg did not
think the agency went far enough, because GeoCities is free to sell
information about users, as long as users are notified.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg favors federal legislation limiting the corporate use
of information gathered at Web sites. Otherwise, said Rotenberg,
``You're going to have to read each privacy policy at each Web site
to decide whether or not it works for you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HILTON HEAD, S.C. _ Here in the lush, sunny Palmetto State,
voters understand the local benefits that can result from the
institutional memory, political savvy and sharp elbows that come
with congressional seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits? Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Residents joke that they are blessed to be served in Washington
by living legends _ ``one is a legend; the other is living.''
</P>
<P>
   The incomparable Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond is in his eighth
term, making him the longest-serving senator in history, the oldest
person ever to serve in Congress, chairman of the powerful Armed
Services Committee and fourth in line for the presidency. Now 95,
he functions slowly these days but looks forward to turning 100 one
month before he finally retires in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest ``Fritz'' Hollings, the longest-serving junior senator in
history, is a relatively jaunty 76 after 32 years in office during
which he rose to become senior ranking Democrat on the Commerce
Committee (he was chairman until the GOP seized control of the
Senate.) He is up for re-election this fall and is generally
considered one of the four most vulnerable Democratic incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters report that the race between five-term Hollings and
three-term GOP Rep. Bob Inglis is tight, with Hollings dependent on
a strong black voter turnout because Inglis leads Hollings among
white voters. Inglis is making an aggressive pitch for black
voters, but they were still 78 percent for Hollings in an
independent May poll.
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey of a dozen participants at a recent South
Carolina Association of Counties conference here, however, suggests
that Hollings' seniority and long record of constituent service
will ultimately carry the day for him.
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed unanimously predicted he would win, although
several said they were Republicans who would not vote for him.
Unlike Thurmond, who switched parties in 1964, Hollings has
remained a conservative Democrat even though South Carolina has
increasingly become a Republican bastion.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the county officials were reflecting a national mood that
seems disinclined to upset any political boats this year. Maybe
they simply like Hollings, whose conduct and voting record they
have observed up close for three decades. Maybe they are so
accustomed to Hollings' presence in Washington they can't imagine
any other.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, they did not indicate any feeling that Hollings has
gotten old and stale, a sentiment that would be greatly to Inglis'
advantage if it were widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Many county officials said Inglis should wait his turn and is
really running against Hollings to build statewide name
identification for a run in four years for the empty Thurmond seat.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis has a problem. He was elected to the House as a crusader
for term limits. If he wins the Senate seat and applies to himself
the automatically curtailed service he demands of others, he will
never accumulate the internal power that comes with lengthy
seniority and to which South Carolinians have become accustomed.
Inglis supports the notion that 12 years, or two terms, is the
longest that senators should be allowed to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Inglis, 38, is leaving the House after serving out a
self-imposed six-year term limit.
</P>
<P>
   Hollings has called Inglis ``totally hypocritical (because) he
campaigned last election for both term limits and Sen. Strom
Thurmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Inglis replied feebly that Thurmond deserved an exception from
the rule because he is ``really different from most long-term
incumbents.'' This difference is not readily apparent, except for
the fact that Thurmond is older.
</P>
<P>
   The term limits issue looked like a winner for Inglis when he
took it up six years ago. But it is no longer popular, even with
House Republicans, who made it part of their ``Contract with
America'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-controlled House has twice rejected a constitutional
amendment to limit members' terms. The Supreme Court has ruled that
qualifications for Congress must be uniform across the nation and
therefore can be set only by a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for term limits was based on a foolish premise that
experience automatically leads to arrogance and long incumbency
automatically leads to isolation and corruption. The rallying cry
was ``fresh thinking.'' It assumed that unseasoned legislative
judgments are necessarily the best judgments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ticking of the clock has a way of focusing the mind,''
Inglis once said. How useful this is for the national good is
questionable. What Inglis' mind focused on was how to get Hollings'
job after Inglis was forced to give up his own.
</P>
<P>
   Like many members who limited their service in advance, Inglis
was not groomed for the Senate's internal leadership structure or
assigned to the most powerful committees, where stability and
experience are important. Party leaders didn't bother with him
because he wasn't going to be around long enough to learn the
ropes. Six years are simply not enough to figure out how to make a
mark in that high-pressure, competitive environment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Inglis languished on the unpopular budget committee and
the judiciary committee, which may have its moment in the sun if
there are impeachment hearings against President Clinton but is
otherwise usually a political backwater.

AUTO INSURERS TO SEEK 15.5 PERCENT INCREASE FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Barring some last-minute change of heart, the state's
auto insurance industry is preparing to seek a 15.5 percent
increase in rates for next year.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry almost always asks for a much bigger rate
increase than it receives, the size of the request this year is a
strong signal that companies believe current rates are well below
the level needed to turn a fair profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Rinehimer, president of Premier Insurance Co. in Worcester,
said the rate needs of the past four years do not go away just
because the insurance commissioner has imposed rate cuts. ``You
have to keep going back and asking for what you need,'' he said.
Last year, the state approved an average 4 percent cut in rates
after the industry had sought an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Rinehimer said most companies have offered discounts to good
drivers and groups off of state-set rates by drawing on their
reserves. He said many companies have been forced to discount to
retain customers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, who will make his rate
recommendation to the state insurance commissioner later this year,
said he could not imagine how the industry could justify such a
large increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fight this battle every year on behalf of Massachusetts
motorists,'' he said. ``The industry comes in with a high request,
my experts examine it thoroughly, cut out the fat and come up with
a recommendation that is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Automobile Insurers Bureau declined comment on its rate
request until the official filing is made today, but industry
sources said the 15.5 percent figure has been backed by the
actuarial committee and by the governing committee.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance commissioner will set rates in December based on
input from the industry, Harshbarger, and the State Rating Bureau,
an agency within the Division of Insurance.

QUAKER FABRICS TO BUILD NEW FALL RIVER PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHANA R. SCHOENBERGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Upholstery maker Quaker Fabrics Corp. said Thursday it would
build a new factory in its hometown of Fall River, which offered
tax incentives and other benefits to seal the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to break ground on the facility, to be located
on 25 acres Quaker purchased this week in southeast Fall River, in
nine to twelve months, president and chief executive Larry Liebenow
said. Quaker will then expand the manufacturing and distribution
center as needed over the next several years.
</P>
<P>
   Liebenow declined to disclose the purchase price of the land,
which he said is still under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   As the factory comes on line, Quaker plans to add 700 to 800
manufacturing and management jobs on the site, hiring mainly Fall
River residents, Liebenow said. The company currently employs 2,400
workers, making it the largest employer of Fall River's
38,000-member labor force, according to Mayor Edward M. Lambert Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of new jobs is good news for Fall River, a onetime
textile town now short on employers. Lambert had staked his plans
for economic revitalization on the Gay Head tribe's proposal to
operate a high-stakes bingo hall in town. Although the tribe said
the facility would generate 1,000 new jobs, the Fall River city
council rejected the project in April, saying gambling would be bad
for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Quaker needs more manufacturing space because the company, which
makes yarn and fabric for furniture, has been steadily expanding
its market share both at home and abroad. Liebenow estimates
Quaker's share of the ``jacquard'' fabric market at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes to expand further in markets such as Canada,
Mexico, and Europe, Liebenow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we can continue growing the business both here
and internationally,'' Liebenow said. ``That's why we're working on
the capacity side of it.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice Quaker to build the plant in Fall River, where it
already has 1.5 million feet of factory space, the municipal
government is currently working on a tax incentive package.
</P>
<P>
   The city also promised to spend about $750,000 on
infrastructural improvements, including roads and sewer systems,
Lambert said. State economic development officials will likely kick
in some of the money for the construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial-zoned land is currently undeveloped, Liebenow
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said the city will reap multiple benefits from the
Quaker factory, the company's sixth plant in Fall River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very significant announcement for us,'' Lambert said.
``Quaker is a very good employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Quaker's stock closed at 10 5/8, up 1/8, after earlier hitting a
52-week low of 9 3/4.

OLDER BREAST CANCER PATIENTS RELYING ON ONCOLOGISTS' WORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly all older women with breast cancer find information on
cancer care from their oncologists helpful. A sizable proportion,
meanwhile, find their primary care doctor to be among the least
informative sources on that topic, according to a new Boston study.
</P>
<P>
   That finding has implications as primary care doctors are being
asked to serve as managed-care gatekeepers and follow-up providers,
according to the researchers from Boston Medical Center, New
England Medical Center and the Everett, Mass. research firm DM-STAT
</P>
<P>
   ``As our nation moves toward models of care that increasingly
rely on primary care physicians, these front-line physicians will
need to have access to up-to-date, high-quality information
regarding cancer care appropriate for different subsets of
patients,'' say the authors in an article in the latest issue of
the journal Cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is also troubling because older women are more
likely to have long-standing relationships with their primary care
doctor _ and are thus probably more reliant on them _ than with
their oncologist, according to the study led by Dr. Rebecca A.
Silliman of the geriatrics section of Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The study, based on interviews with 300 women from the Boston
area, most of whom are white and well-educated, aims to better
describe the factors affecting older women's breast cancer care.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of breast cancers are diagnosed in women age 60
and older, but earlier studies have found that older women are at
greater risk of getting less than definitive care, compared with
younger women, according to the new study.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to assessing women's observations about the quality
of information from physicians and other sources, the researchers
looked at social factors affecting the women's emotional health and
their ability to cope with treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Paralleling findings in other studies, the report found that
women who are widowed or who have never married, or who do not have
social supports through church or other activities, may be less
emotionally equipped to deal with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians may be able to help overcome some of those obstacles
to recovery, however, through better communication with their
patients, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians may need to work harder to involve their older
patients in care decisions than their younger patients,
particularly those who have additional insecurities regarding their
own communication skills and those who lack social support,'' the
researchers write.

 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ the Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   According to a chronology contained in the agreement between
Hilton and the government, the Port Authority selected Hilton over
the Boyd Group and the Promus Corp. in January 1993. In late
January or early February of that year, Anderson met with a Hilton
official at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The official was not named by authorities Wednesday because he
was not charged, and Hill said no further proceedings were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The chronology states that the Hilton official ``thanked
Anderson for his help in obtaining the Kansas City project, told
Anderson that Hilton rewards its friend, and asked Anderson what he
personally wanted from Hilton in return for his support.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement continues, ``Anderson replied that he wanted
Hilton to fund a seminar//fashion tour to be conducted in
conjunction with the Black Expo Tour,'' a trade show in which
Anderson organized the Kansas City stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``They then agreed on a sum of $1 million to be paid by
Hilton,'' the agreement states. ``Anderson understood that his vote
had been `financially secured' by HHC (Hilton) for future
developments.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Hilton later agreed to fund a ``social/minority
grant'' for five years, at $250,000 a year. The Hilton employee
``explained to Anderson that a lump sum payment of $1 million was
not possible at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1993, the Hilton employee resigned. But ``before
leaving,'' the agreement states, ``he conveyed Hilton's commitment
to fund the seminar//fashion show to an employee of HKCC
(Hilton).'' Anderson also spoke to other Hilton officials about the
grant, the agreement states, including Hilton Hotels' president and
chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although there is no evidence that (Hilton) employees were
aware of a specific quid pro quo,'' the agreement states, ``all of
these individuals agreed to honor the commitment and accede to
Anderson's request.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilton announced the grant to Perspectives in July 1993, and
sent the check in August. Because the payment came after Anderson's
vote on awarding the casino to Hilton, Hill termed it a reward
rather than a bribe, and said Anderson ``was paid to influence his
future support as Port Authority chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said prosecutors didn't pursue individual Hilton employees
because none of them individually benefited from the arrangement
and because none of them still work for Hilton. Some of the
employees resigned after the payment became known, and others
resigned during the gaming commission hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Though no Hilton officials were charged, Hill said, ``I think
it's a fair inference that they knew what was going on. They knew
what was intended to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw, Hilton's lawyer, said Hilton officials ``had no
knowledge it was a bribe or illegal payment....We don't believe the
company is guilty of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson denied any illicit dealing at the commission's
hearing in October 1996, the casino was granted a license.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Anderson was convicted of bribing former Jackson
County Legislator James Tindall and Kansas City Councilwoman D.
Jeanne Robinson. He then decided to cooperate with investigators in
hopes of reducing his potential prison sentence of six to seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Hilton's total payment of $655,000 was not a
fine. Steve Taylor, executive director of Casino Watch, a Missouri
anti-gambling group, called Hilton's payment ``chump change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they're soft-pedaling around,'' he said. ``To
use the job issue as an excuse not to prosecute is ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the payments give ``the gambling industry a bad
name.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Hilton and the government will not have
any immediate effect on Hilton's casinos in Atlantic City, New
Jersey or New Orleans, though officials said they were still
considering action.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Furlong, spokesman for the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement, said officials in his state have been closely
following the situation in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will want to study the agreement to see if any action is
appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana gaming officials hadn't heard about the agreement
Wednesday, and weren't sure what if any effect it might have on the
Hilton casino in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly reviewing the suitability of license holders,
and this is something that could come up in a suitability
hearing,'' said Denise Bottcher, spokeswoman for the Louisiana
Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Nevada Gaming Control Board did not return a
phone call seeking comment.

ANALYSIS: RUSSIA'S CONTINUING ECONOMIC TREMORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also RUSSIA-ECON and RUSSIA-MARKETPLACE) 
(js) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ There is something about Russia's financial crises that
won't quit, no matter how much money is thrown at them, no matter
how hard the government tries to do what its creditors expect.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one month after the International Monetary Fund
promised a package of $22.6 billion in loans and credit to rescue
the ruble from the brink, a new wave of panic has set in, sending
shivers through the little that is left of Moscow's shattered
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Once again the air is filled with talk about devaluation and
default _ two options that could destroy investor confidence,
unleash a new round of inflation and rob Russia of its fragile
political stability.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Was the IMF package too little too late, as
some have argued? Have the government's revenue-raising and
belt-tightening efforts proved too feeble? Or with world markets in
turmoil and oil prices falling, was the timing of this summer's
crisis just bad luck?
</P>
<P>
   On one thing most analysts are now agreed: Faith in the current
value of the ruble, now 6.3 to the dollar and slipping, has been
shattered. Foreign investors have already fled the Russian market,
those Russians with savings are keeping them mostly in their
mattresses or abroad and now Russian banks are running out of money
to repay loans that are backed by fast-folding government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   An ill-timed and vaguely worded announcement on Wednesday night
by a deputy director of the Central Bank, limiting access of some
banks to foreign currencies, was the final straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the kind of vague statement that sets off panic,'' said
Anders Aslund, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment in
Washington. ``Hearing that, anybody with any sense would pick up
their rubles and trade them for dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   A breakdown in the banking sector in the last week was the
second shoe to drop as the government moved to tighten its fiscal
and monetary policy. Even before the summer, many banks were
running short of cash, reverting to a risky game of using
high-interest government bonds as collateral for loans from foreign
lenders. As the bonds lost value, lenders demanded more collateral,
which some banks here could not provide. The Russian bankers,
fearing a devaluation, began to buy dollars at an increasingly
frantic rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that there are a lot of banks that are hitting
the wall,'' said Tom Adshead, director of research at the
Moscow-based United Financial. ``It is all about liquidity. If I
borrow from people, I have to have enough cash on hand to pay them
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF did solve the problems with the government. What
nobody realized was that waiting behind the corner was this banking
system with terrific problems as well. It is as if they dodged the
left hook but then ran straight into the right hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Another spark to the panic was a letter by George Soros, the
international financier, who has come to Russia's aid in the past.
The letter, which was published in The Financial Times of London on
Thursday, called for a controlled devaluation of the ruble, backed
up by another injection of $15 million in aid.
</P>
<P>
   Soros, in a telephone interview from Long Island, said his
letter was a response to the quickening financial turmoil, not _ as
some in Russia suggested _ because of his own financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of selling any rubles short,'' he said,
referring to a market maneuver that would make money if the ruble
weakened further. ``The reason I wrote the letter was to issue a
wake-up call'' to major potential donors, he said. ``While the
Russian government is doing everything in its power to deal with
the situation, they can not do any more without help from abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros said the newest crisis was a result of two conflicting
problems: ``You have the budget crisis and you have the banking
crisis,'' he said. ``To deal with the budget crisis, you need very
tight fiscal and monetary policies. To deal with the banking
crisis, you need liquidity. You need a lender of last resort and in
this case, the Russian government does not have the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Soros' proposal, which he said is ``under discussion'' in
Moscow and abroad, a currency board would fix the value of the
ruble to a foreign currency and strictly limit the issuance of new
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The currency board, by providing additional funds to the
Russian government, would enable the government to meet its
obligations,'' he explained. ``It would also impose strict
discipline, which would re-establish confidence in the ruble.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts doubt whether either the government or the Central
Bank will ever relinquish control over monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin on Thursday defended
Soros' proposal. ``Devaluation is an idea which should be
considered only in a package,'' Vyugin said. `` Soros did not call
for devaluation as such.''
</P>
<P>
   So far the edge of panic on the markets has not spread to the
street, and news reports on Russian television Thursday night were
reassuring. But as the situation sours, more analysts are saying
that either a devaluation, or a freeze on new government bonds, or
both, becomes more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a devaluation is inevitable unless there is another
intervention from the West, which is unlikely,'' said Al Breach, an
economist at the Russian-European Center for Economic Policy. ``But
the problem now is capital, and you are not going to solve the
capital problem by devaluing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the IMF package, the markets were in total crisis,'' he
said. ``Then after the IMF package, investors went from being
fearful to being greedy, and wanted to get all their money out. But
you can't get blood out of a stone, and you can't run an economy
with interest rates of 50 percent.''

HILTON AGREES TO PAY $500,000 TO AVOID CRIMINAL CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM JACKMAN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The owners of the Hilton Flamingo casino
agreed Wednesday to pay the government $500,000 to avoid criminal
charges that a Hilton executive rewarded a local official for his
support for the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Hilton Hotels Corp. said the agreement was
unprecedented in its history, but was not an admission of guilt.
Nevertheless, Missouri state gaming regulators say they will review
the agreement to determine the company's suitability to operate the
Flamingo.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, two Hilton subsidiaries, Hilton Gaming Corp. and
Hilton Kansas City Corp., also agreed to pay another $155,000 as
the costs of the federal investigation and set up an internal
training program to educate employees about how to respond to
public officials seeking money.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the public official was then-Port Authority
Chairman Elbert L. Anderson. The agreement said that in 1993,
Anderson arranged for Hilton to make a $250,000 grant to K.C.
Perspectives. The company was owned by Anderson's business
associate and lover, Michelle Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   The Hilton employee who worked out the agreement with Anderson
is no longer with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors revealed Wednesday that Hilton agreed to make four
more similar payments to Lathan's company, totaling $1.25 million.
Those payments were never made, prosecutors said, because Lathan's
company collapsed amid the unrelated bribery investigation that
later snared her and Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Stephen L. Hill Jr. said the potential impact of
an indictment on Hilton employees nationwide was a major
consideration in his decision not to seek criminal charges against
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   If Hilton were convicted of criminal charges, Hill said, gaming
authorities in the states where Hilton has casinos would likely
move to shut down Hilton's casinos, throwing thousands of employees
out of work nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Missouri gaming officials said Wednesday they would
reopen hearings into Hilton's Kansas City casino. Acting Executive
Director Mel Fisher said, ``We'd certainly be interested to know
what the (federal) grand jury testimony is,'' and that the
commission would move ``as promptly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he would ask a federal judge to provide recent grand
jury testimony to the Missouri Gaming Commission. He would not say
who gave that testimony or what was said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaming officials in New Jersey and Louisiana said they would
consider reviewing the licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the center of the investigation was Anderson, who
testified twice before federal grand juries in recent weeks. After
that testimony, negotiations began in earnest between prosecutors
and Hilton's lawyers, resulting in the deal unveiled Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said another reason he agreed to the deal, rather than seek
criminal charges, was that the money paid by Hilton was
``comparable if not greater than what a court could legally impose
after a conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors termed the settlement a pre-trial diversion
agreement, in which the government agrees to defer prosecution if a
defendant abides by certain conditions. The two subsidiaries
entered into the agreement. Hill said his office had entered
similar agreements with corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton lawyer Thomas Gallagher said Hilton had never entered
such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton officials clearly were happy with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased,'' said Jean Paul Bradshaw, a local attorney
representing Hilton. ``We feel like it is a better resolution than
some sort of criminal proceedings, because we don't think that was
merited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradshaw said the Missouri Gaming Commission's declaration of
renewed hearings ``doesn't surprise us, because we've kept the
gaming commission here and in other jurisdictions aware of what was
going on. We gave them a copy of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, when the Missouri commission was deciding whether to
issue a license to the Flamingo, it conducted hearings at which
Anderson testified. He said Hilton's $250,000 payment to K.C.
Perspectives was legitimate and not intended to influence him as
head of the Port Authority. MORE

INVESTMENT CAMP GIVES YOUNGSTERS UP-CLOSE LOOK AT ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Management and labor leaders of a major car
maker squared off in Kansas City on Wednesday morning. The urgent
talks led to a last-minute contract offer that won support from
union negotiators and the roomful of workers who attended. The vote
averted a strike by 80,000 employees of Specific Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The tense session might have seemed real, except that hardly
anyone there was old enough to get a driver's license. They were
children, taking part in the Bull &AMP; Bear Investment Camp at the
Bruce R. Watkins Cultural Heritage Center.
</P>
<P>
   The camp is a weeklong clinic on the economy, business and
investing conducted by Douglas Coe, president of Moody Reid Inc., a
brokerage firm in Kansas City. Coe's camp, in its fifth summer,
includes a mock stock market, role-playing sessions like the
labor-management talks, team and individual competitions for
``Douglas dollars,'' and a camp-ending auction in which students
bid against each other with their winnings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's auction includes a Sony PlayStation, 35mm camera, AMC
movie tickets and other donated prizes. At stake are the lessons
these youngsters will need as earning, saving and spending adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned this myself but I never thought about teaching
them,'' said James Vivian, whose daughters _ Deborah, 12, and
Esther, 11 _ are attending the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's teaching methods motivate the students and let them make
decisions. Two teams each invest an imaginary $100,000 in imaginary
stocks that mirror real life companies on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Spike (as in Nike) Shoes Inc. is having trouble with threats
that basketball legend Michael Jordan, who stars in Spike
commercials, might retire. Its latest plan is to ask Tiger Woods to
endorse a high-top golf shoe with removable spikes for an
after-round game of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   CyberSoft Inc. struggles with an antitrust investigation that
might hold up release of its Doors 98 software. Million Dollar
Productions Inc. can't find peace with Will Smith and Sean
``Puffy'' Combs, the co-stars of its upcoming sequel ``Independence
Day II.''
</P>
<P>
   As these and other ``news'' stories develop through the week,
Coe reads media reports on the latest developments. Students
portraying stock analysts had been briefed the day before and tried
to help their teams guess how the stock market would react.
</P>
<P>
   Other team members, playing economists, got an update from Coe
on the likelihood the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates at
its meeting the next day as well as tips on what Fed action, or
inaction, would mean to the market.
</P>
<P>
   With each installment of news Wednesday, Coe released the
results of the previous day's market moves: Munich Mining _ whose
gold mines passed a core sample test _ doubled for the second day
in a row. CyberSoft tumbled 35 percent. Million Dollar Productions
jumped 50 percent. Spike Shoes fell 25 percent. Specific Motors
lost 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Students groaned or cheered depending on how their team had
invested the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Have no doubt that these kids are soaking up Coe's message. They
were caught up in the contract talks at Specific Motors.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, check this out. We need you all because if you lose
your jobs how would you support your families?'' said Daniel
Masterson, 15, playing the role of Specific Motors' chief operating
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Jaron Moore, 13, countered that the company didn't
care about the workers but needed them to make more money. He
emphasized the $1.7 million personal bonuses the executives had
gotten.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his fellow labor leaders asked for 45 percent of the
profits from Specific Motor's soon-to-be released electric car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty,'' gasped Jeremy Parker, 16, in character as the
company's chief executive officer and unable to even utter the
entire amount.
</P>
<P>
   Worker Brittany Dayton, 10, asked if each employee could have an
electric car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, management offered a 21 percent share of the electric
car profits for the union pension plan, a 7.4 percent raise and
higher medical benefits. Workers, following the lead of their
negotiators, accepted overwhelmingly.
</P>
<P>
   Coe had counseled each side separately and would announce the
next day the stock market's reaction to the vote. After a small
break, Coe talked to the students about international investing
then opened the Bull &AMP; Bear Market for each team to reshuffle its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, after only two days in the mock market, were up to
$178,195. The Bulls had $168,500. But the pounding in the mock
market Tuesday led both teams to protect gains rather than risk
another bad day. The Bears kept half their money out of stocks and
the Bulls _ ignoring their monicker _ kept 89 percent in cash.
</P>
<P>
   But summer's almost over, kids. The auction comes Friday and
soon it's back to school. If only someone were holding camp for the
parents....

   RELIGION-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ In a new book, author Roger
LeBlanc argues that the spread of dissent throughout the church on
issues ranging from the role of women to human sexuality is eroding
papal authority and endangering the church's future. By Diego
Ribadeneira.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ The left-leaning
Unitarian-Universalist Association, which has no creed and
proclaims that each person has a right to seek spiritual truth, is
at odds with the Boy Scouts of America, which has told the
association that it can no longer award merit-badge-style religious
emblems to Unitarian boys in Scout troops. The BSA objects to
Unitarian concerns about the Scout oath's references to God and
country. By Gustav Niebuhr.

THIS TIME, THE SAMPLE OF ALASKA WILL BE BIGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: There was a time in the last century when the lust for
gold and the willingness to risk all in hunting it drew men north
by the tens of thousands to what was then the last U.S. frontier.
</P>
<P>
   A few found their fortunes in Alaska. More found suffering and
disappointment. Many paid for the adventure with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   I have been there one time only, a dozen years ago, and that was
only for three days.
</P>
<P>
   A plane carried me in comfort up the western coast of the
continent, where mountain ranges loom up sharply and glaciers creep
down their sides to cave into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   I had a friend in Anchorage, a former journalist colleague who'd
spent more than half a lifetime in the northernmost state. And
after I'd discharged the small duty that had brought me there, he
undertook to show me a little of the place he'd come to love.
</P>
<P>
   Given Alaska's immensity, seeing only the least fraction of it
was all that time allowed.
</P>
<P>
   We took Highway 1 out of Anchorage northeast to Palmer, then
more eastward to Glennallen. The springtime weather was uncertain,
but for short periods the sky would clear and the splendor of Mount
McKinley, the loftiest North American peak, could be briefly seen.
</P>
<P>
   Near Tahneta Pass, we located through binoculars a band of white
Dall sheep in a slanting alpine meadow. And closer to the road,
perched comfortably on ledges that could not have been more than a
hand's breadth wide, were several wild goats.
</P>
<P>
   At Glennallen we changed onto Highway 4, bearing south to the
harbor at Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez is the terminus of the Alaska pipeline, carrying crude
oil from the north slope. It was from there, you will remember,
that the loaded Exxon tanker blundered onto the rocks, was holed,
and spilled much of its cargo in one of the worst environmental
catastrophes to that time.
</P>
<P>
   Our visit was before that misfortune, however, and I remember
Valdez as raw but fairly unspoiled. Small fishing vessels
shouldered up to the pier to unload their catch for processing, and
bald eagles in astounding numbers perched like crows on every post
and roof comb, waiting for scraps.
</P>
<P>
   We passed an overnight in the one motel, a minimal but clean
establishment, then retraced our route to Anchorage, and I caught
my plane.
</P>
<P>
   It had been only a sample, but enough to spark a yearning to see
more.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of Alaska five years later, at the end of a Siberian
river expedition, when, after 2,700 miles, our party reached its
destination on the Arctic coast. It occurred to me then that the
distance from there to the 50th U.S. state was only half that of
the distance back to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately ahead I finally will get to Alaska again
_ with my family this time, and for a longer stay. We'll still see
only a fraction of that remarkable place. But it will be a larger
fraction, and seen in greater depth.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a splendid time _ at the end of summer, just as the
autumn starts to turn. And I promise to make careful notes, so that
nothing of it will get away.

SETTING A CYBER-ERA EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: I've seen the face of the New Millennium Worker, and
he's a 57-year-old former Marine.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Digby Willard sent me an e-mail. Something
I wrote about teamwork pushed his button. We exchanged more notes.
I assumed he was a stereotypical Generation X-er because of his
comments on ``virtual corporations'' and ``teamwork in
cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo: Be careful about assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   This man is no X-er. He was in the worst of things in Vietnam.
Yet here's a guy with a cutting-edge workplace gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Willard, who owns Digby Willard Engineering Inc., a small,
home-based consulting firm in Roeland Park, Kan., buzzes with an
Energizer Bunny zeal to re-educate and redefine himself. The work
world is changing, and he intends to more than go with the flow. He
intends to channel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to keep the attitude of `you've got to keep
growing,' but I try,'' Willard says. ``I start by trying to
maintain a pretty high level of physical fitness. I use that as a
rationale: If I can compete with younger people physically _ and I
can _ I should be able to compete with them intellectually as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't leave the intellectual competition to chance, though.
He's working on a master's degree in engineering management (his
(BEGIN ITALS)fourth(END ITALS) master's degree). Just two years
ago, he completed his third master's, that one in mechanical
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few years he's taken business, finance and
marketing classes at Johnson County Community College and at the
University of Kansas Edwards Campus. And he's participated in the
Kauffman Foundation's entrepreneurial development program.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, he's also hired two top-notch telecommuting engineers
(both of them mothers who were eager to work part-time while they
cared for their young children at home), set up a company Web site
and started a multi-pronged marketing campaign, including the
development of a potential-client database.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people consider me intensely self-confident, arrogant,
even,'' Willard says, adding quickly, ``I need every bit of it. It
gets me through every day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not, as they say, your father's Oldsmobile. This is the
New Millennium Worker talking, if you believe the pontifications of
workplace consultants. They and Willard sound a lot alike. Here for
example, are Willard's bullet points for leading a successful team
of telecommuting workers:
</P>
<P>
   Seek out exceptionally well-qualified individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Give assistance as necessary in setting up a home office.
</P>
<P>
   Pay well for performance.
</P>
<P>
   Give complete flexibility of schedule. Results are all that
count.
</P>
<P>
   Results are all that count. That could be the title of every
other management book that hits the shelves these days.
</P>
<P>
   Willard began his engineering career in his late 30s. He started
his own business in his mid 50s. He says he's ``still just a few
weeks from running scared'' as far as income goes.
</P>
<P>
   I'd bet on his success. Talk about adapting. Talk about lifelong
learning. Talk about being cyber-savvy. Talk about any workplace
trend of the late 1990s. Then just ask Digby Willard how it's
going. He's probably given it a test drive already.

   PEPSI-BOTTLERS (Kinston, N.C.) _ Pepsico's independent bottlers
have been fighting an uphill battle against Coca-Cola Consolidated,
the second-largest Coke bottler in the United States, which can
afford big marketing campaigns and price wars in the fight over
shelf space and vending machines. Now, 12 years after Coke moved to
a centralized ``anchor bottling'' model, Pepsico is considering a
spinoff of its company-owned bottling operations, which might then
acquire independent bottlers _ which are already consolidating. By
Constance L. Hays.

that they are forging alliances of two longtime adversaries:
cattlemen and environmentalists. Together they are adapting a tool
used to preserve open space in the crowded East, land trusts, to
save the West's privately owned wide-open spaces by keeping cattle
grazing on them. By James Brooke. (Scheduled to move by 7:30 p.m.

   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ President Clinton led the nation
in a somber moment of remembrance, paying tribute to the 12
American victims of the twin embassy bombings even as the
investigation of the explosion continued.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said Thursday the first pieces of evidence from
the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam would arrive in
Washington this weekend for testing.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 mourners stood in silence at the Andrews Air Force
Base hanger as 35 pallbearers brought the five flag-draped caskets
of 10 victims out of a gray military cargo aircraft and placed them
into 10 identical black hearses.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the grief on the warm tarmac came a startling realization _
the relatives of those who died were not alone in their sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family,'' said Sharon Blake, whose cousin, Jean Rose
Dalizu, died in Kenya last week, ``really grew today.'' Dalizu's
body remained in Kenya for burial, and the body of Air Force Senior
Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds, was sent to her native Florida
Wednesday, in accordance with her family's request.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Americans were among 250 who died in the blasts last
Friday, and more than 5,000 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the family members gathered here Thursday to hear
tributes from the president, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, and Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Blake said in an
interview that she felt her family was not alone in its mourning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like someone of their family died, too,'' she said of
the speechmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In his tribute, the president spoke about each person who died,
mentioning small details about their lives. He said, for example,
that Dalizu was ``an embassy administrator who married a Kenyan and
stayed in close contact with her children back in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Harris Hamilton's family suffered a double tragedy,
when her uncle, Julian Bartley, and his son, Julian ``Jay'' Bartley
Jr., died in the bombing. ``You really had a sense that everybody
was suffering the same grief,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Ambassador to Kenya William Harrop added: ``Everyone
there, whether they were part of the State Department or not, felt
a loss.'
</P>
<P>
   Harrop, who was the first ambassador to Kenya in 1980, said
America's embracing of the victims' family members will perhaps
lead to more awareness of the dangers of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good point for the country to have that feeling of
solidarity and coming together to grieve (with) these people,'' he
said. ``Perhaps more people are understanding now that diplomacy is
a high-risk profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family members wore blue ribbons in memory of their loved
ones, and Lori Dalizu, Jean Dalizu's oldest daughter, cried as she
held a large, framed photograph of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   As a chaplain led the group in prayer, another woman clasped her
hands and shook them as she looked up to the sky as if searching
for an answer from God.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was visibly shaken as he spoke from a lecturn
between the hearses and underneath an American flag hanging from
the ceiling. He reminded the audience that those who died lived for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to honor 12 proud sons and daughters who perished half
a world away, but never left America behind, who carried with them
the love of their families, the respect of their countrymen, and
above all, the ideals for which America stands,'' he said. ``We
must honor the memory of those we mourn today by pressing the cause
of freedom and justice for which they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   He shed light on the victims' personalities with details about
their lives. Those who died, the president said, included Dalizu
and the Bartleys, ``a senior diplomat who I had the honor to meet
twice, and his son, who worked proudly alongside him this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, the president said, was an Army sargeant who
``told his own father that if anything ever happened to him, he
wanted his ashes scattered in the Pacific off Big Sur because that
was where he met his beloved wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The president promised that the United States would not let
terrorists bully America.
</P>
<P>
   ``America will not retreat from the world and all its promise,
nor shrink from our responsibility to stand against terror and with
the friends of freedom everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Nairobi will be rebuilt at another site, a senior
US official said Thursday, and other embassies will be rebuilt to
meet security regulations.
</P>
<P>
   He assured the country that the United States is determined to
punish the terrorists who caused the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for
these evil acts and see that justice is done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, the president walked with his head bowed to
stand next to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who wore a black dress and a red, white, and blue
ribbon tied into a bow, said terrorists may take lives, but not the
ideals people live for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror can turn life to death, laughter to tears and shared
hopes to sorrowful memory,'' she said. ``It can turn a building to
rubble, but it cannot change America's determination to lead or to
strive with others to build a world where there is more hope and
prosperity, freedom, and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Americans who died in the explosions were heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew the dangers of their profession, yet they risked
life and limb for us all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force band played ``America, the Beautiful'' while some
saluted and others held their hands over their hearts to watch the
trail of black hearses drive away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSTON, N.C. _ This is the capital of Pepsi country, where
babies born at regional hospitals go home with Pepsi birth
certificates, along with the state-issued ones. They grow up
playing Pepsi-sponsored Little League and develop a taste for
barbecue, hush puppies and one of the more unusual indigenous
snacks: a package of salted peanuts poured directly into a bottle
of Pepsi-Cola, to be drunk and chewed all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi signs dot the flat landscape of cornfields and tobacco
farms, now shimmering in the summer heat. Over the 63 years since
the Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise was first awarded here, per
capita consumption of Pepsi products, mostly Pepsi-Cola and
Mountain Dew, has grown to more than 400 8-ounce servings per
person, per year; in the rest of the nation, it is 270.
</P>
<P>
   But Pepsi's hold on the area is not as solid as it once was. For
three years, Pepsi's bottler in these parts, the family-owned
Minges Bottling Group, has been competing against Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. Consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   This Coca-Cola affiliate covers a 12-state swath of the South,
had sales of $802 million last year and, as a publicly traded
company in which Coca-Cola Co. holds a 30 percent stake, can afford
big marketing campaigns and price wars in the fight over shelf
space and vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like David and Goliath,'' said Jeff Minges, president of
Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. of Kinston, one of three within the Minges
Group.
</P>
<P>
   It is a problem that Pepsico Inc., No. 2 to Coca-Cola in the $50
billion domestic soft-drink business, recognizes. Twelve years
after Coke moved to a centralized ``anchor bottling'' model,
Pepsico is planning to spin off its company-owned bottling
operations. The new bottling company may then acquire small
independent bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Many small bottlers _ like the convenience stores and other
retailers they sell to _ are already consolidating: There were 180
independent Pepsi bottlers in 1987 while today there are 121,
according to Beverage Digest, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   (Wednesday, Pepsico said it had agreed to buy full ownership of
its eighth-largest bottler, Pepsi-Cola Allied Bottlers Inc. in
Latham, N.Y., a suburb of Albany. Terms were not disclosed.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more difficult, competitive environment than it
has been historically,'' said Philip Marineau, president of
Pepsi-Cola North America.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pepsi-Cola was invented 100 years ago some 30 miles to the east
of here in New Bern, where a pharmacist named Caleb Bradham
happened upon a formula that the public embraced.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Pepsi's dominance in the area can be credited to Hoyt
Minges, now 74 and taking a back seat to his sons and nephews, who
are the third generation of the family in the bottling business.
Hoyt, who started working with his father, M.O. Minges, in 1943,
won award after award from corporate headquarters for increasing
consumption, a record often helped by thirsty farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   But things began shifting after the local Coke bottler sold his
business to Coca-Cola Consolidated. This spring, a tussle erupted
between Coke and Pepsi over which soft drink company would have
exclusive pouring rights at East Carolina University, in nearby
Greenville. (Pepsi won the rights, for $7 million, but only after
corporate executives got involved.) Billboards proclaiming that
Coca-Cola and barbecue are ``perfect together'' have popped up
along the main roads, and Coke vending machines, some depicting
North Carolina lighthouses on their broad fronts, are
proliferating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this perception that eastern North Carolina is Pepsi
country,'' said Lauren Steele, a spokesman for Coca-Cola
Consolidated. ``We are out to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   At nearly every supermarket and convenience store, the windows
and aisles, and sometimes even the light poles in the parking lots,
are plastered with evidence of the struggle. A 24-pack of Pepsi at
one Piggly Wiggly supermarket in Kinston was $6.99; a 12-pack of
Coke was less than half as much, at $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Minges, Hoyt's middle son, finds the consolidation and the
subsequent clout of his Coca-Cola competitors much on his mind. He
says the deep roots that he and his relatives have in their
communities are invaluable in business dealings _ ``You know the
mayor personally'' _ and the family has tended the business
carefully, operating debt-free most of the time and competing
tirelessly against Coke and others. But it is also clear to him, as
it is to Wall Street, that large-scale, well-financed bottling
operations offer increased efficiency for customers and corporate
strategists alike.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico chairman and chief executive Roger Enrico announced last
month that the company would begin studying a spinoff of its
company-owned bottling operations. He called the move ``a critical
part of our long-term growth strategy.'' Analysts expect the
spinoff to occur by December or January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research shows this fragmented bottler network of Pepsi's
has been the key issue in terms of Pepsi's recent performance and
market share versus Coca-Cola,'' Bill Pecoriello, an analyst for
Sanford Bernstein, said. The proposed spinoff bottler ``will be the
consolidator,'' he predicted. ``Over time, these small bottlers
will sell their business to this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi is considering the spinoff at a time when Coca-Cola is
facing increased scrutiny over the way it has moved its expensive
bottling factories to its own spinoff, Coca-Cola Enterprises.
Critics such as Albert Meyer, an accountant and investment analyst,
say Coke and the bottling company are actually one entity, and for
accounting purposes should be consolidated.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets the
nation's accounting rules, is expected to release a draft of a new
rule later this year that would force companies with very close
ties to consolidate their financial statements. Although it might
be many months or even longer before such a rule took effect, a
consolidation of this kind at Coca-Cola could cut the company's
short-term earnings and could force it to reclaim billions of
dollars of debt that now resides with Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Coca-Cola declined to comment Thursday on the
accounting issues. They have said previously that Coca-Cola
Enterprises is an independent company and that their accounting is
proper. And at Pepsi-Cola, Brad Shaw, a spokesman for the company
in Somers, N.Y., said: ``The two primary forces driving our
interest in a separate bottling company have nothing to do with
accounting. Our interest is being driven by the large size and
continuing consolidation of our retail customers, as well as the
continuing consolidiaton of our competition.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While members of the Minges family, whose two other companies
are in Greenville and New Bern, say they have no plans to sell,
Jeff Minges says he expects the spinoff to mean more support from
corporate headquarters for companies like his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Pepsi-Cola will be able to focus more on the bottler
network,'' he said. ``And hopefully, they can financially support
us and put more field people in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Tyrus, manages the bottling company in New Bern,
while a cousin, Tom Minges, runs the business in Greenville.
Another cousin, John F. Minges III, who is also the family
historian, is quitting to pursue a career in the nonprofit world.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a local bottler has changed markedly from what it
was in 1943. Pepsi-Cola, which accounts for 75 percent of the
Minges Group's sales, has had recent problems with identity and
market share, both of which are eroding in the face of Coke's
aggressive marketing, especially that aimed at young people. Coke
has a 43.9 share of the domestic market, according to Beverage
Digest, while Pepsi's is 30.9.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover at the high levels of Pepsico has irritated bottlers,
who tend to prefer long, well-developed relationships with the home
office as they go about their business. They not only package soft
drinks, but also distribute them to stores, vending machines,
restaurants and other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty years ago, it was pretty much a relationship between the
route salesman and the store manager,'' Jeff Minges said. ``The
little stores, they're all gone. Those stores are what built our
business. You'd go in and buy a pack of Nabs and a Moon Pie and a
Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, it's much more complex. ``Look at all the brands
you've got, and look at all the different-sized bottles and cans,''
he said. `` But a store manager can't make a decision because it's
all dictated by a chain.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bright, a 21-year-old route salesman, works for a general
manager in New Bern who has been known to dress up as a Pepsi can
for local parades. For Bright, getting Pepsi on the shelves of the
local Target and Wal-Mart involves a delicate dance between him,
the store manager and the Coke salesman. Certain shelves might hold
Coke one week, Pepsi the next. It's up to Bright to keep an eye on
what happens, and he finds Coke increasingly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau thinks that ``there could still be small family
bottlers in the Pepsi system _ they have that entrepreneurship, and
Pepsi blue runs in their veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some changes have put fresh pressures on small bottlers.
This year, they were asked to sign a renegotiated franchise
agreement that gives Pepsico control of lucrative fountain accounts
that the bottlers used to handle. Most bottlers, including the
Minges family, have signed; about 20 are still holding out.
</P>
<P>
   As part of asserting itself in the fountain business, Pepsico
also sued Coca-Cola Co. in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in May,
accusing it of antitrust violations and unfair domination of the
food-service distribution area of the fountain business. (Coke has
moved to have the lawsuit dismissed.) Pepsi also sued one of its
bottlers, Central Investment Corp., after saying that it had
threatened to enter the first lawsuit on Coke's side.
</P>
<P>
   The company also introduced a new blue can for Pepsi-Cola this
year, expanded test markets for a lemon-lime drink called Storm,
announced a new diet drink called Pepsi One and bought the
Tropicana juice business from Seagram Co. All of these moves are
examples of innovation that, in theory, keeps consumers paying
attention to the brands.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, demand for vending machines and other cold-drink
equipment is growing as both Coke and Pepsi ratchet up their
emphasis on what are known as immediate-consumption sales, which
have some of the highest margins in the business. That could push
some smaller bottlers toward consolidation with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``In neither system is there a strategy to eliminate smaller
bottlers,'' said Beverage Digest publisher John Sicher. ``But there
is a strategy to grow the business, and the tools required to grow
the business, in some cases, will be more likely found in the hands
of a larger, consolidated bottler.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pepsi spinoff is coming half a generation after
Coke put together a similar plan with Coca-Cola Enterprises,
executives at Pepsi appear confident that their plan will work for
their products. ``I don't think we're too late,'' Marineau said.
``We can succeed in this marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the members of the Minges family, they express cautious
confidence in the reconfigured world of Pepsi. ``I'm excited about
the future,'' Tom Minges said. ``I feel better than I have in a
long time.''

   PEPSI-BOTTLERS (Kinston, N.C.) _ Pepsico's independent bottlers
have been fighting an uphill battle against Coca-Cola Consolidated,
the second-largest Coke bottler in the United States, which can
afford big marketing campaigns and price wars in the fight over
shelf space and vending machines. Now, 12 years after Coke moved to
a centralized ``anchor bottling'' model, Pepsico is considering a
spinoff of its company-owned bottling operations, which might then
acquire independent bottlers _ which are already consolidating. By

GOP-ARMY (Washington) - Military training? For U.S. congressmen?
Two Arizonans, J.D. Hayworth and Jim Kolbe, were among a group of
about seven GOP federal lawmakers who shipped out to army bases in
1995 and 1996 to learn the art of strategic thinking and
battlefield decision-making. This was the brainchild of Newt
Gingrich and the GOP leadership, and Kolbe's office, for one, says
it has helped them handle stressful situations such as dealing with
environmentalist demonstrators. But now, the Pentagon's Inspector
General's office says the Army improperly provided the services
without charging the politicians and that it was far too partisan
because no Democrats received any training. Hayworth was so
enthusiastic about the training that he took along 18 staff
members. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BISKIND-ABORTION (Phoenix) - Phoenix abortion doctor John Biskind
has his medical license revoked following the death of one patient
in his care and the near-abortion of a full-term baby while working
at an abortion clinic owned by a New York doctor. uBiskind was
facing a hearing next month to determine if the state should yank
his license, but he agreed to admit to the state's allegations and
end the matter. By SUSIE STECKNER and JODIE SNYDER. Story will move

 &QL; 
PERMITS (Undated) - After being acquitted last year for trespassing
on Mount Graham while praying for his daughters passage into
womanhood, Wendsler Nosie hoped the University of Arizona would
lighten up. Instead, the university, in an attempt to protect its
controversial telescopes, is requiring ``prayer permits,'' a policy
that Nosie and other traditional Apaches say is an attack on their
religious freedom. Nosie and 50 young Native Americans from across
Arizona will run 100 miles Saturday from the San Carlos Apache
reservation to the top of Mount Graham, to pray. And they will not
attempt to acquire permits to do so. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story will

national NRA shooting champion, is disqualified in this year's Ohio
tournament for having falsified her score. By BILL HERMANN. Story

 &QL; 
CLINTON-SOAPS (Undated) - What if the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal
actually was a plot line on a soap opera? `Sunset Beach' has
already incorporated a scheming character named Melinda Fall (as in
Linda Tripp.) One writer said she'd cast Bill Clinton immediately
because he's the kind of man who women will always forgive.
Producers and/or script writers tell us how they'd wrap up the big
plot line and what the Big Creep's fate would be. WITH

NOTARO-COLUMN (Undated) - It was my husband who saw it first.
``Hey,'' he said, leaning toward the TV. ``Isn't that your old
boyfriend?'' It's a question he asks me a lot, especially if he's
watching ``Cops`` or ``America's Most Wanted.`` ``I told you, just
because some guy on the news walks out of a trailer without a shirt
on, has a beer in his hand and is being questioned by the police
doesn't mean I've dated him,'' I shouted from the kitchen. ``I
think this is the guy who had the snakes,'' he yelled back. A thin
shiver coiled up my spine. The snakes. They belonged to my first
boyfriend, a big guy with a mohawk, since this was during the
mid-80s and boyfriends with snakes and mohawks were just part of
the deal. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PI-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Pi`` is one of the best movies I have seen
in a long time, but do not go and see it. You probably won't enjoy
it. If that is an odd endorsement, well, ``Pi`` is an odd movie. It
is a thriller about mathematics. There are no car chases, no
fireball explosions, no dinosaurs. It is about an obsessive recluse
living in a shabby apartment in New York, who spends his life

Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he

laughed when recalling his first meeting with the M's pitching

laughingstock among major-league pitching staffs, especially the
bullpen which regularly blew leads and cost Nardi Contreras his
job. But since May 1, the staff ERA is 4.48, slightly above average
in the offensive-minded American League. The slow and meticulous
climb to respectability has reached the point where bad
performances, like Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon in Toronto
where seventh-inning pitching collapses led to back-to-back losses,
are considered a glitch instead of a trend.

   UNDATED - Who could not be
</P>
<P>
   sympathetic with the plight of James Brunen?
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale, Ariz., businessman was arrested on July 23
entering Nogales, Sonora, Mexico, and has been in jail ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That's a Mexican jail, ladies and gentlemen, the very thought of
which would probably qualify for cruel and unusual punishment
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Brunen says he mistakenly left some ammunition in his car, a
transgression for which he has already spent $15,000 and the
discomfort of surviving in a rat-infested prison cell.
</P>
<P>
   His wife has been making frequent visits with bottled water,
canned food and medical supplies, bringing cash to help pay for a
bigger cell.
</P>
<P>
   `He had to buy a breath of fresh air. He had to buy protection
for his food. He had to buy the right to use a phone and the price
went up every day,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She warns American travelers to make sure they are not packing
weapons if they head south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   `It's very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes.
</P>
<P>
   While we sympathize with Brunen's plight _ and the plight of the
other Americans jailed in Sonora for violating Mexico's strict gun
laws _ the responsibility for much of their suffering rests on
their own shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   After all, signs are posted all over the place warning travelers
not to bring guns or ammunition into Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Stories of immediate and unpleasant incarceration in Mexico for
the discovery of guns have been circulating for years throughout
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take much to fathom the importance of knowing
whether your vehicle contains any ammunition or weapons when
entering Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The simple fear of ending up in a Mexican jail is sufficient
motivation for most people to exercise extreme caution when
approaching the border.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   At least by American standards, Mexico runs a crooked game and
everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   If you sit down at the poker table, you should not be surprised
to learn the odds are against you.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican police are notorious for being corrupt. That is a
regrettable fact. It is also a regrettable fact that Mexico does
not exhibit an American sensitivity for the rights of the accused _
especially those like Brunen unfortunate enough to land in their
jails.
</P>
<P>
   The 29 Americans sitting in Sonora jails for allegedly violating
Mexico's strict gun laws are reminder of what can happen if you are
charged with taking ammunition across the border. Carrying even a
single round of ammunition into Mexico can mean a jail sentence of
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   It's not fair. No argument there. But the Mexicans, after all,
do not require that Americans leave their brains on the northern
side of the border.

 &HT;    Changes bring optimism to Ole Miss
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Traditions die hard at Ole Miss, where some Rebels
fans ignored pleas from coach Tommy Tuberville last season to stop
waving Confederate flags during games. But the extent of his
commitment to reversing the fortunes of a program that hasn't
finished atop the SEC since the dark days of the civil-rights
struggle may have gained more converts.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just because Tuberville enters his fourth season
with Mississippi's first bowl game in five years, a victory over
Marshall in the Motor City Bowl, to culminate an 8-4 campaign. He
also turned down an offer worth an estimated $850,000, more than
twice his 1997 income, to assume the reins at Arkansas, his native
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from Arkansas, I would have regretted not listening,''
Tuberville said. ``But last season for us was miracle part one.
We're hoping this year, it will be miracle part two.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of 12 seniors, including unsung quarterback Stewart
Patridge and running back John Avery, drafted in the first round by
the Miami Dolphins, means Tuberville will have to continue his
overachieving reputation in Oxford. Although the Rebels are off
NCAA probation and finally restocking their roster, they will have
fewer than 70 players on full scholarship this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like we were playing iron-man football,'' senior
cornerback Gary Thigpen said about playing through the sanctions.
``It's been an uphill battle to get to the level we're at now. Now
that we're off probation, we feel like we can compete with (top
SEC)-caliber teams.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Tuberville wanted to put an end to waving the Stars
and Bars, which he thinks hinders recruiting. No Confederate flags
are pictured in the media guide, and any reference to the ``Dixie''
fight song also has been excised. However, Colonel Reb, the
venerable mascot, won't be retired anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the changes will have to be more than cosmetic.
Ole Miss returns arguably the best tight end in the country, junior
Rufus French. Sophomore Romaro Miller is set to take the reins from
Patridge, who surprised Tuberville by winning the job over the
highly touted former Parade prep All-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we had a group of seniors who wanted a bowl and
laid it on the line for us,'' he said. ``This year, we have a loss
of that leadership. It's going to be interesting to see who steps
up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller played in just three games in 1997, completing 11 of 27
passes, but he excelled in the spring game. ``We want him to get a
great start, but you don't know what will happen,'' Tuberville
said. ``Our goal is to bring him along slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Avery, who rushed for 862 yards, will be a more
sizable task. Deuce McAllister and Tony Cannion earned letters, and
they will get competition from redshirt freshman Joe Gunn.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss must replace six defensive starters, including all
three regulars at linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the new faces, however, Ole Miss doesn't figure to
be overlooked any longer. The Rebels start off at home with Memphis
and Auburn before settling into a league schedule that will take
them to Alabama and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sneaking up on anybody now,'' Thigpen said.
``Instead, they're looking out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming Saturday: Alabama

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLARK, Colo. _ In a timeless tableau, Jay Fetcher's Red Angus
cattle graze on meadows that stretch down a hidden valley here,
cupped on three sides by Federally owned forest and wilderness. But
15 miles and a few bends down the Elk River lurks Colorado's modern
resort economy in Steamboat Springs: a ski area that sells one
million lift tickets every winter, an airport with direct flights
to Chicago and Dallas, and a spreading sea of vacation
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Here and across the Rocky Mountain West, tourism and the
second-home industry have spurred a land rush that is carving up
the ranch land that composes heart-stopping Western vistas,
threatening the very landscape that draws so many people to the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The pressures are so powerful that they are forging alliances of
two longtime adversaries: cattlemen like Jay Fetcher and
environmentalists. Together they are adapting a tool long used to
preserve open space in the crowded East, land trusts, to save the
West's privately owned wide-open spaces by keeping cattle grazing
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmental groups have complained that cattle harm
fragile Western lands by overgrazing and trampling stream banks,
and have sought to limit grazing permits in national forests. But
as subdivisions and ``ranchettes'' replace cattle, the new rallying
cries are ``Cows, not Condos'' and ``Herefords, not Highways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as cows versus the environment anymore,'' said
Marty Zeller, a Denver land conservation consultant who advised
Fetcher's family on protecting their land. ``If you are going to be
realistic about saving land in the West, you have to interact with
the ranching community. In Colorado, if you look at land people
want to protect, 90 percent of that land is under agricultural
management.''
</P>
<P>
   With developers in Steamboat paying 20 times the farm value of
land, the Fetchers saved the family ranch by donating the
development rights on 1,300 acres to a land trust. In doing so,
they cut future estate taxes in half and ensured that the land will
be used in perpetuity for ranching, without opening their land to
public use.
</P>
<P>
   The experience proved so successful that Fetcher went on to form
the nation's first land trust by and for ranchers, the Colorado
Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust. The idea of ranchers donating
development rights to land trusts managed by fellow ranchers spread
like wildfire: In February, the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association endorsed conservation easements to protect agricultural
land, and in July, the California Cattlemen's Association set up
the Rangeland Trust. The land trusts are set up to administer the
easements.
</P>
<P>
   Still firmly wedded to private property rights, western ranchers
in highly coveted mountain valleys realize that new times demand
new tools to preserve open spaces and their way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and his brother paid less for this ranch than I paid
for that mower,'' said Fetcher, a soft-spoken 50-year-old, nodding
to a new piece of haying equipment. ``But, at dad's death, the IRS
would come in and say the highest and best use of our land would be
35-acre ranchettes at $7,000 an acre.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the trust, much of the land would have be
sold.
</P>
<P>
   The Fetchers donated their development rights to the land trust,
but those rights can also be sold. And some ranchers prefer to sell
their land to developers and use the profits as their retirement
nest egg.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics bear out the joke that the last crop from ranchers
approaching retirement will be a subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Colorado has been losing agricultural
land at a rate of 200,000 acres a year. Conservation easements
protect only 3 percent of the 10 million mountain acres in private
hands. Adding a critical twist, more than half of Colorado's
agricultural land is owned by ranchers and farmers who are over 55
years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see a major intergenerational transfer,'' said
Lynne Sherrod, the executive director of the Cattlemen's Trust and
a ranching neighbor of the Fetchers. ``Without estate planning, it
could really change the face of Colorado. It is really scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The change has already come to Steamboat, which in the past
decade lost its John Deere dealership, its fuel and grain
cooperative, and a supply store that sold western wear and tack for
horses as local ranchers went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the summer of 1992, ranchers predicted another blow when
Jamie Williams opened an office here of The Nature Conservancy, the
Washington-based conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear was that we would come in, buy up the valley,
take land out of production, and erode the local agricultural
community,'' recalled Williams, who worked here for five years.
``What I found very quickly was that we had a tremendous amount in
common with the ranching community. The common ground was the tidal
wave of development that was threatening.''

 &HT;    Falcons' DeBerg, 44, gets first comeback test in Detroit
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Olson was jogging around the practice fields at
Suwanee about 10:45 the other night, when a noise at midfield
stopped him in his tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Olson, an intern with the Falcons public-relations staff, heard
a shuffling sound and noticed a shadowy figure moving quickly, a
blur in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me to death,'' said Olson, who thought he was seeing
a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   It's not far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four-year-old quarterback Steve DeBerg, who has risen from
the NFL dead, was on the practice field, dropping back to pass, as
if the lights were on with 60,000 fans in the stands. He was
rehearsing for tonight, when he is expected to play three quarters
in the Falcons' exhibition game at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg, who hasn't played since 1993, is the oldest man
currently seeking employment as a player in the NFL. And he's older
than five head coaches _ Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy, Oakland's Jon
Gruden, Pittsburgh's Bill Cowher, Tennessee's Jeff Fisher and San
Francisco's Steve Mariucci.
</P>
<P>
   Most players in NFL camps are battling to prove they're good
enough to play. DeBerg is out to prove he's no fool.
</P>
<P>
   If he makes the team, he will be the second-oldest man to play
in the league. When George Blanda played for the Raiders in 1975 at
age 48, he was used mainly as a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing a lot of extra work, lifting or running, because if
I do get an opportunity to play, No. 1, I don't want to embarrass
myself, and No. 2, I don't want to get hurt,'' DeBerg said,
explaining his late-night workout. In fact, it has been a routine
for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg was drafted by Dallas in 1977, was cut and was picked up
by San Francisco. After backing up Jim Plunkett there, he became
the starter in 1978. He passed for a career-high 3,652 yards in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   After being unseated by Joe Montana, DeBerg was traded to
Denver, where he backed up John Elway under coach Dan Reeves. He
later went to Tampa Bay ('84-87), Kansas City ('88-91), Tampa Bay
('92, three games in '93), and Miami (five games in '93).
</P>
<P>
   He finished 13th in NFL history with 33,782 passing yards, 10th
in completions with 2,844 and 11th in attempts with 4,965.
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg tried coaching in 1995-96 and became an assistant with
Reeves in New York. In 1997, he was recently divorced, restless, a
little fat and out of work. So he decided to get in shape. Part of
his routine involved old quarterback drills. He lifted, ran, threw
into nets. And he started thinking about a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a letter out (in June) to quite a few NFL teams just to
let people know I'd been working out,'' he said. ``I really felt
like if anybody gave me a workout they'd be impressed with how I
threw, but I didn't know if I'd get a look. At 44, it was going to
have to be a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next day, Dan (Reeves) called, and said, 'Steve, what is
this empty envelope?' And I said it was supposed to be a letter
explaining that I'm interested in re-starting my career. I had no
idea Dan was in a predicament with his quarterback situation _ that
was pure coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was looking for a backup quarterback. Starter Chris
Chandler missed all or parts of six games last season with
injuries, and the Falcons lost them all. Tony Graziani, the backup,
had a passer rating of 3.7 in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta responded by signing veteran Mark Rypien, but the
Falcons were informed that family problems would put his career on
hold. That's when DeBerg's empty envelope arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we got to training camp, with what we had as far as
what we were willing to spend, which was nothing, there were very
few people that fell into the category (of having experience with
the Falcon offense),'' Reeves said. ``We probably would have done
nothing if it hadn't been for a scenario like Steve DeBerg...
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave him one of the longest workouts ever, and he just
threw the ball great. If a guy can do it, I don't care if he's 25
or 45.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg signed on July 6, a day before mini-camp.
</P>
<P>
   Graziani remains the backup, and DeBerg is No. 3. More
competition arrived Wednesday, when the Falcons acquired rookie
John Dutton, a sixth-round pick waived by Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game might not make or break DeBerg. He hopes the
Falcons will not be hasty with a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I can contribute more than almost any player in the
NFL as a backup quarterback who doesn't play,'' he said. ``There
may be more talented backup quarterbacks; that remains to be seen.
I know what to do, but can I actually do it? Again, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, since I signed so fast, I'm kind of rushing things.
I'm not where I want to be, where I will be. I'm actually shooting
for October. I can help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of coaches have never been under center. When you've
done it, and you can explain it in a way that is easily
understandable, I can help teach how to read defenses faster,
improve ballhandling skills, a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has incredible knowledge,'' said Chandler, 32, the NFL's
No. 2-rated passer in '97. ``He comes across very clearly. I feel
like the luckiest quarterback in the league to have him around,
except for the Kenny G and Bob Seger he plays in the morning. His
kind of stuff, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg has been eating alone, usually reading a playbook, the
financial pages in a newspaper or the living section. He seems
almost mellow. The image doesn't match his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he was arrested in New York on a DUI charge, which was
dropped. DeBerg underwent alcohol counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pretty footloose and fancy-free away from football, but
football has always been very, very serious to me,'' he said. ``I
left a bar, and I was trying to get to the Lincoln Tunnel, and I
got going the wrong way on a one-way (street), and a cop came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a beer once in a while, but I have a totally
different approach to alcohol. I love to have fun, but I learned I
don't have to be intoxicated to have fun. You can also have a lot
more fun the next day. It's about maturing and growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg marvels at how players have changed since he first came
into the league. Ephraim Salaam, the youngest Atlanta player, was
10 months old at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players then did it more for passion. The money thing has
changed it a lot,'' he said. ``When I first came into the league,
players had offseason jobs to support their football income. My
first contract in 1977 was for $18,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``NFL players have tremendous egos. Take a quarterback, any
position, really, but just take a quarterback. An organization
says, 'We'll give you $2 million.' He wants $2.5 or he says he's
going to retire. Wait a minute. You're going to retire? How does a
guy in the corporate world who works 12 hours a day, six days a
week, and makes $125,000 busting it -- understand that?''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg is laughing now, grinning so hard that his deeply tanned
face looks ready to tear, and his bright white teeth seem huge. His
sharp blue eyes are invisible behind a squint. It's obvious he is
having fun.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? As he said, the money of the modern era ain't bad.
</P>
<P>
   He negotiated a $25,000 signing bonus with Atlanta, and while
the $325,000 salary he'll earn if he makes the team is the NFL
minimum for a player with his experience, it'll pay for several
SCUBA or snow-skiing trips, maybe a little more sailing or
water-skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tease these (coaches) I was on the staff with in New York,''
DeBerg said. ``I say I got the best coaching job in the world. I'm
getting paid way more than those guys; I put in about a third of
the time, and I get to enjoy the actual performance end of it. I
got the system beat, I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as he can avoid the Lions.

 &HT;    Former democratic congressman slams Clinton, calls for his
resignation
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Former Democratic Rep. Ben Jones was the darling of
conservative talk show hosts Thursday after he penned a forceful
letter in a Capitol Hill newspaper calling on President Clinton to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who once campaigned for Clinton, said the president's
refusal to answer questions about his alleged sexual relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky has ``done a lasting
disservice to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will testify Monday, via closed-circuit television,
before a grand jury that is examining the alleged affair and
allegations that Clinton lied about it under oath and encouraged
others to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to Clinton published in the Roll Call
newspaper, Jones said if the allegations are true, as he believes
they are, there is only one way the president could repair the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the honorable thing. Step down. The nation will be
grateful,'' Jones wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction from the White House. Neal Boortz, Sean
Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, however, were only too happy to read or
quote from Jones's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Hannity interviewed Jones for his afternoon program from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-turned-congressman-turned-actor said, in a separate
interview, that he put on paper what ``an awful lot of Democrats''
are feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone in this party has to stand up and say we're better
than that,'' he said. Actually Jones, who played a spin-happy media
consultant in the movie ``Primary Colors,'' has been saying that
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of
Virginia, said he first saw Jones's letter in Roll Call's on-line
edition early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stunned me because, while he's not a significant figure,
he's the first Democratic office holder, former or current, to call
for Clinton to resign,'' Sabato said. ``It may be just a footnote
or it may be the first leak in the dike.''
</P>
<P>
   After two-terms in the House of Representatives, Jones lost a
Democratic primary in 1992, so he never served in Congress when
Clinton was in the White House. He ran a longshot campaign against
Newt Gingrich in 1994 and filed ethics charges against Gingrich
that eventually led to the speaker's reprimand by the House and
$300,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jones is without his own personal battles. He has
freely discussed his drinking problem and the battery charge filed
by one of his four former wives. ``My philosophy was, 'When on thin
ice, dance!''' he wrote in Roll Call.
</P>
<P>
   So he has some empathy with Clinton in the area of ``personal
moral excesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All that does is make him an adulterer and hypocrite,'' Jones
said. ``That's not an impeachable offense. But perjury is and
obstruction of justice is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he fears the country would be divided by impeachment
proceedings, should they occur, or be left with a ``hobbled
president with no credibility and no moral standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those prospects prompted him to suggest a third way,
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   As he told Clinton in his open letter, ``Mr. President, I have
bad news for you. The last dog has died.''

 &HT;    Refinery revived in Louisiana
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOOD HOPE, La. _ A little ways downriver from New Orleans, some
5,000 workers have been resurrecting an oil refinery that lay
dormant for 15 years. When it is complete, it will process 230,000
barrels of crude oil a day.
</P>
<P>
   To those unfamiliar with the oil industry, those facts probably
are irrelevant. But insiders are raising their eyebrows and
stepping in for a better look because this is the first major
American refinery to go on line in 20 years. As such, it represents
the largest single addition to American oil refining capacity in
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The revived refinery is a sign of the times. Not too long ago,
there was a glut of oil products on the U.S. market. Today, there
is a 2 billion barrel deficit every day in the United States,
caused by increased use of oil and gas and a decrease in the
nation's refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But refining profits are on an upswing, and demand, which lately
has been increasing about 2 percent a year, will only increase,
experts say, as long as the economy stays strong and Americans
continue to favor gas-guzzling luxury cars and sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the oil industry has reinvented itself after the
bust years of the late 1970s and 1980s, so too has TransAmerican,
which owns the facility. The refinery went bankrupt in 1983 thanks
to incredibly bad timing: The bottom fell out of the oil market
just as the company had completed a $1 billion expansion and
doubled its refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shut the plant down in 1983 and mothballed it,'' said Gary
Karr, vice president of refining. ``At that time, we didn't know
how long we'd be down. But the intent all along was to restart the
refinery.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, TransAmerican is placing itself in a niche.
The refinery will process heavy, sour crudes from overseas _ mostly
Venezuela _ into gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel and heating oil.
Heavy crudes are more complicated to handle but are more profitable
because they are cheaper to buy than the oil most American
refineries process.
</P>
<P>
   When the refinery is fully operational, it will produce more
than 200,000 barrels a day, offsetting 10 percent of the nation's
daily deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the environmental permit process has become so strict
within the last decade, there probably won't be much competition
coming on line any time soon. TransAmerican escaped that problem by
spending millions of dollars over the past 15 years keeping permits
active.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are hurdles. The refinery is in deep debt; it took
a capital investment of almost $700 million to get the refinery
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a financial point of view, there is a significant amount
of debt on the refinery, but doing business as we do gives us an
advantage,'' said Glen McGinnis, chief operating officer for
Trans-American. ``There's nobody that can take as much of the
percentage of the crude as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wall, spokesman for the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil &AMP; Gas
Association, said some of the other refining companies are
surprised by TransAmerican's move to go back on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are wondering why they would make that investment
at this time _ oil prices are fluctuating pretty wildly right
now,'' Wall said. ``It's a pretty bold step.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur ``Bud'' Tower of Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs
Inc., a New Orleans investment firm, said this move is typical of
TransAmerican's owner, Jack Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been attempting to make a go of this refinery for many
years,'' he said. ``Clearly conditions now favor opening it, as
opposed to four years ago. But I'm not sure it says anything about
where the industry is going. Is somebody else doing to build a
grass-roots refinery in the United States? I seriously doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley would not be interviewed, but McGinnis said he is well
aware that people are watching TransAmerican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our competitors started out by saying, `You're
crazy,''' he said. ``But in the last six or eight months, as we've
gotten closer to finishing, the other refineries have become
believers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company is determined to make it happen and to make it
happen on schedule. To attract and keep construction workers, who
are traditionally migrant and often stay in jobs only temporarily,
TransAmerican has been raffling off a new Dodge truck every month.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery's reopening has been a boon to St. Charles Parish,
which was devastated when it closed 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the refinery is back, and once construction is complete, it
will need some 1,000 permanent workers to keep it running.

 CLARK, Colo.: was threatening.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mrs. Sherrod, a fifth-generation Routt County rancher, recalled
that many ranchers associated conservationists with tighter Federal
restrictions on ranching, adding: ``People here have a lot of
distrust of anything environmental.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams ``spent a lot of time in kitchens drinking coffee;
people believed Jamie before they believed his ideas,'' said Mrs.
Sherrod, whose Cattlemen's Land Trust now protects 22,000 acres
around Colorado. ``I didn't want to see him come. I was just
horrified to see him go.''
</P>
<P>
   After ranchers and conservationists recognized that they shared
a desire to protect open space, they started to sell the idea
locally. In Steamboat, which largely lives off its image as a
cowboy resort town, open space defenders realized that tourists
prized ranchers more for producing scenery than for producing food.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Colorado State University surveyed summer visitors to
Steamboat. About 90 percent of the 400 people who responded said
that ranch meadows with wildflowers, birds and grazing cows and
horses added to their enjoyment of their vacation. About 80 percent
said they enjoyed looking at the local hay fields, corrals, ranch
buildings and working cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly half of them warned that if ranch land continued to
be converted into golf courses and condominiums, they would not
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of scenery far outproduces the value of the
livestock and hay,'' said C.J. Mucklow, a state agricultural
extension agent who worked on the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that vacationers would not fly from Chicago to see
condominiums, Routt County voters in 1996 approved a real estate
tax to buy development rightsfrom ranchers. To keep traditional
pastures intact, the County also adopted incentives for developers
to cluster new houses in one area of a ranch, to avoid chopping the
treeless landscape into 35-acre lots.
</P>
<P>
   With $1 million in requests for buying development rights and
ranchers vying to sell them, the County now has to carefully choose
conservation sites to avoid triggering unwanted development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called beachfront property,'' Mucklow said, using real
estate jargon for developments next to protected farmland. ``Within
one month of one easement, a real estate ad came out: `Next to land
conservation easement.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steamboat's fight for open space conservation is a microcosm of
a battle being waged across Colorado and the Rocky Mountain West.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, the land in local trusts had grown to 300,000
acres, or about 469 square miles, in 1996 from 140,000 acres, or
about 219 square miles, in 1993. And although the land trust
strategy may not completely stop the loss of agricultural land, it
is a step in the direction of preserving open space. The state's
counties and municipalities that levy taxes for buying open space
or conservation easements has jumped to 28 today, from 6 a decade
ago. This year, the land protection budget of Great Outdoors
Colorado, a state-supported trust fund, jumped to $22 million, from
$9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do in the next 10 years in Colorado is going to
determine what this state looks like 100 years from now,'' said
Will Shafroth, executive director of the fund. As some real estate
prices rise by 1 percent a month, the fund is gradually shifting
from buying land outright to joining with local groups to buy
conservation easements.
</P>
<P>
   Land trusts, long a preservation tool in New England, now are
growing fastest in the rural west. In Colorado, where the first
land trust was formed in the late 1960s, there are now 38. In
Colorado and Montana, the amount of land protected by conservation
easements has doubled in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is happening very fast,'' said John Wilson, managing
director of The Montana Land Reliance, the nation's largest local
land trust, with 300,000 acres under easement.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, preservationists are spurred by rapid population
growth. In July, state demographers forecast that Colorado's
population would increase by 38 percent, from 4 million today to
5.5 million in the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of baby boomers expected to buy retirement homes
in coming years, Colorado's mountain resort counties are expected
to grow far faster than the state as a whole. Routt County, for
example, is forecast to grow by 66 percent, from 17,860 today to
29,588 in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   According to these new forecasts, Gunnison County, home to the
Crested Butte ski area, is to grow by 40 percent; Pitkin County,
home to Aspen, by 52 percent; Eagle County, home to Vail, by 69
percent; Summit County, home to Copper, Keystone and Breckenridge,
by 79 percent; and San Miguel, home to Telluride, by 92 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't come to Colorado, Wyoming or Montana to see another
Wal-Mart,'' warned Jean Hocker, president of the Land Trust
Alliance, a Washington-based group that represents 700 of the
nation's land trusts. ``Working, well-run cattle ranches are far
preferable to land paved over for parking lots or a sea of
subdivisions.''
</P>
<P>
   With 76 percent of metropolitan Denver respondents telling a
local polling company this summer that the area is growing too
fast, ``cows, not condos'' is becoming a mainstream call.
</P>
<P>
   In June in Wyoming, radical environmentalists demanding ``no
more welfare for cowboys'' snipped barbed wire in about 150
sections where fences crossed Federal grazing lands. The region's
largest selling newspaper, The Denver Post, immediately fired back
in an editorial: ``What Wyoming eco-terrorists fail to appreciate
is that the far-ranging ranches of the Cowboy State ensure that
some Western land, at least, will be spared from strip malls.''

 &HT;    Universities ready to sow crop of biotech researchersBy Andy
Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Emory University plans to turn the former Georgia
Mental Health Institute campus into a greenhouse for young
biotechnology companies, helping them grow to maturity and, as a
result, produce multibillion-dollar dividends for the state.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-acre site will become a biotech development center on the
42-acre GMHI property, which the university is purchasing from the
state. The land deal is expected to close this month. Hiring for
the facility and some center activities could begin this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the center, which will be jointly run by Emory and
Georgia Tech, is to help nurture early-stage biotech research
companies and then nurture them into economic maturity. Project
leaders hope the center will jump-start Atlanta's sluggish biotech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Emory will pay $2.9 million for the GMHI property. Renovations
to its 17 buildings are projected to cost up to $28 million and
some new construction is likely. The biotech center's backers
estimate its impact to Georgia's economy will be $2.8 billion over
10 years, with that money coming from the creation of new jobs and
increased tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Such development ''incubators,'' for biotech and other
industries, nurture young companies with space, expertise and
services to help them grow. Georgia Tech already has one for high
tech companies, called the Advanced Technology Development Center.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech incubator will also provide funding and management
help. ``We're going several levels above what most incubators do,''
Dennis Liotta, vice president for research at Emory, and one of the
project's planners, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The center will combine Georgia Tech's technology and
engineering capabilities with Emory's biomedical expertise,
expanding the collaborative research the two institutions already
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a beautiful marriage,'' said William Todd, president
of the Georgia Research Alliance. ``Georgia Tech has engineering,
but no medicine; Emory has medicine, but no engineering. They need
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The metro area and Georgia have lagged in biotech development
despite having key ingredients, including research universities,
medical centers, the prestigious Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Research Alliance, and an entrepreneurial climate.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital is now more available here, but traditionally
has been scarce, as is commercial laboratory space. Only a handful
of biotech companies have evolved in metro Atlanta _ most small and
yet to produce any significant revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The state has received just 2 percent of all U.S. research and
development spending in biotech _ or life-sciences companies that
produce diagnostic tests, medical devices and drugs. California and
Massachusetts account for about half of that R&AMP;D spending.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, though, Cousins Properties broke ground on a lab and
office complex in Alpharetta. So far the complex has attracted
Norcross, Ga.-based AtheroGenics, which is developing treatments to
help prevent heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   The Emory-Tech center could serve as a pipeline of companies to
such a biotech park, said Emory's Liotta.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator project would give new and startup firms some
initial funding and access to about 40,000 to 50,000 square feet of
laboratory space, along with room for the operations of about 10
companies. The center would also provide a management team to help
companies with strategic planning. The center is expected to occupy
most of the 42-acre campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a lot easier for small companies to get started
without having to hire a full-time CEO,'' said Don Giddens of
Georgia Tech, chairman of the joint biomedical engineering
department of Tech and Emory. ``Faculty are not business people.''
</P>
<P>
   The biotech center, Liotta said, ''will take the (initial) high
risk, because no one else wants to.'' The center will take an
equity stake in the companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
   After the initial biotech studies are completed, Liotta said,
``we will filter out a lot of bad technologies.'' That's when
venture capitalists would come calling, attracted to the pool of
technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta hasn't been a place where venture capitalists have
stopped off and visited,'' Liotta added. ``The center will serve as
a magnet for people investing in new technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another investment opportunity would come from offering a mutual
fund of the center's biotech companies, Liotta said. ``If one of
the companies hits, you've got a good return on investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a biotech ``incubator'' is fairly common, said
industry expert Bill Reardon, of PricewaterhouseCoopers in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen have cropped up around major cities, with
varying structures and degrees of success, Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Emory-Tech proposal of a management team is positive, along
with the commitment of funding, he said. ``I've seen other
locations struggle with the model.''
</P>
<P>
   For an area to develop in biotech, it needs not only money and
research universities, but also proximity to health-care
institutions, Reardon said. ``Doctors are needed from an idea
perspective and for clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   And biotech growth tends to feed off itself, as companies'
success spurs others to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field has all the promise for the first part of the 21st
century that the information technology revolution has done for the
last part of this century,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   The center will also work with Georgia's other universities and
medical centers, along with the CDC, the American Cancer Society,
the National Arthritis Foundation and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of Emory's agreement with the state includes a clause
that Emory can't resell the property without state approval. GMHI,
which delivered short-term hospital care for people with mental
health problems, was closed in June by the state of Georgia because
of high operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Emory co-developed GMHI in the mid-1960s and conducted some
research there, as well as providing some mental-health services
there. Emory's psychiatric work is expected to continue on the
campus.
</P>
<P>
   There were no other formal bidders for the GMHI property, said
Rod Bowlden of the State Properties Commission. He cited the
legislation that authorized its sale, which restricts the campus
use to a government or educational entity.

 &HT;    Biotech future still as bright as everBy Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Biotechnology is often touted as the industry of the
future, but that future has taken its own sweet time getting here.
</P>
<P>
   In the late-1980s, the sector was seen as the next wave of
high-tech innovation, the conjunction of biology and commerce that
would spawn many hundreds of companies and create tens of thousands
of jobs _ all while radically reshaping human health.
</P>
<P>
   With the millennium nearing, biotech is like a sapling _
promising, pretty and still very small.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth is real. Biotech, like some other high-tech
industries before, has been concentrated in a few areas of the
country. What those regions tend to have in common are strong
medical facilities and universities.
</P>
<P>
   It should not be surprising then that San Francisco has the most
publicly-traded biotech companies _ 61, followed by Boston and New
England with 54 and San Diego with 33, according to Ernst &AMP; Young.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has 22 biotech companies that are nurtured and
sometimes funded or bought by the huge pharmaceutical companies
along Route 1. The Washington-Baltimore corridor has about 20
public biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, there are more recent _ and thus far, more modest
_ efforts at spurring biotech in Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and
Florida as well as Georgia. All have produced a smattering of
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, where the Research Triangle Park has vied for
status as a high-tech center, the North Carolina Biotechnology
Center was founded by the state in 1981. That center has spent much
of its energy luring biotech companies from elsewhere to either
move headquarters or do their manufacturing in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The center's $10.5 million-a-year budget comes mostly from the
government, said spokesman Barry Teater. Together with NationsBank,
the state is putting together a venture capital fund aimed at
raising $30 million for biotech firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina now has nearly 60 home-grown biotech companies,
most of them tiny, but expects its biotech sector to mushroom in
the next few years, Teater said. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people
work in biotech in the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has just a handful of biotech and biomedical companies.
However, the state has several overlapping organizations that aim
to boost that presence, including the Consortium for Plant
Biotechnology Research, the Georgia Biomedical Partnership, the
Georgia Biotechnology Center and the University of Georgia
Biotechnology Program.
</P>
<P>
   Even at its most successful, biotech is dwarfed by older
industries and can boast only a virtual handful of jobs and a faint
economic impact.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, investors have pumped a lot more money into biotech
than they have recouped. Only a few biotech companies are
profitable, and many are years away from having a product in the
market to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 140,000 people work in biotech in America, a
workforce smaller than that of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The biotech industry here includes 1,274 companies _ including
317 that have gone public, according to the Biotechnology Industry
Association. About one-third of those companies have fewer than 50
employees. About two-thirds of all biotech companies have fewer
than 135 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The association calculates that the biotech industry as a whole
lost $4.1 billion on total U.S. revenues that add up to $17.4
billion _ less than the yearly sales at BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the promise is real enough.
</P>
<P>
   Science has made such dramatic strides that biotech can
potentially apply to more than just diagnosing and treating human
illness. For example, micro-organisms can be used to remove
contaminants from soil, air and water. The genetic technology of
DNA is used to improve the yield and quality of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Cloning is probably the best-known biotech advance, but that
controversial procedure overshadows biotech treatments for anemia,
cystic fibrosis, leukemia, hemophilia and hepatitis. Some of those
are in the market, saving lives and turning profits.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some other industries with state support _ like
tourism _ biotech can boast jobs with better-than-average pay. The
average pay for a biotech job is $50,000 a year, according to the
Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech companies look for highly trained scientists to do
research. Even manufacturing in biotech requires technicians with
skills and education. But the industry is simply not
labor-intensive _ a biotech assembly line runs with only a few
helping hands.
</P>
<P>
   So a successful biotech company can sells millions of dollars of
product without the large workforce that would be needed in the old
blue-collar manufacturing jobs making textiles or cars.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the industry has been slow to develop the trend is
in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   For example, product sales in biotech last year increased 20
percent from the years before, while revenues jumped by 19 percent,
said Dan Eramian, a BIO spokesman. ``There aren't too many
industries that can claim that kind of growth.

`RETURN TO PARADISE' A RETURN TO INTELLIGENCE FOR AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN SCHOFER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - What would you be willing to do for a friend? How far
would you go? This is the question Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn
struggle with as she tries to persuade him to return to Malaysia
and save a buddy in the tense drama ``Return to Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff (Vaughn), Lewis (Joaquin Phoenix) and Tony (David
Conrad) are college graduates who meet and become friends while on
vacation. There, the three enjoy a virtual paradise of cheap women
and cheap drugs. Afterward, the men go their separate ways, but two
years later it is learned that Lewis never made it out. He has been
imprisoned on drug charges and now faces the death penalty in eight
days.
</P>
<P>
   And it is up to his attorney, Beth Eastern (Heche), to persuade
Sheriff and Tony to return to Malaysia to share a part of the
responsibility for the drug charges. If they do, Lewis' life will
be spared and each man will have to serve only three years in
prison. However, if only one of the men goes back, that one has to
serve six years.
</P>
<P>
   This, then, becomes the ethical question: Would you go back?
Would you face the horrors of a third-world prison where you might
face torture or death?
</P>
<P>
   These are complex issues, and in order for the audience to
become involved, they have to care about the characters.
Unfortunately, the film's convoluted story never fully gives the
audience that chance.
</P>
<P>
   The film's screenwriters (Bruce Robinson and Wesley Strick) must
have stolen a page right out of Screenwriting 101. The film's story
seems to be more about plot twists than character development. At
every turn, a roadblock is thrown up, until at times it becomes
difficult to see where the road is going.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when it looks as if Eastern has lost her chance to
convince Sheriff, he falls in love with her. The audience never
really sees a relationship evolve, it is simply a twist to keep
Sheriff in the story. And just when you think the love story will
move the story forward, M.J. (Jada Pinkett Smith) appears as a
reporter determined to turn Lewis' plight into a media crusade.
Other than this, M.J. has nothing to do but appear occasionally to
remind everyone that she's still there. With all the plot twists,
one begins to wonder if the filmmakers weren't paid by the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the plot contrivances (and enough cigarette smoking to
pay for a national tobacco settlement), ``Return to Paradise'' is
still a solid drama. All the actors give convincing performances in
a piece that could have very easily become melodramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Heche manage to have chemistry in spite of being
forced together by the storyline. They are the foundation that
supports the film, along with the central issue of what would you
do in this situation?
</P>
<P>
   In a summer filled with mindless action movies (with few notable
exceptions), it is refreshing to see a drama that invites the
viewer to think, to consider tough questions and even tougher
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Paradise'' is rated R for violence, strong language,
sexual situations, and brief nudity. 3 stars. &QL;

COMMENTARY: LAMENT FOR A LOST SEASON  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calendrically speaking, this is what the British used to call
the silly season. It was a time for sightings of the Loch Ness
Monster. Men stately as monuments fled Westminster for Scotland,
there to shoot small birds. Newspapers doubled their usual volume
of stories about ghost-infested houses and messages arriving from
beyond the grave.
</P>
<P>
   An annual silly season can be spiritually refreshing to a noble
Anglo-Saxon nation like ours, which also used to have one but
doesn't seem to anymore. During those pauses in the year's
tribulations, a nation's duty to improve the human race could be
put aside for a few weeks and nonsense permitted to reign.
</P>
<P>
   In America people competed to see who could sit longest on top
of a flagpole equipped with a platform wide enough to spare the
competitor the discomfort inherent in sitting on the actual top of
an actual flagpole.
</P>
<P>
   People rolling in money went to Atlantic City to see the famous
diving horse. Street carnivals blossomed in the grimmer sections of
cities. A man could board a Ferris wheel in his own block and look
down on the top of his rooming house and imagine he was Captain
Roscoe Turner flying at the Cleveland Air Races.
</P>
<P>
   People by the million went to ``the shore'' and broiled their
hides to purpled red. So ignorant of sunblock emulsions, so
uninformed about the deadly consequences of life in all possible
situations, they actually enjoyed these outings when they should
have been home bemoaning their actuarial probabilities.
</P>
<P>
   With August's onset, Americans who had fought July stifling
inside the national jacket-and-necktie uniform surrendered and
moved outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Congress shut down and fled Washington. It had to. The
Capitol wasn't air-conditioned. It's amazing how technology can
affect a congressman's sense of duty. All Washington is now so
magnificently air-conditioned that Congress never leaves, except
for a few weeks of campaigning every couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   City streets were full of people far into the night. Giving up
the struggle to sleep on damp sheets in boiling bedrooms, men and
women emerged from houses and sat on steps or porches talking
softly to the sleepless neighbors on the steps next door.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal of silliness still survives in American Augusts,
but it is having a hard time standing up to the grim, sad, pious
and solemn scowl which is the prevailing national expression.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the past 70 years the country has never had such good
reason to relax and enjoy a healthy bout of silliness as it has at
this moment.
</P>
<P>
   With money, money everywhere, we are free at last _ free at
last! _ of ancient enemies and in such glowing health that we now
live on and on and on, far beyond the age at which our ancestors
went down the valley.
</P>
<P>
   You might sensibly anticipate that a people so lucky, so blessed
with such a delightful era in which to live, might naturally treat
themselves to the kind of silliness for which August was made.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is plenty of silliness in the air, of course. For
one, there is Topic A, also known as O.J. Simpson II. But to
suggest that there's something ineffably silly about it would be to
invite the vilest kind of abuse from millions who think it more
critical to American destiny than the Battle of Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   As an institution, the silly season is probably all washed up in
America. We now have the solemn season, which runs 12 months a
year. Solemnity hates silliness as intensely as a Puritan hates a
good time.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be solemn about everything in sight these days is to
court the contempt of millions who believe that while life is
earnest, life is real, it has never been earnester or realer than
it is right now.
</P>
<P>
   There is a cost for such earnestness, such realness. Most of
what passes for comedy nowadays, for instance, couldn't produce a
snicker if terrorists blew up its supply of primitive nouns.
</P>
<P>
   In a less solemn age, Topic A would be the subject of a riotous
political comedy from Preston Sturges. Imagine Rudy Vallee as
president of the United States, and you see what possibilities to
make us laugh while seeing things clearly are now sacrificed to the
principle of all solemnity all the time.

 &HT;    Investment paying off for Georgia biotech company; more may
benefit
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A $1 million investment by venture capitalists four
years ago provided just the jump start needed to get AtheroGenics
running.
</P>
<P>
   Without it, the Norcross, Ga. biotechnology firm, which is
involved in the research and development of products to diagnose
and treat heart disease, may not exist today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not exist without venture capital,'' said Connor
Seabrook, director of finance and administration. ``When you have a
company with no product and no revenues, it's very important that
you have an investor to provide the capital.'' To date, the company
has received about $15 million in venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
   But in the future, attracting capital could become a bit easier
for firms like AtheroGenics because of the plans by Emory
University and Georgia Tech to develop a biotechnology center,
which experts say could attract more venture capital dollars to the
area. One component of the center, which will be located on
Briarcliff Road at the site of the former Georgia Mental Health
Institute, will be a incubator program designed to nurture young
business startups. In recent years, the Southeast _ particularly
Atlanta _ has shown up more on the radar screens of venture
capitalists. Part of that increase is due to the burgeoning
technology and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the venture capital money has gone into service and
telecommunications,'' said Stephen Fleming, a general partner with
Alliance Technology Ventures in Atlanta, an early investor in
AtheroGenics. ``We are beginning to see the start of a strong
community of venture_funded startups in biotechnology.''
</P>
<P>
   Alliance invested about half of its initial $35 million fund in
biotechnology firms. It plans to invest about a third of a second
$75 million fund that is still being raised in biotechnology as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But while the presence of the center is likely to catch the
attention of more venture capitalist, experts warn not to expect a
flood of money. At least not right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of developments (biotechnology) are very long term
in nature,'' said Ralph Wright, a general partner with Cardova
Capital Partners in Atlanta. ``By nature, they are are heavily
involved in the regulatory process so it's not pure science. While
the center will have a positive effect, the degree of success
remains to be seen. These things are not predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other industries, many of the drugs that biotech produces
must pass through a long pipeline. They must undergo years of
tests, perhaps starting on animals before human trials can begin.
Only then can they be vetted and approved by regulators _ and that
clearing last hurdle can take many months.
</P>
<P>
   While biotech companies have gotten increased coverage in the
media, they have received only a smattering of the billions of
venture capital dollars that have flowed into technology, service
and communications firms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance in 1997, venture capitalists invested $655 million
in biotech firms, compared with $2.7 billion in communications
companies, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tracks
quarterly venture capital investment .
</P>
<P>
   ``Relatively speaking, this is just a small part of the
technology landscape,'' said Kirk Walden, national director of the
PricewaterhouseCoopers Money Tree Survey. Developing a product and
getting FDA approval to use on humans could take as much as 15
years, Walden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A venture capitalist typically likes a horizon of not more
than five years for an exit strategy,'' he said. ``It sort of takes
a special branch of venture capital firm that can wait longer than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the center will spur interest, ``it won't catch up
to communications or software anytime soon,'' Walden said. But the
``beauty of biotech investment is that when it does pay off in a
huge way, it almost certainly is good for humanity as well as being
good for your investment.''

   BBA-MARINERS (Chicago) Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams
laughed when recalling his first meeting with the M's pitching
staff, when he told them they could finish the season with a
composite earned run average under four runs a game. ``They must
have thought I was an alien,'' Williams said. The Mariners were the
laughingstock among major-league pitching staffs, especially the
bullpen which regularly blew leads and cost Nardi Contreras his
job. But since May 1, the staff ERA is 4.48, slightly above average
in the offensive-minded American League. The slow and meticulous
climb to respectability has reached the point where bad
performances, like Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon in Toronto
where seventh-inning pitching collapses led to back-to-back losses,
are considered a glitch instead of a trend.

`PI' IS A MIND BENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - `Pi` is one of the best movies I have seen in a long
time, but do not go see it. You probably won't enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   If that is an odd endorsement, well, `Pi` is an odd movie.
</P>
<P>
   It is a thriller about mathematics. There are no car chases, no
orange fireball explosions, no dinosaurs and no hurtling comets.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it is about an obsessive recluse living in a shabby
apartment in New York City who spends his entire life trying to
discover the mathematical meaning of the world, between the
debilitating migraine attacks he suffers.
</P>
<P>
   It is an obsessive film about obsession, claustrophobic and
oneiric. These are characteristics that mean the film is not made
to enjoy on any level familiar to Hollywood studios. If enjoyment
is to be found, it must be sought on the level of aesthetics and
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At that level, the film is as exciting as any ``Terminator''
movie.
</P>
<P>
   First-time filmmaker Darren Aronofsky manages to keep us
engrossed in his quirky story in three main ways.
</P>
<P>
   First is the visual style of the film. It is shot in grainy,
high-contrast black and white with a hand-held camera. The pictures
jump around on the screen like flocks of frightened birds. There is
almost no gray in the picture: Everything is reduced to a
washed-out white or an inky black. It has the look of lack of
sleep. `Pi' is graphically one of the most adventurous films in
recent years. It almost redeems the years of MTV we have been
subjected to.
</P>
<P>
   There is something owed to the look of ``Eraserhead,'' but `Pi'
is less intestinal, more cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   Also a part of the style is the integration of music and sound
with the visuals. `Pi' is a loud, cacophonous film, and the film's
composer, Clint Mansell, or its sound designer, Brian Emrich,
deserve an Oscar for the way they manage to keep the music on the
edge of being sound effect and the sound effect on the edge of
being music.
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky's second success is in creating a very real,
believable and sympathetic main character. Max Cohen (Sean
Gullette) is not just a misfit, he is a very individualistic and
ideosyncratic misfit. No mere stereotype, he has his pique, his
softnesses, his confusions, his certainties. And most of all, he
has his migraines.
</P>
<P>
   Those who suffer the problem will sympathize painfully with Max
as he recognizes his warning signs, and the helplessness he feels
as the attacks take their inevitable course.
</P>
<P>
   It is never completely clear _ not to Max and not to us _ where
the delusions brought on by migraine end and where reality begins.
</P>
<P>
   The third successful aspect of the film is its ideas. They are
fascinating. Max believes that mathematics offers the key to
understanding the universe:
</P>
<P>
   ``One: Mathematics is the language of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two: Everything around us can be represented and understood
through numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three: If you graph the numbers of any system, patterns
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore: There are patterns everywhere in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Max's working hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   He works with various irrational numbers, primarily `Pi,` the
ratios of the ``Golden section,'' and the Fibonacci series, to
understand the organizing principle of creation.
</P>
<P>
   But as Max gets closer to discovering the mathematical basis for
reality, several other interested parties want to cash in.
Mysterious people from Wall Street want to use Max's research to
predict the stock market. And a cadre of cabalistic Jews wants to
use the research to regain the secret name of God.
</P>
<P>
   Max does not share their interest in profits or prophets, but he
finds himself uncomfortably drawn into their dual webs.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Max finds guidance and a little peacefulness
playing the Japanese game of go with an older mathematician, who
once gave up the same manic search Max is pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose scientific rigor,'' he warns Max, ``the math
just becomes numerology.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the fuzzy edge between rationality and mysticism that is
at the core of the film _ and at the core of the world it creates _
a dreamlike, raw-edged, timeless world you will not be able to get
out of your head. The film is rated ``R'' for its intensity and
some violence. 5 stars. &QL;

`STELLA' NOT STELLAR, STILL FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The first 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   of ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' are pure high-calorie,
four-star fun.
</P>
<P>
   We have Stella (Angela Bassett, Oscar-nominated for ``What's
Love Gotto Do With It``), a fabulously beautiful 40-year-old with a
glam job, an adorable son, a hilltop Bay-area house, a Calvin Klein
wardrobe, and granite abs _ the kind of woman for whom ``Vogue'' is
a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   She's in need of a break from her high-powered schedule, though,
so within minutes of the opening credits, she's off to Jamaica with
her deliciously foul-mouthed best friend, Delilah (Whoopi
Goldberg).
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing three-quarters of an hour is spent watching Stella
giggle with Delilah, bathe in the turquoise Caribbean and _ after
some requisite dodging and parrying _ make love beneath the
mosquito netting with Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs), a sculpted
medical student who cooks and has a lilting West Indian accent. In
short, he's the human equivalent of Death By Chocolate. He's also
only 20, but on Fantasy Island, that's of little concern.
</P>
<P>
   This high-gloss portion of the movie is enough of an excuse to
sit in an air-conditioned theater in August. But it scores
additional points for the way it slyly tips the Hollywood balance.
The same month that ``People'' magazine has a cover on ``older men
with younger women'' movie couples _ Harrison Ford and Anne Heche,
Robert Redford and Kristin Scott Thomas, Jack Nicholson and Helen
Hunt, Warren Beatty and Halle Berry, etc. _ ``Stella'' puts a woman
who was around for the Checkers speech with a man who can't legally
buy beer. And, when Stella and Delilah check out the boys of
Montego Bay, the camera slides over biceps and brawn with a
technique normally reserved for junior-high boys whose binoculars
are trained on the girls' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Then the rest of the movie happens, and the fantasy screeches to
a halt like a needle being dragged across an LP. A tragedy occurs
that changes the tone of the movie from hot to cold, but with no
particular purpose to the story served.
</P>
<P>
   The tone changes yet again after Stella brings her boy-man home
to San Francisco. The difference in their ages (and incomes) rears
up. They fight. They make up. They fight again. They make up again.
There's nothing in any of these displays _ which make`` Stella''
overlong at two hours _ that shows us why exactly Stella and
Winston should sustain a relationship beyond a few postcards.
</P>
<P>
   If there were, ``Stella'' (based on the book by Terry McMillan,
the former University of Arizona prof who also wrote ``Waiting to
Exhale``) would have been a much different movie: an exploration of
what an older woman and younger man have to do to hurdle the
obvious barriers.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been an interesting movie, no doubt. But the one
promised by ``Stella'''s first part had its merits, too. They were
of the double-rich-cheesecake variety, but on a marquee menu of
graying men landing nubile women without a thought to what a few
decades between them might mean, what could it have mattered, just
this once? If only ``Stella'' had stuck to its diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back'' is rated R for profanity,
nudity and adult situations. 3 stars. &QL;

 &HT;    UGA's Mitchell a 'model citizen' after earlier trouble with law
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Kawika Mitchell still remembers the long, lonely
laps on the Lake Howell High School track near Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years ago, Mitchell appeared destined to become
another statistic: a promising high school athlete wasting his
talents. But those long runs helped Mitchell steer his life back on
the right track and led him to a spot on the University of Georgia
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who was born in Honolulu _ his first name means
``David'' in Hawaiian _ and moved to Florida after his parents
separated when he was 8 years old, was expelled from Lake Howell
High as a 15-year-old freshman. By then, he already had been
arrested and made several trips through the juvenile justice system
for petty theft crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He was shunned by classmates, teammates, neighbors and coaches
and found himself ``hanging with the wrong crowd'' and his problems
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really getting in trouble,'' Mitchell said. ``I didn't
have any goals and didn't think much of the future. I wasn't
thinking about anything, really.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really fearful that I would lose him,'' Judy Wilbur,
Mitchell's mother, said from her home in Casselberry, Fla. ``I
thought it was only a matter of time before he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, a 6-foot-2, 240-pound freshman linebacker, says his
life hit bottom in 1994. After missing 34 days of school in two
nine-week periods at Lake Howell High, Mitchell was expelled after
the first semester of his freshman year. He left with an 0.6
grade-point average, after spending more time in trouble than in
the classroom. His problems included his behavior toward his fellow
classmates, which often lead to confrontations at school, as well
as more incidents involving theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any feeling for others,'' he said. ``I really
didn't care about anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I turned around, there was a telephone call to come
pick him up because he was in trouble again,'' Wilbur added.
</P>
<P>
   For the next few months, Mitchell ran on the track alone,
pondering his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was out of school, I didn't have any friends,''
Mitchell said. ``I was basically by myself. I was lonely. I
realized that I wasn't going to have any friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur, who says she nearly lost her job as a teacher's
assistant at an elementary school because of time spent looking
after her son, refused to give up on the youngest of her six
children. Neither did Mitchell's girlfriend of more than four
years, Billie McCook, or his older sister, Venus Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur attempted to enroll her son in Excel Alternative School
in nearby Sanford, Fla., which is designed to curtail dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't even accept him, because his behavior was so
bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Wilbur persuaded an admissions officer in the Winter
Park Adult Education program to accept Mitchell, even though he was
younger than the school's 16-year-old age requirement. Mitchell
took classes there for a short time, raising his GPA enough to make
a strong case for returning to Lake Howell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted him back there,'' Wilbur said. ``The coaches
didn't want him back. They didn't trust him. He had to go back
there and work through a lot of people talking about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilbur convinced Lake Howell principal Don Smith that he should
give her son a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother had come to me and asked me to take him back,''
Smith said. ``She was very sincere in that he needed a second
chance and would take advantage of it. I often hear that, but you
seldom see it. It's one of those situations where you take a chance
and hope that it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell didn't play football his sophomore year, instead
concentrating on his classwork. By his senior year, remarkably, he
had raised his GPA to 3.5. He was voted vice president of the
student government and also was a peer counselor for troubled
youths. He was named to the academic honor roll three years in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stories you like to hear about,'' said Smith, who has
worked in education for 31 years. ``But I've never seen a
turnaround to this extreme. He's a very, very good young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell returned to the Silver Hawks football squad as a junior
and blossomed into one of the state's top linebacker prospects. As
a senior, he had 110 tackles, three sacks and two blocked kicks. He
was the team's lone captain for the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going to lose the kid,'' Lake Howell coach
Mike Bisceglia said. ``A lot of the kids that start out in the
direction Kawika did don't turn their lives around. But Kawika was
conscientious enough to know that he wasn't doing the right things.
He turned out to be a model citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell received scholarship offers from Notre Dame, Alabama,
Florida and Georgia Tech. After spurning Gators coach Steve
Spurrier's invitation of an official visit to the Florida campus,
Mitchell signed with the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, he is expected to contend for playing time in a thin
Georgia linebacker corps, which lost starters Greg Bright and
Brandon Tolbert to graduation. Although he's not as heralded as
fellow freshmen Boss Bailey of Charlton County or William
Witherspoon of Panama City, Fla., Mitchell could battle for time at
outside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Mitchell says, he will concentrate on school work. He
intends to major in landscape architecture in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that a lot of kids who get trouble, people just
give up on them,'' Mitchell said. ``That's why they don't care
anymore. If there's support there for you, you can turn your life
around.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ President Clinton led the nation
in a somber moment of remembrance, paying tribute to the 12
American victims of the twin embassy bombings even as the
investigation of the explosion continued.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials said Thursday the first pieces of evidence from
the bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam would arrive in
Washington this weekend for testing.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 mourners stood in silence at the Andrews Air Force
Base hanger as 35 pallbearers brought the five flag-draped caskets
of 10 victims out of a gray military cargo aircraft and placed them
into 10 identical black hearses.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the grief on the warm tarmac came a startling realization _
the relatives of those who died were not alone in their sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family,'' said Sharon Blake, whose cousin, Jean Rose
Dalizu, died in Kenya last week, ``really grew today.'' Dalizu's
body remained in Kenya for burial, and the body of Air Force Senior
Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds, was sent to her native Florida
Wednesday, in accordance with her family's request.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Americans were among 250 who died in the blasts last
Friday, and more than 5,000 people were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the family members gathered here Thursday to hear
tributes from the president, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright, and Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Blake said in an
interview that she felt her family was not alone in its mourning.

<P>
   ``It felt like someone of their family died, too,'' she said of
the speechmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In his tribute, the president spoke about each person who died,
mentioning small details about their lives. He said, for example,
that Dalizu was ``an embassy administrator who married a Kenyan and
stayed in close contact with her children back in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Harris Hamilton's family suffered a double tragedy,
when her uncle, Julian Bartley, and his son, Julian ``Jay'' Bartley
Jr., died in the bombing. ``You really had a sense that everybody
was suffering the same grief,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Former US Ambassador to Kenya William Harrop added: ``Everyone
there, whether they were part of the State Department or not, felt
a loss.'
</P>
<P>
   Harrop, who was the first ambassador to Kenya in 1980, said
America's embracing of the victims' family members will perhaps
lead to more awareness of the dangers of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good point for the country to have that feeling of
solidarity and coming together to grieve (with) these people,'' he
said. ``Perhaps more people are understanding now that diplomacy is
a high-risk profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family members wore blue ribbons in memory of their loved
ones, and Lori Dalizu, Jean Dalizu's oldest daughter, cried as she
held a large, framed photograph of her mother.
</P>
<P>
   As a chaplain led the group in prayer, another woman clasped her
hands and shook them as she looked up to the sky as if searching
for an answer from God.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was visibly shaken as he spoke from a lecturn
between the hearses and underneath an American flag hanging from
the ceiling. He reminded the audience that those who died lived for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to honor 12 proud sons and daughters who perished half
a world away, but never left America behind, who carried with them
the love of their families, the respect of their countrymen, and
above all, the ideals for which America stands,'' he said. ``We
must honor the memory of those we mourn today by pressing the cause
of freedom and justice for which they lived.''
</P>
<P>
   He shed light on the victims' personalities with details about
their lives. Those who died, the president said, included Dalizu
and the Bartleys, ``a senior diplomat who I had the honor to meet
twice, and his son, who worked proudly alongside him this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another victim, the president said, was an Army sargeant who
``told his own father that if anything ever happened to him, he
wanted his ashes scattered in the Pacific off Big Sur because that
was where he met his beloved wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The president promised that the United States would not let
terrorists bully America.
</P>
<P>
   ``America will not retreat from the world and all its promise,
nor shrink from our responsibility to stand against terror and with
the friends of freedom everywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy in Nairobi will be rebuilt at another site, a senior
US official said Thursday, and other embassies will be rebuilt to
meet security regulations.
</P>
<P>
   He assured the country that the United States is determined to
punish the terrorists who caused the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for
these evil acts and see that justice is done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After he spoke, the president walked with his head bowed to
stand next to Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who wore a black dress and a red, white, and blue
ribbon tied into a bow, said terrorists may take lives, but not the
ideals people live for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror can turn life to death, laughter to tears and shared
hopes to sorrowful memory,'' she said. ``It can turn a building to
rubble, but it cannot change America's determination to lead or to
strive with others to build a world where there is more hope and
prosperity, freedom, and peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Americans who died in the explosions were heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew the dangers of their profession, yet they risked
life and limb for us all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force band played ``America, the Beautiful'' while some
saluted and others held their hands over their hearts to watch the
trail of black hearses drive away.

SOUTHPAWS GET THE UPPER HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY KATHY CANO-MURILLO AND KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Stick shifts. Can openers. Three-ring binders. Slanted
spatulas. Doorknobs. Chain saws.
</P>
<P>
   These are not a few of a left-hander's favorite things.
</P>
<P>
   In a right-hander's world, left-handers are left out. It may not
be enough to cause psychological problems, but frustrations mount
with such simple tasks as cutting a piece of construction paper
with a set of right-handed scissors.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly the reason for the creation of International
Lefthanders' Day, which falls on Aug.13. Started in 1976 by
Lefthanders' International, a club for lefties, the day celebrates
society's unseen minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, what a great idea!'' says lefty Stephanie Stanton, a news
reporter at Channel 3 (KTVK) in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember as a child always being singled out in art class.
Our teacher would say, `Any lefties in the room? Raise your hand so
I can find you scissors.' I didn't realize it then, but later I
started noticing I was different than most people and now I know
being left-handed has a lot to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton would rather cut off her right arm _ well, figuratively
_ than become a righty. She looks fondly at her left-handed life
and has accumulated stories to share with her grandkids someday.
Like how she thinks driving would be easier if only for a
left-handed gas pedal.
</P>
<P>
   But she has adjusted comfortably to a right-handed world, so she
really feels no need for left-handed products.
</P>
<P>
   Not all lefties feel that way.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon McGregor found right-handed products weren't handy in the
least. Today, he operates Southpaw Enterprises, a mail-order
business on the Internet that caters to the sinisters of the world
by offering dozens of left-handed gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   His aggravation goes back to his days as a telephone-wire
repairman in Canada. His biggest battle _ next to sorting colored
wires _ was using a traditional tape measure.
</P>
<P>
   He created a tape measure specially designed for southpaws, one
where the tape pulls out from the left side rather than the right.
And now telephone cables are a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything from left-handed can openers to portfolios,
but by far the tape measure is what keeps us in business
full-time,'' says Diane McGregor, Gordon's wife.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say being left-handed has kept Arizona Diamondbacks
pitcher Brian Anderson _ and a host of others _ in business full
time as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be a demand for good, left-handed
pitching,'' says Anderson, a starter. ``If you're a left-handed
pitcher and still sucking air, then you've got a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is a sport notorious for catering to righties. Because
of the configuration of the baseball diamond, lefties must choose
from among being a pitcher, a first baseman or an outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson played shortstop his senior season at high
school, he's made a name for himself racking up outs on the mound
and not in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot for lefties to play,'' says Anderson,
who also said it was difficult finding left-handed gloves as a
child in Ohio, where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   The fraternity of southpaws is small on the Diamondbacks (six on
a 25-man roster), and like all lefties, Anderson says they all seem
to have a screw loose somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all kind of goofy,'' Anderson says. ``Especially (first
baseman) Travis (Lee). He's got a serious goofy streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Anderson says he tries to be ``as right-handed as
possible,'' he is almost exclusively a southpaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I throw left-handed, I write left-handed, I eat left-handed
and I kick left-footed,'' he says. ``But I punch right-handed,
because I don't want to injure my pitching hand.'' &QL;

<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The FBI agent in charge of solving the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy here said Thursday that the bureau had found
fragments of the truck that carried the explosives, and was piecing
together a picture of what happened in the seconds before the bomb
went off.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are trying to put together a puzzle of
countless parts, plucking shards of glass and metal from the
shattered embassy, and sorting through sometimes contradictory
accounts by witnesses. They are trying to reassemble the scene at
the moment when an explosion set off by three unknown suspects, at
least one of whom may still be at large, killed at least 247
people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is developing slowly, and the initial stage of the
investigation may take a month, the bureau said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy's private security guards have given the FBI a
detailed account of what happened just after 10:30 a.m. last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guards, Benson Okuku Bwaku, met with the FBI Thursday
to help them draw a sketch of one of the suspects. He described a
man with a light beard, gray slacks and a plaid shirt. The head of
the private company employing the security guards said the embassy
had told him not to characterize the man's ethnic background, but
said he was neither white nor African.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painstaking detective work,'' including ``literally sifting
through piles of rubble,'' has yielded potentially significant
clues, said the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation,
Sheila Horan, a counterterrorism specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been successful, we think, in identifying certain
parts of the delivery vehicle,'' she said. Shattered parts of the
car were carried possibly hundreds of feet from the blast, over
terrain that FBI forensics teams have combed for the last three
days. She did not explain how the investigators knew the fragments
were from the delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   That twisted metal could help trace the car's origins and the
type of explosive used, and take the investigation a step or two
down the long road ahead, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the car,'' a senior law-enforcement official said,
describing the future course of the investigation. ``Get the VIN,''
the vehicle identification number unique to every automobile and
soldered to its body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take you somewhere,'' the official said. ``Interview
everybody. Somebody saw something. Somebody knows something.
Somebody saw someone get on an airliner. You're far, far away from
a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said that the first pieces of evidence from the scene of
the two bombings in East Africa would arrive in Washington this
weekend for forensic testing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday at FBI headquarters, senior bureau
officials said that the investigation would come down in large part
to the analysis of tiny, even microscopic bits of evidence from the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into the tedious task of looking for parts of cars,
trucks and other parts of the bombs and trying to determine what
happened,'' said Thomas Pickard, the director of the FBI's criminal
division. ``This is what the FBI does best, the painstaking
gathering of information that all comes together to make an
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI laboratory director Donald Kerr said that ``the evidence you
want most is part or closest to whatever explosive was used, and so
it's the small pieces that matter; it's the residues that matter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials said that the FBI was making extraordinary
efforts to prevent evidence from the two bomb sites from
contaminating each other; evidence gathered from the sites will be
sent to Washington on separate planes and then stored at FBI
headquarters on different floors of the building. ``We're treating
them as separate incidents so as not to inadvertently come to the
wrong conclusions,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate on the type of explosives used in the
two bombings. ``There clearly was substantial energy release'' from
the blasts, he said. ``But it could be a relatively small amount of
a high explosive or a larger amount of a mining explosive or the
like, and we don't want to speculate on that based on the effects
we observe on the ground until we can put it into a proper
context.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said that there are 215 bureau employees in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and that the scene investigation _ the
gathering of rubble at the site and hundreds of interviews _ would
continue for four more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials said they were confident that
the terrorists would be captured. Pickard said he had been at the
White House on Wednesday to discuss the investigation, and ``the
president asked me if the FBI would be as successful as we were in
Oklahoma City, and I said, `Yes, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is working in teams with the Kenyan police, who have
detained five people for questioning, said Peter Mbuvi, the deputy
commissioner of Kenya's criminal investigations department. But
U.S. officials said the five were not considered prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men detained was Anjum Javed, his family said
Thursday night. Javed is a Kenyan citizen of Pakistani descent. The
family said he had been arrested as he tried to rescue the wounded
at the site of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Javed's neighbors in Pangani, a predominately Muslim
neighborhood, said the police had been harassing residents whom the
police think look like Arabs. Nearly 40 percent of Kenya's people
are Muslims of African, Arabian or Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether one or more of the three bombers got away.
The security guards have given differing accounts as to whether the
driver and a passenger were still in the car when it exploded, said
their employer, William John Guidice, chief executive officer of
United International Investigative Services, which provides the
private security at U.S. embassies in Kenya and 12 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The guards' accounts suggest that in carrying out the bombing in
Nairobi, the terrorists may not have been as sophisticated as the
overall plot, in which they managed to set off a second powerful
bomb, nearly simultaneously, at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania more
than 300 miles away, killing 10.
</P>
<P>
   It has been assumed that the attackers in Nairobi wanted to
drive the explosives into the underground garage of the embassy.
Their initial stop at the front of the building suggests a lack of
meticulous planning, and allowed them to be seen by the guards in a
calm setting.
</P>
<P>
   Guidice said the guards had reported that the truck carrying the
explosives was a Mitsubishi Canter, a mini-pickup commonly used
around Nairobi for deliveries, and that it first drove to the gate
into the parking lot at the front of the embassy on Moi Avenue. The
driver told the guard that he had a delivery for the embassy. The
parking lot is reserved for diplomatic cars, and contrary to some
earlier reports, the car did not have diplomatic plates, so the
guards told the driver of the vehicle to go around to the back.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned back, the pickup was driven down Moi Avenue,
made a U-turn, went around a traffic circle at the intersection
with Haile Selassie Avenue, made another U-turn and approached the
back of the embassy, Guidice said.
</P>
<P>
   A car coming out of the parking lot behind the embassy
inadvertently blocked the terrorists' path.
</P>
<P>
   The security guards, who were unarmed, saw a man jump out of the
back of the pickup, quickly pull three hand grenades out of one
pocket, and take a fourth out of another, Guidice said. The man
threw one grenade past Bwaku, who fled, calling for help on a
walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 seconds later, the car exploded, realizing the worst
fears of diplomats who have served at the U.S. Embassy here in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those diplomats said Thursday that fears of a
terrorist attack and other security concerns date back a decade at
the mission, but remained unresolved by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems were known,'' one of the diplomats said. ``Anyone
can drive to that spot at the back door,'' he added, referring to
where the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   Other State Department officials said concerns mounted in the
last three years, after the attacks on U.S. military bases in Saudi
Arabia in 1995 and 1996, which showed that even U.S. outposts in
friendly nations with stricter security procedures than Kenya's
were vulnerable to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat who served here said that ``it takes a great deal of
will to get an embassy moved,'' as well as many millions of dollars
for the land, building, and security measures. He recalled
discussions about moving the embassy out of downtown Nairobi to a
leafy suburb where other foreign missions are situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not atypical of the way things work in the American
bureaucracy, unfortunately,'' he said.

Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the

   BBA-MARINERS (Chicago) Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams
laughed when recalling his first meeting with the M's pitching
staff, when he told them they could finish the season with a
composite earned run average under four runs a game. ``They must
have thought I was an alien,'' Williams said. The Mariners were the
laughingstock among major-league pitching staffs, especially the
bullpen which regularly blew leads and cost Nardi Contreras his
job. But since May 1, the staff ERA is 4.48, slightly above average
in the offensive-minded American League. The slow and meticulous
climb to respectability has reached the point where bad
performances, like Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon in Toronto
where seventh-inning pitching collapses led to back-to-back losses,
are considered a glitch instead of a trend.

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stock and bond prices plunged into free fall Thursday,
taking with them any hope of averting depletion of the government's
finances and a meltdown of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a week of ominous declines, the major blue-chip index
dropped as much as 15 percent Thursday morning before the Federal
Securities Commission stepped in and halted trading. The market
later recouped all but 6.49 percent of the loss, but the blue chips
now have lost almost a quarter of their value in seven days, and
traders said new buyers are nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Russian bonds vanished altogether, with yields on
some short-term bonds exceeding an astounding 300 percent, assuming
anyone wanted to purchase them. Few did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has ceased to exist, in some ways, as an actual
market,'' said Tom Adshead, director of research for United
Financial Group in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has seen other terrifying plunges in this decade, and
experts differed over whether this one would be fatal, or just one
more near thing.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the panic was psychological, not fiscal, and
repeated, as it has in recent days, that it has money to meet its
obligations through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank and aides to President Boris Yeltsin dismissed
a suggestion Thursday by financier George Soros that the ruble
should be devalued, _ a move that would effectively reduce the
nation's debt but inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rumors that such documents are being worked out here
are just invention and lies,'' said Irina Yasina, the spokeswoman
for the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent amid the furious denials, however, was a more
equivocal statement by Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin. Vyugin said
Soros actually urged several measures to support the ruble, one of
which was devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devaluation is an idea that should be considered only in a
package,'' he said. ``Soros did not call for devaluation as such.''
</P>
<P>
   But many private analysts nevertheless predict just that, saying
that the government is losing the struggle against bankruptcy, and
that its most likely escapes would be devaluation or a ``forced
restructuring'' of its debt, in which bondholders would simply be
handed new repayment schedules with no choice but to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Either course would amount to a dramatic repudiation of the
$22.6 billion rescue plan that the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and Western leaders assembled only last month.
</P>
<P>
   That package, for which Russia promised more coherent and
efficient tax and budget policies, was supposed to yank the
government back from near-insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the package to give the Russian economy its much
needed stability has disappointed Washington. The White House
spokesman, Mike McCurry, said, ``It is critical that the Russian
government act quickly to restore confidence in their economy, and
that is something we have communicated with Russian officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern in Washington was reflected at meetings that
President Clinton had with his economic and national security
advisers on Tuesday and Wednesday, and in conference calls that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers both had with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also conferred with deputy ministers from the
Group of Seven major industrial nations to review the options,
McCurry said, but no specific proposals were made for further aid
for Russia. Politically, any proposal to increase aid for Russia
would be hugely unpopular in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF package was also supposed to cushion private investors
and the Russian people from hardship, a goal that now seems more
and more remote. Despite redoubled tax-collection efforts and
sweeping financial decrees from the Yeltsin government, foreign
investors so far have shown little faith that Russia is climbing
out of its financial hole. With fewer foreign investors, the ruble
has lost value and the government has had to raise interest rates
on bonds higher and higher to attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But those developments have sapped the government's financial
health, further eroding confidence and leading still more investors
to call it quits.

</P>
<P>
   Moody's, the bond-rating service, lowered its rating of Russia's
foreign bonds from B1 to B2, which is five levels below investment
grade, and said the outlook is negative.
</P>
<P>
   What can the government do to pull out of the tailspin beyond
devaluation, default or some other dramatic and painful act? There
are no simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's calamity had many causes.
</P>
<P>
   The prime focus Thursday was on a Central Bank announcement made
Wednesday evening of new rules to increase bank liquidity and to
protect the ruble. One increased the number of banks with direct
access to Central Bank credit; a second limited purchases of
dollars by certain unnamed Russian banks in an attempt to prevent
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which were issued without explanation, underscored
what had long been rumored: that some Russian banks are in trouble
and that others have already walked away from debts to foreigners
and to other Russian banks. Many banks here have borrowed heavily
to invest in government bonds, only to see the value of those
investments plummet as rates for newer bonds began to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   The second trigger may have been pulled Thursday morning, when
The Financial Times in London printed a letter from Soros urging an
international rescue of the ruble. That effort should include a
ruble devaluation of 15 percent to 25 percent, Soros suggested. The
call for devaluation made headlines worldwide, and may have
galvanized wary investors with holdings in Russian companies that
would be hurt by a drop in the ruble's value.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the value of the ruble plunged Thursday, and the
government seemed to confirm the ruble's plight, saying the
reserves of hard currency and gold it can use to prop up its
currency had dropped by $1.4 billion over the last two weeks, to
$17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank's action and Soros' letter came atop other
developments that have made Western investors nervous: the
declining price of oil, a staple of the Russian economy; the
economic crisis in Japan; and a government admission that tax
collections, while rising, are falling short of stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were not helped when, on Wednesday, the lower house of
parliament seemed to reject Yeltsin's call for a special session to
enact emergency laws on taxes and the budget. Yeltsin has
implemented many of those laws by decree during the parliament's
recess, but the legality of some of those decrees is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone agrees that the nation's fiscal situation is
grim, the view that the plunge in stock and bond prices is
justified by events is hardly unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts note that the government is moving steadily
if not always quickly toward fulfilling the terms of the loans
offered last month by the IMF and other lenders. And in fact the
government's finances are stable, if hardly robust.
</P>
<P>
   The real crunch may come this winter, when a large amount of
debt falls due. The government must sell new bonds to repay some of
the old ones, and it is the dead market for new Russian bonds that
has led many investors to conclude that the government will not be
able to raise the money it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid the debt situation is not manageable when in
fact, by all accounts, it is and will be manageable, at least up to
November,'' said Margot Jacobs, a banking analyst at the United
Financial Group in Moscow. ``But instead of playing wait-and-see,
people seem to be voting with their feet.''

   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

CLINTON BACKERS EASING OFF ON TOTAL INNOCENCE STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the day Monica S. Lewinsky told a grand jury she
had sex with President Clinton, his former press secretary, Dee Dee
Myers, said the former White House intern had no reason to lie
since she had full immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Myers's remarks last week on CNBC's ``Rivera Live'' not only
departed from her previous public statements but also reflected an
evolution in her thinking about the sex scandal as it has unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   With the president preparing to testify to the grand jury Monday
via closed-circuit television, many of his former top aides have
been strongly suggesting his earlier denials of an affair may not
be truthful.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the presumption of innocence has fallen during the
past six months _ diminished by news reports about Lewinsky's
testimony, the re-emergence of a dress being tested by the FBI for
genetic material, and other corroberating evidence from independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The one-time aides have used the airwaves to urge Clinton to
come clean with the grand jury and the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Former White House chief of staff Leon Panetta and top adviser
George Stephanopoulos have been consistent in their calls for
Clinton to make a public statement so the matter can be put behind
him and the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people think that there's more to the
story than the president has said,'' Stephanopoulos said on a
recent edition of ABC's ``This Week.'' He added: ``I think that's
pretty clear.'
</P>
<P>
   Now add Myers to the growing list former White House aides whose
feelings about the Lewinsky affair have placed them at odds with
their former colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, in an interview Thursday, said, ``I owed it to him as an
American citizen and as my former employer and friend to wait for
the evidence before drawing a conclusion. Over the last six, seven
months, the leaks about the purported evidence have not been
exculpatory, and I was disappointed the president was not able to
deny that there could be DNA evidence on the dress.
</P>
<P>
   Myers said that as Clinton prepares to testify, ``the message I
and others have tried to send is that he knows more about what the
facts are than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's beginning to defy common sense to suggest that
the president's statement on this so far has been complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyers said her earlier comment on television that Clinton
hasn't denied the possibility of a stain on Lewinsky's dress
``because he can't. If he could have, he would have'' did not
``make anybody happy'' at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While such comments may unnerve White House aides, Myers and
former Clinton associates appear in sync with most Americans. Polls
show a majority of the public believes Clinton and Lewinsky had an
affair but are critical of Starr for expanding his investigation of
an Arkansas land deal to pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said from the beginning that it was nothing but a
nickle-and-dime, petty sex investigation,'' Clinton defender James
Carville said in an interview this week.
</P>
<P>
   Carville, a consultant to the president's 1992 campaign, said he
felt vindicated by reports that Starr plans to submit a tightly
focused report on the Lewinsky matter to Congress, rather than
attempt to show a broad pattern of obstruction of justice. ``I've
been right all along, and the only personal feeling I have is of
vindication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he believes the president did not have an affair
with Lewinsky, Carville said, ``That's what he said, and until he
says something differently, I will believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Caputo, former press secretary for Hillary Rodham Clinton,
said: ``We don't know what's fact and what's fiction. Until that
time, I believe that I should take the president at his word.''
</P>
<P>
   Neel Lattimore, the first lady's former deputy press secretary,
said he would be ``disappointed and hurt'' if the truth is
different than what Clinton has said. But, he said, ``I refuse to
go there. I'm not preparing myself for the worse, nor am I
preparing to dance in the streets. Gloating only gets you in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Lattimore acknowledges that a ``huge fear'' exists
among former and current White House aides that the allegations
against the president may be true. ``I wished that everyone who has
worked for the president and Mrs. Clinton would be part of this
circle that is surrounding them. Evidently, that's not the case.
That's wishful thinking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As news reports circulated that Clinton may stick to his earlier
denials of sex with Lewinsky when he testifies to the grand jury,
one former aide reportedly snuck into the White House late one
night to urge him not to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view is he shouldn't even testify, and my backup view is
testify and go on vacation,'' Carville said, adding that he was not
the former aide who made the late-night visit to Clinton. ``I was
in France,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Panetta was not the former aide either. Last Sunday,
on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' Panetta said the president's pledge
to testify truthfully and completely would help avoid a
constitutional crisis. He also said he hoped Clinton would share
that testimony with the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has a special bond of trust with the American
people,'' said Panetta. ``He owes them an explanation as to what
this relationship is all about, and I think that will help,
hopefully, expedite a conclusion to this whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, said Panetta, ``We are in for a very, very long
process that could go another four to six months in the Congress
with testimony, with hearings, with continuing speculation as to
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James Kennedy said such talk among former
aides has been commonplace through Starr's investigation and
conflicts with his personal view of loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In exchange for having the access and opportunity to serve the
public, you should be discreet and not critical of those whom
you're working with, even after you leave,'' he said. ``Over the
course of six months, there has been nonstop opinionating about
every minute aspect of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But are those at the White House listening?
</P>
<P>
   Said Kennedy: ``We really haven't spent much time listening to
speculative talk before, and I don't think we are going to do that
now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What goes on in the weird and wonderful world of the
sex, drugs and rock'n'roll President, the willy-waving leader of
the free world? Obviously not sex, drugs and rock'n'roll as we know
it, captain.
</P>
<P>
   For here is a man who can take drugs and not inhale, have some
kind of physical contact but not call it sex _ Monica did not
inhale _ and seriously pretend that rock'n'roll means the
reformation of Fleetwood Mac.
</P>
<P>
   We are expected to swallow all this and carry on grooving away
because good ol' Bill is not such a bad boy really, and the good
ol' American economy is still doing OK.
</P>
<P>
   And swallow it we do. The tedious talk of oral gratification,
the discussion of the President's genitalia, the endless
explanations of obscure legal terms, have bored us into submission.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Americans polled believe that Clinton did have sex
with Monica Lewinsky. So it seems that the majority of Americans
believe their president is a liar and are not bothered.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of pundits here also seem to think that Clinton's sex
life is his own business _ or maybe Hillary's _ and they don't
really care either, because an adulterous Democrat is better than a
repressed Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I do care, and for a long time I have thought that Clinton
cannot ride this one out.
</P>
<P>
   No one agrees with me, I know; but even if I am wrong, I wonder
how we have become so morally numb that we are prepared to go along
with this.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that all men are bastards, they only want one thing
and will use and abuse their positions of power to get it, you
might think I was a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   If I said that certain men have such appetites that they just
can't help themselves _ they lie to their wives and girlfriends,
and the more important they are, the more they think they can get
away with it _ you might assume that I was bitter and twisted.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have, of course, been strangely silent on Bill's
behavior, not bitter and twisted enough for my liking.
</P>
<P>
   American feminism has shown itself, at least publicly, to be
even more class ridden than the British version. Clinton likes
women, goes the line, strong women; he even married one and has
promoted others. Therefore what Clinton does in the privacy of his
own office/hotel bedroom/back of car is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, just look at the women who have made the accusations:
Jennifer Flowers, Paula Jones and now Monica ``I am a pizza''
Lewinsky. They're clearly trash and, however much they are made
over, trash will out.
</P>
<P>
   Are we really to think that the lives of these kinds of women
don't matter? What sort of feminism is this, that deigns to protect
only those who least need protecting, and disses those from the
wrong side of the tracks?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, say those who support Clinton, maybe Monica enjoyed it.
These were relationships between mutually consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is possible to ignore the power differential between a
president and an intern. In which case, why can't Clinton tell us
the truth?
</P>
<P>
   If he were to tell the American public tomorrow, ``Hey, guys. I
can't keep my trousers on, and you know that if you were in my
position you would be the same,'' then at least we would know which
ball park he was playing in.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary really was a lesbian, or having affairs with his
young aides, as in ``Primary Colors,'' we could perhaps accept that
this open marriage was not a bad arrangement after all.
</P>
<P>
   But we know, don't we, what sort of men Clinton surrounds
himself with? Men who are happily instructed to order up women as
if they were fried chicken. I'll have a party bucket, please.
</P>
<P>
   Men such as Dick Morris, who once moaned about the fact that the
poor old President couldn't even get (oral gratification) in the
back of a limo these days; the man who once said ``Men are from
Mars, women are from Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   What depresses me about all those who would let Clinton off the
hook _ the
it's-not-the-sex-it's-the-lying-that-matters-and-we-all-lie-anyway
brigade _ is that yet again we have thrust down our throats the
view that male sexuality is somehow uncontrollable.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the world is reduced, even by his
supporters, to little more than a walking, talking phallus. Forget
the politics and Jesus, let us worship the sordid coupling of the
Yankee dollar and the wicked willy that can move it up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the boy can't help it. Most of them can't, can they? Sex
makes their heads go funny. But if nations are to be governed by
talking sets of genitalia, why bother with policy at all? Why not
simply vote for the man with the wickedest willy of all?
</P>
<P>
   If Americans care more about having a little bit extra in their
pockets than the fact that they are represented internationally by
a known liar, then the business of politics has been successfully
replaced by business alone, and all talk of principle is entirely
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Let the apologists for Clinton send their daughters to work for
men twice their age, whose wives don't understand them. Let the
feminists who find Clinton such a sex god, walk one mile in his
wife's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   My dream is, and I have it with upsetting regularity, is that
Hillary follows my advice (it is a dream, after all) and finally
has enough. She goes on TV and says, ``I am sick of the lies. I am
sick of him making me and all those other women lie. If you want
the truth, if you want to change America, then here I am. There is
a toll-free number, and you can make me your president simply by
ringing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The switchboard is jammed... and then I wake up and realize that
this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if Bill will stagger on with a ``he said, she said''
defense. Perhaps, at last, he has met his match in Monica. She says
she has lied all her life. He may understand that.
</P>
<P>
   This gigantic waste of time and money may be the result of an
office affair, but who ends up really paying?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's popularity is up, though his credibility is down. How
can that be? Do we like those who are weak because they remind us
of ourselves as they fumble and lie?
</P>
<P>
   I tell you who ends up paying. All of us _ because if the most
powerful nation in the world continues to admire a cheat and a liar
then we are all diminished.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about sex. Clinton can have sex with Saddam Hussein
for all I care. It's about power, the power to get away with
anything.
</P>
<P>
   No one has that power unless others consent to it, and it looks
to me as if the majority of people both here and in the States are
in a mutually consenting relationship with Mr. President.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope that they get as much pleasure from it as the man
Lewinsky used to call ``the big he'' does. &QL;

RIGHT ON! FACTS FIT FOR PRO-LEFTIES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Perhaps the dictionary doesn't shine the brightest
light on lefties (check out the definition of ``sinister''). Still,
here are but a few factoids proving southpaws deserve a little more
credit than Webster's opinion alone, beginning with the ubiquitous
pro-lefty quote found on mugs and T-shirts: ``The left side of your
brain controls the right side of your body, and the right side of
your brain controls the left side of your body. So only left-handed
people are in their right mind.''
</P>
<P>
   _ZIP code 25251 is dedicated to left-handers. Left Hand, W.Va.,
does allow right-handers, but everyone there is a true Left Hander.
</P>
<P>
   _The turbot has the distinct advantage of having both eyes on
the left side of its head. The turbot is a fish, and an envied one
at that.
</P>
<P>
   _James A. Garfield was the first left-handed U.S. president. He
could, however, go both ways and would amuse visitors by
simultaneously writing in Latin with one hand and Greek with the
other. Now that's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   _Left-handers have an advantage in baseball. A lefty batter is a
step closer to first base. A southpaw pitcher can keep an eye on
the runner at first better then a right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   _The term ``southpaw'' was started by Chicago sportswriters in
the 1890s to describe left-handed pitchers. Pitchers in the Chicago
stadium faced west toward home plate. Their pitching arms, then,
were to the south. Get it? Sportswriters are so clever.
</P>
<P>
   _Males of the left-handed persuasion outnumber females, 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   _Lefty Albert Einstein was called backward. As a child, speech
came slowly and he had problems in almost every subject in school.
</P>
<P>
   _Rudders on ancient sailing vessels were attached to the right
side, forcing them to dock on the left. This became the ``port''
side.
</P>
<P>
   _Thank a lefty for electricity. Ben Franklin flew a kite in 1752
and proved lightning is electricity, so if not for him, we'd be
cruising the Internet by candlelight. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   _The ancient Greeks were one of the few people kind to lefties.
Their word for left was ``aristera,'' meaning ``the best.'' This is
where we get the word aristocrat.
</P>
<P>
   _Tuesday is lucky for lefties. It was named for the left-handed
Scandinavian god Tiw. This is the best day to meet a southpaw.
</P>
<P>
   _The Kerr clan in Scotland believes its surname comes from the
Gaelic ``keir, `` meaning left. Many of its castles were built with
stairs winding counterclockwise, giving left-handed sword fighters
the advantage in defending against right-handed attackers.
</P>
<P>
   _Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine are probably the most famous
left-handed couple in history. So don't anger a short lefty with a
Napoleon complex or he just might decide to take over the world. &QL;

CLINTON ATTENDS ARRIVAL OF BODIES FROM KENYA BOMB BLAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the bodies of Americans killed in the bombing of
the U.S. Embassy in Kenya came home Thursday, President Clinton
called them adventurous spirits who ``relished the chance to see
the world and make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They perished in the service of the country for which they
gave so much life,'' said a teary-eyed Clinton, who recounted
poignant details about the lives of the men and women killed in
last week's bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of those bodies arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, Md.,
outside the nation's capital, where the president, family members
of the dead, State Department employees and other dignitaries
awaited in a hangar lined with 10 black hearses.
</P>
<P>
   As the band played ``Nearer My God to Thee,'' escorts from the
five branches of the military carried the coffins wrapped in the
U.S. flag from the gray military aircraft that had returned them
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After the ceremony, the bodies were flown to Dover Air Force
Base, Del., where autopsies will be conducted on the bodies before
they are returned to the families.
</P>
<P>
   One of the U.S. victims, Jean Alizu, 60, who was married to a
Kenyan, will be buried in the East African country. Another victim,
Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds, 40, was flown
directly to Florida Wednesday at the request of the family.
</P>
<P>
   Before the ceremony, Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton met with 100 family members in a private session.
</P>
<P>
   In his public remarks, the president repeated his vow that the
perpetrators of the bombings of the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
would be tracked down. No Americans were killed in the second
embassy bombing in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what it takes, we must find those responsible for
these evil acts and see that justice is done,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who spoke before the
president, harshly condemned the bombings as the work of
unprincipled terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake. Terror is the tool of cowards. It is not a
form of political expression and certainly not a manifestation of
religious faith. It is murder, plain and simple. And those who
perpetrate it, finance it or otherwise support it, must be opposed
by all decent people,'' said Albright, who accompanied the bodies
from Ramstein Air Base, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, who spoke first, said that ``we
can never allow terrorists to diminish our determination to press
on with the inspiring work of those who have been taken from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The speakers also noted that 245 Kenyans and Tanzanians died as
a result of the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony took place as officials debated the security of
U.S. embassies around the world. Earlier this week, Undersecretary
of State Thomas Pickering acknowledged that the U.S. Ambassador to
Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had expressed concern that the embassy in
Nairobi was not secure.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues and family who had come to mourn the deceased said
they were always aware that overseas assignments posed great risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a fear come to realization, It was always in the back
of our minds,'' said Lynn Powell, a relative of two people killed
in the embassy blast _ Counsel General Julian Bartley, 55, and his
21-year old son, Jay, who had a summer job at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said that the senior Bartley's daughter was visiting her
in Nashville, Tenn., when the bombing occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Adams, a State Department employee who attended the
ceremony, said she was well aware of the security problems in
Nairobi because she worked there from 1991-93.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she always felt insecure in the building because it
was in the middle of the bustling city, unlike many other nations'
embassies which were located behind gates on large lots in
Nairobi's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams said her concerns were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me the panic attack I had was (because of) the
altitude,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said she knew several of the people killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking something like that could happen to me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne King, a 26-year-old State Department intern, said the
bombings have not discouraged him from trying to enter the Foreign
Service and possibly go to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the dangers of being on the front line,'' said
King, who attends law school at Temple University in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that those who died were a diverse lot. They
included Louise Martin, a 45-year old epidemiologist from Atlanta
who worked to save African children from disease, and Molly Huckaby
Hardy, a 51-year old grandmother from Georgia who was on her last
overseas assignment.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who died, Army Sgt. Kenneth Hobson II, a Missouri
native and veteran of the Gulf War, had requested that his ashes be
scattered in the Pacific Ocean off California's Big Sur, because
that is where he met his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Others who lost their lives in the attack were:
</P>
<P>
   Marine Sgt. Jesse Aliganga, 21, of Tallahassee, Fla, a security
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Prabhi Kavaler, 45, born in India and a naturalized American who
worked for the general services office at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Kirk, 50, of South Bend, Ind., who had just returned from
a six-week vacation to her job as a fiscal officer for the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle O'Connor, 36, who worked for the General Services
Administration. She will be buried in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shah, 38, a political officer from Chicago who was planning
to attend the 20th anniversary of his high school graduation in
Cincinnati this fall. His former classmates plan a memorial service
for him at the time of the reunion.

LARRY McREYNOLDS, MIKE SKINNER RAISE GRADES IN TEAM CHEMISTRY 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry McReynolds never would say this, because Larry McReynolds
is too classy a guy. But before the 1998 NASCAR Winston Cup season
is over, Dale Earnhardt will regret the Sunday when he signed off
on the deal that dumped McReynolds as his crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   And here is another prediction. Before the 1998 Winston Cup
season is over, McReynolds and his ``new'' driver, Mike Skinner,
will win a race before Earnhardt and his ``new'' crew chief, Kevin
Hamlin, do.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to that most elusive of elements _ team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Car owners increasingly contend that team chemistry is more
important than all the high-tech shocks, springs and setup numbers
in their guarded possessions. Car owner Richard Childress gave
McReynolds all the approved doodads money could buy for Earnhardt's
No. 3 GM Goodwrench Service Plus Chevrolets during a working
relationship that began at the start of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt and McReynolds managed to win the 1998 Daytona 500
together in February, an emotional milestone for the sport's second
seven-time Cup champion. But by early June, both
Earnhardt//McReynolds and Skinner//Hamlin were failing team
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Childress announced on June 8 that heading into the Miller Lite
400 at Michigan Speedway he was swapping crew chiefs in a bid to
jump-start both teams. At that point, 13 races into the 33-race
schedule, Earnhardt was an uninspiring 12th in points. Skinner _
who had suffered through grinding crashes at Atlanta Motor Speedway
and Texas Motor Speedway _ was wallowing in 38th.
</P>
<P>
   As the tour returns to Brooklyn, Mich., for the Pepsi 400 on
Sunday, both programs have righted themselves. In the seven races
since the swap, Earnhardt has qualified among the first-round top
25 on six occasions. Qualifying was one of his glaring problem
areas while working with McReynolds. Earnhardt also has notched
three top-10 finishes, including a fifth in the Brickyard 400 at
the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and has climbed to ninth in
points.
</P>
<P>
   With some added straight-line Chevy SB2 horsepower, maybe
Earnhardt can begin to run up front with points leaders Jeff
Gordon, Mark Martin and Dale Jarrett and think about winning races
again.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner already is knocking on that door. His career-best
third-place finish during The Bud at The Glen on the road course in
Watkins Glen, N.Y., on Sunday was his third top-five result in the
last four races. And it was a prime example of the rapport that
will earn Skinner and McReynolds their first victory together
before the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Reprising the strategy that carried Geoff Bodine and former crew
chief Paul Andrews to victory at The Glen in 1996, McReynolds tried
to steal one on fuel mileage over the twisting 11-turn, 2.45-mile
layout. McReynolds gambled that Skinner could stretch his fuel
mileage over the final 39 laps of the 90-lapper into a decent
finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry said to forget about winning the race, to get a good
finish and go on,'' said Skinner, who surrendered the lead to
eventual winner Gordon on lap 87. ``I think Larry McReynolds
delivered a message _ chemistry is everything. And we have some
great chemistry. Larry is a communicator. We communicate well with
the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner's recent surge has moved him to 32nd in points _
admittedly light years away from Earnhardt, much less Maximum Jeff.
But in the seven race-span since the swap, Skinner's results in the
No. 31 Lowe's Monte Carlo rank him a respectable 11th in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't beyond our expectations,'' McReynolds said, quite
modestly, on Tuesday. ``This is a good little race team. I knew
that before Richard relocated me here. It's a very young, very
aggressive team. They haven't got caught up in the Winston Cup rut
yet _ telling you how they did things in 1970-something. They have
an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds added that unlike Earnhardt and his burgeoning
business interests, he and Skinner make quality time to talk about
their race car during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stressed to Dale to come work more at the shop,'' said
McReynolds, who has guided various Cup drivers to 23 victories
since 1986. ``I think the days of the driver walking up on Friday
morning and saying, `Hey guys, what kind of week did you have?' are
on the way out. The days of what I call the `helmet driver' is
drifting farther and farther away.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds said he remains convinced Earnhardt still has the
desire to win races. But Earnhardt also apparently has remained set
about the elusive feel he is seeking inside a race car. With the
exception of the Daytona 500 on Feb. 15, McReynolds never did quite
figure it out, and he was handed a failing grade in team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds never would say this. But before the 1998 Winston Cup
season is over, Earnhardt will regret that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BUZZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Final makeup of the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup schedule remains one
of the great mysteries of life. But NASCAR president Bill France
Jr. confirmed another piece of the puzzle Sunday, when he said The
Bud at The Glen would be staged for the 14th consecutive year at
Watkins Glen (N.Y.) International next summer. Officials at Texas
Motor Speedway had already announced that the Primestar 500 would
be run on March 28 in Fort Worth. The consensus of the rumor mill
is that the schedule will grow by only one race, to 34, with the
addition of the Miami-Dade Motorsports Complex in Homestead, Fla.
All other venues currently on the schedule are rumored to return in
1999. One scenario involving Homestead has that race slotted for
Nov. 7, pushing the traditional season-ending NAPA 500 at Atlanta
Motor Speedway back to Nov. 21 _ two weeks later than this year's
finale. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is an understatement to say the majority of Cup drivers were
pleased the 1,200 Goodyear Eagle radial wet tires stacked in the
garage area at Watkins Glen International never were used for the
first time during The Bud At The Glen on Sunday. In the event of
rain, NASCAR officials had planned to halt the race, bring the cars
into the pits and have the crews mount the treaded tires and
install a windshield wiper motor/blade to go racing. The cars
already were equipped with a red brake light inside the rear
windows. Championship contender Dale Jarrett said trying to race in
the rain remains out of place in this series. ``I don't even know
if you can race in the rain. We wouldn't know what to do,
basically,'' Jarrett said. Incidentally, native Texan Terry Labonte
tested the same Goodyear radial wets on the half-mile at
Martinsville (Va.) Speedway. But Stu Grant, general manager of
Goodyear worldwide racing, said the tires ``didn't appear feasible
for short ovals.'' ...

   Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice president for competition, said
recent rumors about cancellation of the Pepsi 400 at Michigan
Speedway this Sunday were unfounded. Questions surfaced after three
fans were killed and six injured by flying debris from the
open-wheel Championship Car of Adrian Fernandez after a wreck
during the Championship Auto Racing Teams' U.S. 500 on July 26.
``Things can happen and I don't want to put odds on it ever
happening again in any kind of motorsport,'' Helton said. ``But our
position is there was nothing that was going to stop us from going
back there to race.'' Track management has added four feet to the
catch-fencing since the tragedy, raising the level to 17 feet.
Helton said that decision was made by Penske Motorsports, not
NASCAR. ...

   Pioneer team owner Bud Moore, like NASCAR, is celebrating his
50th anniversary in the sport this summer. Moore plans to return to
the series at the Michigan Speedway this weekend with Ted Musgrave,
who finished 19th in his last race for team owner Jack Roush at The
Glen. Moore said Musgrave, who has been replaced by
rookie-of-the-year contender Kevin Lepage, remains under contract
to Roush through December. ``They're `loaning' us Ted Musgrave to
run at Michigan. I'll put it that way,'' said Moore, whose drivers
have won 63 races and 45 poles during his tenure. ...

   Team Tabasco's Darrell Waltrip will switch from a Chevrolet
Monte Carlo to a Pontiac Grand Prix for the remainder of the
season, beginning at Michigan Speedway. The change comes at the
order of Paul McIlhenny, whose Tabasco brand has sunk considerable
sponsorship money into promotions featuring a Pontiac (formerly
driven by Todd Bodine). The team switched to the Chevys owned by
Texan Tim Beverley after his Tyler Jet Motorsports acquired
majority ownership of ISM Racing from Bob Hancher before the
Brickyard 400.CART

   With the exception of the four-race International Race of
Champions Series, two-time and reigning NTB Trans-Am champion Tommy
Kendall has been without a full-time ride in 1998. But Kendall said
former Championship Auto Racing Teams champion Jimmy Vasser has
become an ally in his search for an open-wheel test. ``Jimmy can't
believe that I don't have anything going,'' said Kendall, who
started 30th and finished 17th in The Bud at The Glen in the No. 46
Chevy fielded by Team Sabco. ``He's been telling me who I need to
talk to and he's been pitching my name around _ like at (team
owner) Chip Ganassi. But Chip doesn't want to hear it. Chip says,
`I've got two drivers.''' However, both Vasser and Target/Chip
Ganassi teammate Alex Zanardi, the reigning CART champion and
runaway points leader, are exploring their options for next
season. &QL;

   NHRA TO STOMP BRISTOL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to jazz up interest in its annual nonpoints all-star
race, the National Hot Rod Association plans to pit Top Fuel
dragsters against Funny Cars during the inaugural Winston No Bull
Showdown at Bruton Smith's Bristol (Tenn.) Dragway next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston Invitational was held in the spring at Rockingham
(N.C.) Dragway for the past 10 years. ``The Rock'' is being
replaced by the quarter-mile track known as ``Thunder Valley.'' The
revised race format definitely smacks of the promotional style of
Smith, whose NASCAR holdings include Texas Motor Speedway in Fort
Worth. For instance, the racing on July 8-10 will be conducted at
night and offer the highest guaranteed purse in NHRA history.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the Top Fuel vs. Funny Car showdown will receive
$200,000 from a total purse of $727,000. A 24-car field of Top
Fuelers and Funny Cars is planned, and the event also will feature
separate 16-car fields in Pro Stock and Pro Stock Truck, and eight
Pro Stock Bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruton's vision, we all know what that's been in Winston
Cup,'' NHRA president Dallas Gardner said during a teleconference
on Wednesday. ``We expect that when Bruton Smith does something
with a facility, it automatically goes to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has committed more than $10 million to renovate Bristol
Dragway, located within walking distance of his half-mile Bristol
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The NHRA plans to implement some type of handicap system based
upon elapsed time to even up the competition between the dragsters
and Funny Cars, which seven-time Winston Funny Car champion John
Force said are from 300 to 400 pounds heavier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have an equal playing field. If they do that,
we'll give them something to see,'' Force said. ``It's going to be
a race like nobody's ever seen. One thing we all like is the purse.
I told Bruton it's like a big casino. We get to go there and make
some serious money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LAST WORDS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the testing you guys (in the media) say I've been
doing in Formula One and Indy-cars. Just kidding.''

FORBES, PRESIDENCY IN MIND, TAKES THATCHER TO THE HEARTLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ The heartland never seemed so foreign.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard detectives stationed themselves discreetly in the
Marriott ballroom, having measured the number of steps from the
entrance to the head table. A rendition of God Save the Queen
rippled out across the room. And, sprinkled among the American
flags, were Union Jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching across the sea to energize his presidential ambitions,
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes brought Lady Margaret Thatcher _
former Prime Minister of Great Britain, Cold War icon and Ronald
Reagan accolyte _ to this Midwestern city.
</P>
<P>
   The joint appearance, at a fund-raising lunch for local
Republicans running in the fall elections, was a savvy political
move by a man determined to polish his conservative credentials,
don the Reagan mantle, and broaden his Republican base in a state
that kicks off the presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting harder and harder to impress Iowans, but even for
us, this is one of the most dramatic events in state history,''
said Steve Chubbs, state Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   It could also signal a turnaround for Forbes, a presidential
candidate in 1996 and likely contender in 2000. Entering late in
the 1996 race and relying mainly on an ad blitz, Forbes made a
mediocre showing in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Forbes is doing whatever he can to woo
Republican activists and lay claim to a fiscally _ and socially _
conservative agenda here. What better way than to invite Thatcher,
viewed by many Iowans as a hero of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the principles personified by Lady Thatcher and
Ronald Reagan,'' Forbes said at a press conference before the
lunch. ``If we follow their principles and renew them, American and
the world will benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's local standing already has improved, Grubbs said, and
this mega fund-raiser could bolster his position. The lunch was
expected to net almost half a million dollars _ a hefty sum for
local candidates in a midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Iowans seemed to agree that the event was an attention-grabber
and a clear signal that Forbes was committed to party team
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really important to the grass-roots here, and important
to the candidate because of the caucuses are led by grass-roots,''
explained Libby Jacobs, a 40-year-old corporate relations director
for a financial group.
</P>
<P>
   Having played host to Nikita Khrushchev in 1959 and Pope John
Paul II 20 years later, Iowa is anything but unaware of _ or
unwelcoming to _ foreign dignitaries. State Republicans took the
opportunity to bestow upon Thatcher the Ronald Reagan Freedom
Without Borders Award.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher gave a half-hour speech to a standing ovation, touching
on her experiences working with Reagan, conversations with Mikhail
Gorbachev, negotiations with the Chinese over Hong Kong, and her
connection with America throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reagan conservatives, Thatcher conservatives and Forbes
conservatives all belive in the same fundamental thing,'' she said
during her acceptance speech. ``It is the essential right to life,
to liberty and to freedom...which comes from the great creator.''
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs, as well as Thatcher's people, wanted to make it clear
that the former prime minister was appearing in Iowa simply as a
``guest'' of her longtime friend. There would be no press
conference, no interviews, and no advocacy _ in short, no meddling
in the political process.
</P>
<P>
   While Iowans gave Forbes points for bringing Thatcher in, it was
obvious the Iron Lady was the draw, as evidenced by the
$250-per-plate charge, or the $1,000 that some couples paid to have
their books signed and picture taken with Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see Lady Thatcher, who I have so admired all these
years,'' said Evelyn Fisher, 60, who runs a sand and gravel
company.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral politicking already has heated up in Iowa this year,
with presidential hopefuls having spent 150 days so far in Iowa,
compared with 50 at the same time in the 1996 pre-election cycle,
according to Hugh Winebrenner, a Drake University professor and
expert on the Iowa caucus.
</P>
<P>
   According to Winebrenner, the Republican Party, with so many
potential presidential candidates and no clear front-runner, is
successfully raising money and attracting dozens of visits by
national political figures. In addition to Forbes, Iowa this week
hosts Elizabeth Dole, Lamar Alexander and former President George
Bush. August will see House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Missouri Senator
John Ashcroft, and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Although Forbes said he will not announce whether he runs until
early next year, he has been busy since 1996 laying the groundwork
for a campaign, with personal appearances in every state,
demographically targeted TV and radio ads, and a barrage of faxes
and op-eds. Spearheading the effort is his Americans for Hope,
Growth, and Opportunity, an issues organization with over 130,000
contributors and $10 million raised so far.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes's staff said the publisher wants to reignite the Reagan
Revolution and take it into the millenium. In addition to flogging
his favorite issue _ the flat tax _ Forbes has seized on school
choice, attacking affirmative action, and promoting a ban on
so-called partial-birth abortion in an effort to ``prove he isn't a
moderate in conservative clothing,'' Winebrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   It looks like Forbes's strategy is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are a lot more open than they were four years ago,''
said Steve Scheffler, field director of the Christian Coalition in
Iowa. ``He's been talking about social issues, and that's
resonating with a lot of people.''

GRAMM TO CONSIDER ENHANCING SECURITY FOR U.S. FACILITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who derided U.S.
embassies as overpriced ``marble palaces'' during his failed 1996
presidential run, will consider President Clinton's forthcoming
funding request to enhance security for U.S. facilities, Gramm
spokesman Larry Neal said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of bombing at the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania,
the administration has pledged to request an emergency
appropriation to increase security at overseas installations.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who during his unsuccessful campaign also castigated
foreign-service workers for ``renting long coats and high hats,''
has always supported funding to ensure that U.S. embassies are safe
from terrorist attack, Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's often stinging criticisms of State Department funding
have been directed at overspending on ``inappropriate luxuries,''
such as expensive furniture, Neal added.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry, addressing past criticism
that the United States spends too much money on embassies, said
Thursday that many Americans erroneously believe that up to 15
percent of the U.S. budget goes to U.S. involvement overseas when
the actual figure is only 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You frequently hear the argument, `Why are we spending all
that money overseas?' and the answer is because we're doing very
important work overseas,'' McCurry said. ``And we need places to do
it, and those places need to be secure and they need to be
adequately funded.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 people, including 12 Americans, were killed in the
bombings in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton on Wednesday called on several federal agencies to
report back to him within a few days on any additional funds that
might be needed to enhance security at U.S. embassies, particularly
those in high-risk areas such as the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, while chairman of the Senate's State Department funding
subcommittee in September 1995, sharply criticized Clinton's budget
request of $2.16 billion for the department and its embassies for
fiscal year 1996. The senator also criticized the $32 million the
United States spent to furnish its embassy in Bangkok, Thailand, a
price nearly equal to the $38 billion it cost to build the
facility, which opened in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the American people were more interested in law
enforcement and fighting drugs than in building marble palaces and
renting long coats and high hats,'' Gramm said in September 1995.
The Senate Appropriations subcommittee on the State Department,
which he chaired, then voted to slash $258 million from the
president's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gramm supported the president's request that $9.7
million be earmarked for security enhancements for U.S. embassies,
Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's comments at the time drew criticism from
then-State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a gratuitous, simplistic and opportunistic attack,''
Burns said. ``Every foreign service officer in this building was
deeply offended by those remarks.''

   MICROSOFT-GORTON (Washington) Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for
Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the
company chairman and chief executive officer, Bill Gates.

   BBA-MARINERS (Chicago) Mariner pitching coach Stan Williams
laughed when recalling his first meeting with the M's pitching
staff, when he told them they could finish the season with a
composite earned run average under four runs a game. ``They must
have thought I was an alien,'' Williams said. The Mariners were the
laughingstock among major-league pitching staffs, especially the
bullpen which regularly blew leads and cost Nardi Contreras his
job. But since May 1, the staff ERA is 4.48, slightly above average
in the offensive-minded American League. The slow and meticulous
climb to respectability has reached the point where bad
performances, like Tuesday night and Wednesday afternoon in Toronto
where seventh-inning pitching collapses led to back-to-back losses,
are considered a glitch instead of a trend.

RAPIST WHO RAN IN 1986 FINALLY SENTENCED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Twelve years ago, after pleading guilty to
raping an eight-year-old girl, George C. Sowyrea apparently decided
he didn't want to do the time for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Free on bail for about a month after entering his plea in 1986,
Sowyrea vanished, and eluded detectives for more than a decade _
until an anonymous caller tipped off police.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, after spending more than 10 years in Clearwater, Fla.,
Sowyrea finally faced sentencing in a Middlesex County courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white cardigan sweater and khaki pants, Sowyrea,
58, shuffled into the hearing Thursday looking very much like a
benign, silver-haired grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   But that facade quickly crumbled as his victim, now 21, took the
witness stand. Through tears, she told Superior Court Judge Charles
Barrett how Sowyrea shattered her young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a hard time understanding how he could destroy me
for his sick, selfish sexual pleasure,'' she said. ``I changed
schools, I moved to Florida, but I still could not escape him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she has had many sleepless nights in the last 13 years,
wondering if Sowyrea was harming other children. ``My never-ending
nightmare is finally ending,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sowyrea sat expressionless through her statement. He also showed
no emotion when Barrett sentenced him to 10 years in prison for the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Sowyrea, a former firefighter, must serve six of those 10 years
and enroll in a sex offenders treatment program, the judge ruled.
Sowyrea was also forbidden from having any contact with the victim
or her family and from any supervised contact with children under
18.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, the victim said she was disappointed in
the sentence. She had urged the judge to sentence Sowyrea to 13
years served for the 13 years she said she served.
</P>
<P>
   After he was convicted in 1986, Sowyrea first went to Maine,
where he defaulted on a drunken driving charge, said Melrose Police
Chief Richard Smith.  &UR;  &LR; He then moved to Florida, where he lived
alone and worked for a landscaping company. In 1992, Melrose police
suspected he was in Florida, but they could not find him.
</P>
<P>
   The case languished until about four months ago, when Melrose
police received an anonymous call telling them that Sowyrea was
living in Clearwater.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa-St. Petersburg Violent Fugitive Task Force immediately
went to the address given by the caller and arrested Sowyrea, who
was using the alias George Seaver. He was extradited to
Massachusetts on April 3.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who reopened the case in 1992, said he was determined to
solve it. ``It bothered me that we had never been able to get
closure for the victim and her family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex prosecutor Kevin Ryle had asked Judge Barrett to
sentence Sowyrea to 12- to-15 years in prison. But defense attorney
Arthur Kelly argued for leniency.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said Sowyrea is an old man ``consumed with remorse and
sorrow'' and noted that his client did not commit any crimes while
living in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Sowyrea was a Stoneham firefighter from 1973 to 1981, when he
resigned because of personal problems, Kelly said. In 1981, he
said, Sowyrea and his wife divorced, and Sowyrea's life ``began to
unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Sowyrea was dating the victim's mother at the time of the rape,
Kelly said. The mother began to testify Thursday, but quickly broke
down in tears and said she could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   She and her children live in Florida now, and her daughter noted
the irony that they moved there to escape Sowyrea.

   UNDATED - They just called over from Features with a correction
for the TV grid. You may want to tape this to the fridge, because
I'm thinking it promises to be the very latest in ``must see TV.''
</P>
<P>
   A programming note:
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug. 17, 2 p.m., The Jerry Springer Show: ``President
Bill Clinton testifies live before a federal grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right, kiddies, in a red-hot, unprecedented collision of
politics, pop culture and pornography, Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr is outta here and Jerry Springer, King of the Airwaves, the
man who brought us ``hermaphrodites who cheat on themselves,'' is
in.
</P>
<P>
   Give us some Springerian hype, Jer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten wild and outrageous on the show before, folks,
but nothing like this! Today we're going to have deeper, even
darker secrets revealed! Love triangles, adultery, transactional
immunity! You probably think you've seen it all, but I'm telling
you, Bill and Monica and Hillary are really too hot for TV!''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! Let's roll that sneak preview.
</P>
<P>
   Caution: As is always the case with the U.S. Presidency in the
late 20th century, the following excerpts are not to be shown to
lifelong Democrats, children under the age of 18, or Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Bill, you've been telling us about DNA testing and how
it was misused to frame O.J. Simpson for those two murders. That's
great, but now I want to welcome to the show another expert on DNA,
Monica the intern.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill: ``Jerry, I feel her, her pain, but she's a lyin'_''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Hey, hey! Shhh! Shut up!''
</P>
<P>
   Audience (all together, like a herd of mongoloid sheep):
``Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``All right. OK. Now Monica, that is one lovely dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``Thanks. I had it in the closet for ages. A little dry
cleaning, presto, it's good as new.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Wonderful. Now tell us, when did it all begin?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill: ``Jerry, any chance I can invoke the Fifth Amendment
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Monica (swallowing back tears): ``It was when I saw him in those
itty bitty jogging shorts. And it was wonderful, until we got
Tripped up.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``I bet. Wonderful on a dozen occasions, from what we
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``Then he turned into the Big Creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill (wagging his finger): ``Jerry, there is no improper
relationship with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Still, sir, you have to admit, this has been a crushing
blow for the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Yuck. Time to fast forward.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Now we welcome to the show Hillary, Bill's wife. Hey_''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary (running straight for Monica): ``You mouthy little
(bleep). I'll kill you! Right wing conspirator! Arkansas hater!''
</P>
<P>
   Monica: ``Bring it on, Ice Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary (reaching past the security guards for Monica's throat):
``You'll wish Newt hadn't spiked my health care proposal when I'm
done with you, freak.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Whoa! I'll be back in a moment with a final thought.
Stay with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this I've been dreaming of for months on end.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry: ``Thanks for being with us today. You know, I have to
tell you, this has been one amazing show. See, I thought that what
I do was the most sordid, vile, scum-bathed thing on the face of
the planet. Turns out, no, Washington D.C. has me beat by a
longshot. Heck, those people produce more filth in a day than I do
in a year. Except there they call it news, or politics, or justice.
It's enough to make me want to get back into politics. Or quit my
show and do something really useful for mankind, like throw myself
off the Sears Tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, until next time, take care of yourself _ and each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, dare to dream, dare to dream. Sadly, the best we can do is
take care to change the channel, and even then it's all Bill, all
Monica, all Jerry, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Way back when, they called the place America. Now it's Springer
Nation. &QL;

U.S. RETREATS FROM PLEDGE TO BACK UP ARMS INSPECTORS IN IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Iraq's challenge to the United Nations has
become more acute, the Clinton administration has retreated from
its pledge of immediate military punishment if Iraq interferes with
arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, senior administration officials said, the act that
would bring U.S. retaliation has shifted to Iraqi moves to produce
weapons of mass destruction or threaten its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall policy is to contain'' Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, a senior administration official said this week after
Baghdad had said it was, in effect, ending inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hasn't changed,'' the official said, ``and we may very
well end up using military force. If he threatens regional
stability or his neighbors, we're prepared to act. And we continue
to have a robust force in the region prepared to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the administration says, it is asking the
Security Council and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to respond
to Iraq's violation of its Feb. 23 pledges to cooperate with the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In February, Kofi was proud of his ability to forestall a war
with his personal intervention and guarantee,'' a senior
administration official said. ``As long as Iraq doesn't do anything
stupid, what's wrong with letting him try to fix it?''
</P>
<P>
   The official argued that letting the secretary general push Iraq
is ``the best way at this point to insure a united and forceful
U.N. response'' that would also involve traditional advocates for a
softer approach to Baghdad, in particular Russia and France.
</P>
<P>
   With the Security Council on record as threatening the
``severest consequences'' if Iraq violates the February accord,
which Annan has conceded that Baghdad has done, ``we don't have to
worry about going back and getting approval for a use of force,'' a
senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last crisis, the official said, ``we ramped up militarily
first and then had to backtrack and build up diplomatic support.''
This time ``we can ramp up the diplomacy first in a way that is
harder for critics and opponents to object to and that doesn't
allow Saddam to set the timetable.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States is urging a Security Council meeting by the
end of the week to respond to letters sent Wednesday by the leader
of the inspection team, Richard Butler, and his counterpart at the
International Atomic Energy Agency. Those letters informed the
council that neither agency could any longer carry out
investigations and that both were limited in monitoring Iraq's
actions. The letters asked the council for instructions.
</P>
<P>
   If efforts by Annan and the council fail to insure Iraqi
compliance, another official said, it should be easier than it was
six months ago to keep the Security Council united and secure broad
support for military action, if necessary, against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they had expected Saddam to challenge the
February agreement. After that crisis ended with Annan's
intervention, the senior Clinton foreign-policy team tried to draft
their new approach to the next crisis. ``We do learn from our
experiences,'' a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago ambivalence among Arab countries, opposition by
many allies to the use of force against Iraq and doubts expressed
in the United States made clear to Washington the need for broader
support. The notion of bombing Iraq and killing civilians over the
principle of access by inspectors was not sufficiently convincing,
some officials said. That prompted a shift in emphasis, to
retaliation for active Iraqi misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States continues to insist that Iraq live up
to its commitment to provide unrestricted access for weapons
inspectors, the officials stress the ability of the United States
to monitor Iraqi behavior through intelligence and satellite and
U-2 spy plane photos.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we determine that Iraq is reconstituting its program of
weapons of mass destruction or its missile delivery systems or
threatening its neighbors, we can respond with the force we
currently have,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also noted an irony. Washington's position might have
been more difficult to defend if Saddam had cooperated with the
inspectors, who could have then declared Iraq free of chemical and
nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver them. That would have made
it harder to counter French and Russian demands for at least a
partial lifting of sanctions in response.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ In a serious setback for Western
governments hoping to end the war in Kosovo through negotiations,
the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova, Thursday named a team
to negotiate peace with the Serbs that does not have the ingredient
that diplomats consider essential to success: representatives of
all ethnic Albanian political forces.
</P>
<P>
   It lacks any representatives of the rebel army fighting Serbia's
rule of Kosovo, meaning its authority to reach agreements binding
on the rebels is doubtful. Many rebel leaders are openly
contemptuous of ethnic Albanian politicians, whom they consider to
be stooges of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more devastating to the Western diplomatic
strategy, Rugova's chief aide predicted that the negotiating team
would unquestionably fail because Western governments insist it
cannot negotiate independence for Kosovo, which almost all ethnic
Albanians demand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a negotiating team that could lead to the end of the
war, the announcement seemed to confirm the deep divisions among
Kosovo's Albanians that will make the war continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good,'' a Western diplomat said. ``But it is the best
we can do. The hope is the Yugoslav government will want to have
negotiations succeed and will give this team some tangible
concessions that will bring it the legitimacy it doesn't have
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that isn't much, but there is no alternative because
the Albanian politicians are too divided,'' the diplomat said,
insisting on anonymity. ``Everyone wants to be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Other diplomats said the concessions hoped for included
withdrawal of government forces from parts of Kosovo or limited
self-rule for the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But there was not much optimism among either diplomats or
Albanian political leaders in Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Five hours before the announcement of the negotiating team,
which U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill helped put together,
Rugova's chief aide, Alush Gashi, said the team had no chance to
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These diplomats threaten us by saying, `If you don't do this,
you will be on your own, the West will go.''' Gashi said.
``Ambassador Hill is blaming us for not uniting. But we can't unite
for anything less than independence, without that the war will
continue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday, Hill called for the Yugoslav government to start talks
with the team announced by Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   The West's position is that granting independence to ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo would fortify the hopes of ethnic Albanians in
Macedonia for independence. That would destabilize one of the most
fragile states in Europe's volatile southeast. Changing the borders
of Yugoslavia _ which now consists of Serbia and Montenegro _ could
also unravel the Dayton peace accord that stitched Bosnia together
after its three-and-a-half-year war.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the deepest divisions among ethnic Albanians are
between its feuding politicians and many of the rebels. In the
countryside, peasant farmers who are bound to a very traditional
way of life and make up most of the rebel forces often accuse
political leaders of being the source of their problems with the
Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not Albanians,'' charged a rebel commander with the
nom de guerre of Lion. ``They are collaborators with Albanian
names. They are tools of the Serbs, and without them the Serbs
couldn't rule us. They are traitors to their people.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. diplomats say they recognized late last year that while
they had assumed that Rugova represented all ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, there was a large and growing split between him and rural
ethnic Albanians who thought his philosophy of nonviolence was not
working.
</P>
<P>
   After Kosovo exploded into war this year, much of the diplomatic
effort has been to reduce the differences between Rugova, along
with the other political leaders in the provincial capital of
Pristina, and the hard-core guerrilla leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement of a negotiating committee that does not
include the guerrillas seems to show that the diplomats have
failed. Although a substantial number of rebels say they still
respect Rugova, and he could possibly win their support for a deal
with the government, many others favor war over negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In his stronghold in mountains southeast of Pristina, the rebel
commander called Lion wore traditional Albanian costume _ with two
modern additions. He had the traditional tall, brimless white felt
cap, the white vest with black embroidery and the baggy homespun
wool trousers. But on one side of the sash that wrapped his middle
and extended to one knee, he had stuffed a semiautomatic pistol. On
the other side hung a two-way radio.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the carpeted floor of the village house where he was
born, he described how he and others had worked to create the
Kosovo Liberation Army and today's rebellion, and why they hated
the political leaders now named to negotiate a peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It began in 1990 when we saw that Yugoslavia could not hold
together and we had a chance to make our own country,'' he said.
``We worked clandestinely starting cells in all the villages around
here. We were preparing ourselves and the people psychologically
and physically for a guerrilla war. We were preparing for what we
have today.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that until 1993 he worked full time as an organizer,
financed by ethnic Albanians in his region and abroad. During that
time, he said, he made several trips to Albania for training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police were looking for me here, but I was living in the
forests, and they could not find me because I had the support of
the people,'' he said. ``The proof that I am a patriot and Rugova
is a collaborator is that I was considered an enemy of the state
and had to hide, while Rugova lived freely in Pristina.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander, who is in his late 30s, said he was only
one of the latest leaders of an Albanian independence movement that
he traces to a revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1878. ``I had
teachers I could follow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those politicians who call themselves Albanians were making
business deals and political deals with the Serbs,'' he said.
``They became the local representatives of the occupiers. They got
rich and we suffered. To them independence for Kosovo is a threat
to their power, and we will never trust them.''

 &HT;    Honda unveils new Acura
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Honda Motor Co. on Thursday launched the Acura
3.2TL, the newest vehicle in its arsenal that's expected to capture
a large chunk of the luxury sedan market.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese automaker has begun manufacturing the new Acura
exclusively at its assembly plant in Marysville, Ohio, which
already makes the No. 1 selling Honda Accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Marysville plant is expected to produce about 40,000 new
Acuras per year for the U.S. and another 30,000 that will be
exported to Japan and other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Acura TL model, introduced earlier this year at the North
American International Auto Show, will go on sale in about three
weeks. The vehicle's sticker price is expected to be about $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Honda officials said the new Acura creates additional job
security for the company's 13,000 workers at four plants in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``These vehicles don't compete against each other, so when one
is down, the other can pick it up. We've been running at full
capacity here for quite some time, but that's a nice challenge to
have in this industry,'' said Ron Shriver, plant manager of the
Marysville factory.
</P>
<P>
   The new Acura also is good news for many Dayton-area companies
that supply components to Honda. More than 400 U.S. companies
supply parts for Honda's Ohio-made vehicles. Honda also operates a
motorcycle factory in Marysville and an engine plant in Anna. The
new 3.2-liter V6 engine for the new Acura will be produced at the
Anna plant.
</P>
<P>
   Acura's TL follows the Acura CL, which has been built at Honda's
plant in East Liberty since 1996. The East Liberty plant also
produces the Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Lambert, spokesman for Honda of America Manufacturing in
Marysville, said the company made room for the new Acura sedan by
shifting Accord station wagon production to Japan.

 &HT;    Air Force base focuses on space vehicles
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ This week's flight test of a possible future
spaceplane underscored the shifting emphasis in research at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base from aircraft to space vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   A 22-foot-long, 90 percent scale model of the so-called Space
Maneuver Vehicle was tested Tuesday in New Mexico, but the Air
Vehicles Directorate at Wright-Pat is a partner in the $12 million
research program.
</P>
<P>
   The directorate's Trans-Atmospheric and Space Office tested the
vehicle's structural design last September. Wright-Pat research is
also developing and testing advanced structures, thermal protection
systems and guidance systems for the space plane.
</P>
<P>
   The other partner is the Space Vehicles Directorate at Kirtland
Air Force Base in New Mexico. Both are units of the Air Force
Research Laboratory, which also has its headquarters at Wright-Pat.
</P>
<P>
   The program is focusing on a Boeing Co. design that addresses
the Air Force's interest in reusable spaceplanes that could be
launched quickly and perform a variety of missions. It reflects the
Air Force's vision of itself as an integrated force that operates
routinely in the air and space.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Richard Paul, commander of the Air Force Research
Laboratory, has said the lab will support the vision by shifting
resources from aviation to space research.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's test, a helicopter dropped the pilotless vehicle
from 9,000 feet above Holloman Air Force Base. Guiding itself, the
2,600-pound craft glided on stubby wings to a 180-mile-per-hour
runway landing. Space Vehicles spokesman John Brownlee said the
1.5-minute flight simulated the approach and landing phases of a
return from orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Air Force's interest in spaceplanes, the program's
future is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, what we have funded is three free flights,'' said
Harry Karasopoulos of the Air Vehicles Directorate at Wright-Pat.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force would have to get new funding to go to the next
phase, which would add a rocket to the spaceplane and ultimately a
booster for flights to orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House has shown little support for spaceplane
research. President Clinton vetoed a line item in this year's
budget for a related program called the Military Space Plane.

JUDGE IN HARRELSON CASE WITHDRAWS IN CONTROVERSY 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal judge who was to decide whether Charles
Harrelson should get a new trial withdrew from the case Thursday
because he played basketball with actor Woody Harrelson, the
convicted killer's son.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Fred Biery of San Antonio stepped aside amid
mounting controversy after he acknowledged playing several
one-on-one games with Harrelson at his hotel gym during a three-day
hearing in Denver last week.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson, who starred in the basketball movie ``White Men Can't
Jump,'' is paying his father's legal costs. The elder Harrelson is
serving two life terms for the 1979 murder of U.S. District Judge
John Wood, who was shot in the back with a hunting rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Biery on Wednesday had given lawyers for both sides the chance
to anonymously request that the case be reassigned. But Thursday,
following a growing furor that included stinging editorials in the
San Antonio Express-News and the Houston Chronicle, Biery made the
move himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buck stops here,'' Biery wrote in his order. ``The court
does not wish to put counsel in the position of having to make that
decision. Even if neither side were to seek reassignment, the
controversy would continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's bid for a new trial was then assigned to U.S.
District Judge Orlando Garcia of San Antonio, who indicated a new
hearing was not likely. The Denver hearing focused on Harrelson's
claim of ineffective council, in particular the role a local lawyer
who was also a suspect in the Wood murder played in Harrelson's
defense
</P>
<P>
   The pickup game occurred after the final day of the hearing at a
downtown Denver health club affiliated with the Embassy Suites
Hotel, where Biery and others involved with the Harrelson hearing
were staying.
</P>
<P>
   Though Biery refused to talk Thursday, he said earlier in the
week that he and Harrelson met by chance in the gym and decided to
play after a short chat. Though the actor who won his fame on
``Cheers'' expressed some reluctance, Biery told him they could
play as long as they did not discuss his father's case.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say Biery's actions gave the appearance of
impropriety, which the judicial code of conduct says federal judges
must avoid. In Thursday's editions, the Express-News ran a cartoon
of Biery and Harrelson on the basketball court under the title,
``White Man Can't Judge.'' In it, Biery says, ``Say Woody, how
'bout some hoops?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Biery could have walked away from the game with Harrelson, but
he didn't,'' said the newspaper in an editorial, calling on the
Clinton appointee to ``walk away from the case if he is truly
concerned about the perception of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Biery said Wednesday in a letter to the lawyers
involved in the case that ``For the past 20 years of judicial
service, I have `called them as I see them' based on the facts and
the law irrespective of the people involved.'' He also acknowledged
socializing with several witnesses who testified against Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   Biery is known to local attorneys as a judge who may play golf
with them on the weekend only to rule against them Monday morning.
In San Antonio's relatively small legal world, he is known as
sociable, accessible _ and athletic. He played basketball in high
school and at Texas Lutheran College.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it's up to him to set his own standard,'' said
Charles Silver, a law professor at the University of Texas. ``Is he
not supposed to play basketball with the lawyers who practice in
his courtroom?''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more predictably, Harrelson lawyers said the criticism
of Biery was undue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of appearance of impropriety is being maligned
here,'' said David Michael, a San Francisco defense attorney who
heads the team representing Charles Harrelson. ``Federal judges
socialize. To isolate them is to remove human nature from the legal
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors involved in the case declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said Biery ought to have known better, especially
since he recognized the sensitivity surrounding the Harrelson case
when he moved the hearing from San Antonio to Denver for reasons of
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that a judge concerned about the implications of
holding the hearing in a San Antonio courthouse named after Wood
ought also to be concerned about the implications of pickup
basketball with Woody Harrelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take a law degree and years before the bar to
understand that appearances do matter in the relationships between
judges and those who appear before them in court,'' said the
Chronicle editorial on Thursday.

COLLECTOR TO SURRENDER DEGAS PASTEL PLUNDERED BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major victory for the family of a Holocaust victim, a
wealthy Chicago art collector agreed Thursday to surrender
possession of an Edgar Degas landscape that was allegedly plundered
from the art collection of a Dutch Jewish couple who died in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by drug company heir Daniel C. Searle to settle the
case comes just before a federal jury in Chicago was to hear the
case and amid growing public interest in how artworks plundered in
Nazi-occupied Europe nearly 60 years ago made their way into
American collections.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Searle will cede a half interest in the
landscape to the heirs of Friedrich and Louise Gutmann, and donate
the remaining half to the Art Institute of Chicago. The museum, in
turn, will acquire the Degas by having it appraised and paying
Gutmann's heirs half the value of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Searle, by art world standards, was the typical innocent
purchaser when he paid $850,000 in 1987 for the Degas pastel
monotype, ``Landcsape with Smokestacks,'' asking few questions
about its past ownership and relying on the expertise of curators
from the Art Institute. They hoped that Searle, a museum trustee,
would donate the Degas to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But according to pre-trial depositions, reported last year by
the Globe, two museum curators missed evidence pointing to flaws in
the monotype's ownership records, including the fact that it was
once owned by Hans Wendland, perhaps the most succcessful wartime
fence for art looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed two years ago by the Gutmanns' daughter, Lili
Gutmann, and her two nephews, Nick and Simon Goodman of Los
Angeles, was the most prominent of a number of recent legal
disputes over wartime looting, because of Searle's prominence, the
museum's involvement and the tragedy that befell Freidrich and
Louise Gutmann.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major Jewish art collectors in Western Europe whose
collections were confiscated by the Nazis, the Gutmanns were the
only ones who lost their lives as well. Friedrich Gutmann was
beaten to death at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia; his wife died
in the gas chambers at Auschwitz in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was amicable, according to a statement released
Thursday by the Art Institute on behalf of Searle and the Gutmann
heirs. ``This settlement, which allows us to preserve the pastel's
history in one of the country's finest art museums, represents a
fair resolution to this complex issue,'' said Nick Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   James N. Wood, the museum's director, said the settlement allows
the museum ``to bring an important work of art to the public while
taking into account the history of World War II and the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is a prominent member of a panel of the Association of Art
Museum Directors, which pledged in June that member museums would
do a thorough search of their collections to ensure that none of
their artworks were unrecovered wartime loot.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, though, bubbles an intense debate over the
extent to which the American art world, in its eagerness to acquire
works by famous European artists like Degas during and after the
war, sometimes ignored warning signs about the origin of some of
that art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the Art Institute,'' Willi Korte, an
art investigator who worked for Gutmann's heirs, said last night.
``The museum gets a very nice landscape they wanted from the
beginning, and they avoid a great number of embarrassing questions
at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the two curators testified in pre-trial
depositions that they were unaware of wartime looting. Estimates
vary, but many scholars believe the Nazis plundered about a fifth
of the world's art treasures in occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A museum spokeswoman could not be reached to comment on Korte's
remark. But in the past, the museum and its attorneys have said the
curators took reasonable precautions before recommending that
Searle buy the work by Degas. The Impressionist was noted for his
monotypes, works pressed onto paper after being painted on glass
with printing ink, and then enhanced by pastels. ``Ravishing'' was
how one of the Art Institute's curators described the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Kline of Washington, the Gutmann heirs' attorney, said
that Friedrich Gutmann sent the Degas, along with other works, to a
Paris art dealer for safekeeping before the Nazis overran Holland
in 1940. But Kline said the Paris dealer, also a Jew, fled when the
Nazis invaded France, and that records show that members of the
Nazi art looting unit seized the dealer's wares.
</P>
<P>
   Searle's lawyers had argued, however, that the Degas was not
listed among the seized artworks, and that Gutmann had sent it to
Paris for sale, not safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But after a federal judge ruled earlier this month that the case
would be tried before a jury starting September 9, Searle,
according to investigator Korte, agreed to a settlement the Gutmann
heirs proposed more than a year ago. Korte said he believes Searle
spent more than $1 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Gutmanns lost more than 40 works of art, many of
which have never been recovered. Kline, their attorney, who has
several major successes recovering looted art for victims, obtained
a settlement last year on a Botticelli the family once owned. He is
now pursuing for them a Renoir that is believed to be owned by a
British collector.

   DALIAN, China _ Thwack!
</P>
<P>
   ``Dammit!''
</P>
<P>
   A red croquet ball meandered to the far side of the playing
field, moving in the wrong direction and dragging a sour grimace
across the doughy face of the woman who had set it in motion. She
had missed the first wicket, again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old lady, if you can't get through No. 1, how are we ever
going to win?'' groused one of her teammates, a sharp-eyed man in a
cheap-looking shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The old lady, as Sun Bixia does not particularly like being
called, muttered a piquant expletive. Harsh language, coming from a
mature woman of 68. But croquet is war in these parts, and there is
no time for niceties.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet, or ``gate ball'' as they call it here, is the game of
the moment in China. Among the elderly, anyhow. In cities
throughout northern China, retired and not-completely-retired
people are spending much of their summer days playing it, and they
compete with a ferocity that seems almost primal.
</P>
<P>
   At Middle Mountain Park here in Dalian, a coastal metropolis
braced by fresh sea air, 10 retirees gather most mornings at a
grassless green, playing against each other in two teams of five.
Croquet is becoming popular, as one man put it, for its genteel
combination of physical exercise and social activity.
</P>
<P>
   But human nature being what it is, darker impulses have a way of
sneaking to the surface. These calm-looking older people become
competitive _ vicious, even _ as soon as play begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was terrible!'' hollered Wang Zhixia at a teammate who
missed a shot and who looked wounded by Wang's remark. ``Next time,
next time,'' the teammate muttered softly as he looked down, as if
to reassure himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Wang's turn. He surveyed the sandy ground like a
world-class golfer, checking the angles and using the broad side of
his wooden mallet to smooth out the dirt immediately in front of
his ball for a clean path.
</P>
<P>
   Swinging the mallet evenly between his ankles, he knocked his
croquet ball just hard enough for it to thump someone else's,
winning Wang an extra shot and the coveted right to whack his
competitor's ball as far away as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Thwack !
</P>
<P>
   The red croquet ball zipped across the field, swift and straight
as a cannonball, stopped only by a wall at the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most fun is hitting someone else's ball,'' Wang confided
later, smirking at the thought. ``You push yourself ahead, and them
behind, at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was Mrs. Sun's turn again. No go. She missed the first
wicket again.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet came to Dalian, and to neighboring cities in China's
northeast, with Japanese invaders during World War II. It was a
summer pastime for Japanese military officers, but the locals who
learned to play had to give it up during China's fanatically
leftist years, when it was considered too bourgeois.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is back, promoted by the Dalian Old Cadres Association as
a suitable form of exercise for elderly people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping it will be recognized as an official sport by the
All-China Sports Federation,'' said Nie Dongli, an official at the
association. ``We don't have an answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nie pointed out that China has formal associations, with senior
officials as honorary chairman, for sports as obscure as luge and
fin swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We too want to get on the list,'' he said. ``There's no reason
gate ball can not become a national sport.''
</P>
<P>
   To Nie, tough competition among elderly croquet players is
perfectly understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play to win,'' he said. ``You think just because a man is
a grandfather he doesn't want to win ?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Croquet is played here with only three wickets and a single
post, a simpler version than the game played in backyards in the
United States and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough,'' grumbled Mrs. Sun. ``Why make it any more
complicated?''
</P>
<P>
   Soon it was Mrs. Sun's turn yet again. No go. She missed the
first wicket, again.
</P>
<P>
   One teammate murmured words of consolation. Two others shook
their heads in apparent disgust. Another player, on the opposing
team, giggled in undisguised delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 5! Your turn !'' hollered a man in a black baseball cap,
referring to Fan Junsheng by the number of his croquet ball.
</P>
<P>
   Fan hustled over to the far side of the pitch, where his ball
had landed after being sent whacking by a competitor two turns
back. He looked out at the field for the longest time, apparently
calculating the best path toward the next wicket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster !'' hollered the man in the black cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming, I'm coming,'' muttered Fan, before he finally took
a swing, sending his ball well toward wicket No. 3, but not through
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried disco, I tried ballroom dancing, but this is the
best,'' said Fan, now a croquet devotee even though he admits his
play is sub-par. ``My wife kept telling me to get out of the house.
Now she asks why I stay out all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the morning's game was winding up. And just before her team
lost, Mrs. Sun finally got her ball through the first wicket. She
had clearly not helped her team, but it was a small victory for her
anyway. She smiled like a child.
</P>
<P>
   As she packed away her mallet, putting the croquet balls in a
canvas bag, Mrs. Sun had a final thought.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet may look easy, she said, but it's deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting the ball just right, that's hard,'' she said.

REBELS TIGHTEN HOLD ON REGION OUTSIDE KINSHASA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ Rebels apparently knocked out all electrical
power to the capital Thursday and tightened their hold on a
strategic region outside this city.
</P>
<P>
   Ministers in the government of President Laurent Kabila insisted
that the problem was a mere technical fault. But the electrical
failure was taken by most here, from the angry crowds in the
streets to the diplomats in their offices, as proof that official
claims of recent advances in the war were fictitious and that the
end was near for Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the rebel breakthrough
in the 10-day-old insurgency, but as the sun set on this capital of
5 million, near total darkness, along with a distinct air of worry,
settled over the city.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said they had broken out of positions to the
southwest of Kinshasa where they were said to have been encircled
by government troops, and seized the Inga dam, by far Africa's
largest hydroelectric generator.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the power went out, at about 3 p.m., rebel
communiques from the headquarters of the uprising in the far
eastern city of Goma began asserting that they had also taken the
strategic western cities of Matadi, which is about 200 miles from
here, and Boma.
</P>
<P>
   By controlling Boma and Matadi, the rebels can stop many of the
food supplies and foreign imports that reach the rest of the
country by way of the seaport at the mouth of the Congo River and
the rail line and national road that links it with the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said Thursday night that if the rebels'
assertions were confirmed, Kabila would have trouble defending
Kinshasa. Moreover, if the pattern of recent conflicts here
continues, they said, the capital could itself ``fall'' with little
or no fighting, save last-minute looting by panicked government
forces as they flee.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night it was reported that Kabila had dismissed
the new military commander, Celestine Kifwa, his brother-in-law,
who replaced the commander dismissed just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would seem like this rebel/Rwandan force has tricks up its
sleeve that nobody around here even thought of,'' said one Western
diplomat. ``Hitting the Inga dam is already the second thing in
that sort of vein.''
</P>
<P>
   The first big surprise of the war, which began abruptly on Aug.
2, was the opening of a far western front almost immediately after
the rebels captured a string of eastern towns along the border with
Rwanda. Flying commandeered commercial jets across the country,
they quickly captured a major western military base at Kitona.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, Congolese officials have denounced the uprising
as a thinly veiled Rwandan invasion of their country. Western
diplomats have been muted in their criticism of Rwanda, but they
have generally acknowledged that Congo's eastern neighbor, once
Kabila's most important patron, has been a crucial backer of the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, long an obscure guerrilla leader in eastern Zaire, as
this country was formerly known, seized power in May 1997 after a
seven-month rebellion against Mobutu, the longtime dictator. That
rebellion, like the current one, was strongly supported by Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has since fallen out with his sponsors in both Rwanda and
its neighbor, Uganda, in part because of what they say is his
failure to control rebel incursions against those two countries
from Congo's vast eastern hinterlands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For his part, Kabila insists that Rwanda has territorial and
economic designs on his country, the third-largest in Africa.
According to Kabila, Rwanda first sought to control his government
through a cadre of Congolese officials of Tutsi heritage, and when
that failed, simply decided to annex or take de facto control of
the east.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of relative quiet on the battle front, the
day seemed to begin auspiciously for Kabila and his supporters.
Following several days of heavy mass recruitment of young
volunteers for the war effort, the government convened a news
conference at which it presented a large group of generals who had
served under Mobutu and were now promoting the new government's
cause.
</P>
<P>
   During a detailed briefing Thursday morning, one minister
painted a confident picture of the western front, saying that the
government had killed hundreds of rebels and was now essentially
mopping up recently invaded areas near the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rwanda, which planned this whole thing, is at its peak
readiness, and Congo, which was caught by surprise, is at its
lowest point in preparation,'' the minister said. ``But they are in
trouble already, and things are going to get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the power went out Thursday afternoon, Information Minister
Desire Mumengi attempted to put the best face on the situation,
saying during a hurried telephone interview: ``What we have is a
technical problem. The experts are working and will have power
restored shortly.'' But as midnight approached, the city remained
dark.
</P>
<P>
   A number of senior government officials were already reported to
be making contingency plans for fleeing the capital. Although it
could not be officially confirmed, a knowledgeable expert in local
transportation said that Kabila had sent several close family
members to the southern city of Lubumbashi, the capital of his
native region.
</P>
<P>
   With no electricity, the government has been deprived of the
ability to communicate to the population by national radio, if only
to contain a wave of panic.
</P>
<P>
   According to well-informed business people, conditions began to
sour for the government earlier in the day when troops in the west
began to panic after a brief engagement with the rebels near Boma.
Stealing whatever vehicles they could commandeer, the fleeing
troops made for the country's major port at Matadi, which is the
capital of Lower Congo Province.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh government troops had been sent to that city overnight by
rail, but rather than being deployed to the front, they quickly
found themselves fighting a rearguard action to stop the flight of
their own comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that the commander for the whole western front fled
yesterday,'' one businessman with extensive contacts in Matadi said
Thursday. ``This sent the troops into a panic. The government has
sent some other commanders down there, but the situation was
already getting out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Another government effort at reinforcement collapsed when a
munitions supply flight to Matadi had to be aborted after rebels
fired on the cargo plane. It later reportedly made an emergency
landing in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday afternoon, from their headquarters in the
eastern city of Goma, the rebels were claiming to control virtually
all of the southwest, including Inga, Boma and Matadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has very little time to turn this situation
around,'' said one Western diplomat. ``It is not like it has no
cards left at all, but the sentiment shifts here very quickly, and
when cities start falling, it gets to be very difficult to stop the
momentum.''

COLLECTOR TO SURRENDER DEGAS PASTEL PLUNDERED BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major victory for the family of a Holocaust victim, a
wealthy Chicago art collector agreed Thursday to surrender
possession of an Edgar Degas landscape that was allegedly plundered
from the art collection of a Dutch Jewish couple who died in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by drug company heir Daniel C. Searle to settle the
case comes just before a federal jury in Chicago was to hear the
case and amid growing public interest in how artworks plundered in
Nazi-occupied Europe nearly 60 years ago made their way into
American collections.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Searle will cede a half interest in the
landscape to the heirs of Friedrich and Louise Gutmann, and donate
the remaining half to the Art Institute of Chicago. The museum, in
turn, will acquire the Degas by having it appraised and paying
Gutmann's heirs half the value of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Searle, by art world standards, was the typical innocent
purchaser when he paid $850,000 in 1987 for the Degas pastel
monotype, ``Landcsape with Smokestacks,'' asking few questions
about its past ownership and relying on the expertise of curators
from the Art Institute. They hoped that Searle, a museum trustee,
would donate the Degas to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But according to pre-trial depositions, reported last year by
the Globe, two museum curators missed evidence pointing to flaws in
the monotype's ownership records, including the fact that it was
once owned by Hans Wendland, perhaps the most succcessful wartime
fence for art looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed two years ago by the Gutmanns' daughter, Lili
Gutmann, and her two nephews, Nick and Simon Goodman of Los
Angeles, was the most prominent of a number of recent legal
disputes over wartime looting, because of Searle's prominence, the
museum's involvement and the tragedy that befell Freidrich and
Louise Gutmann.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major Jewish art collectors in Western Europe whose
collections were confiscated by the Nazis, the Gutmanns were the
only ones who lost their lives as well. Friedrich Gutmann was
beaten to death at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia; his wife died
in the gas chambers at Auschwitz in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was amicable, according to a statement released
Thursday by the Art Institute on behalf of Searle and the Gutmann
heirs. ``This settlement, which allows us to preserve the pastel's
history in one of the country's finest art museums, represents a
fair resolution to this complex issue,'' said Nick Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   James N. Wood, the museum's director, said the settlement allows
the museum ``to bring an important work of art to the public while
taking into account the history of World War II and the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is a prominent member of a panel of the Association of Art
Museum Directors, which pledged in June that member museums would
do a thorough search of their collections to ensure that none of
their artworks were unrecovered wartime loot.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, though, bubbles an intense debate over the
extent to which the American art world, in its eagerness to acquire
works by famous European artists like Degas during and after the
war, sometimes ignored warning signs about the origin of some of
that art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the Art Institute,'' Willi Korte, an
art investigator who worked for Gutmann's heirs, said last night.
``The museum gets a very nice landscape they wanted from the
beginning, and they avoid a great number of embarrassing questions
at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the two curators testified in pre-trial
depositions that they were unaware of wartime looting. Estimates
vary, but many scholars believe the Nazis plundered about a fifth
of the world's art treasures in occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A museum spokeswoman could not be reached to comment on Korte's
remark. But in the past, the museum and its attorneys have said the
curators took reasonable precautions before recommending that
Searle buy the work by Degas. The Impressionist was noted for his
monotypes, works pressed onto paper after being painted on glass
with printing ink, and then enhanced by pastels. ``Ravishing'' was
how one of the Art Institute's curators described the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Kline of Washington, the Gutmann heirs' attorney, said
that Friedrich Gutmann sent the Degas, along with other works, to a
Paris art dealer for safekeeping before the Nazis overran Holland
in 1940. But Kline said the Paris dealer, also a Jew, fled when the
Nazis invaded France, and that records show that members of the
Nazi art looting unit seized the dealer's wares.
</P>
<P>
   Searle's lawyers had argued, however, that the Degas was not
listed among the seized artworks, and that Gutmann had sent it to
Paris for sale, not safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But after a federal judge ruled earlier this month that the case
would be tried before a jury starting September 9, Searle,
according to investigator Korte, agreed to a settlement the Gutmann
heirs proposed more than a year ago. Korte said he believes Searle
spent more than $1 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Gutmanns lost more than 40 works of art, many of
which have never been recovered. Kline, their attorney, who has
several major successes recovering looted art for victims, obtained
a settlement last year on a Botticelli the family once owned. He is
now pursuing for them a Renoir that is believed to be owned by a
British collector.

 &HT;    Refinery revived in Louisiana
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to ``...upriver....'' in lede.)
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOOD HOPE, La. _ A little ways upriver from New Orleans, some
5,000 workers have been resurrecting an oil refinery that lay
dormant for 15 years. When it is complete, it will process 230,000
barrels of crude oil a day.
</P>
<P>
   To those unfamiliar with the oil industry, those facts probably
are irrelevant. But insiders are raising their eyebrows and
stepping in for a better look because this is the first major
American refinery to go on line in 20 years. As such, it represents
the largest single addition to American oil refining capacity in
two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The revived refinery is a sign of the times. Not too long ago,
there was a glut of oil products on the U.S. market. Today, there
is a 2 billion barrel deficit every day in the United States,
caused by increased use of oil and gas and a decrease in the
nation's refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But refining profits are on an upswing, and demand, which lately
has been increasing about 2 percent a year, will only increase,
experts say, as long as the economy stays strong and Americans
continue to favor gas-guzzling luxury cars and sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   And just as the oil industry has reinvented itself after the
bust years of the late 1970s and 1980s, so too has TransAmerican,
which owns the facility. The refinery went bankrupt in 1983 thanks
to incredibly bad timing: The bottom fell out of the oil market
just as the company had completed a $1 billion expansion and
doubled its refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shut the plant down in 1983 and mothballed it,'' said Gary
Karr, vice president of refining. ``At that time, we didn't know
how long we'd be down. But the intent all along was to restart the
refinery.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, TransAmerican is placing itself in a niche.
The refinery will process heavy, sour crudes from overseas _ mostly
Venezuela _ into gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel and heating oil.
Heavy crudes are more complicated to handle but are more profitable
because they are cheaper to buy than the oil most American
refineries process.
</P>
<P>
   When the refinery is fully operational, it will produce more
than 200,000 barrels a day, offsetting 10 percent of the nation's
daily deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Because the environmental permit process has become so strict
within the last decade, there probably won't be much competition
coming on line any time soon. TransAmerican escaped that problem by
spending millions of dollars over the past 15 years keeping permits
active.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are hurdles. The refinery is in deep debt; it took
a capital investment of almost $700 million to get the refinery
rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a financial point of view, there is a significant amount
of debt on the refinery, but doing business as we do gives us an
advantage,'' said Glen McGinnis, chief operating officer for
Trans-American. ``There's nobody that can take as much of the
percentage of the crude as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Wall, spokesman for the Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil &AMP; Gas
Association, said some of the other refining companies are
surprised by TransAmerican's move to go back on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are wondering why they would make that investment
at this time _ oil prices are fluctuating pretty wildly right
now,'' Wall said. ``It's a pretty bold step.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur ``Bud'' Tower of Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs
Inc., a New Orleans investment firm, said this move is typical of
TransAmerican's owner, Jack Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been attempting to make a go of this refinery for many
years,'' he said. ``Clearly conditions now favor opening it, as
opposed to four years ago. But I'm not sure it says anything about
where the industry is going. Is somebody else doing to build a
grass-roots refinery in the United States? I seriously doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley would not be interviewed, but McGinnis said he is well
aware that people are watching TransAmerican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our competitors started out by saying, `You're
crazy,''' he said. ``But in the last six or eight months, as we've
gotten closer to finishing, the other refineries have become
believers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the company is determined to make it happen and to make it
happen on schedule. To attract and keep construction workers, who
are traditionally migrant and often stay in jobs only temporarily,
TransAmerican has been raffling off a new Dodge truck every month.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery's reopening has been a boon to St. Charles Parish,
which was devastated when it closed 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the refinery is back, and once construction is complete, it
will need some 1,000 permanent workers to keep it running.

MICROSOFT, JUSTICE DEPTARTMENT SEEK TWO-WEEK DELAY OF TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The trial of Microsoft should be delayed for two
weeks beyond the scheduled Sept. 8 start date, lawyers for the
government and the company told a judge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   According to several people involved with the case, the lawyers
proposed the delay in a conference call with U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson. Jackson, who has been anxious to keep the
trial on schedule, has not yet decided whether to approve the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Justice Department and Microsoft declined to
comment on the conference call. A spokeswoman for New York Attorney
General Dennis Vacco would say only that ``we don't believe there
will be a material delay in the trial date.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the attorneys general of 20 states
and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits against Microsoft in
May, accusing the company of illegal anticompetitive practices in
its bid to gain share in the market for Internet browsers.
Microsoft denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A delay in the trial has been widely anticipated for several
days, after lawyers for the New York Times, the Seattle Times, ZDTV
and ZDNet intervened in the case, arguing that a little-known 1913
statute allows the public access to depositions in antitrust cases.
Jackson agreed, and 25 scheduled depositions, including those of 17
Microsoft executives, are now on hold while a federal appeals court
decides whether to uphold his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the government and the news media are supposed to
file briefs Friday explaining to the appeals court why they believe
the depositions should be open. Microsoft, which has argued that
opening the depositions is legally unjustified and risks revealing
trade secrets and delaying the process, is supposed to reply on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court could decide as soon as Monday whether to
grant Microsoft's request that the depositions be held behind
closed doors, with the option that the news media could later view
the depositions on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the possibility that the depositions will be
public, lawyers for the government and Microsoft held talks
Thursday about the protocol for allowing public access to
depositions, and are hopeful they will reach agreement soon. They
must decide how many people would be allowed to view the
depositions, how those people would be chosen, and whether any
recording devices or computers would be allowed in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everybody generally believes that what ought to be
replicated is access as if this were in a courtroom,'' said Adam
Liptak, a lawyer for the New York Times Co. ``This ought to be no
more or less easy to get in ... than it would be if it were held in
Judge Jackson's courtroom.''

</P>
<P>
   _ TV: TBS will telecast tonight, FOX on Saturday. Sunday's game
will not be televised.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP Kevin Millwood (13-6,
4.51 ERA; 1-1, 4.15 lifetime vs. Dodgers) vs. RHP Dave Mlicki (6-5,
4.94; 1-2, 5.93 lifetime vs. Braves). Saturday, RHP John Smoltz

<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta trails the all-time series 230-300 but

</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves swept three from Los Angeles May
4-6, outscoring the Dodgers 19-5 and holding them to a .202
average. Michael Tucker homered twice in the series, and Greg
Maddux threw seven shutout innings in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: The job security of manager Glenn Hoffman, interim GM
Tommy Lasorda and president Bob Graziano all are in jeopardy, and
the Dodgers can barely play .500. The Dodgers had lost three
straight and eight of their last 10 entering Thursday night's game
with Florida, with the Marlins going for a three-game sweep. At 18
games behind San Diego, Los Angeles is the lowest it has been in
the standings all season. . . . The club's big moves simply haven't
panned out. L.A. is 41-38 since dealing Mike Piazza for Gary
Sheffield and Bobby Bonilla and is just 24-22 since firing manager
Bill Russell. . . . There is not a segment of the Dodgers' play
that stands out. The team is hitting .253, 14th in the NL and the
club's on-base percentage (.308) is the lowest in the majors. In
the field, L.A. has committed 112 errors, just four fewer than the
entire 1997 season. And pitching, the pride of the organization,
has been racked by injury. The club ERA of 3.79 is barely average
(seventh in the league) and the club is walking a batter once every
2.5 innings. . . . Second baseman Eric Young remains a tough out,
the fourth-toughest strikeout in the league, once every 16.3
at-bats, and he ranks fourth in the NL with 34 stolen bases. Closer
Jeff Shaw has 34 saves, tied with Chicago's Rod Beck for second
most in the NL behind San Diego's Trevor Hoffman. . . . The Braves
have not faced Dave Mlicki, tonight's starter, yet this year. He is
5-1 since coming to L.A. from New York, getting no decision in his
last outing, an eventual 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh. He has lasted
past the sixth inning only three times in his last seven starts. .
. . On the DL: INF Tripp Cromer (right thigh strain), OF Todd
Hollandsworth (left shoulder surgery), RHP Ramon Martinez (right
rotator surgery), RHP Ismael Valdes (strained right oblique muscle)
and INF Jose Vizcaino (sprained right ankle).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: SS Mark Grudzielanek has hit .318 in five home games
since being acquired from Montreal. Closer Jeff Shaw is 11-for-12
in save conversions as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: OF Gary Sheffield is in a 2-for-18 slide and has not
hit a home run since July 29. 1B Eric Karros has five hits in his
last 28 at-bats. RHP Darren Hall has a 10.32 ERA in his last 11
games.

REVOLUTION SEES SOLE MATES IN MUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Almost every move the Revolution have taken since the
early days of the franchise has failed. They have the worst
three-year record of Major League Soccer's 10 original teams and
they are last in the league this season.
</P>
<P>
   But they are fortunate that the Tampa Bay Mutiny have followed a
similar path the last two years. Tampa's on-field problems started
when coach Thomas Rongen departed after leading the Mutiny to the
league's best regular-season record in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny gradually began dismantling the team Rongen created,
and now it is in fourth place in the Eastern Conference with 21
points in 24 games. Rongen went to the Revolution, who have 19
points in 24 games. The combined point total of the two teams is 8
fewer than that of conference leader D.C. United and 12 fewer than
that of MLS's leading team, the Los Angeles Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mutiny and Revolution meet Friday night, it will be a
battle of both losers and playoff contenders. Though the Revolution
are in worse position after three-quarters of the season than in
their first two years, they could qualify for the playoffs by
overtaking the Mutiny and Miami in the final eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought we would be in this situation again,''
Revolution captain Mike Burns said Thursday. ``The expectations of
the coaches, players, management, owners are so much higher than
this. But rather than dwell on what has happened, you have two
choices. You can throw in the towel or you can forget about the
first 24 games and concentrate on the last eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our playoffs. To dwell on the past is giving up, and
I'm not doing that. The morale is pretty good under the
circumstances. It's a good sign that everybody feels we are a
better team than what we have shown. The way the season's gone,
what we have to do is look at what Colorado did last year. They
made a run at the right time. The league is full of teams which
have gone on streaks. If we can put together a couple of wins, we
can go into the playoffs on an up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the only streaks the Revolution have had lately have been
negative. They set an MLS record for consecutive home defeats with
eight and tied last year's league mark with nine successive
regular-season losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say we have been unlucky, not with our record,'' Burns
said. ``But it is not one area or one player, it's everyone. It's a
combination of everything. We've never been on the same page all
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, it's disappointing. We're in our third
season and we are in the same situation as Year 1 and Year 2. It's
difficult on players, management, and coaches and everyone else.
The only way to salvage the season is to get into the playoffs, and
it's remarkable we still have a chance to do that. We are in the
same boat as Miami and Tampa Bay and we control our own destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have had to keep the faith. Their offseason
acquisitions have failed to make a major impact. Rongen seems to
have lost the winning touch he had at Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start of the season,'' Burns said, ``when you know that
four of the five or six teams make the playoffs, no one thinks they
are going to be the one not to make it. The percentages are so
against you.

COURT BACKS PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS DENIED BY HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court has ruled that Medicare
patients are entitled to immediate hearings and other protections
when they are denied care by health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling on a nationwide class action suit, the court said that
many HMOs had failed to provide adequate explanations for the
denial of benefits and had failed to inform patients of their
appeal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued on Wednesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in San Francisco, was a major victory for consumers.
The lawsuit was filed in Arizona on behalf of nearly 6 million
Medicare patients in HMOs around the country. The opinion, for a
unanimous three-judge panel, was written by Judge Charles Wiggins,
a former Republican congressman from California.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven months, Congress has been engaged in bitter
debate about whether to guarantee similar rights for more than 150
million Americans with private health insurance. The White House
has repeatedly denounced Republicans and HMOs for resisting
President Clinton's demand for a ``patient's bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appellate court said that in running the Medicare HMO
program, federal officials had not lived up to their duty to
guarantee ``due process of law,'' as required by the Fifth
Amendment to the Constitution. Indeed, it said, Medicare officials
have failed to enforce their own rules and have improperly renewed
contracts with HMOs that violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins said Medicare beneficiaries were entitled to due process
because the HMO decisions amount to ``government action.'' HMOs are
private corporations, but when they deny services to Medicare
beneficiaries they act ``as a governmental proxy'' and they are
``federal actors,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government cannot avoid the due process requirements of
the Constitution merely by delegating its duty to determine
Medicare coverage to private entities,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Other courts have reached similar conclusions in cases involving
Medicaid, the federal-state program that provides health care for
poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Medicare is significant because it holds that
beneficiaries have important rights that are rooted in the
Constitution, not merely in statutes or regulations subject to
change by Congress and the president.
</P>
<P>
   The number of beneficiaries in HMOs is rising rapidly and is
expected to reach 10 million, or 25 percent of the Medicare
population, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the HMO industry had argued that
HMOs serving Medicare patients were private entities and that the
federal government should not be held responsible for their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decisions of the HMOs are not government action,'' the
secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, asserted in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health
and Human Services, said Thursday that government lawyers were
studying the decision. ``We absolutely believe in a strong,
independent appeals process, and we have taken steps to strengthen
the appeal rights of Medicare beneficiaries,'' she said. ``But we
have concern about the judge's finding that private HMOs should be
treated as if they were the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs filed suit in 1993 and won a favorable ruling
from the U.S. District Court in Tucson, Ariz., in October 1996.
Shalala then appealed, saying that the judge, Alfredo Marquez, had
usurped her authority and gone further than necessary in protecting
patients' rights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration has been insisting that HMOs provide more
rights to their privately insured customers, and Clinton has
boasted that he voluntarily provided such protections to people
covered by Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hart, a lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy who
represented patients in the Arizona case, said: ``The government is
speaking publicly as if it had an obligation to protect the rights
of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. But in court, it took the
position that it had no legal obligation to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The government issued rules to define Medicare appeal rights in
April 1997, and Congress adopted similar requirements last August.
But Ms. Hart said, ``Many beneficiaries are still not receiving
written notice when services are denied.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court said that ``the appeal rights and other
procedural protections available to Medicare beneficiaries are
meaningless'' if patients do not receive such notices.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, a trade group for HMOs, said: ``We were comfortable with the
Medicare rules issued in 1997. They made important changes that
responded to beneficiaries' concerns. We want to study the court's
decision to compare it with those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ignagni said her group had not taken a position on
legislative proposals to set uniform national standards for appeals
by patients with private health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Gottlich, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law
Center, said: ``This ruling will provide new protection to Medicare
beneficiaries. It goes much further than current federal rules in
requiring HMOs to explain what additional evidence you need to
support your claim, and how to get that evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the court set tighter deadlines. Federal rules say
that an HMO must ordinarily rule within 14 days on a request for
services from a Medicare patient, but the court allows just five
days.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez had issued a detailed order specifying how Medicare
officials should protect patients' rights, including the right to
hearings, and the appellate court upheld that order, over
objections by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   When an HMO denies or terminates a service it must issue a
notice of appeal rights, written ``in at least 12-point type'' that
will be readable by older people, Marquez said. He found that HMO
notices ``were often illegible'' and ``failed to specify the reason
for the denial.''
</P>
<P>
   In urging the appellate court not to expand patients' rights,
the administration said, ``A beneficiary denied service by an HMO
can obtain such services outside the plan and then seek
reimbursement for their cost.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court rejected that argument, saying it was ``of
little comfort to an elderly poor patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez also ordered Shalala to ``monitor and investigate the
compliance of HMOs'' with the requirement for hearings. If she
finds that a health plan failed to comply, he said, she ``is
prohibited from renewing or entering into a subsequent Medicare
contract with the HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   Shalala objected to this part of the judge's order, saying she
should not have to impose such drastic penalties. But the appellate
court said that the penalties were required by the Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Marquez, the other members of the three-judge panel were
Judges Herbert Choy and Mary Schroeder.

   MICROSOFT-GORTON (Washington) Sen. Slade Gorton's advocacy for
Microsoft is being rewarded with campaign contributions from
company executives. During the first six months of this year, 23
Microsoft executives have contributed to Gorton, even though the
state's 70-year-old senior senator isn't currently a candidate for
anything and hasn't announced whether he plans to seek re-election
in 2000. The contributions are far more numerous than ever received
by Gorton from the Redmond-based software giant. In 1997, he
received contributions from eight Microsoft executives, in 1996
none, and in 1995 he received just one contribution, from the
company chairman and chief executive officer, Bill Gates.

COLLECTOR TO SURRENDER DEGAS PASTEL PLUNDERED BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major victory for the family of a Holocaust victim, a
wealthy Chicago art collector agreed Thursday to surrender
possession of an Edgar Degas landscape that was allegedly plundered
from the art collection of a Dutch Jewish couple who died in Nazi
concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by drug company heir Daniel C. Searle to settle the
case comes just before a federal jury in Chicago was to hear the
case and amid growing public interest in how artworks plundered in
Nazi-occupied Europe nearly 60 years ago made their way into
American collections.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Searle will cede a half interest in the
landscape to the heirs of Friedrich and Louise Gutmann, and donate
the remaining half to the Art Institute of Chicago. The museum, in
turn, will acquire the Degas by having it appraised and paying
Gutmann's heirs half the value of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Searle, by art world standards, was the typical innocent
purchaser when he paid $850,000 in 1987 for the Degas pastel
monotype, ``Landcsape with Smokestacks,'' asking few questions
about its past ownership and relying on the expertise of curators
from the Art Institute. They hoped that Searle, a museum trustee,
would donate the Degas to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   But according to pre-trial depositions, reported last year by
the Globe, two museum curators missed evidence pointing to flaws in
the monotype's ownership records, including the fact that it was
once owned by Hans Wendland, perhaps the most succcessful wartime
fence for art looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed two years ago by the Gutmanns' daughter, Lili
Gutmann, and her two nephews, Nick and Simon Goodman of Los
Angeles, was the most prominent of a number of recent legal
disputes over wartime looting, because of Searle's prominence, the
museum's involvement and the tragedy that befell Freidrich and
Louise Gutmann.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major Jewish art collectors in Western Europe whose
collections were confiscated by the Nazis, the Gutmanns were the
only ones who lost their lives as well. Friedrich Gutmann was
beaten to death at Theresienstadt in Czechoslovakia; his wife died
in the gas chambers at Auschwitz in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was amicable, according to a statement released
Thursday by the Art Institute on behalf of Searle and the Gutmann
heirs. ``This settlement, which allows us to preserve the pastel's
history in one of the country's finest art museums, represents a
fair resolution to this complex issue,'' said Nick Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   James N. Wood, the museum's director, said the settlement allows
the museum ``to bring an important work of art to the public while
taking into account the history of World War II and the
Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is a prominent member of a panel of the Association of Art
Museum Directors, which pledged in June that member museums would
do a thorough search of their collections to ensure that none of
their artworks were unrecovered wartime loot.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the surface, though, bubbles an intense debate over the
extent to which the American art world, in its eagerness to acquire
works by famous European artists like Degas during and after the
war, sometimes ignored warning signs about the origin of some of
that art.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for the Art Institute,'' Willi Korte, an
art investigator who worked for Gutmann's heirs, said last night.
``The museum gets a very nice landscape they wanted from the
beginning, and they avoid a great number of embarrassing questions
at the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the two curators testified in pre-trial
depositions that they were unaware of wartime looting. Estimates
vary, but many scholars believe the Nazis plundered about a fifth
of the world's art treasures in occupied Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A museum spokeswoman could not be reached to comment on Korte's
remark. But in the past, the museum and its attorneys have said the
curators took reasonable precautions before recommending that
Searle buy the work by Degas. The Impressionist was noted for his
monotypes, works pressed onto paper after being painted on glass
with printing ink, and then enhanced by pastels. ``Ravishing'' was
how one of the Art Institute's curators described the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Kline of Washington, the Gutmann heirs' attorney, said
that Friedrich Gutmann sent the Degas, along with other works, to a
Paris art dealer for safekeeping before the Nazis overran Holland
in 1940. But Kline said the Paris dealer, also a Jew, fled when the
Nazis invaded France, and that records show that members of the
Nazi art looting unit seized the dealer's wares.
</P>
<P>
   Searle's lawyers had argued, however, that the Degas was not
listed among the seized artworks, and that Gutmann had sent it to
Paris for sale, not safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But after a federal judge ruled earlier this month that the case
would be tried before a jury starting September 9, Searle,
according to investigator Korte, agreed to a settlement the Gutmann
heirs proposed more than a year ago. Korte said he believes Searle
spent more than $1 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the Gutmanns lost more than 40 works of art, many of
which have never been recovered. Kline, their attorney, who has
several major successes recovering looted art for victims, obtained
a settlement last year on a Botticelli the family once owned. He is
now pursuing for them a Renoir that is believed to be owned by a
British collector.

JUDGE'S WORDS OVERTURN MURDER CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL LANGNER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Four words uttered by a judge presiding over a 1994
murder trial have led the state appeals court to order a new trial
to a Lawrence man convicted of second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling issued Thursday, the court ruled that Superior Court
Judge Wendie I. Gershengorn should not have used the words, ``or
grievous bodily harm,'' when she issued instructions on what
standard the jurors could use to find defendant Felix Pichardo
guilty of murder.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion written by Chief Justice Joseph P. Warner, &UR;  &LR; the
court said that phrase lowered the standard for finding someone
guilty of murder in the second degree. The proper standard,
according to the opinion, is that a jury must find that a defendant
should have known his actions were likely to cause death.
</P>
<P>
   If a jury found that a defendant should have expected ``grievous
bodily harm'' to result from his action but the victim died
instead, Warner wrote, that would amount only to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty for second-degree murder is life in prison with
parole eligibility in 15 years. The maximum penalty for
manslaughter is 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Stephen O'Connell, a spokesman for the Essex County District
Attorney's office, said prosecutors will review the decision and
decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   According to evidence presented at Pichardo's trial, he and
several other young men who lived in and near the Hancock housing
projects had fought with a man named Dennis Dietrich the evening of
July 21, 1993. Dietrich was struck by a crowbar and he stabbed one
of his assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Dietrich and the group with Pichardo parted, but one of them
later fired a shot at Dietrich's apartment with a .380
semi-automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   That pistol was later stashed under the seat of a car in which
Picchardo and some friends went riding when they came across
Dietrich walking down a sidewalk and about to run into one of
Pichardo's friends. When Dietrich saw that friend, he raised both
hands over his shoulders to show he had no weapon, then turned and
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   After Dietrich's back was turned, evidence showed, Pichardo got
the pistol out from under the passenger seat and pointed it toward
Dietrich. His companions later testified they first heard a click
and then two shots. One of them killed Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo later said he didn't know the gun was loaded, but
Warner in his opinion said that he must have known after the first
shot that it &UR;  &LR; wasn't unloaded. The problem remains, Warner wrote,
whether it was the first or second shot that killed Dietrich.
</P>
<P>
   In her jury instructions, Gershengorn explained that the jurors
had to find that Pichardo had acted with malice. She gave them what
lawyers call the three prongs of malice: that the defendant
intended to kill the victim, do the victim grievous bodily harm, or
should have known that according to common experience, there was a
plain and strong likelihood that death would follow the
contemplated act.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gershengorn had inserted those four extra words, Warner
wrote, ``the jury may have found malice on a lower level of proof
than required by law.''

FARINA DEFEATS FERNANDEZ IN MUCH-DELAYED MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ This was a tennis match that could have been
played on the deck of Noah's Ark. Rain fell, play was halted, rain
fell again, the match was halted again until finally _ on the third
day _ Italy's Silvia Farina was able to defeat the comebacking Mary
Joe Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no ... never, never!'' replied Farina when asked if she'd
ever had a tennis match last three days. ``It was so difficult
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more so for Fernandez, who was so upset that the match had
been called Wednesday when she was leading, 5-3, in the third set
that she would not talk to media. And Thursday morning, when Farina
and Fernandez awoke to dry weather and took center court at Babson
College in the Corel Boston Cup, Fernandez had nothing as Farina
took the final four games, winning the third set, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been in a match that took three days
to play,'' said Fernandez, now down to 49th in the world rankings
and making a comeback from wrist surgery last December. ``That made
it very tough to get any kind of momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   Farina, the 26-year-old from Milan, had a killer day, playing
two singles matches and a doubles match. Most of all, said the
Italian, she began the day ``by using so much of the energy to beat
Mary Joe. Then I was OK in the second match, but in the third, I
was really ... well, tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, the 26-year-old from Miami, had won the first set,
6-1, Tuesday and was up, 4-1, in the second set when rain halted
play. Then on Wednesday after dropping the second set, 6-2,
Fernandez seemed in full control of the match, only one game away
from victory, when the mist became heavier and the courts wetter
and play was again halted for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really tough to go through this,'' said Farina. ``We
are not used to play like this, to finish the match in three days.
Then you are waiting for the rain. I just try to think my mind away
from the match, to think about other things. Don't think too much
about it. That's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday morning, ``I had myself a very good warmup before
playing Mary Joe,'' said Farina, ``and I knew the first game was so
very important.'' Indeed, if Farina had lost that game, she would
have lost the match.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, once ranked fourth in the world, was counting on
doing well in this Boston tour stop, only her third tournament on
the comeback trail. She was irked by her inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being a duck out of water,'' said Fernandez. ``I'm
used to a certain level of play, and sometimes I'll feel it coming
back, but then suddenly, I'll lose it and become tentative, which
is frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Her wrist felt fine, she said, ``and I think it's more mental
than physical at this point. But with time and patience I'll
overcome this ibstacle. And I'm sure, once I get a better feel of
things out here, I'll be equipped to play'' the bigger tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Farina agreed with her opponent's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I think Mary Joe had too many up-and-downs,'' said
Farina. ``Like after she won the first set, she start to miss ...
and with no reason. I mean, she was leading but she had
up-and-downs, so I took my chances. I think she needs more matches.
It's tough to come back after injury and be a world player. But she
is still a tough player.''
</P>
<P>
   Farina, the fourth seed, had a choice after defeating Fernandez.
She could have waited until after Lisa Raymond's match with
Romania's Ruxzandra Dragomir to play her next match against Cara
Black of Zimbabwe. But Farina chose to play immediately, losing to
Black, 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   After that match, Farina had less than an hour's rest before
teaming with Germany's Anke Huber in doubles against South Africa's
Nanie De Villiers and Australia's Lisa McShea. That fatigue showed
as Farina-Huber lost the first set, 1-6, before storming back to
take the second, 6-1, and finally _ on their sixth match point _
the final set, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very fatigued,'' said Farina. ``I will sleep well.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond beat Dragomir, 6-3, 6-3, and will face Corina Morariu in
a quarterfinal Friday afternoon. Morariu defeated Meghann
Shaughnessy, 6-1, 6-2, Thursday. In this morning's first
quarterfinal match, at 11, Mariaan de Swardt of South Africa will
meet Huber, who won in a walkover Thursdayover the ailing Olga
Barabanschikova of Belarus. Black will meet Russia's Elena
Likhovtseva at 7 p.m.

 &HT;    Regional airlines get a vote of confidence
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Worries about the health of the economy have been
driving down airline stocks for the last month. But at least one
analyst is making a distinction between the outlook for big
carriers, like Delta Air Lines (ticker symbol DAL), and for smaller
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regional airlines are less cyclical because they carry
more business travelers. That business is more stable across all
economic environments,'' said analyst James D. Parker of
Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Business people ``still have to visit their branch offices and
their customers. In fact, they tend to try even harder during these
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Business passengers are also less sensitive about flight costs
than leisure travelers, who tend to cut back on their discretionary
spending and skip a trip, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parker's assessment differs somewhat from that of CIBC analyst
Julius Maldutis, who asserted airlines will stay strong even in a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Parker agreed with Maldutis' point that airlines have been
strengthened by their ability to sell more tickets, at reduced
distribution costs, over the Internet. But Parker asserted that a
recession would soften the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Both Parker and Maldutis are bullish on the industry's future.
But Parker has higher hopes for the regionals, citing their leaner
corporate structure, flexibility, and increasing array of 50-seat
jets that have replaced turboprops.
</P>
<P>
   Currently he has a ``buy'' recommendation on stocks for the
following regionals: ASA Holdings (ASAI), Atlantic Coast Airlines
(ACAI), Midwest Express Holdings (MWH), Comair Holdings (COMR),
Mesaba Holdings (MAIR), and SkyWest (SKYW).
</P>
<P>
   He has a ``hold'' recommendation on these regionals: AirTran
Holdings (AAIR), Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY), Southwest Airlines
(LUV), Midway Airlines (MDWY), and Mesa Air Group (MESA).
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks retreated again Thursday. Among those of
particular interest in Georgia, Delta Air Lines lost $2.75 to
$114.50, ASA Holdings fell $2.25 to $40.75, and AirTran Holdings
dipped 12 1/2 cents to $5.25.

   &LR;   &LR; Zugdidi, Georgia &QL; 
(Russian-patrolled Abkhazia) &QL; 
The death of Zurab Alpenidze, who was chased down on June 2 by his
own neighbors a few miles from here and cut to ribbons by
machine-gun fire, carries a stunning price tag.
</P>
<P>
   As much as $24 billion in energy revenues hangs on the struggle
that has killed Alpenidze and thousands of his friends, relatives
and neighbors-turned-enemies.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Georgian province of Abkhazia, where the backdrop to
one of history's greatest oil strikes is a vicious civil war _ a
war between ethnic Georgians like Alpenidze and ethnic Abkhazians,
fought on both sides with Russian arms under the gaze of 7,000
Russian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who were sent here as U.N.-approved peacekeepers,
say it is a tribal blood-letting, a Caucasian Bosnia. The war's
survivors call it a Moscow power play, a murderous sideshow to the
discovery of immense oil fields in the nearby Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   The war's toll, since 1992, is an estimated 15,000 dead and more
than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the fighting began, 44 percent of Abkhazia's 500,000
people were Georgian,'' says Jemal Mikeladze, chairman of a
refugee-dominated political party in Georgia. ``Today they are
about 17 percent of a population reduced to less than 200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Until June 2, they included Alpenidze. Members of his family,
who fled their native city of Gali after the slaying, are walking
down an abandoned railroad line when two American journalists
encounter them.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old farmer has just been buried in a shallow grave
beside the track. His widow, Eka, is silent, a framed photograph of
her husband cradled in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother-in-law Jeiran steps ahead of her and confronts the
reporters. ``Show America what the Russians are doing to us,'' he
cries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Abkhazia occupies the western fringe of a vast hydrocarbon
basin, reaching from the borders of Afghanistan to the Russian
Caucasus, which holds immense reserves of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Two questions loom over the region's future: Who owns the
bonanza? Who will transport it to market?
</P>
<P>
   The answers will help shape the global economy in the next
century and the international order that governs it. The terms are
now being set in some of the most intense corporate negotiations
the world has ever seen _ and on a ring of battlefields that
encircles the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of enormous resource wealth in the Caucasus and
Central Asia, warns Azerbaijan President Heydar Aliyev, is shadowed
by ``armed conflict, aggressive separatism and nationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a 250-mile radius of the derricks and gas fields, six
wars and rebellions are now raging. At the moment, none is more
menacing than the conflict in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty miles south of Zugdidi lies the Black Sea port of Supsa,
the terminus of a new European-built oil pipeline that will be
completed next year. It is also a critical way-station on a
proposed U.S.-backed Main Export Pipeline (MEP) across Georgia and
Turkey to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, just beyond the Caucacus Mountains, is the Russian
port of Novorossiysk, where Moscow, on the contrary, is determined
to see the MEP routed.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden, mysterious flare-up of the Abkhazian war in May is
explained by an imminent deadline, many Georgians charge: In
October, a decision is due from a cartel of regional governments
and western multinationals on the route of the MEP, which will earn
a fortune in yearly transport fees for the nation that hosts it.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian route, according to Vladimir Stanev, director
general of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, could bring Moscow $5.5
billion in dividends, $18.4 billion in taxes and an annual $900
million in transport fees.
</P>
<P>
   A pipeline to the Mediterranean, which is longer than the route
to Novorossiysk, could be worth even more to Azerbaijan, Georgia
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction must begin very soon,'' says geologist John
Connor, project manager in Azerbaijan for Chevron Overseas
Petroleum, Inc. ``The proven reserves in the Caspian basin already
exceed the capacity of existing export facilities. One or more new
pipelines will have to be in place by the middle of the next
decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaos in Georgia, say many observers, provides a convenient
endorsement of the Russian route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow wants Georgia to be unstable. It's in their interest,''
charges Vakhtang Kolbaia, deputy chairman of the Georgian
parliament. ``Western countries understandably require security for
their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns are exacerbated by the visible presence of
hundreds of thousands of refugees, who mill outside of
storm-drenched camps near Zugdidi or on the streets of Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
   Many are housed in former tourist hotels like the Iveria Palace
in Tbilisi. ``They live six to a room'' _ a space that measures
about 10 feet by 12 feet _ ``and at least half of them have
tuberculosis,'' says Tatyana Vermisheva, a physician at the Iveria
who is also a refugee.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officers in Abkhazia vehemently deny that there
is a connection between the war and the pipeline. But to the 30,000
refugees who have poured into Zugdidi since late May alone, the
link is as clear as the origin of the Kalashnikov assault rifles
that tore away half of Zurab Alpenidze's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pipeline: that's why this is happening,'' says Gocha
Tsurtsumia, a former Georgian militiaman in Abkhazia and now a
refugee. ``There is no other reason. We are burying our friends for
oil ...''
</P>
<P>
   The proof is circumstantial, but compelling. Its chief evidence
is a huge influx of arms smuggled into nations surrounding the gas
and oil fields _ from surface-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons
to grenade-launchers, anti-personnel mines and thousands of
Kalashnikovs.
</P>
<P>
   They are pouring into a region that is soaked in oil _ and
blood. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The map of regional wars and insurgencies, with Abkhazia at its
violent center, includes the homicidal debacle in Chechnya; the
Kurdish uprising in eastern Turkey and the Kurdish civil war in
Iraq; the endless factional struggle in Afghanistan, raging within
a few miles of Turkmenistan's natural gas fields; and the
10-year-old conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the
mountainous Azerbaijan province of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev held talks
with military officials in Armenia, reportedly to discuss the
shipment of S-300 missile systems to that embattled Caucasus
nation. Moscow is believed to have provided Armenia with more than
$1 billion worth of arms since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plans to strengthen military cooperation between Russia and
Armenia, in our opinion, will not further the restoration of peace
in the Caucasus or help resolve the Armenian-Azeri conflict,'' a
spokesman for Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   The regional map also embraces simmering rebellions in the
Russian Federation's republics of Dagestan and North Ossetia, which
share borders with Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The same map is crisscrossed with current or proposed pipeline
routes, and a web of property claims to the richest oil fields.

WEB SITE RELEASED SUBSCRIBER DATA AFTER VOWING IT WOULDN'T, FTC
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the federal government's first Internet-privacy
enforcement action, the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that
a popular Web site had lied when it told more than 2 million
subscribers, both adults and children, that it would not disclose
personal information it collected from them.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the company, Geocities, announced they had reached a
settlement under which the Web site would stop promising
subscribers that they would not give out information collected
during registration _ including age, education, occupation, income
and personal interests _ without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geocities misled its customers, both children and adults, by
not telling the truth about how it was using their personal
information,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also said Geocities engaged in ``deceptive practices''
by gathering information about children who played games on its
site and turning that over to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting wrongdoing, Geocities has posted a new privacy
statement that explains how it uses the information it collects.
``The company has denied the allegations contained in the FTC's
complaint and believes that it has acted fairly with its
customers,'' Geocities said in a statement. ``However, it has come
to agreement with the FTC in order to resolve the matter in an
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities site offers members their own Web pages, e-mail
addresses and information on topics of interest to them. It has
been in business since December 1994 and went public Tuesday. The
company's initial offering was at $17 a share, and the stock closed
after the first day at $37.31. Wednesday the stock rose to $45.50.
Thursday it closed down 7 points, or about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company disclosed that it was the subject of an FTC
investigation. In an interview Thursday, Geocities president Thomas
Evans said the settlement ``will have absolutely no impact on our
business model.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Evans added that he was happy his company could take the lead in
the online privacy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Plesser, the company's lawyer, said, ``It's important to
note that there was no admission of wrongdoing, no fine or
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The company would not disclose the terms under which it gave
personal information about subscribers to advertisers and others.
</P>
<P>
   FTC attorney Toby Levin said, ``We are not trying to tell them
what their privacy policies ought to be. They just have to disclose
those policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's research shows that the Geocities case is not
unique. An FTC study made public in June showed that 92 percent of
600 Web sites surveyed collected personal information on visitors
or subscribers, while only 2 percent of those offered a privacy
statement that disclosed how the information would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and privacy groups have complained that more needs to
be done to protect the privacy of people, particularly children,
using the Web. But the Clinton administration has chosen to allow
the industry to regulate itself on this issue. In a broad privacy
initiative published last month, Vice President Al Gore's office
said, ``The administration will continue to press for
self-regulation'' for online privacy ``with enforcement
mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of large companies, the Online Privacy Alliance, has
drafted a self-enforcement plan, hoping to avert direct regulation.
But the FTC's leaders have indicated they are impatient with
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said the FTC is investigating other Web sites and may
bring additional actions.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, a research group, said, ``It's
significant on one hand that the FTC is now ready to enforce
privacy concerns on the Internet. But this leaves open the question
of how privacy should be enforced.'' He said he would prefer a
government policy that sets limits on the dissemination of personal
information collected on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities site still collects copious personal information
from new subscribers. But the new privacy statement, reached from a
tiny link on the company's home page, now says:
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who elect to receive promotional materials from
Geocities or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their
profile, we do release personally identifiable information''
including ``name, street address, e-mail address, interests,
Geocities neighborhood, and the broader personal information (e.g.,
level of education, occupation and marital status).''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the commission said, the site's registration page
said, ``We will not share this information without your
permission,'' though the company did release it, even without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities also agreed to discourage children under 13 from using
the site without parental permission.

   The literary event of the week _ on tabloid TV shows, at least _
was the publication of  &UR; Christopher Andersen &LR; 's ``The Day
 &UR; Diana &LR;  Died'' (Morrow; $27), a detailed account that includes all
kinds of dark revelations. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Diana's childhood nanny used to go upside her head with a
wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual healer  &UR; Simone Simmons &LR;  detected a ``vast whirlwind
of energy'' on the left side of Diana's bed, her favorite side.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to Diana's hairdressers, there were ``at least nine
men'' in Di's life after the divorce, including  &UR; Placido &LR; 
 &UR; Domingo &LR;  and  &UR; Luciano Pavarotti  &LR; (and what's  &UR; Jose Carreras &LR; ,
chopped liver?).
</P>
<P>
   _ When the princess was having an affair with heart surgeon
 &UR; Hasnat Khan &LR; , she arranged to watch him perform surgery. She was
often nauseated by the sight, she told a friend, ``but I force
myself to watch because I want to learn as much as possible about
heart surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If she could be anyone in the world, said Diana, ``I would be
 &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   _ On  &UR; Nelson Mandela &LR; 's advice, Diana contacted a Zulu shaman to
give her advice on whether she should marry  &UR; Dodi Fayed &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _ Diana's last Christmas present from the queen was a bar of
soap.
</P>
<P>
   _ A love poem Fayed had engraved in silver and given to Diana
was actually ``borrowed'' from a poem he'd received several years
before from  &UR; Tina Sinatra &LR; , who was his girlfriend at the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having rushed to the Paris hospital to be at Diana's side,
 &UR; Sylvia Jay &LR; , wife of the British ambassador to France, blew her
nose into an Irish lace handkerchief as she learned of the
princess' condition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Within an hour of Diana's death, &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR;  had aides
inquire as to whether the princess had had any of the royal jewels
with her.
</P>
<P>
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman has called the book ``complete
fantasy.''

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE AND DEATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Edwin Heaven &LR;  noticed that among the Sex Pistols featured on
one of those Levi's ``Our Models Can Beat Up Their Models''
billboards, is  &UR; Sid Vicious &LR; , who probably could have beaten up
anybody's model. In October 1978, Vicious was charged with stabbing
his girlfriend to death, and he died of a heroin overdose before he
could be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make him an appropriate advertising icon? ``Icon's the
word,'' said Levi's  &UR; Brad Williams &LR; , naming some of the other
celebrities on the billboards. ``The Sex Pistols did a great many
things, but the thing they'll be remembered for is that they
invented punk rock,'' an expression of originality that ``is what
Levi's brand is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder? Williams described it as just one of ``many
details'' people remember.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Neither  &UR; David Bowie &LR;  nor  &UR; Yoko Ono &LR;  were sponsors of ``The
 &UR; Hermann Nitsch &LR;  6-Day Orgy Mystery Theater,'' against which a
member of Congress railed recently. The Austrian artist had
disclaimed rumors of their involvement several weeks ago. The
diatribe against Bowie and Ono by Rep.  &UR; James Traficant &LR; , D-Ohio,
reported here a few days ago, did take place, but the congressman's
wrath was misdirected.

JOB CHANGE PAYS OFF FOR TRAINER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last December, some questioned whether Patrick Byrne made a wise
career move to accept a position as private trainer for owner Frank
Stronach, since it meant giving up his champion juveniles Favorite
Trick and Countess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good long-term choice, Byrne said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now his decision looks good in the short run, too.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne has two of the best older horses in training this summer.
Touch Gold, who upset Silver Charm in the 1997 Belmont Stakes, will
run tomorrow in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar. And at
the other end of the country, Awesome Again just won the Whitney
Handicap at Saratoga after outrunning Silver Charm in a stakes race
at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that mix a potentially top sprinter in Wild Rush, and
Byrne is sitting in an enviable position for 1998's stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``These horses were developed by someone else, so I can't take
credit for them,'' Byrne said. But he still deserves plenty of
accolades.
</P>
<P>
   Again this year, Byrne can do no wrong. Although he is clearly a
top-rate trainer, his stratospheric 36 percent win rate last year
was thought to be somewhat of a fluke. Yet he is maintaining that
percentage again this year, while juggling many more balls in the
widespread Stronach horse empire.
</P>
<P>
   Touch Gold is unquestionably the star of the stable, Byrne said,
insisting that he is a more talented runner than Awesome Again.
</P>
<P>
   In today's Pacific Classic, 8-5 Touch Gold faces the 6-5 entry
of Gentlemen and Puerto Madero, along with Free House and five
other rivals. His chronic hoof problems of last year appear behind
him, and if all goes well today, Touch Gold could be on a possible
collision course with division leader Skip Away for the Nov. 7
Breeders' Cup Classic, if they don't meet before then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Awesome Again could tackle Skip Away in Monmouth's
Iselin Handicap on Aug. 30, if Byrne judges the weight assignments
as fair.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said he plans to keep Touch Gold and Awesome Again running
in different races until the Breeders' Cup program at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne's new career path has seemed even more fortuitous as the
stock of Favorite Trick and Countess Diana has plummeted. Neither
has met lofty expectations as 3-year-olds, although Favorite Trick
captured last weekend's Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga for trainer
Bill Mott.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Favorite Trick's undefeated horse-of-the-year
campaign last season was an impossible act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   But so was Byrne's incredible year, and so far, he is staying on
course quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz
Woodman recovers
</P>
<P>
   The condition of Woody Stephens, the 84-year-old former trainer
who has been battling emphysema for years, is improving, according
to wire reports. Stephens, most famous for saddling five
consecutive Belmont Stakes winners, has been carrying a portable
oxygen tank since 1990 and was recently hospitalized in Miami.
Deserved honor
</P>
<P>
   Few racing fans have ever heard of Ansel Williamson, who last
week became only the fourth black to be inducted into the National
Racing Hall of Fame. But his mark on the sport is indelible. In
1875, the ex-slave trained Aristides to win the first Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Aristides' jockey, Oliver Lewis, also was black.
Rest of the story
</P>
<P>
   What if Pete Rose had been suspended from baseball not just for
gambling on the sport, but for offering bribes to other players to
``fix'' the outcome of games? If Rose had crossed that line, would
there be any controversy about his Hall of Fame credentials?
Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he picked the wrong sport.
</P>
<P>
   As the NTRA tries to overcome public concerns about the
integrity of racing, the sport's Hall of Fame has just enshrined
jockey Jacinto Vasquez, now 54, who won nearly 6,000 races in a
successful career that ended two years ago. Vasquez, who has been
on the Hall of Fame ballot since 1992, served a one-year suspension
in New York in 1984 for allegedly offering a bribe to fellow rider
Eddie Maple, who testified against him. \Nrailhed:What's in a name?
Robbie Albarado rides with a titanium mesh inserted by surgeons
beneath his scalp to strengthen two skull fractures he sustained in
a spill earlier this summer. On Aug. 1, he booted home his first
winner of the Saratoga meeting. Appropriately, the horse's name was
Skullbuster.
</P>
<P>
   For those willing to back a hunch play, the return was $140 for
a $2 win wager.
Hoofbeats
Pick-Six fever
</P>
<P>
   It worked so well for Hollywood Park that Del Mar has scheduled
its own guaranteed pick-six promotion tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar has put up a guarantee of a $2 million pool for its
pick-six, which covers races 5-10 and thus includes the Pacific
Classic, scheduled as the seventh race on the program with a 5:42
p.m. CDT post time.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park has tried a similar guarantee twice this summer,
and both times the nationwide betting pool topped the $3 million
mark.
Still around
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm might not miss the rest of 1998 after all. Trainer
Bob Baffert is pleased with the way the 4-year-old champion has
bounced back from a disastrous last-place finish in the July 25 San
Diego Handicap at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   But even after a fast six-furlong workout in 1:12 1/5 yesterday,
Baffert isn't offering a definitive timetable for the colt's next
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm slowly getting him cranked up again, with nothing
particular in mind,'' he said.
Round two
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest won Sunday's Buick Haskell Invitational, but
look for Victory Gallop to turn the tables in the Aug. 29 Travers
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Haskell, Coronado's Quest held off Victory Gallop's
trademark stretch rally to triumph by 1 1/4 lengths, but the
distance was only 1 1/8 miles and Monmouth Park's track favored his
early speed. The standout 3-year-olds are expected to be rematched
in Saratoga's Travers, where no such advantages should be present.
The Travers is at 1 1/4 miles over a track where
come-from-behinders usually have a better chance of winning.
Etc.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN will televise the Pacific Classic from 5-6 p.m. ... Media
reports continue to label R.D. Hubbard as the sole owner of
Gentlemen, but he isn't. Former Dallas mayor Robert Folsom has kept
his one-eighth share in the handicap star along with several other
partners. And Folsom also owns a similar interest in Puerto Madero,
giving him a strong one-two punch in today's Pacific Classic. ...
Jersey Girl's streaking career is on hold indefinitely. The
3-year-old filly, owned by Houston brothers Robert and Lee
Ackerley, underwent surgery last Friday to have a stabilizing screw
inserted in a fractured right knee. She has won seven consecutive
races, but won't return to competition unless she can come back at
100 percent. ... Jockey Marlon St. Julien won his 1,000th race last
Saturday at Chicago-area Hawthorne. ... Texas-bred 3-year-old
Thomas Jo tied Delaware Park's 1 1/16-mile track record of 1:41 2/5
in winning Sunday's Francis LaBelle Memorial Stakes. ...
</P>
<P>
   The California Senate has passed a bill that could have
implications to tracks nationwide. If signed by the governor, the
bill will permit California tracks to import full-card simulcasts
from out of state. Currently, California tracks may simulcast from
other states only feature races with purses of $50,000 or higher.
... The shake-up of Illinois racing continues. The 1999 live dates
of Sportsman's Park, which is undergoing a $65 million conversion
to a combined horse-and-auto racing complex, have been transferred
to next-door-neighbor Hawthorne. Meanwhile, Arlington International
has decided for the second year in a row not to seek dates. ...
Minor-league Atokad Park in Nebraska has been closed and sold to an
auction company for $1.2 million. The state's only major track,
AKsarben, closed in 1995. Three tracks remain in the state: Lincoln
Downs, Columbus Downs and Fonner Park.

<P>
   The Middle Eastern influence might not be as strong nowadays at
American yearling sales, but it is still around. At this week's
Saratoga Select Sale, Prince Ahmed Salman _ nephew of Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd _ paid $1.7 million for the highest-priced
filly, and Shadwell Stud's Sheikh Hamdan al Maktoum of Dubai bought
the top colt for $900,000. ... ABC Sports has signed a deal with
the NTRA to add four new half-hour telecasts of Kentucky Derby prep
races and expand its coverage of the same-day Blue Grass, Wood

 ASHKHABAD, Turkmenistan-2NDTAKE-SFCHRON  
 ... economic polices. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the year 2000, according to Turkmenistan's oil ministry, the
nation plans to export almost $30 billion worth of oil and gas
annually, measured at average price levels for the 1990s. In 1996,
the lastest year for which figures are available, the average
monthly wage in Turkmenistan was approximately $13.
</P>
<P>
   Every cent of the oil and gas revenues will go into a state fund
controlled by Niyazov and his advisers. ``As the president has
pointed out, at the present time it's most important that all the
earnings from the industry should be concentrated in one place,''
the government said recently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Turkmenbashi abruptly banned English classes in all
but a few selected schools, most of them reserved for children of
his one-party state's top officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hundreds of teachers were suddenly fired,'' said a scientist.
``No explanation was offered. We can only guess that Niyazov came
to equate English with dangerous foreign influences, with things
like BBC broadcasts and the Voice of America, and decided to shut
the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even among the well-educated, the Turkmenbashi has
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``His style of governing may not be to your Western taste, but
the president offers us stability,'' said a young attorney. ``And
with all of this wealth lying around us, we need the kind of
security than only a firm hand can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer's reasoning, with minor variations, is shared by many
of his counterparts across the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same reasoning that once led the U.S. government and
American firms to invest heavily in the futures of the Shah of Iran
and Indonesia's President Suharto. Like Niyazov, they appeared to
guarantee stability amid the cyclone of change provoked by an oil
boom _ until the cyclone turned on them.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Turkmenbashi paid his first official visit to
Washington, where he held private meetings with President Clinton,
Vice President Gore, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense
Secretary William Cohen and executives of Exxon and Mobil.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Mobil became the first U.S. energy firm to reach a
production-sharing agreement with the Niyazov regime, joining
Italy's AGIP. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The obsession with stability in the Caspian basin is not simply
based on paranoid fears, inflamed by opportunistic strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to half a dozen unresolved wars and civil conflicts,
the area's periphery is swamped by a rising tide of Islamic
fundamentalism. Its source is not Iran, which observes the dictates
of Shiite Islam, but the extremist fringe of a rival Sunni movement
called ``Wahabism.''
</P>
<P>
   The movement is growing rapidly in the north Caucasus, and has
provoked pitched battles with security forces in Chechnya and the
Russian Federation's republic of Dagestan. A similar Wahabist
campaign is under way just east of the oil-producing nations in
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two largest oil producers, Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan, are predominantly Muslim, they share a long-standing
tradition of secularism. Veiled women are rarely seen in their
cities, and explicitly Islamic political activism is discouraged or
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   The worry is that the rapid pace of change set in motion by the
energy boom _ which is creating dangerous new social divisions, as
well as promising new opportunities _ will open the doors to
Wahabist radicalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our countries do not accept extremism,'' Kazakhstan president
Nursultan Nazarbayev said at a press conference in June. ``But this
problem does exist, and we cannot ignore that it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Of more immediate concern across the Caspian basin, however, are
recent memories of the turmoil that erupted with the collapse of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In Azerbaijan, Heydar Aliyev's re-ascent to power in late 1993
followed five years of war with Armenia in the province of
Nagorno-Karabakh and three years of unremitting domestic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't walk the streets in Baku after evening fell,''
said a former staff member of Pennzoil, a U.S. oil firm. ``They
were full of belligerent young men with guns, self-appointed
`partisans' from Karabakh who were under no one's control.''
</P>
<P>
   Aliyev quickly signed a cease-fire with Armenia, which has
remained in effect despite frequent skirmishes. During the next 24
months, his regime was challenged by three coup attempts; they were
immediately quashed by police and army forces. Former prime
minister Suret Huseinov, who is suspected of organizing the coups,
went on trial July 13 for treason.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Baku is the most secure and prosperous major city in the
region. ``There is a crucial connection between our success in
attracting oil contracts, and the president's power to achieve a
cease-fire in Karabakh and stabilize the political situation in
Baku,'' an Azeri diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition parties claim that the stability has been
purchased at the cost of genuine democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Azerbaijan's parliament, the Milli Mejlis, is little
more than a cheering section for the president. This spring it
approved his proposal for a controversial package of new laws by a
vote of 89 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Aliyev will run for a second term. The main
opposition party, the Popular Front, is calling for a boycott of
the election unless he rescinds a law authorizing the government
itself to appoint the Central Elections Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Several Popular Front leaders, including the party's chairman
and his deputy, were arrested in May when they marched to the
legislature in a protest demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has also criticized
the law, which effectively permits Aliyev to control how the
elections are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Senate committee recently passed the Silk Road
Act, an administration-backed bill that would lift a ban on U.S.
aid to Azerbaijan and give it the status of a ``priority nation''
in American policymaking. ``Stability in this region is of the
utmost importance,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgians offer a similar rationale for backing Eduard
Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he became president, we were overrun by the
Mkhedroni,'' says insurance executive Shalva Kochladze, referring
to ``armed groups'' of militiamen that were originally established
to fight in the secessionist war in Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
   They evolved into gangs that fought bloody turf battles in the
nation's cities. ``The Mkhedroni are gone now, and we have a
crackdown by Shevardnadze to thank for it,'' Kochladze says.
</P>
<P>
   As in Indonesia three decades ago, when Suharto assumed power
amid widespread chaos and bloodshed, peace in the streets is
regarded here as its own vindication. But the trade-off is fragile,
no matter how firm the hand of autocracy _ another lesson from
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, the argument for strongman rule
inevitably collides with the attractions of change, in the shape of
foreign influences that are almost impossible to suppress in an era
of satellite television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the primary source of seduction is often the United
States, despite its own obsession with stability in the developing
world and its long history of support for leaders who promise it.
</P>
<P>
   ``America symbolizes a place where you can do anything you like.
Dress as you like, think as you like, act as you like,'' said
Leila, 17, a pre-law student in Baku. ``That must be our future,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words were enough to provoke anger in Raschad Bayramov, 19,
who overheard the young woman's conversation with a foreign
journalist. ``She's from a rich family, from the nomenklatura,''
said Bayramov, who described himself as ``old-fashioned'' and not
ashamed of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who gather here do nothing,'' Bayramov added, as
Leila turned her back on him and walked away. ``They live on their
parents' money.''
</P>
<P>
   In that brief exchange are echoes of Iran a generation ago, of
Nigeria and Indonesia today.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous oil boom in the Caspian basin promises to alter
everything in its path _ to erect a new El Dorado in desert wastes,
fuel the economies of the United States and Europe, and re-order
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   It will also imperil thousands of years of tradition, setting
its defenders against the tide of a glittering but deeply uncertain
future.
</P>
<P>
   From the gas fields of eastern Turkmenistan to the pipeline
terminals that send oil west to America and Europe, the Caspian
bonanza will destroy as much as it builds, and the history of the
21st century will be written.

IN CASPIAN REGION, BLACK GOLD COMBINES WITH IRON RULE

<P>
   &LR;   &LR; ASHKHABAD, Turkmenistan _ A time-traveler from the 1980s
would be dazed by the capitals of former Soviet Central Asia and
the Caucasus. From Turkmenistan to the Black Sea, an energy boom
has swept through on an enormous wave of dollars, leaving few
reminders of the gray era of Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   Except for his fellow Soviet leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as striking as the effect of the boom _ which has filled
the region surrounding the Caspian Sea with overnight millionaires,
luxury apartment towers, casinos and limousines _ is the area's
utterly familiar cast of strongmen.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Turkmenistan is Saparmurat Niyazov, former
chairman of the Supreme Soviet in Ashkhabad. The president of
oil-rich Azerbaijan is Heydar Aliyev, former Communist Party
secretary and KGB director of his republic. Their counterparts in
the Georgian Republic and Kazakhstan, presidents Eduard
Shevardnadze and Nursultan Nazarbayev, served on the Soviet
politburo.
</P>
<P>
   The past, personified by the men who governed here when the
Soviet Union was a superpower, is in charge of the Caspian basin's
glittering future.
</P>
<P>
   These men are the principal partners of more than 50 major
energy companies and other multinationals _ including Unocal,
Bechtel and Chevron from California, Elf and Total from France,
Britain's BP and Holland's Royal Dutch Shell, Norway's Statoil,
Italy's AGIP and Itochu of Japan _ which are bankrolling and
drilling the Caspian basin's oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of the region's Soviet holdovers has been accorded a
state visit to Washington by the Clinton Administration, which has
made relations with the Caspian presidents a top foreign policy
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Some have improved their policies and images, and have set out
to modernize their nations. Others have embraced a political model
that is older than Brezhnev's Moscow, and far more autocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere are the anachronism or the autocracy more entrenched
than in Turkmenistan, where the 21st century is dawning under a
regime that could have been inspired by Josef Stalin or Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
   The president has gone so far as to rename himself
``Turkmenbashi'' _ ``Chieftain of the Turkmen'' _ in unspoken
homage to China's Great Helmsman.
</P>
<P>
   He has also rechristened Krasnovodsk, his country's main Caspian
seaport, as ``Turkmenbashi City.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkmenbashi's plump face smiles down from giant posters on
almost every building in Ashkhabad, including its casinos and
foreign-owned hotels. It appears on thousands of banners strung
across the nation's streets, along with an endlessly repeated
slogan that proclaims ``Halk! Watan! Turkmenbashi!'' _ ``People!
Motherland! Chieftain of the Turkmen!''
</P>
<P>
   When a viewer tunes into the government-operated (and only)
Turkmen-language television station, an image of the Turkmenbashi
appears in the screen's upper right-hand corner. It remains there
throughout the nonstop documentaries on the president's activities
that constitutes all of the programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkmen history has endowed the leader with a whole complex of
psychological qualities that have enabled him to conceive and put
into reality the unique Turkmen notion of neutrality,'' Lyudmilla
Glazovskaya wrote in the spring issue of an Ashkhabad magazine,
alluding to the Turkmenbashi's nonaligned foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where ``democracy'' is little more than a ceremonial
word used to describe one man's monopoly on power, the effect of
his personality cult is mind-numbing.
</P>
<P>
   When a referendum was held in 1994 to extend the Turkmenbashi's
rule until 2002 without an election, the official results were
1,959,408 votes in favor and 212 against.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one dared speak out about the referendum,'' said a merchant
in Ashkhabad. ``Almost no one speaks out about anything in our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond occasional discreet gatherings where Turkmenistan's few
university-educated or foreign-connected citizens express their
dissent _ in secret, at enormous risk _ Niyazov's self-glorifying
rule is passively accepted by most Turkmen. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  In part, that is because the majority of the 3.8 million
Turkmen do not live in Ashkhabad or Turkmenbashi City, which are
home to the country's 400,000 Russian-speaking residents from other
ex-Soviet republics and the small Turkmen middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the city limits, the average Turkmen's life, for the
moment, is even more unchanging than the roster of Caspian
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2 million Turkmen live in yurts, camel-skin tents
pitched outside of remote oases on the vast Kara Kum Desert, where
they dine on grilled camel kabobs washed down by camel's milk. They
break camp periodically, to move on to another oasis, or to meet by
the tens of thousands at the Tolkuchka Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   Located about five miles north of Ashkhabad, the Tolkuchka is
the largest remaining outpost on the ancient Silk Route, the
8,000-mile necklace of trading centers that linked Europe and China
for more than 20 centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Along one end of the unimaginably crowded bazaar _ tolkuchka
translates as ``pushing'' _ modern consumerism is making gradual
inroads, led by cheap wristwatches from Russia,
Turkish-manufactured portable stoves and Iranian soaps and
detergents.
</P>
<P>
   But the principal goods for sale here remain what they were
2,300 years ago, when Alexander the Great rode through on his way
to India. Garbed in long silver-bedecked gowns and head scarves,
women merchandise a vast array of hand-loomed silk and wool carpets
_ ``the most beautiful in the world,'' Marco Polo said after his
visit in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   Half a mile away, men in desert tunics and enormous shaggy wool
hats barter over racing ponies, herds of sheep unloaded from rusted
ex-Soviet Army trucks and the inevitable camels. ``Excellent meat,
sir, you won't be disappointed,'' a merchant said, patting his
animal on the hump. ``The price is just $450.''
</P>
<P>
   The merchant's customers showed little interest when asked their
opinion of the Niyazov regime. ``These are people whose ancestral
memory includes history's most tyrannical depots, from Tamurlane
and Genghis Khan to Stalin, and their culture has survived them
all,'' said an academic in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their point of reference is a brutal desert, where absolute
obedience to a tribal leader is the line between life and death.
Parliamentary democracy is meaningless to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not meaningless to the academic. Like almost everyone
who spoke with two American reporters in Turkmenistan, he asked
that his name be withheld. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The discretion is well-advised. Any affront to the Turkmenbashi
is a serious offense in his dominions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister was imprisoned for complaining about a food
shortage,'' a university student said. ``All that she said was,
`What kind of country is it that has so much oil and gas, but not
enough bread?' Two days later, she was in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Her question, overheard by one of the regime's legions of
undercover spies, was interpreted as criticism of the
Turkmenbashi's economic policies.

 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The literary event of the week _ on tabloid TV shows, at least _
was the publication of  &UR; Christopher Andersen &LR; 's ``The Day
 &UR; Diana &LR;  Died'' (Morrow; $27), a detailed account that includes all
kinds of dark revelations. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Diana's childhood nanny used to go upside her head with a
wooden spoon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual healer  &UR; Simone Simmons &LR;  detected a ``vast whirlwind
of energy'' on the left side of Diana's bed, her favorite side.
</P>
<P>
   _ According to Diana's hairdressers, there were ``at least nine
men'' in Di's life after the divorce, including  &UR; Placido &LR; 
 &UR; Domingo &LR;  and  &UR; Luciano Pavarotti  &LR; (and what's  &UR; Jose Carreras &LR; ,
chopped liver?).
</P>
<P>
   _ When the princess was having an affair with heart surgeon
 &UR; Hasnat Khan &LR; , she arranged to watch him perform surgery. She was
often nauseated by the sight, she told a friend, ``but I force
myself to watch because I want to learn as much as possible about
heart surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   _ If she could be anyone in the world, said Diana, ``I would be
 &UR; Sharon Stone &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   _ On  &UR; Nelson Mandela &LR; 's advice, Diana contacted a Zulu shaman to
give her advice on whether she should marry  &UR; Dodi Fayed &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   _ Diana's last Christmas present from the queen was a bar of
soap.
</P>
<P>
   _ A love poem Fayed had engraved in silver and given to Diana
was actually ``borrowed'' from a poem he'd received several years
before from  &UR; Tina Sinatra &LR; , who was his girlfriend at the time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Having rushed to the Paris hospital to be at Diana's side,
 &UR; Sylvia Jay &LR; , wife of the British ambassador to France, blew her
nose into an Irish lace handkerchief as she learned of the
princess' condition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Within an hour of Diana's death, &UR; Queen Elizabeth &LR;  had aides
inquire as to whether the princess had had any of the royal jewels
with her.
</P>
<P>
   A Buckingham Palace spokesman has called the book ``complete
fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE AND DEATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Edwin Heaven &LR;  noticed that among the Sex Pistols featured on
one of those Levi's ``Our Models Can Beat Up Their Models''
billboards, is  &UR; Sid Vicious &LR; , who probably could have beaten up
anybody's model. In October 1978, Vicious was charged with stabbing
his girlfriend to death, and he died of a heroin overdose before he
could be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make him an appropriate advertising icon? ``Icon's the
word,'' said Levi's  &UR; Brad Williams &LR; , naming some of the other
celebrities on the billboards. ``The Sex Pistols did a great many
things, but the thing they'll be remembered for is that they
invented punk rock,'' an expression of originality that ``is what
Levi's brand is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder? Williams described it as just one of ``many
details'' people remember.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Neither  &UR; David Bowie &LR;  nor  &UR; Yoko Ono &LR;  were sponsors of ``The
 &UR; Hermann Nitsch &LR;  6-Day Orgy Mystery Theater,'' against which a

   BETHEL, N.Y. _ Twenty-nine years ago, people came here by the
tens, and then hundreds, of thousands, abandoning spray-painted
Volkswagen buses and bumper-stickered cars along clogged roads,
walking for miles to the festival of rock 'n' roll called
Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a few thousand of the original Woodstock
generation and their progeny returned each August to pitch homemade
tents, beat drums, and dance at the hallowed 37-acre concert site,
trying to recapture those free-loving days.
</P>
<P>
   But not any more. Five miles of split-rail fencing sprouted this
summer around Max Yasgur's hayfield, which has been bought and
tamed by a billionaire whose goal with a concert series this
weekend was to leverage the legend of Woodstock, luring
buttoned-down yuppies, not rainbow-clad hippies, to this
long-depressed southern flank of the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing we have up here in Sullivan County that
has a national brand name,'' said Alan Gerry, 69, a native of the
county who became the ultimate cable guy three years ago when Time
Warner bought his cable television company for $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of the ad hoc concert grounds into a fenced
commercial enterprise appalled many self-described ``Woodstockers''
around the region, who have protested for two years _ through civil
disobedience and lawsuits _ that the field is a public shrine to a
state of mind, not a piece of private real estate where one can
charge admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Gerry's done is, he's bought the church and run off the
congregation,'' said Abigail Storm, a bead-wearing Woodstock
pilgrim from the nearby town of Monticello who runs the Woodstock
Nation Foundation with her husband, Daniel Eggink. The nonprofit
group, which exists mainly on the World Wide Web, is devoted to
maintaining public access to the original concert site.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry (pronounced with a hard G, like Gary) said that he
understood the pangs of the traditionalists, but said times had to
change. ``What we're trying to do up here,'' he said, ``is for the
betterment of the many and, hopefully, the inclusion of the few.
But we have to have a chance to get this thing going.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, called ``A Day in the Garden,'' after a song lyric
by Joni Mitchell, one of the scheduled performers, was clearly
intended to attract a new kind of clientele to a place where
acid-tripping teen-agers once danced naked in the mud and a nearby
lake.
</P>
<P>
   It was being touted as a clean, well-lighted event, with the
first two days of music, on Friday and Saturday, performed by
several graying veterans of the 1969 concert, including Pete
Townsend and Ten Years After, along with several peers, including
Don Henley, Lou Reed, and Stevie Nicks _ kind of an Old-Timers Day
of rock. The Sunday show would feature some fresh-faced bands for
the MTV generation. No more than 30,000 tickets would be sold for
each show.
</P>
<P>
   As an army of workers deployed 400 portable toilets, as
forklifts placed metal sculptures on the neatly mowed grass, as
vendors set up souvenir stalls and a portable automated teller
machine under high-tech tents imported from the Netherlands, the
only Volkswagen in sight was one of the new, pricey Beetles.
</P>
<P>
   The car was painted in a psychedelic swirl of images, but only
because it was a promotional tool for a local FM radio station.
</P>
<P>
   With clean toilets, a ban on camping, and a hilltop beer garden
instead of a drug bazaar, the goal, Gerry said, was to bring a new
surge of monied tourists to the Catskills, paving the way for a
regular series of concerts in years to come, ranging from jazz to
country to, possibly, the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear as the weekend approached just how many
paying customers would be coming to Gerry's show. Hotels for miles
around said they were booked for the weekend, with people coming
from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But for several weeks, sponsoring Hudson Valley radio stations
had been eagerly offering two-days-for-the-price-of-one deals.
Tickets for the veteran rockers had originally been $35 for each
day. Ticket prices for the Sunday show had started at $25,
descended to $10 and now were up to $25 again.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry said that the Sunday show, featuring popular current acts
like the Goo Goo Dolls, was nearly sold out. But sales had only
reached about half of capacity for the first two shows, despite the
discount.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that those numbers were not a disappointment, adding
that this year was essentially a trial run, that he was in this for
the long haul.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Michael DiTullo, one of Gerry's top lieutenants, explained that
it would take time to shift the demographics of those attracted to
the Woodstock site.
</P>
<P>
   As DiTullo inspected preparations for the show, he painted a
word picture of the ideal visitor: ``Capitalism has been good to
them but they still cherish what the whole Sixties phenomenon was
about.''
</P>
<P>
   He said this was also new territory for a group of executives
more versed in the world of finance and cable television than in
rock music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bankers, investment-type people,'' DiTullo said. Waving
a hand past the imported tents, police cars, Porta-Potties, and
fencing, he said: ``This is our research and development.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerry may have rankled aging hippies, but he had the
enthusiastic support of almost every elected official and business
owner in Sullivan County, partly because he had arranged to pay
almost all of the legal, logistical and administrative costs
connected with the event. Altogether, he was pouring more than $5
million into the event through a nonprofit group, the Gerry
Foundation, which he created last year.
</P>
<P>
   For Bethel, the shift to supporting a concert at the hallowed
field represented a dramatic turnaround. The town, essentially in a
state of shock for 28 years after the original event, had gone to
great lengths to turn away the annual impromptu pilgrimage, passing
restrictive ordinances about public gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   But Bethel largely embraced Gerry's upscale vision, which was so
clean and neat that he even decided to close the beer concession on
Sunday, when a big teen-age audience was expected. Town officials
granted him exemptions to the old laws and passed new ones allowing
traffic on public roads around the site to be shut down for what
was essentially a private event.
</P>
<P>
   With many old Catskills resorts shuttered or bankrupt, and the
failure of a recent bid to bring legalized gambling here, cashing
in on the Woodstock legend was seen as something of a last chance
for Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   To deter any unwanted incursions, some 400 police officers and
private security guards were setting up checkpoints on roads for a
mile around to turn back people without a ticket or a local
address.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Ms. Storm and Eggink, 47 and 60, who run a printing
and graphics business with their children, were planning to march
past the checkpoints on Friday, beating a brightly painted bass
drum wheeled on a luggage cart and proclaiming their right to walk
freely to what they said is a sacred site.
</P>
<P>
   But Eggink, stroking his long beard, said the battle for the
soul of the site, and the country, may have already been lost. ``It
might be that our time historically has come, that enough people
have decided that idealism and utopianism are no longer
important,'' Eggink said.
</P>
<P>
   Along Route 17B, there were few signs of the annual influx of
so-called ``rainbow people,'' a wandering clan of vegetarian
pacifists that has regularly camped around the area this time every
summer.
</P>
<P>
   At Hector's Inn, a tavern where many visitors in tie-dyed
clothing have gathered in years past, the only people around the
bar Thursday were three neighbors with silver hair, talking about
their tomato plants.
</P>
<P>
   The only person wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt was the bartender.

RUSSIAN CRISIS PUSHES U.S. MARKETS LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-MARKETPLACE, RUSSIA-ECON, RUSSIA-ASSESS) 
(JT) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A growing sense of crisis in the Russian economy
helped push United States markets lower Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia's stock market fell 6.5 percent. At one point, trading
was stopped for 35 minutes when losses exceeded 10 percent. The
central bank stepped in to protect the ruble and the banking
system, but Moody's Investors Service and Standard &AMP; Poor's
downgraded Russia's foreign debt, which already had been ranked as
``junk.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,459.50, its lowest
point of the day, down 93.46 points, or 1.1 percent. The blue-chip
index, which was up as much as 18 percent for the year at its peak
in July, is now up just 6.98 percent this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.31 points, to 1,074.91,
and the Nasdaq composite index lost 22.99 points, closing at
1,802.54, a 1.3 percent decline. The S&AMP;P and the Nasdaq are up
10.77 percent and 14.70 percent, respectively, for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the situation in Russia, combined with continuing
problems in Asian economies and expectations of slower earnings
growth among U.S. companies, have contributed to the growing
cautiousness among investors in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia's clearly at the top of the list,'' Robert Bissell,
president and chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management,
said. ``Russia's in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   He said institutional investors were concerned that Russia might
devalue its currency. A devaluation could affect banks and
financial institutions worldwide with exposure to the country, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, said:
``Earlier this year people shrugged this stuff off. Now portfolio
managers are paying more heed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of investors' waning belief in the resiliency of the
market, comments by the Goldman, Sachs market guru, Abby Joseph
Cohen, did little to stem Thursday's slide in stocks. Last October
the bullish stance of Ms. Cohen, co-chairwoman of Goldman's
investment policy committee, calmed investors and helped the Dow
Jones industrial average recover from a decline of more than 500
points.
</P>
<P>
   In a note to clients Thursday, Ms. Cohen said stocks were now
undervalued and she does not expect a recession or an uptick in
inflation soon. In addition, the direct impact of events in Asia
and Russia on the United States is likely to remain moderate, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not seem to buoy the market.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, DuPont, which led both the Dow and the S&AMP;P lower,
warned that third-quarter profits would be at the lower end of
forecasts and below levels from the comparable period last year.
The company pointed to a number of causes for the shortfall,
including declining oil prices, Asia's impact on its polyester
business and declining agriculture business revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when DuPont reported second-quarter earnings, it
also warned that third-quarter results could falter.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont closed at 55, down 5{ points.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations that earnings will continue to weaken is keeping
some investors on the sidelines, Acuff said, as portfolio managers
hesitate to buy the shares of companies that may soon warn of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, small-company stocks faltered. The Russell index
of 2,000 smaller-company stocks fell 4.72 points, or 1.2 percent,
to 403.83.
</P>
<P>
   As bearish sentiment becomes increasingly pervasive, analysts
note that portfolio managers are becoming less aggressive about
putting cash to work than they were in previous months. Aggressive
buying on downturns, for fear of missing out on subsequent gains in
the market, were a key factor in propelling stocks to record highs
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   This change in sentiment comes as cash flows into equity mutual
funds are slowing to their lowest levels this year. In the week
ended Aug. 5, $468 million flowed into U.S. equity mutual funds,
down from $648 million in the previous week, according to AMG Data
Services, a California research firm. And in the week ended July
22, investors moved $1.5 billion out of mutual funds, AMG said.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus, along with the general decline in the market, has
trimmed the aggregate market value of mutual funds by $200 billion
to $225 billion in the last three weeks, Robert Adler, AMG's
president, said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend, if it continues, also could herald a sea change in
investors' outlook toward stocks, he said, adding that cash flows
into bond funds have been increasing recently.

<P>
   ``Our cleaning lady and driver are former physics professors,''
Amy McMaken said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Baku headquarters of San Francisco-based Chevron, finance
and administrative manager Jim Hawkins said that the woman who just
made the coffee is a doctor. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  About half an hour's drive south of the McMaken apartment, the
main highway to Iran passes an arid peninsula that juts two miles
into the Bay of Baku. Thousands of rusted, abandoned oil derricks
scar the peninsula's treeless hillsides, casting gaunt shadows on
concrete huts that bake under the ferocious Caspian sun.
</P>
<P>
   The derricks are what remains of Azerbaijan's last experience
with Western energy firms.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1880s to 1900 companies controlled by John D.
Rockefeller of the United States and Alfred Nobel of Sweden built
vast fortunes on an earlier oil strike here. At the turn of the
century, 51 percent of the globe's oil came from Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1920s, when the young Soviet Union seized control of
Azerbaijan, the onshore reserves had been emptied _ leaving behind
silent derricks and blocks of palatial mansions in the capital
city, many of which are now being converted into offices and
apartments by the multinational investors of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Shafaq, a 14-year-old girl, has lived in one of the huts with
her mother and seven other people since 1993, when her father was
killed in the war with Armenia in their native province of
Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, everyone but the smallest children joins throngs of
refugees on street corners in downtown Baku, where hotels and
construction crews hire day laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine of us get by on around 150,000 manat ($40) per month,''
Shafaq said. ``It's just enough to eat, and to pay the bus fare to
the city and back.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has been slowed by a fragile 1994 cease-fire, broken
almost weekly by skirmishes around Karabakh. But its mutual ethnic
cleansing is already complete. There are no Armenians left in
Azerbaijan, except those in Karabakh _ technically, 20 percent of
Azerbaijan's land _ and no Azeris left in Karabakh or Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   At least a million Azeris are now refugees in their own country,
almost a fifth of Azerbaijan's population. They are the poorest of
the poor in a nation where enormous wealth is literally gushing
from the offshore seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Deputy Economics Minister Oktay Hagverdiyev said,
``Between 45 and 48 percent of the population lives below the
poverty line in Azerbaijan,'' the richest and most urbanized of the
new oil-producing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our average per capita income is around $70 a month, including
the proceeds of a rather large black market,`` he said. ``Consumer
surveys indicate that something closer to $100 per person is
necessary these days.''
</P>
<P>
   That's more than twice the income earned by Shafaq's household
of nine people.
</P>
<P>
   But if history holds lessons, the vast gulf between the richest
and poorest is not the ticking Caspian time bomb. As University of
California at Berkeley political scientist Crane Brinton noted in
his landmark study, ``Anatomy of Revolution,'' social firestorms
are more often ignited by rising _ but frustrated _ expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hope four or five years ago,'' Shafaq's mother said.
``It's lost now. We'll never see our homes again.''
</P>
<P>
   The desperately poor don't harbor expectations. Samaya Jafar
does. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The balance sheet of the Jafar family is a case study in Baku's
confusing social realities in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Samaya and her husband Rauf, an electrical
technician for a Turkish-owned contracting company, take home 4
million manat per month ($1,150).
</P>
<P>
   On the debit side, they are paying off the mortgage on a modest
two-bedroom apartment that was purchased in 1996 for $35,000 _ real
estate nowadays is invariably priced in dollars, rather than manat.
</P>
<P>
   The Jafars must also save for the secondary educations of their
two sons, Ismail and Yussif, at expensive private high schools if
they hope for them to go on to a good university. Once there, the
expenses will soar into the stratosphere. At the recently opened
American University in Baku, tuition is $7,000 per year _ almost 14
times Azerbaijan's per capita annual GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure is made greater by the fact that both boys are
clearly exceptional. At the age of 12, Jussif is fluent in Azeri,
English, Russian, Arabic and Turkish. Ismail, 8, spends hours
riveted to the family's English and Russian encyclopedias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Name a country, any country on Earth,'' his father says to
their American guests.
</P>
<P>
   One of the visitors offers Tuvalu, a tiny island-state in the
South Pacific with a population of less than 10,000. ``The capital
is Funafuti,'' Ismail instantly responds.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted from a seven-day work week at the market, Samaya
listens quietly from across the dinner table. Her hopes for her
sons, and the toll this exacts, would be familiar to a mother
anywhere. ``Now you see why I sell chickens,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor also sees that the boys' minds are mirrors of hers,
and that their world view is being shaped in the forge of her
painful compromise between self-esteem and money.
</P>
<P>
   The Jafars cannot live on Rauf's pay and a teacher's salary.
Samaya has tried, endlessly, to find work in the dazzling Baku of
foreign investors and multinational corporations. But she won't
clean floors or make coffee _ ``That's no reason to leave the
market'' _ and every responsible job seems closed.
</P>
<P>
   Western executives confirm that hiring practices are not what
they might be. ``There are no employment agencies,'' said Chevron's
Jim Hawkins. ``The major way we identify potential new employees is
word-of-mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   In many firms, the word is passed on by local staff members, who
are deluged with employment requests from relatives and friends.
``You have to know somebody just to get past the receptionist,''
Samaya said, ``and even then, the first thing they notice is that
I'm almost 40.''
</P>
<P>
   That's too old, in a Caspian basin where anyone over 30 is
regarded as a Soviet anachronism. The glaring exceptions are scions
of the Soviet ``nomenklatura,'' the ex-Communist Party bosses and
their children who governed the region a decade ago and remain an
elite class today.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry is volatile, fueling resentments between
generations, as well as between the pampered nomenklatura and less
privileged citizens _ and raising early warning signals of the
conflicts that led other oil nations into the social abyss.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want younger people, the 25-year-olds, even if they can't
speak English as well as I do,'' Samaya said of the foreign
multinationals in Baku. ``The idea is that they can be trained,
while I'm beyond the point where training is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiments are widely shared among older Azeris. ``Oil?
There's always been oil in our country. It doesn't affect people
like me,'' said a 52-year-old woman at the Central Market, where
she sells used clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks away in the Relax Cafe near Fountain Square,
younger Azeris lingered over hamburgers and Cokes _ convinced that
their own lives will unfold to the pattern of Amy McMaken rather
than Samaya Jafar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation believes we will all be rich eventually,'' said
Nuriya Huseynova, 18, a student at the private Western University
in Baku. ``Look at Kuwait: Nothing but oil, no other product in
their economy, and everyone has big cars and villas.''

<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan_ The insistence on personal fulfillment, on a
career that enhances self-esteem and inner peace, is supposed to be
a Western preoccupation. A luxury of the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Then a traveler meets someone like Samaya Jafar, 38, who is rich
from the indirect proceeds of a huge oil boom in Central Asia and
the Caucasus _ and reeling with bitter frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Jafar sells chickens in the Central Market of Baku, about 40 on
a typical day. In Azerbaijan, where per capita GDP is $504 a year,
they bring in the equivalent of $1,000 a month.

<P>
   In the nearby school where she teaches English two days a week,
Jafar's monthly income equals the profits on a dozen chickens.
</P>
<P>
   An economist might regard her as an icon of success, a
prosperous new entrepreneur in an ex-Soviet republic just shaking
off the constraints of 70 years of communism. Her income puts her
well ahead of the national curve, in a nation where salaries
overall have risen by 60 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life,'' Jafar declared, ``is a failure.''
</P>
<P>
   It may also be a time bomb, ticking toward an explosion that
could have massive repercussions. The clock turns on the very boom
that has put $5 chickens into Azeri pots, transformed struggling
teachers into affluent merchants _ and bewildered Azeris and their
ex-Soviet neighbors with its contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have years of education and teaching behind me. I want to
use my mind, my imagination,'' Jafar said, in barely accented and
perfectly grammatical English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why must I sell poultry to give my children a decent life?
What does it mean, that there is no better place for me than a
market stall, amidst such wealth?''
</P>
<P>
   Jafar's question recalls the social distortions that beset many
other developing nations inundated with black gold _ Iran,
Indonesia, Nigeria, Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijani officials are painfully aware of these precedents.
``We're determined to follow the example of Norway rather than
Nigeria,'' said Ali Jarafli, a top executive at the state oil
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tremendous job ahead of us just to bring our
infrastructure up to modern levels _ transport, communications,
ports, airports, railroads, electric energy, roads and services.
The costs will exceed $10 billion,'' said Oktay Hagverdiyev, deputy
minister of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're so busy dealing with the macroeconomic issues that
other considerations are pushed aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the other considerations is a crisis in values,
brought about by the abrupt marriage of two very different worlds. &QL;

 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  If they met, Amy McMaken would understand Samaya Jafar's
bitterness, just as she would understand her own inadvertent role
in it.
</P>
<P>
   McMaken is who Jafar wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Kurt, are certified public accountants,
halfway through a two-year stint in key executive positions at the
Baku office of a major multinational firm.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment assigned to them by their employer is on the first
floor of an elegant 19th century building on Prospekt Neftyanikov,
``Oilmen's Avenue,'' a mile below the market.
</P>
<P>
   When the door is opened, a visitor steps into the pages of
Architectural Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Their firm leased three apartments in the building and connected
them, gutting the contents and renovating to the taste of a
Manhattan interior designer:
</P>
<P>
   Polished hardwood floors and track lighting. A football
field-sized living room. Furniture from Italy and Scandinavia. A
high-tech kitchen that could swallow 30 market stalls. Year-round
climate control and 24-channel satellite television.
</P>
<P>
   In Baku, this is how the other half lives _ the expatriates who
run the oil boom's multinational offices.
</P>
<P>
   Amy and Kurt McMaken are 28 years old. They are, respectively,
in charge of tax consulting and auditing services in Azerbaijan for
one of the world's leading accounting partnerships. Their clients
include several of the most powerful corporations on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Aesthetically, their home is as far as you can get from the
cinder-block slum that abuts the Central Market. Yet in actual
distance it is less than a five-minute taxi ride from Jafar's
chicken stall.
</P>
<P>
   What separates the McMakens from many of their fellow
expatriates is that the contrast makes them uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among Europeans and Americans in Baku, there is often an
`expat mentality' that is deeply embarrassing,'' Amy said. ``It's
an attitude of superiority, a habit of using dismissive phrases
like `these people' in reference to Azeris.''
</P>
<P>
   But bridging the divide, Kurt said, is almost impossible.
``There's a natural tendency for expats and nationals to group
together separately. People were visibly uncomfortable when I
played soccer with our Azeri staffers once.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their arrival in 1997, the McMakens tried to break
down the barriers by inviting local colleagues to dinner. The
effort fizzled _ in part, because the guests were so intimidated by
their apartment. ``They found it posh beyond all belief,'' Amy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unofficial estimates place the community of western expatriates
in Baku alone at more than 10,000, with nearly as many scattered
around the capital cities, oil fields and pipeline construction
sites of the Georgian Republic, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   The expats' growing population _ and fat paychecks _ have
spawned an incongruous separate economy of air-conditioned luxury
apartment towers, supermarkets, bars and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Baku, foreign workers can dine on sweet-and-sour pork at the
Dragon Palace, blackened redfish at the Ragin' Cajun or enchiladas
at Margaritaville, a Tex-Mex joint. Its Azeri waiters, garbed in
panchos and sombreros, hand out publicity flyers just before supper
time in Fountain Square, the city's central park.
</P>
<P>
   Scots, who number more than 2,700, gather after dark at the
Ranger Pub, named for a Glasgow soccer team, where they gulp down
pints of lager as British sporting events unfold on a giant
satellite-fed television screen.
</P>
<P>
   A beer fetches the equivalent of $6 at the nearby Fountain
Square Steak House, where most of the customers are expatriates and
the owner is an American. The same beer costs 80 cents at an Azeri
bar 50 yards away, where the customers are locals who work for the
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
   The price gap is symbolic of a more ominous distinction between
locals and expatriates. Drawn by salaries that are three or four
times those in the public sector, Azeris by the thousands have
abandoned professional careers for menial jobs in foreign offices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MORE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the oil sits in a murky void. Landlocked bodies of
water such as the Caspian are not governed by international law,
and there are no universally recognized principles for determining
boundaries on its seabed.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1991, all of the surrounding lands except Iran were part
of the Soviet Union, and had no need to establish separate claims
to the seabed. The Soviet collapse, followed by massive oil and
natural gas discoveries, changed everything _ and led to a mad
scramble for drilling rights.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are the Russians and Iranians, respectively at the
northern and southern ends of the sea. Moscow and Teheran want
joint sharing of revenues by all five Caspian nations, even though
their own offshore areas appear to contain no oil. Among the
current oil producers, only Turkmenistan supports Moscow and
Teheran on the ownership issue.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are oil-rich Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, which
have called for a formal division of the seabed according to the
Caspian states' respective national borders. Further complicating
the picture is an accord reached by Russia and Kazakhstan last
month that divides fishing rights in the northern Caspian _ but not
oil _ between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement on July 20, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Boris Pastukhov and his Iranian counterpart, Morteza Sarmadi,
declared that ``the 1921 and 1940 agreements signed by Iran and the
former Soviet Union stand as valid.'' These agreements require
``the consensus of all five littoral states'' on the Caspian for
any new legal division of the seabed, effectively permitting Iran
and Russia to veto unfavorable boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Iran have 210 million inhabitants, huge standing
armies and governments that exert significant influence on the
global stage.
</P>
<P>
   The three oil-producing nations have a combined population of
less than 30 million, insignificant military forces and _ because
of estimated oil and gas reserves second only to those on the
Persian Gulf _ a cast of new overseas friends and backers led by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The result, in the seabed and pipeline controversies alike, is
the threat of growing friction in the region between the Caspian
basin's two local superpowers and their long-standing rival in the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The joint Russian-Iranian communique reads as a thinly veiled
warning to the Clinton Administration. The statement ``specifically
ruled out interference by any outside party, as a mediator or
otherwise, in drawing up the Caspian legal regime.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. involvement in the region ``is leading the matter toward
open confrontation with Russia,'' Russian Deputy Energy Minister
Valery Garipov warned in April. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; 3 stars &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  Most of the nations and major firms with significant stakes in
the outcome give lip service to the principle that ``multiple
pipelines are the ideal,'' as a Chevron executive put it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in practice, most have committed themselves to specific
routes, with far-reaching economic and security implications.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron, as a partner in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium with
Kazakhstan, supports a $2 billion Russian route from Kazakhstan to
Novorossiysk that is already under construction _ a step that puts
the San Francisco firm at odds with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The United States government and a majority of American oil
firms have thrown their weight behind the longest and most
expensive proposed pipeline, a 1,030-mile, $3 billion conduit
across Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, from Baku on the Caspian Sea
to the Turkish port of Ceyhan on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan is also publicly committed to the Ceyhan MEP system,
which would tentatively be joined to a proposed $2 billion pipeline
under the Caspian carrying oil from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   The Ceyhan MEP is expected to cost 50 percent more than the
proposed new Russian system. But advocates point out that it would
avoid the narrow and crowded shipping lanes on the Bosporus strait
between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, where oil spills would
bring disaster to the most heavily populated area of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Washington formally launched its ``Caspian Sea
Initiative,'' authorizing the U.S. Export-Import Bank and two other
federal agencies to support 65 energy projects in the region. All
are tied to the Baku-Ceyhan route.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the new Western Pipeline from Baku to the Georgian
Black Sea port of Supsa goes into operation. Like the proposed
Ceyhan route, it bypasses Russia entirely, for reasons that that
have as much to do with international gamesmanship as they do with
money or technical feasibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful completion of the project to transport oil
through the Western route is important, not just from the economic
point of view, but also politically,'' John Leggate, president of
the Azerbaijan International Operating Company, told reporters July
13.
</P>
<P>
   The only existing pipeline courses through Russia, a country
whose dependence on volatile energy revenues is as dangerously high
as that of its tiny, resource-rich former satellites. A quarter of
all Russian tax receipts now comes from oil industry levies and
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Both the country's young prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, and
his predecessor, Viktor Chernomyrdin, are former gas or oil company
presidents. The Kiriyenko government hopes to revive a deeply
ailing economy by drawing the bulk of Caspian basin oil to a much
larger new pipeline to Novorossiysk.
</P>
<P>
   Rival pipelines through their own countries are also being
pushed by Ukraine, Romania, Greece, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
Turkmenistan, China and Armenia. But the primary contenders are the
routes to Novorossiysk and Ceyhan _ each of which plunges into a
battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Support for a Ceyhan pipeline will drag the American government
and U.S. corporations ever deeper into the Turkish campaign against
Kurdish insurgents, which is already being fought with American
F-16s serviced by U.S. Air Force maintenance crews.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's route goes directly through troubled Dagestan and
Chechnya, the rebellious Caucasian republic that has defeated the
Russian Army and descended into violent anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Chechen spokesmen promise that the oil will flow,
whatever the state of their relations, because neither side can
afford to spurn the lucrative transport fees. In late April,
officials signed an agreement that would pay Chechnya $3.58 per ton
(50 barrels) of oil crossing its territory through the present
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   With an annual capacity of 5 million tons of oil from Azerbaijan
and Kazakhstan, the deal could bring Chechnya as much as $18
million per year. A Russian MEP, with a projected capacity of 67
million tons per year, would increase the Chechen take to $240
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a recent escalation of hostilities suggests that the
agreement is extremely fragile. Unless Russia accepted his terms on
war reparations, Chechen Acting Prime Minister Shamil Basaev warned
in July, he would shut down the pipeline immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in a shoot-out along the pipeline route between
security forces and Islamic paramilitaries, at least 50 Chechens
were killed.

 BAKU, Azerbaijan-2NDTAKE-SFCHRON  
 ... roughly $5 trillion. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will soon be worth far more, as oil prices are certain to
mount. Demand from newly industrializing nations, led by China, is
soaring. Overall, according to the International Energy Agency,
worldwide daily consumption is set to rise from the equivalent of
100 million barrels of oil today, to more than 150 million barrels
in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   All but a handful of the globe's current oil-producing giants
will have emptied their proven reserves during the next two
decades. The United States is expected to run out of domestic oil
in 10 years, Indonesia and Canada in nine years, Nigeria and Russia
in 20.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Azerbaijan's proven reserves alone should last into
the 22nd century. Even Saudi Arabia, with its 262 billion barrels
of untapped oil, will empty its reserves by the year 2080 at
present production levels.
</P>
<P>
   If oil prices reach the $55 per barrel registered in 1982, the
Caspian bonanza will reshape global finance. Yet the new El Dorado
is taking root in sparsely settled infant nations _ among them, the
three primary oil producers have fewer than 28 million citizens,
and none existed as an independent state in 1990 _ without clear,
internationally recognized property rights to the oil fields that
lie off their coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Already, say economists, their financial dependence on oil and
gas revenues is worryingly excessive, despite razor-thin legal
claims to the gushing offshore wells. Almost half of Turkmenistan's
entire GDP in 1996 came from energy exports; more than 30 percent
of the Azerbaijan public budget is paid for by oil.
</P>
<P>
   Oil and gas are ``my future, all of our future,'' says Shalva
Kochladze, regional executive for a European insurance firm. It is
a future gambled on huge amounts of borrowed cash, pumped blindly
into a legal void. &QL; 
(3 stars) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A lawless limbo between the Soviet past and a glittering but
perilous future is the rule across the Caspian basin.
</P>
<P>
   Its most basic element, an inescapable part of daily life for
natives and foreign oil workers alike, is a corruption so
entrenched that it is taken utterly for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The shakedown _ which unfolded more than two dozen times on a
recent 500-mile journey from the Western Pipeline Route's Caspian
terminal in Baku to the Georgian port of Supsa on the Black Sea _
is relentlessly predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of an empty highway, policemen signal the car over
to the shoulder of the road, waving billy clubs and hand-held stop
signs. A brief conversation with the driver ensues. Then, usually
in open sight, the policemen are paid an on-the-spot ``fee'' for
unspecified infractions.
</P>
<P>
   At the Georgian-Azerbaijani frontier, travelers confront a
gantlet of customs officers, ``fixers,'' and sheer con men from
both countries with their hands out.
</P>
<P>
   Even with press credentials and business visas, it took four
hours to cross the two-mile-wide border, following payment of
``special taxes'' negotiated by three cab drivers who each ferried
passengers over a few hundred yards of the customs zone.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers _ and the border officials who work with them _
enjoy a virtual monopoly on traffic between the two nations that
are expected to guarantee the delivery of Caspian oil to the West.
There are no flights between Baku and Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital. Buses are supposed to cross the border three times per
week, but are often canceled without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, according to a confidential World Bank report
obtained by The Chronicle, almost every major public institution,
from local criminal courts to the post office, is fed on a chronic
diet of bribes.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials, the report found, are the greediest, expecting
$300 for their services. The average daily take for the traffic
policemen who haunt the road to Supsa is $20, just ahead of public
health officers, the phone company and housing authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't name a country where corruption doesn't exist,''
said Oktay Hagverdiyev, Azerbaijan's deputy minister of economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of scale _ here it tends to be modest amounts
spread in a very large circle, rather than the large amounts in a
very few hands that you see in countries like Kuwait or the United
States. In either case, the effects are demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, he says, ``is that policemen, for instance, are
paid around $50 month. You can't live on that today. So bribery,
from an economic point of view, is entirely understandable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has been preoccupied with an austerity program
imposed after the collapse of the Soviet Union sent currency values
spinning. Azerbaijan has won high marks from international
financial analysts for its campaign against inflation, which fell
from an annual 1,600 percent in 1994 _ when average salaries
plummeted to $8 per month _ to 3.7 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do about corruption,'' says Hagverdiyev,
``is improve the public salary structure gradually. To move too
quickly would inevitably create new distortions in the economy.'' &QL; 
(3 stars) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Aydin Veliyev pauses for a moment when asked whom he works for.
``That's not a simple question,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As quality control engineer at the construction site of the
Zestafoni Pressure Reducing Station, a critical junction on the
Western Pipeline Project halfway between the Caspian and the Black
seas, Veliyev answers to a byzantine hierarchy of bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian shipping and construction giant, Kvaerner Ltd., is
the station's principal owner, but the land belongs to the Georgian
government, and the 500-mile-long pipeline itself is managed by a
consortium of local firms and multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Veliyev himself is an Azeri, the 58 men wielding
shovels in a trench where the pipeline will run are a mixed team
from across the Caucasus, and the chief on-site engineer is a
Briton. They are not paid directly by Kvaerner, but by Turkish and
Azeri contractors, or by one of two Georgian subcontractors that
built a nearby camp where the workers sleep and eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough job,'' Veliyev says, gesturing toward the
trench, where his men dig furiously under a canopy of storm clouds.
``To meet the schedule, we've been working 10 hours per day since
December, with just four days off per month.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Pipeline's complex web of partnerships reflects a
conscious strategy, pioneered by the government of Azerbaijani
President Heydar Aliyev and borrowed by Kazakhstan, Georgia and
Turkmenistan. Its cornerstone is an international division of
shares _ and responsibilities _ among as many players as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy makes oil executives nervous. ``The more partners
you have, especially from different countries, the more difficult
it can be at every level,'' says Jim Hawkins, finance and
administration manager for Chevron's operations in Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   But informed observers also call Aliyev's approach a stroke of
genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that oil is about politics, as well as
commerce,'' said Gurban Aliyev (no relation), an Azeri geologist
who serves as a consultant on the Caspian offshore fields for
Western firms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, he points out, ``is our biggest and most powerful
neighbor, and governed us for 70 years. It begs for trouble if they
aren't allowed to participate in major production contracts. The
government has seen to it that Iran acquires shares for the same
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy's showcase is the Azerbaijan International
Operating Company (AIOC). Unlike many joint ventures in the
developing world, where state-majority ownership discourages
foreign investors, SOCAR holds a modest 10 percent of AIOC's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The rest have been parceled out among 11 other oil firms: BP of
Great Britain is the largest shareholder, with 17.13 percent of
AIOC stock; America's AMOCO, however, is just a shade behind with
17.01 percent. The remaining shares are divided among other firms
from the United States, Britain, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Norway and
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a deftly structured union joining longtime
international rivals, and what amounts to de facto local control of
costly exploration and drilling operations _ $8 billion has already
been invested in just three of the AIOC offshore fields _ that are
largely paid for by foreign interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the interests of many countries are represented, they all
have a stake in success,'' said SOCAR's Ali Jafarli, a principal
architect of the joint-production strategy.

CASPIAN OIL BONANZA _ A PERILOUS PIPLINE TO THE WEST 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; BAKU, Azerbaijan _ Rising abruptly from the 140-degree sands
of Turkmenistan's Kara Kum Desert, on the desolate frontiers of
Iran and Afghanistan, a slender pipe twists through a coil of
valves and arrows off toward the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   This is the lifeline of the 21st century _ the conduit that will
deliver an immense trove of natural gas and oil to the homes,
factories and transportation systems of America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the industrialized world will depend on it, and on
a group of small, fledgling nations that most Americans have never
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Veering through Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, the lifeline exits
Central Asia at the Caspian Sea. Swollen with the pulse of offshore
oil rigs, it drives westward across a fragmented map _ Azerbaijan
and Georgia, Dagestan, Chechnya and Abkhazia, the shattered remains
of the Soviet Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   There are two branches of the lifeline now, coursing along two
narrow valleys separated by the 16,000-foot peaks of the Caucasus
Mountains: a pipe that curves northwest across Russia toward the
port of Novorossiysk, and a railroad from Baku to the west coast of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, there will be a third branch, the 500-mile-long
Western Pipeline through Azerbaijan and Georgia, transporting
nearly a million barrels of oil per day to a fleet of tankers on
the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   The $600-million conduit will already be obsolete the day it
opens, overwhelmed by an output expected to grow by a dozen times
in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the Caspian basin's untapped energy resources range
up to 300 billion barrels of oil or its equivalent in natural gas _
50 percent more than the combined total of all proven reserves in
Western Europe, the Americas, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The region's wells will shower unimaginable wealth on people
whose annual per capita GDP today hovers between $400 and $600,
building a new El Dorado in nations where camels still outnumber
automobiles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran oil executives, a terse breed who are wary of
superlatives, can barely contain themselves when discussing the
Caspian strike. The first of hundreds of new offshore fields to
begin pumping, a joint venture between Azerbaijan and 11 foreign
energy firms, ``is already yielding a spectacular 60,000 barrels of
crude per day from just five wells,'' marvelled geologist John
Connor, project manager in Baku for San Francisco-based Chevron
Overseas Petroleum, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years from now, their production level could be a
million barrels per day. That's truly exceptional _ the highest
level of production ever achieved from one field.''
</P>
<P>
   With many of the world's current principal oil sources drying
up, the Caspian reserves are vital to the continuing prosperity of
the West, and the advancement of the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every major international oil and construction firm
has sought a foothold in the new El Dorado, led by California
giants such as Chevron, Unocal and Bechtel. In an investment frenzy
that now exceeds $120 billion in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan alone,
they have constructed forests of offshore rigs and derricks at
breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined annual capacity of the Western Route and an
expanded Russian pipeline is 550 million barrels of oil,'' said Ali
Jafarli, a top executive at SOCAR, the State Oil Company of
Azerbaijan. ``By 2005, we could be looking at an annual production
of up to 7 billion barrels.''
</P>
<P>
   The next century's energy lifeline, say many experts, flows with
the largest fossil fuel strike in history after the Persian Gulf.
The purest in quality. The most lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous. &QL; 
(3 stars) &QC; 
 &LR;   &LR;  The stakes are measured in a dizzying, contradictory mosaic of
images. They dramatize the perils and promise of the boom:
</P>
<P>
   At a roadblock just north of the Western Pipeline's Black Sea
terminal, Russian infantrymen in full combat gear, backed up by
tanks, guard the approaches to the only road bridge over the Inguri
River. ``It's possible to cross with the right papers,'' one of
them says. ``But not many people try.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, five of his fellow soldiers died on the far side of
the bridge, when a remote-controlled mine destroyed their armored
personnel carrier. The mines were buried in the separatist Georgian
province of Abkhazia, amid the ruins of a six-year-old civil war
between ethnic Georgians and ethnic Abkhazians.
</P>
<P>
   But the war's fluctuations appear increasingly related to a
fierce struggle between Russia and its former Soviet dominions over
the route of the Main Export Pipeline (MEP) _ the proposed new
system that will carry the bulk of Caspian basin oil to market,
paying a fortune to the countries it traverses in transport fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism and force hang like a sword of Damocles over the
whole complex of companies and enterprises that are involved in
transporting oil,'' Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze warned
at a summit meeting of regional leaders in June.
</P>
<P>
   When night falls, the television sets of Central Asia and the
Caucasus are aglow with a different sort of warning: stern
religious broadcasts from neighboring Iran, or news reports of
political upheaval in distant Indonesia and Nigeria, documenting
the cultural backlash and violent instability that so often
accompany an oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are directly proportionate to the promised wealth.
And in the Caspian basin, that promise is announced in a gaudy,
ostentatious display of wild spending.
</P>
<P>
   The bonanza has filled the streets of Baku and Ashkhabad, the
capitals of Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan, with Cadillacs and
Mercedes. They double-park outside of five-star international
hotels, luxury apartment towers, casinos and nightclubs that have
cropped up virtually overnight _ serving instant local millionaires
and weekending oil roughnecks who drink themselves into oblivion on
$20 shots of Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   The most cautious projections set the region's energy wealth at
200 million barrels worth of oil and natural gas, an amount
exceeded only by the reserves of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The wells drilled by Chevron's joint venture with Kazakhstan,
east of the Caspian in the Tengiz oil fields, ``are capable of
producing 800,000 barrels of crude per day,'' says Connor. ``That's
a major country's worth of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe the Caspian basin may hold up to 200
billion barrels of oil alone, with 100 billion barrels' worth of
gas under the Kara Kum Desert and other sites. At average price
levels for the 1990s, that adds up to a treasure chest of roughly
$5 trillion.

   On the 150th anniversary of the California gold rush, a new El
Dorado is beckoning half a world away. Only this time, the
substance is oil, not gold.
</P>
<P>
   In a four-part series, Chronicle staff writer Frank Viviano
examines the extraordinary oil bonanza in the Caspian Sea. The huge
oil and natural gas finds there will provide energy to the West for
the next century.
</P>
<P>
   But formidable obstacles stand in the way of the oil getting to
Western markets: war, political rivalries and ethnic tensions
abound throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   In a monthlong journey of more than 3,000 miles, 100 interviews
and 4,000 photographs, Viviano and Chronicle photographer Tim Kao
documented the oil boom.

 &HT;    Falcons Notebook: Coaches will be looking at running game
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Atlanta Falcons take the field tonight in the
Silverdome to play their second preseason game of the summer,
reserve quarterback Steve DeBerg, 44, will get much of the
attention. He's supposed to play three quarters, and after not
playing since 1993, whatever he does will be good for a spot or two
on SportsCenter tonight.
</P>
<P>
   But the evaluation of DeBerg is one of a few primary objectives
the Falcons coaches take into tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The other critical issue is the running game. Atlanta was just
19th in the NFL in rushing last year, despite improvement at the
end of the season. In last week's 31-16 win over Tennessee, the
Falcons had 67 yards on 23 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Take away two Harold Green carries for 21 yards, and a Jamal
Anderson run for 11, and the birds rushed 20 times for 35 yards.
Take away the three scrambles by quarterback Tony Graziani for 15
yards, and the Falcons had 17 rushes for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to get the running game going,'' coach Dan Reeves
said. ''You've got to be aggressive up front, hitting people and
sustaining contact. You see a lot of offensive lineman standing
around. When the play is over, they still ought to have contact.
You can't just smack 'em once, and lose 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The first offensive line of left tackle Bob Whitfield, left
guard Calvin Collins, center Robbie Tobeck, right guard Gene
Williams, and right tackle Nate Miller will probably play the
entire first half.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (eight carries for 21 yards last week), and Byron
Hanspard (seven carries for 11 yards last week) will see
considerable action in the first half as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, you need a running back running to daylight and not
wasting a lot of time doing it,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome aboard, QB
</P>
<P>
   The newest Falcon, rookie quarterback John Dutton of
Nevada-Reno, arrived Thursday, and threw a little in basic drills.
The 6-foot-4, 222-pound native of Newport Beach, Calif., was waived
Tuesday night by the Miami Dolphins, who drafted him in the sixth
round.
</P>
<P>
   He hit 444-of-701 passes (63.3 percent) for 6,276 yards, 42
touchdowns, and 12 interceptions the last two years at Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons claimed him Wednesday after Dutton said he ended up
in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Dolphins will start Dan
Marino, and behind him is Craig Erickson. Battling for the No. 3
job are Damon Huard, who was the Dolphins' No. 3 quarterback for 15
games last year in addition to playing the last two springs in the
World League, and three-year veteran Chad Maye, a fourth-round pick
of the Vikings in '95. He also has been on the roster with the
Cardinals, and
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it had to do with talent; it was kind of a
numbers game,'' Dutton said. ''(Dolphins coach) Jimmy (Johnson) and
I sat down and had a good talk. he was saying that with Dan being
37 years old, they're going to need some experience at the No. 3
spot (in the event Marino and Erickson go down). They talked as a
staff, and wanted to let me go early so I could save this year,
hopefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was happy to offer a chance, releasing rookie free agent
Brian Brennan of Idaho in order to fit Dutton on the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a guy we thought a great deal of coming out of college
so it's an opportunity to bring him here and see what he looks
like,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Aches and pains
</P>
<P>
   Thursday was a repeat of Wednesday and Tuesday, as the same
eight players missed a 50-minute jog-through prior to the game.
They were DT Mark Campbell (knee sprain), RT Corey Louchiey
(groin), WR Keith Crawford (hamstring), WR Tim Dwight (back), DT
William Gaines (back), WR Jammi German (groin), DE Barry Mitchell
(elbow), and CB Randy Fuller (ankle).
</P>
<P>
   None will play Friday night at Detroit, and it's possible CB
Lenny McGill (ankle/hamstring) won't play. If he doesn't, rookie
Elijah Williams likely will be the No. 2 left corner.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities galore
</P>
<P>
   All those injuries mean some players will get more of a chance
to show their stuff than they otherwise might have. Included in
that group are rookie free agent wide receiver Octavus Barnes, and
receiver Kevin Thornal, who was on the practice squad last year.
</P>
<P>
   Terance Mathis and Tony Martin will start, but won't play much.
The first-string offensive and defensive lines are likely to play
most, if not all the first half, with the only variation being an
alternating situation at left defensive end with starter Lester
Archambeau and John Burrough.
</P>
<P>
   The only change in the starting lineup is that right cornerback
Ronnie Bradford, who missed last week's game with a hamstring, will
be in there.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of other positions, however, will alternate more,
including receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Thornal, who has three catches for 55 yards last week, and
Barnes, who had one catch for 12 yards, are among them.
</P>
<P>
   ''This week was supposed to be my week off since I got so many
reps last week, but the injuries changed things,'' Thornal said.
''I'm going to have to fill all three spots, including the slot
back.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You never wish an injury on anybody, because that's the worst
thing that can happen, and I've been in that situation,'' said
Barnes, who blew out his knee at the end of his sophomore season at
North Carolina. ''But I'm glad I'm getting a chance to showcase my
talents. Most of the time I've been working at the split end
position, but I'll get thrown in at slot some.''
</P>
<P>
   No go, Fernando
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons failed to get their man in former defensive end
Fernando Smith, who decided instead Thursday to sign a contract
with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Atlanta general manager Harold
Richardson and Reeves wanted to add the 6-foot-6, 283-pound Smith,
who had 13.5 sacks the last two years before being released
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's agent, Jeff Durand of Minneapolis, said the Falcons were
one of four finalists, joining the Jaguars, Redskins and Saints.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would have challenged for a lot of playing time, and he
would have helped at tackle and end,'' Reeves said. ''I was hoping
we could get it worked out, but . . . the money is close and a guy
is going to go where he thinks he's got the best chance. He felt
like his chances were best in Jacksonville.''
</P>
<P>
   Where to in '99?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are fast approaching a decision on where training
camp will be held next summer, as it appears all but certain there
will indeed be construction at the team's Suwanee headquarters this
time next year. What will be under construction is still up in the
air, but with at least one of the three top candidates _ Furman
University in Greenville, S.C. _ asking for an answer within a few
weeks, the Falcons probably make a decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   Furman, Middle Georgia College in Cochran, near Macon, and the
University of Tennessee at Chattanooga are the three sites
considered most likely to get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll probably make a decision before September . . . because
wherever we go, they've got to get some things done,'' Reeves said.
''Those three are definitely the leaders.

WATER TRUCK DISCOUNTED AS CARRIER OF EXPLOSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: AFRICA-MEMORIAL, AFRICA-BOMBING, AFRICA-U.S.) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ After initial surmises that the bomb
that exploded here last Friday outside the American Embassy was
attached to an embassy-owned water truck, investigators are
shifting their attention to other possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But two American security officials who said Thursday that the
water truck was being discounted as the carrier also said that they
had no explanation of how the bomb arrived at the entrance gate.
</P>
<P>
   The theory that the bomb was on the tanker, which was about to
enter the embassy grounds, was proving a dead end, officials said.
They added that investigators had not found parts of a car or
another vehicle that might have carried the bomb. Officials said
they had no witness accounts of a car's arriving at the scene just
before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   One official suggested that the bomb was ``gas enhanced,''
similar to the bombs used in attacks in 1993 on the Marine barracks
in Beirut, Lebanon, and the American Embassy in Kuwait. Such bombs
are surrounded by canisters of flammable gas that intensify
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion here caused far fewer deaths and casualties than
the one in Nairobi, Kenya, in part because the embassy is a
reinforced-concrete building that the Israeli government built in
the late 1970s. But the delivery of the bomb to a point as close as
possible to the edge of the compound and its nearly simultaneous
timing with the explosion in Nairobi showed extensive planning, the
officials said. The reconnaissance of the site, the assembling of
the explosives, their transportation to Tanzania and perhaps even
the building of a prototype took an estimated six months, one
official, an expert in counterterrorism, said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion left a crater 10 feet in diameter in an area that
seems to be just behind where the water truck was idling, awaiting
clearance to enter the gates. The truck never received clearance,
and early reports that a guard was inspecting its undercarriage
with a mirror on a long pole led to the conjecture that the bomb
had been on the truck.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the tanker and its undercarriage were swept
forward 50 feet by the blast but not obliterated suggested that the
bomb was not attached to the truck, officials said Thursday. The
truck cab was burned to shreds, probably because fuel had been
stored under it.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been collecting debris from the site since
Sunday, and the crater at the gate has been scooped wider and
deeper for samples to be analyzed for residues of explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for clues will take months, and after the criminal
investigators no longer need the site the building will probably be
demolished, said the charge d'affaires, John Lange.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One embassy employee, Saidi Rogati, 48, remains missing.
American officials said no trace of Rogati, an assistant driver who
had worked at the embassy for 13 years, had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers had seen him on the embassy grounds before the
explosion, and the officials say they assume that he died in the
blast. The officials strongly suggested that he was not a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The indication that the bomb was probably not on the water
tanker was of some consolation to the State Department Diplomatic
Security office, which is responsible for the safety of embassies.
The office's main concern is that terrorists not breach embassy
compounds. If the bomb had been attached to the tanker, that could
mean that the bomb had been planted while the tanker was parked
overnight at the back of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   One striking aspect of the protection at the embassy here, as is
the case in some other African countries, is that the guards at the
perimeter are employees of a company, Ultimate Security. Such
guards, known as askaris, are poorly paid and poorly educated.
</P>
<P>
   One American official described Ultimate Security, which has
contracts to guard many major commercial sites in the capital and
most embassies, as fairly decent but added: ``That said, they are
African guards with a stick. They are trained with Mace. They are
not legally allowed to carry a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 people who died here, five were Ultimate Security
guards at the front of the building. No Americans were killed.

WEAK DOLLAR, DEBT AUCTIONS DRIVE BOND PRICES LOWER  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A weaker dollar and the third part of the Treasury's
quarterly debt auctions kept prices of government securities
depressed Thursday for the second consecutive day. Also weighing on
prices is the Federal Reserve's monetary policy committee meeting
next week. The price of the benchmark 30-year bond dropped nearly a
half-point, to 107, while its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose to 5.63 percent, from 5.60 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's $10 billion auction of 30-year bonds was the final
and most difficult part of the quarterly debt sales. With yields
already near record lows and investors holding higher-yielding
long-term issues, traders think market participants may be a little
reluctant to buy more. The new 30-year issue was bought at an
average price to yield 5.590 percent, mostly in line with
expectations. Bonds began the session down when the dollar dropped
against the Japanese yen because investors feared the Japanese
central bank would sell dollars to support the yen. A strong dollar
makes Treasury securities more attractive to foreign investors, not
only because of the high return but also because of the potential
gains in currency translation. Still, Treasuries did receive a
small boost from foreign investors seeking shelter from turmoil in
Russian and Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors keep watching for signs that Asia's slowdown is
weighing on economic growth in the United States. The government
said Thursday that retail sales fell 0.4 percent last month after
rising 0.10 of a percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer spending is the mainstay of the economy and the key
to the economic outlook,'' said Donald Fine, chief market analyst
at Chase Asset Management, ``and the Federal Reserve is highly
unlikely to ease monetary policy until consumption slows
significantly and sustainably from its ebullient pace over the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But while a more accommodative monetary policy does not appear
to be on the horizon, ``neither does a tightening.'' He said the
pace of economic growth appeared to be slowing, in large part
because of the financial crisis in Asia, which would be exacerbated
by a rate rise in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Fed on hold, it has hardly been a surprise that the
bond market has been locked in a narrow range of between 5.60
percent to 5.80 percent,'' he said, adding, ``In the anticipated
absence of an inflationary outbreak on the one hand and signs of
recession on the other, bond yields are likely to remain in this
range for quite some time.''

MUSLIM HOLY LEADERS DENOUNCE TERRORISM AT MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN SCHWARTZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a meeting last weekend, Muslim religious leaders
from around the world condemned Islamic fundamentalism and
terrorist acts committed in the name of their religion.
</P>
<P>
   Although conference organizers had already planned a joint
declaration on the two issues, their stance was grimly underscored
by the news that the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania had been
bombed, possibly by fundamentalist extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extremists attack us at the same time as they attack the
United States,'' said President Aslan Maskhadov of the rebel nation
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost thousands of our people fighting for Islam against the
forces of Soviet imperialism, but (fundamentalist extremists) say
we are not good Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; In interviews and speeches at the Second International
Islamic Unity Conference in Washington, Maskhadov emphasized that
the Chechens, notwithstanding their intense Islamic faith, would
never accept the imposition of fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Chechens are striving for democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was called by the Islamic Supreme Council of
America, headed by Lebanese-born Sheik Hisham al-Kabbani.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbani also voiced a strong condemnation of the bombings in
Africa. ``Whoever is behind the terrorist act in Africa we
condemn,'' he said. ``Our religion has never called for
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The statements by the assembled leaders carry considerable
weight in the Muslim world for two reasons: Those attending
included some of Islam's most respected figures, and their stance
both reflects and amplifies the belief in nonviolence held by most
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Maskhadov, the Washington event attracted other
Muslim leaders from the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly dramatic statement came from Sheik Mahomed
Albogachiev, supreme mufti of the Ingushetia Republic, which
borders Chechnya. Albogachiev pointed out that 60 percent of his
nation's residents, who now number only 300,000, had died in
repression meted out by Josef Stalin. ``We were killed for our
faith. Yet they (fundamentalists) claim we are not real Muslims,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kabbani, the presiding figure at the conference, is a major
leader in Sufism, a mystical movement in Islam that fundamentalists
condemn.
</P>
<P>
   The Sufi orders, which developed chanting and other forms of
``dhikr'' or remembrance of God through meditation and repetitive
prayer, are extremely influential in the northern and eastern
regions of the Muslim world, from Turkey through Pakistan to
Malaysia and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Sufi orders follow the Sunni branch of Islam, and
Sufis are credited with bringing Islam to India. They have millions
of members. But they are continuously attacked by fundamentalists
who claim that following Sufi leaders and venerating Islamic
teachers from the past as holy figures are corruptions of Islam
borrowed from the Christian tradition of sainthood.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Washington gathering was called by Kabbani, it
concentrated on the broadest issues in Islamic life, with an
emphasis on the repudiation of fundamentalism and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The conference heard repeated calls for Muslims to adapt to
democracy and modernity without abandoning their faith and
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering paralleled a similar event hosted by the Muslim
women's organization Kamilat, with presentations boosting women's
political participation, women's rights in an Islamic context, and
the struggle against domestic violence in Muslim households.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants included Sheik Mohammed Nazim al-Haqqani, the
grand mufti of Turkish Cyprus and head of the Naqshbandi Sufi
order.
</P>
<P>
   Nazim has made the repudiation of terrorism a major feature of
his Islamic teachings, in Cyprus and elsewhere, declaring: ``Those
who plant bombs and kill the innocent are not Muslims. A Muslim
defends the faith by fighting face to face, not by cowardly
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov expressed his gratitude for the support of the
Naqshbandis, to which the majority of Chechens are affiliated,
during the recent war with the Russians. ``I do not hesitate to say
that although we lacked heavy weapons in our struggle with the
Soviet empire, we had great support from Allah, strengthened by our
Sufi commitment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation of Muslims with a long history of integration into
Russia was described by a delegation of religious leaders from
Tatarstan, a region surrounding the Russian city of Kazan, with a
population of 4 million, about 60 percent of them Muslim Tatars.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Galiulla Gabdulla, mufti of Tatarstan, said his people had
lived in peace with their Russian neighbors for more than 400
years. But he said that because of anti-Muslim racism among
Russians, Tatars have been treated as an underclass.
</P>
<P>
   In comments similar to those of African American Muslims,
Gabdulla stressed the importance of prison ministry work. Many
young Tatars have ended up in prison, he said, because of limited
professional opportunities and other forms of discrimination in the
former Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have programs to reach young Tatars in prison,'' he said.
``We work with them and we believe the rate of return to prison by
those we have assisted is very low.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gabdulla said, the Tatars and other Muslims in
Russia now have to deal with drug use and trading, which they never
knew before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working to bring our young people back from the
temptations of drugs, crime and other such problems. It is one of
our most important responsibilities,'' he said.

 &HT;    N.C. hog farmers' ads raise concern
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUPLIN COUNTY, N.C. _ Some 3 million pigs populate this rural
eastern North Carolina county, outnumbering people about 75 to one.
That makes Duplin the hog farming capital of the world and gives
state Rep. Cindy Watson, the local legislator here, a district with
one mountain of pork.
</P>
<P>
   But late last year Watson, a 57-year-old interior decorator,
awoke to find herself on the wrong side of the feed trough.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers for Fairness, a tax-exempt trade association of North
Carolina's largest corporate hog farmers, began airing radio and
television ads accusing Watson of voting to pollute the environment
and being anti-hog.
</P>
<P>
   An ad titled ``Flip-Flop Watson'' said Watson was ``misleading
people'' about pollution caused by the $2 billion hog industry.
Over the four months preceding Watson's May primary, Farmers for
Fairness spent $10,000 to $20,000 a week on unregulated ``issue
ads'' in her district, for a total that by some estimates exceeded
$400,000. None of the money was subject to campaign contribution
limits.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the onslaught? Watson was the hog industry's
sharpest critic. In 1997, she pushed for a two-year moratorium on
new hog operations, an effort to contain the industry's exploding
growth while officials studied the environmental problems of hog
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Now Farmers for Fairness is waging a high-stakes battle with the
North Carolina State Board of Elections in a case that election
officials believe could decide their ability to enforce laws
requiring groups to obey contribution limits and barring
corporations from engaging in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the case and another involving North Carolina
Right to Life will have broad implications for other states, most
of which have laws regulating how much individuals can contribute
to candidates and who must comply with contributor disclosure laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``If special interests are permitted to spend money this way and
get away with it, we may as well not have election laws at all,''
says Joshua Rosencranz of the Brennan Center for Justice at New
York University, which is defending state campaign laws in North
Carolina and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, the state elections board ruled in June that
the Farmers for Fairness media campaign against Watson was intended
to defeat her, a finding the group denied. The board ordered
Farmers for Fairness to register as a political action committee,
disclose its campaign contributions and expenses and refund any
donations that exceeded legal limits or came from corporate
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers for Fairness, also under attack for possible misuse of
its IRS tax exemption, is mulling a decision to defy the board's
ruling and appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The case has made for riveting drama. At an April hearing,
Farmers for Fairness officials alleged that state House Speaker
Harold Brubaker pressed the hog industry for campaign money in
return for promises that the House would not enact new hog
regulations. Then the witnesses testified that the GOP House passed
more regulations on the industry because hog farmers hadn't
contributed enough.
</P>
<P>
   Both the North Carolina Bureau of Investigation and the FBI are
investigating those allegations, which Brubaker vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's ordeal began when she was elected in 1994, becoming the
first Republican to represent District 10 in 100 years. Describing
herself a ``lifelong conservative,'' Watson said she has always
abhorred government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   After her election, however, she was inundated with calls from
her constituents. Children complained of asthma from the stench
created by hog waste. Others said the hog odors were so bad they
couldn't go outside. Some complained their wells were contaminated
by E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1995, a hog farm in her district accidentally spilled 25
million gallons of hog waste into the nearby New River, the worst
spill in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Enough was enough, Watson decided, and in 1996 and again in 1997
the Republican backed new regulations on the hog industry,
including a moratorium on new operations that expires next year.
</P>
<P>
   Watson says she was simply trying to ``represent the person who
lives next door to the hog farmer as well as the hog farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I support the swine industry and its growth, just not at the
expense of the environment or the quality of life in eastern North
Carolina,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The hog industry saw it differently, says Nick Weaver, president
of Farmers for Fairness, which was formed in 1996 during the heat
of the hog debate. The group's mission was to ``educate and inform
the general public and elected leaders about agricultural issues to
help strengthen farming,'' according to IRS filings.
</P>
<P>
   The group's first poll found that only 17 percent of voters
viewed the hog industry favorably. For the first year, the group
launched a series ads statewide that never mentioned individual
legislators and sought to boost the industry's image.
</P>
<P>
   Then in late 1997, the group switched tactics. Instead of
generic ads on hog farming, it decided to target a half-dozen
legislators, including Watson, with negative spots.
</P>
<P>
   The change apparently resulted from the belief, discussed in
closed-door strategy meetings, that the only way Farmers for
Fairness could get the attention of the state legislature was ``to
beat one of them,'' according to the findings of the elections
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had all the free press,'' says Weaver, explaining why
Farmers for Fairness singled Watson out. ``We had no other way to
tell people, average John Q. Citizen, that hogs weren't destroying
this state.''
</P>
<P>
   But testimony at the board of elections hearing disclosed that
Farmers for Fairness was interested in far more than Watson's
position on hog farming.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to advertising in Watson's district, the group polled 300
registered voters in District 10.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's second question asked the race of the respondents
(one-third of the district is black). If the answer was not white,
the interview was terminated -- a clear signal that the group
didn't want the responses of black voters, who vote largely
Democratic, but wanted only ``white Republican voters,'' according
to the elections board.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also posed hypothetical matchups between Watson and
local people who had not even declared they might be running,
asking who respondents would vote for.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a second poll was conducted, again targeting 300
white voters in District 10. This poll included a hypothetical
matchup between Watson and Johnnie Manning, a hog farmer who only
six days previously had announced his intention to challenge Watson
in the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The survey asked repsondents if they would be more or less
likely to vote for Watson if they knew ``that she put her husband
on the state payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the survey asked if respondents would be more or less
likely to vote for Manning if they knew that he had been a farmer
``all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections board concluded that these type of survey
questions were ``push polls'' designed to influence voters and
belied Farmers for Fairness's assertion that it simply wanted to
educate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blatantly transgressed,'' says Larry Leake, chairman of
the elections board. ``They were doing everything except say 'vote
for, vote against.'''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers for Fairness bumped into several provisions of North
Carolina election law, much of which is common to other states.
Since 1931, North Carolina has banned campaign contributions from
corporations on the premise that entities that can't vote shouldn't
also be allowed to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   State law also requires that any group seeking to ``influence or
attempt to influence the results of an election'' must register as
a political action committee and comply with campaign contribution
limits ($4,000 per two-year election cycle).
</P>
<P>
   Farmers for Fairness argues that it shouldn't comply with the
laws because it was engaging in ``issue advertising'' that, while
mentioning candidates, didn't specifically tell voters to vote for
or against them.
</P>
<P>
   So-called magic words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote against''
have been used by courts to determine if advertising is issue
advertising or ``electioneering'' designed to influence an
election's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't mention the magic words, we have that
right,'' says Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Leake argues that elections officials and the courts must look
beyond the so-called magic words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the intent of the message and the activity combined
together,'' he says. ``If you cannot take that step, you are going
to find all campaign financing...will be impossible to enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers for Fairness is also facing questions from a group of
non-profit organizations, who complained to the IRS last week that
the group abused its tax exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly $1.5 million that Farmers for Fairness spent in
its first year, two-thirds was treated as tax deductible to the
corporate hog farmers who contributed, according the the group's
tax return. IRS rules bar trade association members from deducting
expenses that are used to influence elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the camel's nose under the tent of corporations
finding another way to use their treasuries to have a massive
influence on political campaigns,'' says Bob Hall, research
director for Democracy South, which authored the letter to the IRS.
``And if they do it right, they also get a tax deduction.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson lost the May primary to Manning by 18 votes, but the
returns were thrown out because of voting irregularities. She faces
Manning in a re-match Sept. 15. Weaver says he isn't sure whether
Farmers for Fairness will run more ads against Watson, who raised
and spent about $21,000 in her primary.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Weaver says the group's statewide ad campaign was a
success. Hog farmers now have positive approval ratings of over 60
percent, he says, and the group enjoys new popularity in the
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made some changes in the philosophy of the state
legislature,'' he says. ``We have some friends there now who
previously were not our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a dozen environmental groups rallied at the Raleigh
Capitol to urge the General Assembly to extend the hog farming
moratorium another 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was the only legislator, Republican or Democrat, who
showed up.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ The University of Notre Dame has made
cultural icons of the Four Horsemen, Knute Rockne and The Gipper.
Over 110 years its football teams have captured 11 national titles
and produced 77 all-Americans, all while maintaining a near-perfect
graduation rate.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Notre Dame football has become the touchstone for all
that is good and right about collegiate athletics, and it served as
the very public soul for the 156-year-old university revered as the
pinnacle of higher learning for Catholic America.
</P>
<P>
   But as the football team began practicing Thursday for the 1998
season, which begins on Sept. 5 against defending national champion
Michigan, Notre Dame maintains a tenuous grip on its hallowed place
in the American sports consciousness. Its once-pristine reputation
has been battered by a lawsuit filed by a former assistant coach
that featured sordid testimony about the program, and an NCAA
review of violations involving gifts to players.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is accusing the Fighting Irish of being what's bad
and wrong about college football, the developments have led many to
wonder whether the team with the best winning percentage in college
football history is really any different from any other big-time
program trying to compete at the highest level of a
multimillion-dollar industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the people in charge didn't understand
that one of their duties was to protect the name of their
institution,'' said Richard Lieberman, the lawyer who successfully
represented the former coach, Joe Moore, in the age-discrimination
suit. ``They decided to put at risk the whole public perception of
who they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was Notre Dame any different than any other football team in
the 90's? Probably not. The names of coaches and players change,
but it's the name Notre Dame that provides the mystique. In my
view, they have taken a hit they may never recover from.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's suit was indeed a severe blow to the school's image. In
sometimes sordid depositions and testimony, witnesses detailed
bitter fighting and backstabbing among the staff of the former head
coach Lou Holtz, as well as incidents of physical abuse by coaches
against players.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, earlier this month the National Collegiate Athletic
Association found that Notre Dame committed two violations
involving trips and gifts given to five former and five current
players from a 28-year-old South Bend woman. Thursday the woman,
Kimberly Dunbar, pleaded guilty to two counts of embezzling more
than $1 million from her South Bend employer.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players have been implicated in the criminal
proceeding. But along with Dunbar, five former team members have
been named as defendants in a civil suit, including one who has a
2-year-old child with Dunbar.
</P>
<P>
   Besides demoralizing many among the school's 100,000 alumni, the
revelations have been greeted with glee by Notre Dame critics who
were put off by the sometimes holier-than-thou nature of the
football team's zealous national following. Their satisfaction is
no doubt enhanced by the school's failing football fortunes, which
included a 7-6 record last season under the first-year coach Bob
Davie.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's coaches, players, and administrators now find
themselves in an uncomfortable and contradictory position. While
insisting that they are no different from other programs, they are
trying not to distance themselves too much from the Notre Dame
mystique _ a phenomenon worth a five-year, $45 million NBC
television deal, the only one of its kind, and a rabid national
following.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get concerned when people hold Notre Dame up as if we
operate at a different standard,'' said the Rev. E. William
Beauchamp, the university's executive vice president, who oversees
athletics. ``If everybody says Notre Dame's standard is different
from everyone else's, then I don't like what that has to say about
intercollegiate athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Athletic Director Michael Wadsworth concedes that the
extraordinary media attention Notre Dame receives, combined with
its strong academic reputation and rich football heritage, have
fostered higher expectations in both performance and conduct.
``It's a mixed blessing,'' Wadsworth said. ``I'd rather have it
than not. It's what makes us unique. It also sets us up to be
knocked down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   What prompted this internal dialogue about Notre Dame's
responsibility and opened the football program up to national
ridicule was the $1.3 million law suit filed by Moore, a
66-year-old offensive line coach who was fired by Davie after the
1996 season. Moore contended he was let go because of his age, and
a jury in federal district court in Lafayette, Ind. agreed with him
and awarded him more than $86,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Moore's attorneys will file for attorney costs _
$500,000 in fees, $100,000 in expenses _ and front pay that could
reach as much as $350,000. They will also ask to have the coach
re-instated at Notre Dame. A federal district court Judge will
decide on these issues as early as October.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the Fighting Irish's reputation the case has been
costly. The university countered Moore's suit by claiming the coach
was physically abusive to players and confrontational with fellow
coaches. In stacks of well publicized depositions and at the trial,
the public was treated to a revealing and unseemly look at the
behind-the-scenes rancor at Notre Dame. The testimony included the
following contentions:
</P>
<P>
   _That Moore sometimes brutalized his offensive lineman with
punches and punishing calisthenics. Former offensive lineman Chris
Clevenger recounted in a deposition how Moore twice punched him in
the face, once drawing blood at halftime of the 1995 Blue and Gold
game, a spring exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   _That Moore and the offensive coordinator then, Dave Roberts,
nearly got into a fistfight over Moore's chain smoking before a
1995 game against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _That Holtz physically attacked former assistant Earle Mosley at
halftime of a 1996 game at Boston College after the running backs
coach got into an altercation with a fan.
</P>
<P>
   _That before a 1996 game against Navy in Dublin, Moore
discovered a group of players gathered together watching a male and
female cheerleader having sex through the window of a hotel room.
He took them out to the parking lot at 1 a.m. and made them do
calisthenics.
</P>
<P>
   _Davie's admission that, as an assistant, he and Moore had a
conversation questioning Holtz's mental stability in his
predecessor's final year and Davie's strong dislike for some of
Holtz's habits and practices.
</P>
<P>
   University officials admit the revelations were embarrassing to
Notre Dame, but say they knew they were coming and ultimately did
the right thing by taking on Moore in court. ``What would have been
wrong is to settle for an unreasonable amount of money, to look
like we hushed it up,'' says Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   But Lieberman, the attorney for Moore, said his client was
willing to settle for far less than the $1.3 million before the
suit was filed and asked for a counter offer. Lieberman said Notre
Dame refused. When the case was ordered to court mediation, the
university offered $130,000, which Lieberman said was unacceptable
because Moore had already incurred more than $250,000 in attorney
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the jury's verdict, Beauchamp still insists Moore's case
had no merit, that if the coach ``was 35'' he still would have been
fired. ``We don't like to have those type of things aired publicly,
but what came up in the trial doesn't add up to a great deal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth dismissed any suggestion that Notre Dame's image had
been irreparably harmed. ``The university's enormous record of
achievement as an academic institution, as an athletic program with
integrity, is bigger than any one coach, player or team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administrators concede there is significant concern among
the Notre Dame community. Several alumni, ranging from former
players of Frank Leahy to more recent non-athlete graduates, used
the word ``scandals'' and said they were disappointed by the recent
turn of events. But loyal to Notre Dame, they declined to speak on
the record.
</P>
<P>
   The circle-the-wagons approach extends to the players on this
year's team, who claim that the summer's controversies have not
distracted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about being a college kid is you don't have
time to read the paper or watch television,'' said Mike Rosenthal,
a captain who testified on behalf of his former offensive line
coach, Moore, at the trial. ``You find solace in the weight room
and work hard. The trial has never been a factor. As far as
testifying, they asked me questions and I just told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal said he places Moore just behind his parents as role
models.
</P>
<P>
   The senior quarterback Jarious Jackson said of the Kimberly
Dunbar case: ``It's not characteristic of Notre Dame football.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of the weight and clout the school's football
program wields nationwide, the troubles resonate far beyond the
campus. Anthony DeMaria, who coaches eight-grade football in a
Catholic School league in Kansas City, where several past Fighting
Irish players have played, is a lifelong Notre Dame fan who is
disillusioned by the recent developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There always has been a sense that Notre Dame played by the
rules, worked hard and treated each other like a family,'' he said.
``It really disappoints me when things turn out they might be like
everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   As troubling as the lawsuit to Notre Dame supporters is the
Dunbar case. Just today she pleaded guilty to embezzling money from
a local mechanical contracting firm where she was employed. She
reportedly spent some of it to purchase gifts and trips for some
current and former Notre Dame players. Earlier this month, the NCAA
decided that her contact with players was improper because she was
a member of the since disbanded Notre Dame Quarterback Club, which
it considered a ``booster organization.'' Notre Dame, which
reported the players' relationship with Dunbar to the NCAA last
spring, has taken the position that no violations occurred. They
argue that club only held pre-game luncheons and that Dunbar had a
personal relationship with the players including since-departed
Jarvis Edison, with whom she has a child.
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, her mother and sister, along with Edison, and former
Irish stars of the Holtz-era - Lee Becton, Ray Zellars, Derrick
Mayes and Kinnon Tatum _ were named as defendants in $1 million
civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Of immediate concern is the status of five current players who
accepted tickets and attended a Chicago Bulls game with Dunbar and
the some of the former players. It is unclear when the NCAA will
decide what, if any, punishment to hand down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can happen at Notre Dame, it proves that it can happen
anywhere,'' says Penn State coach, Joe Paterno. ``It takes more
character to play football these days than ever before because the
outside pressures on these kids are tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsavory headlines have been noticed by Fighting Irish fans,
according to Tim Prister, a 1982 graduate and editor of Blue &AMP; Gold
Illustrated. His popular insider magazine has heard from some of
its 55,000 subscribers covering all 50 states and 22 foreign
countries. ''Support for the program and the team is as low as it's
been before Lou Holtz got here,'' Prister said. ``It's been a
snowball. They went 7-6 last year. There's the court case and the
NCAA ruling. Expectations are very low.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows that better than Davie, the 43-year-old former
defensive coordinator who succeeded Holtz last season. The crux of
Moore's case concerned statements Davie made to players and others
about the dismissed coach's age _ though an unflattering portrait
of the Irish's new coach as a self-serving assistant also emerged
in the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Another fallout of the case is the increasingly cranky defense
from Holtz. In appearances on his current book tour, Holtz has made
it clear he's tired of the subtle suggestions that he was
ultimately responsible for Notre Dame's fall from grace. He didn't
return phone calls seeking comment, but in recent interviews has
suggested Davie hasn't been telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The current coach is eager to put the summer behind him. He
concedes that he and his staff, as well as his team, have much to
prove this season. He also says directly what his administrators
will not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take very seriously anything that tarnishes the Dome,'' said
Davie. ``At Notre Dame you are judged by a different standard and
that's fair. It is what we sell.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows that his fall can turn just as brutal as his
summer because the Irish will face six teams that beat them last
year. ``We didn't play very well on the field last year and that's
not characteristic of Notre Dame,'' said Davie. ``We can't control
what people say and write about us in the past. But we can control
what they say and write about in the future.'' &QL;

   ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE, Md. _ To the strains of ``Nearer My God
to Thee,'' the remains of 10 Americans killed by the terrorist bomb
in Kenya were borne home Thursday and received at a solemn ceremony
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10-hour, 18-minute flight from Germany, accompanied by
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the coffins were draped in
flags and escorted with full military honors to a tableau of 10
black hearses lining a giant hangar at Andrews Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton watched the precision-drill ceremony with tears
streaming down his face as the silver trumpets of the Air Force
Ceremonial Brass Band swelled with a lush arrangement of ``America
the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing can bring them back,'' the president said to an
audience of 2,500 family members, friends, the diplomatic corps and
service men and women. ``But nothing can erase the lives they
led.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who died were a cross-section of the foreign service
community, including the consul general, an Army sergeant, a
security guard and an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease
Control who was testing a new anti-malaria drug. They were killed
last Friday when a bomb blew up the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi. The
blast killed at least 247 people and wounded 5,000. Another bomb
went off simultaneously at the embassy in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
killing 10 people.

   Albright described her mission of returning with the remains in
a C-17 transport plane from Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany as
one of sorrow mingled with pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the kind of unpretentious but remarkable people who
represent America in diplomatic outposts around the world _ people
doing their jobs day in and day out, working for peace,
strengthening democracy, healing the ill, helping those in need,
winning friends for America,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After criticism in Africa that Americans were more concerned
about the few Americans who were killed than the hundreds of
Africans, officials at Thursday's ceremony pointedly remembered the
African victims. The Color Guard carried the flags of Kenya and
Tanzania, along with that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   No one referred to the State Department's admission Wednesday
that the ambassador to Kenya, Prudence Bushnell, had pleaded for
tighter security at the embassy over the last nine months but was
turned down for budgetary reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the grim ceremony focused on the dead Americans.
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, met privately with
more than 60 of the relatives for about an hour in advance, moving
from table to table for quiet conversation, so the president could
learn a bit about each of those who died.
</P>
<P>
   The service was held here instead of Dover Air Force Base, the
typical port of arrival for those killed overseas, because so many
colleagues and friends live in the Washington area. But the remains
were sent to Dover later for post-mortem examinations. From there,
the remains will be escorted to hometowns across the country.

   One widow, Debbie Hobson, whose husband, Army Sgt. Kenneth
Hobson II, of Springfield, Mo., was killed in the blast, said she
was going to take her husband's ashes to Big Sur, Calif., where
they had fallen in love, and cast them into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve Americans were killed in Kenya. The remains of Air Force
Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds went to Florida at her family's
request. The 12th victim, Jean Dalizu, is to be buried in Kenya,
where her husband lives.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the families of three victims _
Julian Bartley, the consul general; Jay Bartley, his son, and
Prabhi Guptara Kavaler, a general services officer at the Nairobi
embassy _ had requested burials at Arlington National Cemetery. The
officials, who said they were unaware that any of the three had
served in the military, said that the secretary of the Army was
reviewing the requests, and that the White House was to announce
the decision Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Burial for non-veterans at the increasingly crowded cemetery has
become a sensitive matter, especially for veterans groups. Last
month a Capitol Hill police officer who was shot to death in the
Capitol was buried at Arlington, even though he had not served in
the military.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony had a Washington air. Many of the mourners wore
government identification tags on chains around their necks or
clipped to their jackets. A voice on the public address system
asked mourners to deactivate their cell phones and pagers during
the service. And everyone had to pass through a security check.
</P>
<P>
   When the transport plane nudged into view of the hangar, the
25-piece brass and percussion ensemble played ``Nearer My God to
Thee.'' The back doors of the hearses were opened, and their white
tail lights reflected off the glossy hangar floor as pall bearers
from each branch of the services, in full dress uniforms, delivered
each coffin from the plane.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 45-minute ceremony, drivers silently pressed
the hearse doors shut and drove off, one by one, with a slight
delay when one hearse would not start. The hearses drove onto the
airfield, where they waited until the mourners left. The hearses
then returned to the hangar and the coffins were reloaded onto the
transport plane for the flight to Dover.

U.S. WILL HELP COLOMBIA COCA GROWERS SWITCH TO OTHER CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ After long refusing to pay for programs to
help Colombia's coca growers switch to legal crops, the United
States is now agreeing to finance alternative development under
this country's new administration.
</P>
<P>
   While the precise amounts and mechanisms of the help have not
been determined, U.S. officials say that development aid will be
part of the U.S. anti-drug strategy in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, has insisted that
aerial fumigation of drug crops, the cornerstone of U.S.
counter-narcotics efforts here, is useless without providing coca
growers with a legal alternative. He has announced his intention to
create what he calls a Marshall Plan for government investment in
coca-growing regions, similar to the U.S.-financed reconstruction
of Western Europe after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, U.S. officials have given minimal aid _ less than
$1 million a year _ to finance consultants to study alternative
development in Colombia, but no direct assistance for crop
substitution work.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru and Bolivia, rural development, in conjunction with
eradication or other law enforcement efforts, has paid off. In
Peru, coca production dropped 40 percent in the last two years; in
Bolivia, it declined 7 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials have ruled out such aid for Colombia in the
past, citing distrust of the previous administration of President
Ernesto Samper and rebel dominance of coca-growing regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Uribe, a consultant to the National Drugs Council who
advised Pastrana on drug control strategy during his campaign,
called the U.S. move to support alternative development ``the first
admission that American eradication policy is not working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we've always told them, that eradication for
eradication's sake doesn't work,'' Uribe said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   As the head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, Thomas
Constantine, arrived here to lay wreaths honoring the 143 soldiers
and police officers killed in a pre-inaugural rampage by rebel
forces last week, U.S. officials denied that any Americans were
among those killed or taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel commander, Jorge Briceno of the the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, had been quoted in the daily El
Espectador as saying that Americans were among those abducted by
the group during the hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``No American citizen was captured or killed during the recent
guerrilla attacks in Colombia,'' a U.S. Embassy statement said. The
attacks covered half the countryside and leveled the
counter-narcotics base at Miraflores. About 300 Colombians were
killed, and 124 police officers and soldiers were abducted.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter of condolence to Pastrana, sent hours before his
inauguration last Friday and made public in Bogota, President
Clinton pledged $2 million to help internal refugees, and promised
to seek congressional approval for stepping up aid to the military
and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also propose to increase our other assistance to Colombia
to include support for a multi-year alternative development program
and for justice sector reforms and human rights,'' Clinton wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has made peace negotiations with Colombia's 20,000
armed rebels a priority of his administration. The rebels have
indicated they would curtail the drug trade among peasants in zones
they control as part of a peace accord. But some see the offer as a
gambit to gain autonomy over parts of eastern Colombia, from which
the rebels could launch further attacks after signing a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are skeptical that the rebels, who are estimated
to earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year for protecting coca
crops and laboratories, would seriously curtail trafficking. ``That
would be like killing the goose that lays the golden egg,'' one
said. Last week's attack on Miraflores has only heightened their
doubts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are saying that aid for alternative development
would flow only to areas where the government has established
control. The aid could be a way to strengthen the state presence,
whose absence peasants in remote regions cite as one reason for
guerrilla control.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials, who insisted on anonymity, said that aid might
not take the form of crop substitution, but could involve finding
other ways for reformed coca growers to make a living, like
development of local industry. Most Colombians live in rural areas,
but their country's economic opening in the early 1990s destroyed
the market for traditional domestic crops.
</P>
<P>
   White House anti-drug chief Barry McCaffrey told reporters last
week that eradication would remain ``the central aspect of U.S.
counternarcotics thinking.'' He added, ``That can't be taken off
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as a new military high command took over, Miraflores
remained in a state of ``red alert,'' beyond government control, a
police spokesman here said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana replaced Gen. Manuel Jose Bonett, chief of the Combined
Armed Forces, and other senior commanders with officers who have
openly supported a peace agreement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The military is particularly discredited now. Investigations
have shown government soldiers were beaten after commanders failed
to back up units under rebel attack. The military's budget largely
benefits senior officers, while foot soldiers often go hungry,
military experts here say.
</P>
<P>
   Two senior officers are under investigation for ties to
right-wing paramilitary death squads, which traffic in drugs. A
third, Gen. Ivan Ramirez, lost his U.S. visa because of his alleged
ties to the death squads.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington Post report that Ramirez was also a paid informant
for the U.S. CIA has caused a stir in Colombia.

 &HT;    Doctors 'confused' over wording in abortion ban law
 &HT;    By Lisa Ocker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two abortion doctors testified Thursday they would be
afraid to perform even the simplest, safest procedures for fear of
prosecution under a new state law.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Edward Watson and James Pendergraft said the wording of the
so-called partial-birth abortion ban is so vague that it could
outlaw numerous types of abortion procedures, even those at the
earliest stage of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, of A Choice for Women clinic in Miami, and Pendergraft,
of Orlando Women's Center, are among several Florida abortion
providers asking U.S. District Judge Donald Graham to declare the
law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A June 30 ruling by Graham temporarily blocked enactment of the
law. The doctors, represented by attorneys from the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy in New York, asked him Thursday for an
extension of the ruling until a trial can decide the law's
constitutionality.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is language in law, which bans a procedure in which a
physician ``partially vaginally delivers a living fetus before
killing the fetus and completing the delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Kathleen Burgener said the language
was more precise than medical terminology, which sometimes is
misused by physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors disagreed. ``I'm confused by it,'' said Dr. Charles
deProsse, a retired physician and professor from Iowa. ''It doesn't
describe for me a medical procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said most common abortions involve the removal of fetal
material through a woman's vagina, rather than abdominally through
a hysterectomy or Caesarian section. And they testified that they
do not know when in the procedure the fetus no longer is
``living.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, attorney BeBe Anderson from the Center for
Reproductive Law and Policy argued that the law is unconstitutional
because it violates a woman's right to privacy in choosing safe,
commonly used abortion procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The law provides criminal penalties against doctors who break
the law _ including up to five years in prison and $5,000 fines _
and creates the possibility that they could be sued by fetus'
fathers or grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony continues Friday in Miami.

 &HT;    Investigators looking into Haitian smuggling ring
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH, Fla. _ Authorities are investigating a link
between Haitians who are landing on Palm Beach County beaches and
local go-betweens who collect money from families to have their
relatives smuggled into the country.
</P>
<P>
   A team of local and federal law enforcement officials
interviewed Haitian-American community leaders Thursday in an
attempt to identify members of the smuggling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lincoln, director of law enforcement for the sheriff's
office, declined to comment on the investigation after leaving the
Haitian American Community Council. He said the sheriff's office is
investigating the deaths of two Haitians who drowned Monday when
two boatloads of immigrants came ashore near Jupiter Inlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the information that has developed, the (sheriff's
office) is assisting federal agents to see whether there are any
connections in South Florida,'' sheriff's spokesman Paul Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the Haitian-American community in Delray Beach say
two smugglers are known to operate in the area. They use beepers
and have no known offices or residences.
</P>
<P>
   Families pay up to $9,000 or more in advance to arrange for the
smugglers to transport relatives from Haiti to the Bahamas then to
the South Florida coastline, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Dorsonne, the father of the 26-year-old woman who drowned
Monday, said Thursday that Benette Dorsonne had come on her own.
Although he sent his daughter money for living expenses in Haiti,
the family paid no money to smugglers, he said.

 &HT;    Roselle Como, wife of Perry Como, dies at 84
 &HT;    By Thom Smith

<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. _ Roselle Como, wife of entertainer Perry Como,
died Tuesday after suffering a massive heart attack. Mrs. Como, 84,
was buried Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, the Comos had celebrated their 65th wedding
anniversary. They had lived in Jupiter since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Roselle Beline was born to French immigrant parents in the
southwest Pennsylvania mining town of Canonsburg in 1914. From the
moment Perry, then a teenaged barber, asked her to be his first
date at a school dance, she was always ``his girl.'' They married
in 1933, as Como left barbering to sing with Freddie Corlone's
orchestra. When he had doubts about a life on the road, she
convinced him to pursue his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that I wasn't always a success,'' Perry Como
once said. ``In the early years, there were some rough times when I
thought I'd quit (show) business. Roselle always stood by me.''
</P>
<P>
   As her husband's career flourished, Mrs. Como ran the home and
raised their three children, insulating them from the distractions
of show business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a home,'' Perry said. ``Roselle made it that. The world
that fussed over Perry Como never made it through the front door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew what I had with Roselle was special,'' Como once
said. ``I worked with the world's greatest talents, and then went
home to the world's greatest woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mass was served by the Rev. Tom Vengayil, parish priest at St.
Jude Roman Catholic Church in Jupiter, who said the family
requested that services remain private. The Rev. Frank Lechiara of
St. Edwards Church in Palm Beach, a longtime family friend,
delivered the eulogy to an estimated 60 family members and close
friends. Mrs. Como was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Como is survived by her husband, three children, 12
grandchildren and three great grandchildren.

STUDY FINDS HOW GENE'S DEFECTS CAUSE BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md., Neb.)  (mk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of North Carolina have made an
important discovery about how defects in one of the two breast
cancer genes, BRCA1, raise the risk of the disease: They leave
cells without the normal ability to correct certain mistakes that
commonly occur in their genetic machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and experts elsewhere say the finding has potentially
important clinical implications for people known to carry the
defective gene in their cells. On the one hand, it could result in
more effective treatments for hereditary breast cancer. It could
also lead to a test that would predict which of the women and men
who carry the defective gene are most likely to develop cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new understanding raises questions about
the safety of starting at a young age to do regular mammograms in
women who inherit the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   The new information, reported in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, will add to the understanding of how cancer starts and
what might be done to prevent it. The lead author of the study,
Lori Gwen, a graduate student, said, ``This is the first direct
evidence of a function for this tumor-suppressor gene, and it helps
to explain how the gene may be involved in cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, done in specially altered cells derived from a mouse,
showed that the BRCA1 gene directly or indirectly participates in a
process called transcription-coupled repair, a rapid means of
correcting mistakes that occur in the DNA of other genes.
</P>
<P>
   When people make a mistake writing with a pencil, they use an
eraser, on the typewriter they use white-out and on the computer,
the delete button. When an error occurs in the DNA of a gene, cells
rely on an error-specific repair mechanism to knock out the errant
information.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's report, Ms. Gowen, Dr. Steven Leadon and colleagues
report that the normal task of BRCA1, one of the two genes known to
be involved in hereditary cancers of the breast and ovary, is to
repair DNA damage caused by oxidation, a process that occurs
continually in the body in the course of normal metabolism and that
can also result from exposure to outside agents like radiation.
</P>
<P>
   When BRCA1 is defective, it is unable to repair oxidative DNA
damage, the most common insult to the genetic material of cells
throughout the body. A defective BRCA1 gene is responsible for
about 5 percent of all breast cancers and can affect men as well as
women in families with hereditary breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An accumulation of genetic damage to the DNA is how overexposure
to sunlight can cause skin cancer and an overdose of radiation from
X-rays can cause cancer in internal tissues like the thyroid gland.
When oxidative damage occurs in genes that determine cell growth
and when the mechanism that normally repairs such damage fails to
work properly, the cell is no longer able to keep its growth in
check and a malignant tumor results.
</P>
<P>
   There are already several other cancers that have been linked to
genes that have lost their ability to repair defective DNA. Skin
cancers commonly occur in people with the rare hereditary disorder,
xeroderma pigmentosum, after exposure to sunlight. Another is a
rare hereditary form of colon cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colon
cancer, or Lynch syndrome, in which a defective repair gene fails
to correct a mismatch in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins
University who unraveled the defect involved in the colon cancer
gene, said that someone who carried a defective BRCA gene started
out with both a normal and a defective version of the gene in each
cell. But when a particular mutation occurs in the normal BRCA gene
in breast or ovarian tissue, the pace of DNA repair changes from
that of a sprint to a slow crawl. This allows mistakes to
accumulate that may eventually result in the uncontrolled growth of
a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But Vogelstein also suggested that an inability to rapidly
repair oxidative damage might prove to be a tumor's Achilles heel
and lead to new improved therapies. The defect suggests, he said,
that these tumors ``are likely to be extremely sensitive'' to
therapeutic radiation or to chemotherapy drugs that cause oxidative
damage. Tumor cells would be hit harder by such treatment than
normal cells, which would still have one normal copy of the BRCA
gene that could correct oxidative damage induced by the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Leadon, a molecular biologist who studies how damaged DNA is
repaired, suggested another benefit: the possibility of determining
who has a defect in BRCA1 that ``would lead to an inability to
carry out oxidative repair.'' He said that ``BRCA1 is a very large
gene that probably has multiple functions and can have mutations
that are not important.'' Leadon added that the new finding ``will
help us determine which mutations are important,'' which could
eventually lead to a test that revealed who would be most likely to
get cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Henry Lynch, an oncologist and expert on hereditary
cancers at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., suggested that the
new finding could prove to be ``a double-edged sword of Damocles.''
Lynch said that if a woman known to carry one defective BRCA1 gene
was subjected to repeated mammograms, say, starting at the age of
25, the X-rays would help detect an early, more curable breast
cancer, but at the same time the cumulative exposure to radiation
might increase her risk of developing a cancer.

JAPAN'S CORRUPTION FIGHTER IS SHUNTED ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHERYL WuDUnn   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Earlier this year, it seemed that a sweeping corruption
investigation might send a good number of Japan's mighty
philosopher-kings, the bureaucrats who largely run the country, to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, despite a cabinet change, nearly the only
government employee who has gone anywhere is Katsuhiko Kumazaki,
the prosecutor who led a much-heralded investigation into scandals
involving expensive free entertainment paid for by businessmen who
wanted the bureaucrats' favor.
</P>
<P>
   Kumazaki, 56, was transferred in June to a relatively remote
coastal city, and the investigation seems to have fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent collapse of last winter's investigation, without
snaring many high-level officials, underscores the resiliency of
Japan's traditional way of governing.
</P>
<P>
   There has been extensive criticism in the last few years of the
Japanese bureaucracy, which makes and carries out policy with far
less interference from elected officials than bureaucrats or civil
servants in the United States, and there had been an expectation of
far-reaching change.
</P>
<P>
   Kumazaki's investigation did bring about the arrests of more
than 30 executives of financial institutions. Four officials of the
Finance Ministry and one from the Bank of Japan, the central bank,
were also taken into custody on charges of having accepted bribes
in the form of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the investigation seemed to readjust the pecking
order in Japan. Traditionally, the most respected elite in the
country was the corps of career bureaucrats in the Finance
Ministry. But their glory seemed to fade a bit when Japanese turned
on their television sets in the spring and saw images of armies of
prosecutors marching into the Finance Ministry, the central bank
and the nation's top commercial banks to confiscate boxes of
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, surprisingly little is different. And Kasumigaseki,
the district near the imperial palace where the government
ministries are situated, has emerged only partly chastened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation destroyed the common wisdom in Kasumigaseki
that being entertained was not a problem, but it ended halfway, and
I regret that,'' said Michio Sato, a member of the lower house of
parliament who is a former prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Kumazaki, who is not giving interviews, was not the only man
behind the investigation. But as the head of the Tokyo prosecutor's
office, he essentially directed it. His transfer brings the inquiry
substantially to a close.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he works in a city that is bypassed by the bullet
train, where only six flights a day land at the airport. Back in
Tokyo, the lights in the special prosecutors' offices go out early.
There has not been a prominent arrest in months, and the legal crew
of dozens of people poring over boxes of confiscated documents has
dwindled to less than half.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kumazaki's investigation has apparently fizzled, there
is some possibility that there will be other efforts to crack down
on bankers and bureaucrats. Some experts say arrests of bankers and
officials may result from the government's new plans to clean up
the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Those plans, which could be carried out in the fall if approved
by parliament, may lead to disclosures of unsound or dishonest
banking practices and bureaucratic complicity in those practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they embezzle, cheat or that kind of thing _ criminal
conduct _ I think they will be sent out,'' said Kiichi Miyazawa, a
former prime minister who is now finance minister. But he added a
cautionary note: ``It really takes time. Nothing happens all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kumazaki's investigation did have one long-term
consequence. It made bureaucrats far more careful about accepting
meals or entertainment from business executives. These days,
Finance Ministry officials say they eat lunch in the ministry's
cafeteria and have their evenings and weekends free.
</P>
<P>
   Their hesitance about accepting dinners arises in part because
prosecutors like Kumazaki pounced on bureaucrats on suspicion they
had accepted bribes that were not in cash but in the form of
regular dinner invitations, lunches and golf outings.
</P>
<P>
   No cash ever changed hands, and the dinners in some cases
amounted to several hundred dollars _ which is not an outlandish
figure in Tokyo's high-priced restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   For the Finance Ministry mandarins, though, probably the worst
part of the punishment was that their names were published in the
newspapers, along with the punishments received.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they don't indict a single person, the question is
whether these people have been punished socially,'' said Jiro
Nomura, who teaches law at the Chiba Institute of Technology. ``For
those who quit the Finance Ministry or received other punishments
announced by the Finance Ministry, that is considered to have been
punishment enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministry officials say that morale is low, and that attitudes
are indeed changing. The Finance Ministry and the central bank are
not attracting the elite graduates the way they used to. The best
students are taking jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a kind of cultural revolution in Japan,'' said a
senior Finance Ministry official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. The investigation ``destroyed the old establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the scandal to a wager gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone is playing golf, they often bet small money or
some chocolates,'' he explained. ``And then suddenly the police
arrest him for gambling. This is the kind of feeling we have
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say such sentiments will be short-lived, mainly
because business entertainment has been part of the Japanese
culture for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things will go back to the old-fashioned way,'' said a
Japanese journalist who covers the courts and the prosecutors for a
major daily newspaper. ``Entertaining has been a part of the
Japanese custom for several centuries. I don't think it will go
away just because of the current investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts say there was a good deal of political
pressure on Justice Ministry officials and the prosecutors to wind
up the investigation. With the economy slipping into recession and
the banks swimming in several hundred billion dollars in bad debt,
these experts say, the government needs its mandarins to steer the
country back on track.
</P>
<P>
   And a rash of suicides by people under investigation or involved
in the inquiry alarmed the nation and dampened public enthusiasm
for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the top-ranked justice officials looked around at the
sentiment in society,'' said the Japanese journalist, who spoke on
the condition of anonymity. ``Criticism was mounting in the
political and business world. People were using the term
`prosecutors' recession.' So high-ranked Justice Ministry officials
made this decision to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that the challenge of taking on the Finance Ministry
was just too great and that Kumazaki and his team hardly got past
the door of the ministry before they were overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation was epoch-making, but Kumazaki was pushed
back at the entrance,'' said Nobuto Hosaka, a member of parliament.
``That is the reality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The growing possibility of a devaluation of the Russian ruble
swept the world's markets on Thursday. Although the Russians insist
there will not be a devaluation, the threat has already led to a
major selloff in emerging markets and proved a drag on Wall Street
and other major stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of immediate shocks in the markets is only the
first of many worries. Given all the other problems clouding the
world's economic outlook _ like the falling yen and the deepening
woes in the rest of Asia _ Russia's crisis could be a sign of a
broadening malaise that would stunt the stubbornly strong economy
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what is going on in Asia and Russia spreads to Latin
America, I can't see how the United States can be immune from
that,'' said Desmond Lachman, managing director of emerging markets
economic research at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble scare, which has been a low-level worry for some time,
stole the spotlight from Southeast Asia on Wednesday as the Russian
government imposed currency controls, seen by some as a precursor
to a devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Russian stock market plunged and was closed
temporarily as sellers swamped buyers. Yields on short-term Russian
bonds jumped to nearly 200 percent. The main stock market index
fell 6.5 percent for the day, resulting in a loss of almost 50
percent in just the last four weeks. Adding insult to injury,
George Soros, a well-known financier, called for major financial
reforms and a 15 percent to 25 percent devaluation of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complex situation, and the risk is that investors
will rush for the door,'' said Constance Hunter, a portfolio
manager for Firebird Management LLC, which runs three hedge funds
investing in equities and bonds in the countries of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's woes have been building for some time despite the
approval of a $22.6 billion rescue package cobbled together in July
by the International Monetary Fund and various nations.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples have been felt in places that do business with
Russia and in other emerging markets whose currencies are
considered particularly vulnerable. Although three of Latin
America's main stock markets _ Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela _ rose
Thursday, they had plunged on Wednesday and their main indexes are
down 22 percent or more for the last four weeks. The stock markets
in Poland and Hungary all fell Thursday and their main indexes are
off 14 percent or more for the four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the riskiness of debt from emerging economies has become more
apparent, investors have demanded ever higher yields. The premium
on bonds issued by emerging market countries has soared, jumping to
nearly 9 percentage points over comparable U.S. Treasury rates from
around 6 percentage points at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its been fairly ugly the last week,'' Lachman said.
</P>
<P>
   The world's developed stock markets have been more insulated.
But some sectors, especially German banks, are vulnerable given
their lending activities and investments in Russia. The uncertainty
in Russia added to the negative sentiment in the United States and
European stock markets Thursday, contributing to a 1.1 percent
decline in the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   And the list of risks to the markets and the world's economies
keeps growing: the drag of the Asian crisis on corporate earnings;
the performance of the new Japanese government; the threat of China
devaluing its currency; President Clinton's testimony in the
Lewinsky matter on Monday;, and Iraq's refusal to permit full
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   A ruble devaluation, of course, would lead to bigger concerns.
``If Russia devalued, the second-biggest nuclear power on the
planet would be in a severe financial crisis, which would raise the
issue of a growing political crisis,'' said Jeffrey Applegate,
chief U.S. investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. While he does
not expect a devaluation, he said, ``No one is immune from that
increase in political risk.''

</P>
<P>
   German banks seem to be the most vulnerable to the new financial
turmoil in Russia. According to the Bank for International
Settlements, German banks had $30.5 billion in loans outstanding to
Russia at the end of last year, about 40 percent of Russia's total
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Merrill Lynch in London, the four biggest German
banks say their net exposure, after offsetting credits and
reserves, is $3 billion, but their stocks have slid sharply.
Deutsche Bank stock is down 18.9 percent since July 21 while
Dresdner Bank is off 17.4 percent since July 22.
</P>
<P>
   American banks have far less exposure, with $7.1 billion,
according to the BIS. Charles Peabody, a bank stocks analyst at
Mitchell Securities, said in a recent report that ``the good news
is that U.S. bank exposure to Russia is minimal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``J.P. Morgan is probably the largest exposure, which I estimate
at $1.5 billion to $2 billion,'' he said. Chase Manhattan also owns
Russian Treasury bills, known as GKOs, which would lose value in a
devaluation or a debt restructuring designed to give Russia more
time to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts caution that parsing the impact of a Russian
devaluation is complicated. The effect on emerging markets, which
have a habit of swooning en masse when one of their own is in
trouble, would certainly be greater than on the markets of Europe
and the United States. And the overall impact would be less severe
than that of a Chinese devaluation of its currency, the yuan, which
would worsen the situation throughout Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, ``the political risk over the next couple of years is
more important,'' said David Bowers, European equity strategist for
Merrill Lynch in London. ``You may end up with a more nationalist
tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowers says the economic risk is greater from Japan, a much
larger economy now mired in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's deepening financial mess, some investors still
expect the IMF, the United States and its key industrial allies to
come up with additional aid to stabilize the situation and the
currency.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences of a ruble devaluation would be too severe,
they argue, as it would re-ignite inflation and threaten to
undermine the current government. And there is a history to support
that argument. Clinton is scheduled to go to Russia on Sept. 1 and
2, and the United States took action to support the falling yen and
provide stability in Asia before the president's visit to China in
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason you haven't seen it get worse is that
people are banking on the United States and the G-7 to step up and
give more assistance,'' said Hunter of Firebird Management. That
hope may explain why Russian stocks and bonds bounced off their
lows Thursday and why there was a rally in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis has frozen some money. Mark Mobius, the managing
director of Templeton Asset Management, moved aggressively into
Russia in the last few years through his Templeton Russia Fund,
whose net asset value lost 52 percent for the first seven months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't buy anything,'' he said of his strategy since the
first wave of the Russian crisis hit in May. ``I had a lot of
doubts at the time, and anyone who got in at that time was quite
brave.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is he doing now? ``Now we are trying to assess what the
next step for Russia is. Is it going to be a political crisis as
well as an economic one?''

A WRITER ONCE SHUNNED RETURNS TO HIS ALMA MATER, WEST POINT

<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ Lucian K. Truscott IV has never been shy
about pointing _ or, more precisely, wagging _ his finger at his
hallowed alma mater, which looms tall and imposing above the Hudson
River here.
</P>
<P>
   In a quarter century of novels, newspaper articles and
television appearances, and most famously in his best-selling 1978
mystery ``Dress Gray,'' Truscott has chided the United States
Military Academy and the Army for secrecy and chastised them for
sexism and homophobia, describing flawed societies too often
governed by prejudice and personal ambition.
</P>
<P>
   That holds true in Truscott's new novel, ``Full Dress Gray,''
published by William Morrow &AMP; Co. last month. Once again, the
academy's immaculate grounds are suffused with the stench of foul
play. Once again, its Gothic edifices are cauldrons of duplicity
and deceit, bubbling over with sexual violence.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise is not what's in the pages of Truscott's potboiler.
It's the academy's response.
</P>
<P>
   The academy bookstore has set up two signings for Truscott on
Friday. The superintendent has invited him over for coffee before
the first one. The academic dean has asked him to dinner after the
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I would never be welcome up there again,'' Truscott,
who graduated from the academy in 1969, said in a telephone
interview the other day from his home in Los Angeles. ``Now they're
in the process of milling a whole new red carpet to run out for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be a bit of an overstatement. But Truscott is certainly
getting a reception unlike any he has experienced in the past, and
his trip to West Point this week reflects a larger, longer journey
that the academy itself has taken, traveling over recent years
toward greater openness and a more measured, sophisticated response
to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different era in the evolution of West Point,'' said
Brig. Gen. Fletcher M. Lamkin Jr., the academic dean, in an
interview here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lamkin, dressed in an olive and forest green camouflage uniform,
was all warm smiles as he spoke of his keen interest in meeting
Truscott. ``I find him interesting,'' Lamkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, ``There's nothing wrong with bringing
controversial people to West Point,'' pointing out that during the
last academic year, both the folk singer Pete Seeger, who protested
vigorously against the Vietnam War, and the gender-bending pundit
Camille Paglia, whose sexual candor rivals Madonna's, gave speeches
at the academy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the academy's current administrators were not around
when ``Dress Gray'' was published, they said their understanding
was that it was greeted with a less tolerant, less sanguine
attitude. Truscott certainly remembers it that way, and news
reports from the time back him up.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bookstore carried the novel, active duty officers
were reportedly forbidden to make public comments about ``Dress
Gray,'' which imagined the murder of a gay cadet at the academy and
an elaborate cover-up by officers to conceal what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   The official academy newspaper ran a prepublication review,
written by a public affairs officer, that described ``Dress Gray''
as an effort to ``foist a story of perversion and intrigue on a
setting totally at odds with such a set of happenings.'' When the
book was subsequently made into a TV mini-series, the setting was
changed to a fictive military institution in part to ward off cries
of protest from West Point.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Andrew Goodpaster, who was the superintendent of the
academy when ``Dress Gray'' was published, said that he could not
recall any official policy regarding the book, but that it was
generally considered an ``assault on West Point.'' He never
contemplated meeting Truscott, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was then regarded as an enemy of West Point,'' Goodpaster,
now retired and living in Alexandria, Va., said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But most cadets interviewed at random at the academy Thursday
had heard little or nothing about ``Full Dress Gray,'' and the
current superintendent, Lieut. Gen. Daniel Christman, talked about
Truscott in relatively flattering terms. ``I've been very impressed
with his writing,'' Christman said.
</P>
<P>
   Christman said that in ``Full Dress Gray,'' Truscott correctly
reasons that ``institutions that stay hog-bound to tradition for no
other reason than that it's tradition quickly become irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful read on those issues,'' Christman said.

 WEST POINT, N.Y.: Christman said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His complimentary words can be attributed in part to subtle
differences between ``Full Dress Gray'' and its predecessor. The
tone of the new book is less heated, and its protagonist, Ry
Slaight, who was a cadet bucking a corrupt power structure in
``Dress Gray,'' is now part of that power structure, proving that
there are heroes and good intentions in high places.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is plenty for the academy to loathe in ``Full Dress
Gray,'' which involves the mysterious death of a female cadet; a
senior officer engaged in adultery with another officer's wife;
brutal misogyny among male cadets, and intimations of gang rape.
</P>
<P>
   The salient change from ``Dress Gray'' to ``Full Dress Gray'' is
in the climate surrounding each book. Senior officers at the
academy said that in the late 1970s, the academy was smarting from
a widely publicized cheating scandal in 1976. Also, like the Army
for which it was training officers, the academy was still reeling
from an anti-military sentiment in the United States that had
carried over from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time,'' Christman said. ``Everything was
tarnished by Vietnam and the overtones of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the more positive public reaction to America's most recent
war, with Iraq, has relaxed the military's defensiveness. And the
less obvious role of the military in the aftermath of the Cold War
behooves it to take a friendlier approach toward public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a real knowledge and understanding that at a
time when we are at peace in the world, when there is no massive,
solid support for the military and people question the need for it,
you've got to be more sophisticated in dealing with the public and
the press and critics,'' said Dave Palmer, a retired lieutenant
general who was the academy's superintendent from 1986 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the academy gives more access to reporters and camera
crews than it ever did in the past, though it does not throw
caution entirely to the wind. Public affairs officers emphasized
that administrators interviewed for this article were expressing
personal opinions about ``Full Dress Gray'' and not any official
academy position.
</P>
<P>
   The academy's relatively unbothered reaction to ``Full Dress
Gray'' may also acknowledge that while some of the scenarios in
Truscott's novel are riper than reality, the sexual tensions and
transgressions he describes merely echo a spate of actual scandals
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   And the liberalization of the Army as it pursues better
integration of men and women has nudged many officers closer toward
the end of the political spectrum from which Truscott has always
fired off his critical salvos.
</P>
<P>
   Truscott, 51, the descendant of high-ranking Army officers,
wrote for The Village Voice when he was at West Point, belonged to
a group of cadets who mounted a successful legal challenge to the
constitutionality of compulsory chapel services and was considered
a leftist rabble-rouser.
</P>
<P>
   His relations with superiors in the Army were so bitter that he
was released from his obligation of service and given an
other-than-honorable discharge about a year after he left West
Point.
</P>
<P>
   He described the academy and the military then as sometimes

 &HT;    Delta III: Historic for Pratt
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) general news and (f) financial categories.)

<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ When the new Delta III rocket takes off
10 days from today, it will be a milestone for manufacturer Boeing
and its upper-stage rocket subcontractor, Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   For Boeing, it will be the first launch of a rocket that allows
it to send larger, heavier communications satellites into orbit.
For Pratt, the launch will mark the first time that its RL10 rocket
is used as the upper stage by all U.S. commercial launch companies.
Already, the RL10 is used as the upper-stage rocket _ the engine
that pushes the payload into orbit _ on the Titan and Atlas launch
vehicles made by Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our entry into the Delta family,'' said RL10 programs
manager Peter Sharf.
</P>
<P>
   What impressed Boeing is the increased power the new RL10B-2
could provide while using less fuel, helping Boeing to almost
double its payload size, said Mark Wilkins, Boeing's Delta III
product team leader.
</P>
<P>
   One Delta III launch is scheduled for this year, with four more
set for 1999. Boeing could accommodate two more next year,
according to Delta III program manager Dan Collins.
</P>
<P>
   With the addition of the Delta III, Pratt is positioned to take
advantage of what has become a growth industry in the 1990s _ the
commercial launch of communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola and its partners have been paying for commercial
launches over the past 18 months for their Iridium network, the
string of satellites that will allow users to make wireless calls
and receive pages anywhere in the world. Iridium goes into
operation next month. And other satellite constellations are in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   The RL10, in some form, has been around since 1958, but Pratt
had its biggest production year in 1996, when it made 26. It
delivered 22 last year and expects to ship 20 in 1998, Sharf said.
It hopes to make 20 or more next year.
</P>
<P>
   The RL10 has been one of Pratt's more stable sources of revenue.
The company's Liquid Space Propulsion unit in northwestern Palm
Beach County accounts for $200 million of Pratt's $600 million
annually from space operations, with the RL10 alone contributing
$100 million. About 200 to 300 employees are involved in its design
and manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   The company's next move will be to sell the RL10 to overseas
launch companies, Sharf said. But for now, expanding to Boeing's
Delta line of rocket boosters is satisfaction enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The excitement for us is to get into Boeing world,'' Sharf
said.

 &HT;    Company that bears Nicklaus' name removed from NASDAQ
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) general news and (s) sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Phil Galewitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jack Nicklaus' publicly traded golf
company was delisted by the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday because it
no longer meets capital requirements.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Golden Bear Golf Inc., based in North Palm Beach,
will either have to trade on the less visible over-the-counter
bulletin board or in the pink sheets, a daily publication of
infrequently traded, over-the-counter stocks that brokers subscribe
to.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in the Nicklaus lead company stopped trading last month
after the company announced a major revision to its 1997 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Bear was tossed by Nasdaq because it no longer had at
least $4 million in net tangible assets, that is the total assets
minus their total liabilities, the company said. Assets in this
case do not include goodwill, which is the amount of money a
company thinks its assets might be worth in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Bear (Nasdaq: JACK) said it will not fight the delisting,
which will become effective at the close of business Tuesday. The
company said it will seek to have its securities traded on the
other markets after it files its amended 10-K for 1997 and its
quarterly earnings statement for the period ended June 30 with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. Spokesman Kenshen Bizzelli said
he did not know when the company planned to submit those reports.
</P>
<P>
   Bizzelli played down the significance of being delisted. ``We
see it as a neutral move that will have no impact on the company,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, companies get considerably more visibility on the
Nasdaq, largely because the stock market is listed in most
newspapers around the country along with the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Bear made its debut on the Nasdaq on Aug. 1, 1996. The
company raised nearly $37 million that day to help it buy golf
driving ranges, then its ``core'' business. But Golden Bear
jettisoned all of its 14 centers in June when it became clear it
could not make money on them. At the time, Golden Bear said it
would concentrate on its golf course construction business and
licensing Nicklaus apparel.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company said it will report a restated loss of
$24.7 million for 1997 to reflect evidence that former management
of a subsidiary falsified financial records. Golden Bear originally
posted a loss of $2.9 million for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, seven lawsuits have been filed against Golden Bear
in U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach, including two filed
Thursday. All accuse the company of falsifying records. The law
firms of Berman, DeValerio &AMP; Pease of Boston and West Palm Beach
and Weiss &AMP; Yourman of New York filed the suits Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus has been unavailable for comment since Golden Bear's
problems began this spring.

ACTIVISTS CRITICIZE BARNICLE DECISION, SEEK SMITH REINSTATEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DANIEL A. GRECH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three activists in Boston's black community held a
press conference Thursday morning decrying a decision by The Boston
Globe to reinstate columnist Mike Barnicle on Tuesday after firing
black columnist Patricia Smith in June for what the activists said
were similar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Sadiki Kambon, president of the Black
Community Information Center, said that if Smith is not reinstated,
then ``a call would be put out to the community of color to
boycott'' the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening, the Black Political Task Force issued a
statement criticizing Barnicle's reinstatement and asking for the
resignation of Globe Editor Matthew V. Storin.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to fairness, the Globe's disciplinary actions
simply do not meet the smell test,'' wrote Lloyd H. King, president
of the task force, contrasting Barnicle's treatment with that of
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Storin has maintained that Barnicle's offense _ using
unattributed materials in his column _ was different in magnitude
from Smith's. Smith resigned in June after admitting to fabricating
characters in four columns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another black leader, the Rev. Eugene Rivers, invited
Barnicle to ``a reasoned, courteous, and candid conversation''
about the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The morning press conference was organized by Kambon, and
included Leonard Alkins, president of the Boston chapter of the
NAACP, and Rodney Mohammad of the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Kambon said he believes the Globe was simply looking for an
excuse to fire Smith, an important figure in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Last week The Globe asked Barnicle to resign after his column of
Aug. 2 was found to contain unattributed material from George
Carlin's bestseller ``BrainDroppings.'' Barnicle said he had never
read the book and was given a month's suspension. But after a video
clip surfaced showing Barnicle recommending the book on WCVB-TV's
``Chronicle,'' Barnicle was asked to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle refused, beginning a week-long standoff and public
relations campaign that ended when Barnicle was reinstated Tuesday
with a two-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The activists expressed outrage at Barnicle's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barnicle mobilized his forces and went hard, going from
getting fired to having a two months' vacation,'' said Kambon.

SOME SANCTIONS AGAINST SWISS ENDED IN WAKE OF SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa.)   (bl)  
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A $1.25 billion settlement between Holocaust
survivors and Swiss commercial banks accused of profiting from the
Nazi era led officials in several states to cancel sanctions
Thursday against Swiss financial interests, even though disbursing
the money will take a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York, California, Pennsylvania and a number of
other cities and states had threatened to begin imposing sanctions
on Sept. 1, saying they were necessary to pressure the Swiss
because two years of negotiations had not led to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department had opposed the proposed penalties _
like barring short-term deposits of city and state funds in Swiss
banks _ saying such pressure was hardening attitudes in Switzerland
and souring relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the agreement'' with the banks, which was
announced Wednesday, said New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
who heads a national committee of financial officers who have been
monitoring the negotiations. He said they ``have unanimously agreed
that we will cancel all planned sanctions.'' Hevesi spoke at a news
conference with New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Treasurer Matt Fong, who had imposed some
sanctions on Swiss banks a year ago, announced that he was lifting
all investment sanctions effective immediately. Pennsylvania
Treasurer Barbara Hafer said she was also canceling proposed
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations and Holocaust survivors generally welcomed
the settlement as at least partial closure on a painful chapter.
``It is a fair settlement,'' said Rabbi Marvin Hier, the dean of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. ``I'm happy this is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations took pains to stress that the settlement
was neither punishment for the banks nor a reward for survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a question of a settlement; it is not a question of
money,'' said Benjamin Meed, the president of the American
Gathering of Holocaust Survivors and a survivor of the Warsaw
Ghetto. ``This is a question of morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Rechter, 70, who survived the camps but whose father did
not, predicted that most Holocaust survivors would receive little
money. ``I think the Swiss could have done much better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for the plaintiffs said the amount roughly
corresponded to the amount of Jews' assets that were seized by the
Nazis and processed through Swiss banks. Joel Sweet, one of the
lawyers, said the settlement could establish an important global
precedent. ``When commercial actors profit illicitly from political
or human rights abuses, they will be forced to pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the major Swiss commercial banks, Credit
Suisse and Union Bank of Switzerland, agreed to guarantee payments
of $1.25 billion, plus any interest accrued before the payments are
made. As a result of mergers and acquisitions, the two banks now
represent 85 percent of Switzerland's commercial bank activity in
1945, lawyers for the plaintiffs said.
</P>
<P>
   In return, a class-action lawsuit against the commercial banks
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn and a suit in the Northern
District in California will be dropped, as will a major suit
against the government-owned Swiss National Bank in U.S. District
Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement does not resolve a separate suit in the Southern
District of New York against three major Swiss insurance companies,
one of which was recently purchased by Credit Suisse.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Swiss government nor the National Bank took part in
the negotiations, although evidence indicates the national bank
processed most of the gold looted from Jews by the Nazis, and
neither is expected to contribute to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hevesi praised Judge Edward Korman, who several weeks ago began
personally overseeing the talks, for ``putting parties in a room
and apparently not letting them out until there was an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the negotiations said as recently as
Monday that the two sides were still far apart. Negotiations had
broken down in June after the Swiss offered $600 million, a figure
the plaintiffs quickly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the sanctions deadline was looming and pressure from elected
officials and other public figures increasing and finally, on
Wednesday afternoon, a settlement was reached.
</P>
<P>
   The money will go, first, to those able to document claims to
dormant accounts in Swiss banks, which often denied survivors or
their relatives access to funds deposited before the war if they
lacked proper documentation. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker is leading a commission that is attempting to match some
8,000 claims against the dormant accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Ratner, an attorney for the plaintiffs, predicted that
the amount paid out for dormant accounts would prove to be a
``small percentage'' of the total, since so much evidence on
specific claims has been lost or destroyed over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money will be distributed to Holocaust survivors
through a mechanism yet to be determined. That money is considered
a form of ``rough justice,'' or restitution to those who cannot
prove their claims to lost assets, as well as for the profits Swiss
banks made from looted gold and art and from loans to the Nazis
that were used for the construction of slave-labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 law firms on the case can apply to Korman for fees, to be
paid from the settlement money, although some have indicated they
will not seek compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But no actual payments are likely to go out for some time,
Ratner said.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge gives preliminary approval to the settlement
amount, which could happen as early as next week, the Swiss banks
have 30 days to make the first payment of $250 million. But that
money cannot be distributed until the entire class represented in
the suit _ the hundreds of thousands of Holocaust survivors
worldwide _ have been notified and allowed to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The court will hold a public hearing before approving a plan for
distributing the funds. Ratner estimated that process would take at
least six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of Holocaust survivors is approximately 81, and
Meed, of the survivors' group, provided a poignant reminder that
for many survivors, the settlement comes too late. Thursday
morning, he said, he learned that the president of the Krakow
Society of Holocaust survivors had died the previous night.

   ``On the radio they said Castro had died,'' said Ms. Gueits, 32,
an insurance agent. ``We started to jump up and down, but I got
home and it wasn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she said, she has heard similar reports about 15
times _ ``that he was dying, that he was in the hospital, that he
was in a coma.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I see him in a coffin,'' Ms. Gueits said, ``I won't
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the adopted homeland of many Cubans who left their
country because of Castro, his death or near death has been grossly
exaggerated periodically for the nearly 40 years of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often a rumor about his impending demise or actual
expiration spreads like wildfire, only to be debunked by the
appearance of a fit-looking Castro delivering a six-hour speech.
</P>
<P>
   While exiles try to will him dead, and some have even plotted to
kill him, Castro turned 72 today.
</P>
<P>
   The latest collective disappointment stemmed from an article on
July 19 in the Spanish-language El Nuevo Herald, a report that was
reprinted by its sister paper, The Miami Herald, and picked up by
other news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the front-page article, a woman identified as a defecting
Cuban surgeon, Dr. Elizabeth Trujillo Izquierdo, said that Castro
had been treated last October for hypertensive encephalopathy, a
potentially fatal illness affecting the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, it turned out, had really been a secretary in a Cuban
paper factory who suffered from ``personality problems,'' her
former husband later said. Roberto Fabricio, El Nuevo Herald's
managing editor, said the woman had duped his newspaper, which told
readers she had produced college degrees, her passport and her
Cuban identity card as ``proof'' that she was who she claimed to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Fabricio said that part of the problem in covering such a story
was the limited access to government information in Cuba, where
Castro's health is treated as a state secret. At the same time, any
news about Castro is of immense public interest here, Fabricio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in Miami in terms of the Cuba story is more important
than Fidel Castro,'' Fabricio said. ``The only agent of change that
one can identify in Cuba is the death of Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   When Castro quit smoking cigars a few years ago, many here
speculated it was surely because of lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an interview with an exile leader who cited
``confidential sources,'' El Nuevo Herald reported in another
front-page article in 1996 that Castro had undergone surgery and
chemotherapy for ``extensive lung cancer,'' and that he had six
months to two years to live.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, the leader, Arturo Cobo, said he
still believed his source, whose identity he said he could not
disclose for security reasons because the person is in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a month left,'' Cobo said. ``Let's see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Garcia-Fuste, a radio commentator here for more than 30
years, said that often, sources for information about Castro are
Cuban doctors who offer detailed accounts of the supposed terminal
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia-Fuste said he had helped spread the rumors himself
because he believed them, even though, he conceded, ``one has to
realize that he has money to pay for the best medicine and the best
medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, apparently fueled by a Havana news station's report
of the death of a revolutionary leader, a rumor that Castro had
actually died ricocheted over telephone lines across the Florida
Straits and in breathless radio and television coverage here,
forcing the Cuban Interests Section in Washington to issue a
statement saying Castro enjoyed ``excellent health.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis Fernandez, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section,
Cuba's diplomatic mission in Washington, called any talk of an
illness ``lies, propaganda, desire to misinform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a grand show to try to confuse and create problems,''
Fernandez said. ``His health is better than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Aruca, another radio commentator who owns a company
that chartered flights to Cuba and has participated in dialogues
between exiles and Cuban government officials, blames journalists
who favor a hard line toward Cuba for giving legitimacy to
unsubstantiated reports that he said often served someone's
particular agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a University of Miami sociologist who writes columns
for El Nuevo Herald and is not related to the Cuban leader, noted
that while the Spanish-language press watches for any sign of
frailty in Castro, they missed the fatal illness of the most
powerful exile leader in their midst, Jorge Mas Canosa, until
barely a few months before his death in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``We imagine the one we hate dead,'' Castro said, ``and we deny
the real illness of the one we support.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidel Castro most recently defied his ill-wishers by touring the
Caribbean on an official visit without a hint of discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   But as Aruca, the commentator, said, ``Fidel Castro, sooner or
later, one day is going to get sick and die.''

 &HT;    Umpire criticizes Cox for 'cheap shots' against rookie son
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Services
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Harry Wendelstedt weighed in his son Hunter's
dispute with the Atlanta Braves and Poppa wasn't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hunter Wendelstedt is going to be a great umpire and he's
going to be somebody who's going to do a super job in this league
for a lot of years,'' said the 33-year veteran umpire. ''The cheap
shots that Bobby (Cox) took at him were just that _ cheap shots.
The fact of the matter is, Mr. Cox leads the league in ejections
every year. Everybody can't be wrong. So there's always three sides
to a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Wendelstedt ejected both Cox and John Smoltz July 29 in
Cincinnati when they protested the rookie's call on a Bret Boone
tag play at third base. Wendelstedt stepped on Smoltz's foot as he
made the call and ejected him for making contact before he ran off
Cox, for putting his hand on his chest as he tried to separate him
from his pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   After the game that day, Cox called the incident, ''a case where
a rookie umpire reacted way too quickly to whatever he saw and
didn't realize what he was doing at the time. I think he's a good
kid.'' Informed Thursday of the senior Wendelstedt's comments, Cox
was in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ''What cheap shots?'' he asked. ''I thought I was being easy on
him. I was trying to help a kid out of a bad situation. Tell Harry
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendelstedt left San Diego Thursday morning to make arrangements
for his father's funeral, after his death Tuesday night. Hunter
Wendelstedt, who was working with his father's crew this week, will
join the rest of the family today.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Wendelstedt has seen Hunter's written report of the
Cincinnati incident and sounded as if Smoltz might be exonerated in
the matter. Though incidents involving contact with umpires are
generally automatic suspensions, the National League office has yet
to rule on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Smoltz's case in my opinion,'' Harry said, ''it looked like
an accident. Somebody stepped on (Smoltz's) foot and he gave a push
to get his foot out. But the umpire didn't even know he was on the
foot. He was busy showing where (Boone's) foot was. This isn't
something that should be blown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who was ejected for the first time in his career for
arguing with an umpire, remains adamant of his innocence and has
suggested he receive an apology instead of a suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''If everybody sees what they saw, I didn't bump him,'' Smoltz
said. ''It should be a dead issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If (Hunter) had it to do all over again,'' Harry said, ''he
wouldn't have stepped on his foot. I can't speak for him but I'll
tell you this. I taught him how to umpire and I told him if anybody
in any way physically accosts you, then unload. And I still adhere
to that. I tell all my umpires that and I teach my crew the same
thing. It can't be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   No-no to the no-no
</P>
<P>
   Through the first five innings Thursday, Glavine had allowed a
walk to Quilvio Veras who was subsequently erased in a double play.
To that point, San Diego had nothing else. Perhaps the biggest
mystery attending the Braves rotations remains how this staff has
not generated a no-hitter (besides the departed Kent Mercker's)
through a decade of strong work. Glavine wasn't really thinking
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what's going on but I never expect to throw a
no-hitter,'' said Glavine, who now has five career-two-hitters.
''It's one of those things where if it happens, it happens. But I
wasn't going out there in the sixth inning thinking, I got a
no-hitter, I got great stuff, I'm going to throw a no-hitter today.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was kind of thinking, when are you going to give one up and
get this over with. I was just hoping I wouldn't do what I did,
which was get into a jam and have to throw out of the stretch for
the first time in the course of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hop-a-long Guillen
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss was going to get a start at shortstop anyway Thursday
but Ozzie Guillen's right foot was so swollen after he fouled a
ball off it in the fifth inning the night before, to send him back
out there would be cruel and unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't put my shoe on last night,'' said Guillen. ''I
might be a couple days before I can do that. But I can push off.
That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen has started 18 of the 32 games since the All-Star break
and hit .320.

MORE SECRET SERVICE OFFICERS TESTIFY BEFORE GRAND JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EXCLUSIVE-CLINTON-LEWINSKY) 
(JT) 
 By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors briefly questioned several more Secret
Services officers Thursday before the grand jury inquiring into
President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Four Secret Service officers arrived at the federal courthouse
here Thursday morning to answer just one or two questions each,
said Michael Leibig, a lawyer representing some members of the
Secret Service. At least five more officers appeared for
questioning Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors then met with jurors, without witnesses, for almost
two hours before adjourning for the day. The grand jury does not
normally meet on Fridays, so prosecutors may have been preparing
the jurors for Monday, when they will hear testimony from Clinton.
His testimony, at the White House, is to be videotaped and
transmitted via closed-circuit television to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the
Lewinsky matter, have been asking agents and uniformed officers
whether they ever noticed Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky alone together.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit,
Clinton said that he could not recall having been alone with Ms.
Lewinsky, the former White House intern, but that it was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether Clinton had a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, lied about it under oath and tried to cover it
up.
</P>
<P>
   One retired Secret Service officer, Lewis Fox, has said that Ms.
Lewinsky visited the president when Fox was at his post near the
Oval Office on a Saturday in 1995. When he testified before the
grand jury in February, his lawyer, Leibig, said that Fox could not
say absolutely that the two met alone, or how long they were
together.
</P>
<P>
   Leibig, who represents only uniformed officers and not
plainclothes agents, said Thursday, ``I still don't believe anyone
in the uniformed division saw the president in a compromising
position.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton met Thursday afternoon
with his private lawyers to continue preparing for his testimony on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who is a member of Judiciary
Committee, sent Clinton a letter Thursday saying that he had grown
concerned about rumors and reports that he might refuse to answer
some questions or perhaps not testify at all.
</P>
<P>
   Specter urged the president to testify completely to help
conclude the investigation. ``It is worth noting the numerous
questions being raised as to whether Saddam Hussein or the
terrorists in Africa are acting because of the perceived weakness
of your presidency or the distraction of the Ms. Monica Lewinsky
matter,'' he wrote. He added that he did not think there was a
``causative link,'' but that the public discussion was ``very
problematic for American leadership abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesmen have pointed to Clinton's remark two weeks
ago that he would testify ``completely and truthfully'' as evidence
that he intended to do just that.

OAKLAND TRIES TO PROTECT MEDICAL SALES OF MARIJUANA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The City Council on Thursday designated the
Oakland Marijuana Buyers' Cooperative as officers of the city, an
effort to shield the group from federal civil and criminal
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department had won a temporary restraining
order in May against the Oakland cooperative and five other medical
marijuana providers in Northern California, claiming that they were
in violation of federal narcotics laws. Three of cooperatives shut
down voluntarily, while the others, including the one in Oakland,
have defied the U.S. District Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland officials and the cooperative had worked together since
the passage of a 1996 state initiative that allowed medically
prescribed marijuana to be distributed to any ``seriously ill''
Californian.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the council voted to allow each medical marijuana user
up to a pound and a half of prescribed cannabis, which the council
views as a three-month supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we needed to be out on the frontier, to ease the
suffering of those in need,'' said Councilman Nate Miley at a brief
ceremony in Oakland's city hall. ``We're delighted to offer the
cooperative all the support we can, and hope that other cities will
follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jones, the executive director of the cooperative, accepted
the designation on behalf of his group, which distributes the drug
to more than 1,500 people to treat the effects of illnesses like
cancer and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great day for our patients and a great day for
Oakland,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Gregory King said the decision by
Oakland officials was under review.

WENDELL, BARD OF FLUSHING, NOW CAN CLOSE HIS STANZAS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For someone who says he does not necessarily want to
bring attention to himself, Turk Wendell has an unusual way of
going about it.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment the antics Wendell brought with him to the
major leagues. He no longer brushes his teeth between innings or
chews licorice on the mound _ although he still hops high over the
base line coming on and off the field. A few springs ago, Wendell's
manager with the Cubs, Jim Riggleman, asked him to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted everybody to know me as a pitcher instead of
a weirdo,'' Wendell said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in several seasons with the Cubs, Wendell proved his
competence as a reliever and in one season, 1996, even notched 18
saves as the team's closer. But until recently, about all he was
known for as a Met was being a throw-in in the trade that brought
Mel Rojas and Brian McRae to New York last August. At 31, he was a
low-ranking member of a not very reliable bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   All that has changed, though, in the last few weeks. Wendell has
suddenly emerged as a key player, the one right-handed reliever
Manager Bobby Valentine can reasonably depend on when the game is
close.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday in St. Louis, he struck out Mark McGwire
the two times he faced him, once with McGwire as the tying run at
the plate. On Wednesday night, Wendell not only pitched for the
third night in a row, but also contributed his sixth straight
scoreless appearance in nine days in an agonizing game the Mets
would eventually lose, 5-4, in 14 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell, now 4-0 with a 3.09 earned run average, is obviously
pleased with his elevated role but not quite comfortable with the
attention it brings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier in the year, no reporters talked to me,'' he said.
``Now everyone wants to talk to me. When you get the big contract,
guys put a little more pressure on themselves.'' Which, Wendell
seemed to be suggesting, is exactly what he doesn't want to do and
which may be why he played down his dominance of McGwire, the most
fearsome hitter in the major leagues, noting that each time he
struck him out he left a slider over the plate that McGwire could
have crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Around the Mets' clubhouse, Wendell is perceived as something of
a loner. Few of his teammates are aware that one way he attempts to
relax is by writing poetry, something he started doing in 1986,
when he was a sophomore at Quinnipiac College in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a weird way to kind of know I can express my emotions
without having to tell somebody about it,'' he said earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   His poems are about baseball, life on the road, relationships
with his family, friends and newborn daughter. There is one he
penned jointly with Deion Sanders on a bus trip when both were in
the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Another early effort, entitled ``Life Is Like a Baseball,'' can
be used as a metaphor for Wendell's bumpy career. It reads, in
part:
</P>
<P>
   Life is like a baseball,
</P>
<P>
   It has many curves,
</P>
<P>
   It has many sliders,
</P>
<P>
   It has many forks,
</P>
<P>
   It has many change-ups,
</P>
<P>
   It gets tossed around constantly,
</P>
<P>
   And it gets hit real hard.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, no one is hitting Wendell hard. What, the Mets
pitching coach Bob Apodaca was asked, enabled Wendell to turn
things around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think belief in himself,'' Apodaca said. ``It comes down to
that elusive ingredient he injects in himself called confidence.
Also, I think he feels the confidence that Bobby has in him.
Bobby's just been waiting for this to happen. That go-to label has
to be earned. We were waiting for him to earn it. Now he has. He's
now somebody we're very comfortable with. And it couldn't come at a
better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he is a little bit of a flake. But he is 100 percent a
gamer. And he wants to pitch in those situations. He has no fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, of public recognition. But if Wendell keeps on
pitching as he has, he will have to learn to deal with it. ``People
still think I'm a weirdo,'' Wendell said earlier this season.
Maybe, but in New York, people now realize he can pitch.

 &HT;    Jones' home courses on display in 2001
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ The Bobby Jones legacy will receive plenty of
attention in Atlanta in 2001. Both clubs that Jones made famous _
East Lake Golf Club and the Atlanta Athletic Club _ will host major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   East Lake has the 2001 U.S. Amateur and the Athletic Club, as
was officially announced Tuesday by the PGA of America, has been
selected to host the 83rd PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was alive when the original East Lake Golf Club
relocated to Duluth, Ga. in 1967, would have had difficulty
choosing a favorite between the two spots, according to AAC
president John Koontz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jones always said that the Athletic Club is my home club and
East Lake is my home course,'' said Koontz, one of 11 Athletic Club
members in attendance at Winged Foot Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Redesigned in 1995 by Rees Jones, the Athletic Club's Highlands
Course last hosted a PGA Championship, won by Marietta, Ga.'s Larry
Nelson, in 1981. It also was the site for the 1976 U.S. Open, won
by Jerry Pate. The Athletic Club's Riverside Course also hosted the
1990 U.S. Women's Open, won by Betsy King.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not redo the course with Rees to get a major
championship,'' Koontz said of the club's two-year, $2 million
renovation. ``We did it for the members.
</P>
<P>
   For architect Rees Jones, Georgia in 2001 will be quite a
showcase. In addition to reworking both East Lake and the Athletic
Club, he designed Ocean Forest on Sea Island, which will host the
2001 Walker Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Pavin out
</P>
<P>
   Corey Pavin withdrew from the tournament because of the death of
his father, Jack, from a heart attack. Pavin was replaced in the
150-player field by Waycross' Taylor Smith. ... Australia's Peter
Senior withdrew and was replaced by Glen Day. ...Today's featured
pairing is an obvious one _ the trio of Masters champion Tiger
Woods, British Open champion Justin Leonard and U.S. Open champion
Ernie Els at 8:55 a.m. ... Two-time PGA champion Larry Nelson is
paired with five-time winner Jack Nicklaus and defending champion
Mark Brooks at 12:31 pm.
</P>
<P>
   Study time
</P>
<P>
   Captain Tom Kite used the PGA practice rounds for some extra
Ryder Cup scrutiny, playing over the last few days with Davis Love
III, Brad Faxon, Leonard, David Duval and Tommy Tolles. ... Els, on
a potential rivlary developing among him and other young players
such as Woods, Leonard and Phil Mickelson: ``This is not like
tennis; you don't play directly against the guy on the other side
of the net. We've got (150) players here. You have to beat those
players and you have to beat the golf course.''

<P>
   Russia's stock and bond markets plunged, taking with them hopes
of averting a depletion of the government's finances and a meltdown
of the country's banking system. Capping a week of ominous
declines, the nation's major blue-chip stock index dropped as much
as 25 percent before rebounding some. It ended down 6.5 percent.
The Russian government said the panic was psychological, not
fiscal, and repeated, as it has in recent days, that it had money
to meet its obligations through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   DOW CATCHES TOUCH OF RUSSIAN FLU
</P>
<P>
   Russia's trouble reverberated in the United States, sending the
Dow Jones industrial average down 1.1 percent. The blue-chip gauge
dropped 93.46 points, to 8,459.50, its lowest point of the day, led
down by DuPont. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.31
points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 1,074.91, and the Nasdaq
index declined 22.99 points, or 1.3 percent, to 1,802.54. Treasury
prices fell for a second day because of a weaker dollar.
</P>
<P>
   BOEING AND UNION REACH 737 DEAL
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and its biggest union reached a deal that paves the way
for the company to produce the 737 commercial jet at the former
McDonnell Douglas complex in Long Beach, Calif. Although the deal
was designed to allay union fears of job losses, Boeing also said
it planned to cut even more employees than it had indicated last
month.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE SURPLUS FALLS IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current account surplus fell in June from May to about
$10 billion, the ninth decline in the last 13 months, as exports to
other Asian nations slowed and imports rebounded from a
two-and-a-half-year low.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA TO INVESTIGATE LIVENT
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators in Canada said that they are investigating
the accounting problems at Livent, the company based in Toronto
that brought the hit musicals ``Ragtime'' and ``Showboat'' to
Broadway. On Monday, Livent's new management announced that an
internal investigation had found serious accounting problems.
</P>
<P>
   GEOCITIES SETTLES PRIVACY CASE
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said that Geocities, a popular Web
site, had lied about its privacy policy and reached a settlement
under which the company would stop promising subscribers that it
would not give out personal information.
</P>
<P>
   RETAIL SALES DIPPED IN JULY
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales fell four-tenths of 1 percent in July, reflecting
the General Motors strikes, the Commerce Department said. Excluding
automobiles, sales rose for the sixth time in seven months.
</P>
<P>
   KMART AND GAP POST GOOD RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Kmart and the Gap reported quarterly earnings that were better
than expected, aided by the strong economy and a return to the
basic fashions favored by their mainstay customers.
</P>
<P>
   LEVI STRAUSS TAKES CUE FROM STREET
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to remain hip with America's youth, Levi Strauss is
introducing a campaign infused with an unconventional, streetwise
attitude for its Silver Tab line of clothing. Instead of using
typical attractive models to showcase the clothes, the campaign
features colorful images of teen-agers displaying their
individuality.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the conclusion of the memorial mass celebrated for
Roger Maris in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, which took
place two days before Christmas in 1985, Cardinal John O'Connor
asked everyone in the crowded congregation, including the 12
priests at the altar, to stand. He then requested that those in
attendance give ``one last burst of applause to honor this man.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaudit for the former Yankee slugger lasted about a minute.
``Steven,'' O'Connor said, looking at Maris' 8-year-old grandson,
who wore a gray suit and a red tie, ``you were not around to hear
your grandfather applauded in the Stadium, but you'll remember
this, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal smiled gently. Steven, seated with his family in
the second row, his feet not touching the floor, nodded solemnly to
the cardinal. Some 13 years later, Steven, the son of Roger's
daughter, Susan, is a stocky 21-year-old student at Santa Fe
Community College in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven remembers that day,'' his uncle, Roger Maris Jr., said
Thursday by telephone from Gainesville, Fla. ``We all do. I was
only 3 years old when Dad broke the homer record in 1961, so I
didn't hear the cheers then, either.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal hadn't mentioned the boos, or, as Roger Jr. would
say, how his father was ``short-changed'' in receiving the
accolades due him. Most of the Maris family lives in Gainesville,
where Roger Sr., after retiring from the St. Louis Cardinals in
1968, and his brother Rudy were given a Budweiser distributorship
by August Busch, owner of the beer company and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   And Roger Jr., like the rest of the family _ like the rest of
the nation, for that matter _ is being reminded daily this year of
the most renowned and, to some, notorious achievement of his
father's 12-year baseball career. It was when he banged out 61 home
runs in 1961 to break Babe Ruth's single-season homer mark of 60.
Every day Roger Jr. reads how Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa and Ken
Griffey Jr., among others, are hitting home runs that put them in
position to catch or pass his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying it'' said Roger Jr., now 40 years old. ``I think
it's neat to know that guys have been chasing the record for so
long. You know that Dad has held the home run record longer than
Babe Ruth did. Dad broke the record 34 years after Ruth's record.
And it's been 37 years since Dad hit 61.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the country would like to see the record broken _ it
adds excitement and interest to the game _ but that wasn't the case
when Dad was going for it. He was going up against two baseball
icons, Babe Ruth and Mickey Mantle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true, and the baseball memories for Roger Maris Sr. were
bittersweet. I spent a day with him in Gainesville in the summer of
1970, two years after he retired from baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he followed the Yankees in the standing? ``The
Yankees? Did I ever play for the Yankees?'' He smiled a half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ever had to have good memories about my baseball
career,'' he told me, ``they probably had to be before 1961.'' He
reached the majors with Cleveland in 1957, was traded to Kansas
City the following season, dealt to the Yankees before the 1960
season and traded to the Cardinals after the 1966 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees wanted Mickey to break the record,'' he said.
(Mantle, a Yankee hero from the early 1950s, finished the 1961
season with 54 homers.) ``I was never the fair-haired boy over
there.''
</P>
<P>
   He understood that many people didn't want him to break the
hallowed Ruth record. And Commissioner Ford Frick said the record
book would indicate that he broke the mark in 162 games, as opposed
to Ruth's 154 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say 154 games, which 154 games are they talking
about?'' Maris asked. ``The first 154, the middle 154, the last
154? If it's the first, then I'd still have tied Ruth, because I
didn't hit my first homer until the 11th game. If it was the last
154 or the middle 154, then I'd have broken it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   While with the Yankees, he said, he was booed at home and on the
road. ``You say it doesn't affect you,'' he said. ``But it does,
finally. All that stopped when I went to the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't think much about the 61 homers. ``It's in the
past,'' he said. ``Maybe it'll become important to me when I'm 65
or 70. Maybe then I'll think about it, and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't to be. Roger Maris died of lymphatic cancer at age 51.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, records are made to be broken,'' said Roger Maris Jr.
``But, honestly, I'd like to see Dad hang on to this one a little
longer.''

Tale of two drivers continues
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gordon, Martin have extra incentives to win Pepsi 400
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BROOKLYN, Mich. _ The top two drivers in Winston Cup racing have a
few things on their mind and a lot on the line this weekend at
Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   For Jeff Gordon, it's a chance to tie a NASCAR record for
consecutive victories and add another major accomplishment to his
list of achievements.
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Martin, it's a chance to honor the man who made him a
race-car driver. Mark's father, Julian, was killed in a plane crash
last weekend, and Martin raced in the Bud at the Glen not knowing
his father had died a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   So the two men at the top of the points standings come to
Michigan with added incentive to win.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has been winning so much these days that things are
starting to get a little boring. But this weekend is different for
the man who seems to be finishing first everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon heads to one of the few places left on the Cup circuit
where he has yet to win a race. He has driven the DuPont Chevrolet
in 11 races at Michigan Speedway without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been close at Michigan so many times, but we haven't
been able to pull it off there,'' Gordon said. ``The odds may be
against us, but I'm going to do everything possible to be there at
the end.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gordon wins the Pepsi 400 on Sunday, it will be his fourth
consecutive victory, tying the modern NASCAR record that is shared
by six other drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the two-mile, D-shaped oval at Michigan is one of only four
tracks where Gordon has failed to cross the finish line first. It
is the only track of the 13 where the Cup circuit races twice a
year that Gordon hasn't won, meaning there is no speedway in
America where Gordon has raced so many times without winning.
</P>
<P>
   The three other tracks where Gordon has yet to win are Phoenix,
Fort Worth and Las Vegas, but the Texas event is only two years old
and the Las Vegas race was added to the schedule this year. Phoenix
and Michigan are the only tracks where Gordon has raced more than
twice without winning.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea that Gordon hasn't run well at Michigan.
The 27-year-old driver has finished second three times and third
three other times in races at Michigan. His average finish at
Michigan is 5.3, better than any other Cup driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really enjoy racing at Michigan,'' Gordon said. ``The track
is fast, flat, and has wide, sweeping turns. It makes passing a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The one man who may have the best chance of passing Gordon at
Michigan is Martin, who has won four times at the speedway in the
Irish Hills, including the last two Cup races at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin comes to Michigan with a heavy heart. His 62-year-old
father was killed when the private plane he was piloting crashed
six days ago in Nevada. Also killed were Julian's wife, Shelley,
38, and their 11-year-old daughter, Sarah.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 39, was told of the tragedy by his wife, Arlene, when he
returned home to Florida after the race at Watkins Glen, N.Y.
Martin attended his father's funeral in Arkansas on Wednesday with
his wife and five children, and then flew to Detroit to prepare for
the race. How the shocking death of his father will affect him
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Julian, who raced on dirt tracks when Mark was a boy, got Martin
started in go-kart racing 34 years ago when Mark was 5 years old.
His father built Mark's first race car when Mark was 15, a year
before Mark was eligible for a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was my hero,'' Martin said. ``There was never a
moment for me and my sisters when we didn't know how proud he was
of us. You couldn't love a son more than he loved me. He is an
unbelievably generous person.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Martin would love to win this weekend for his father,
but he also would love to end his streak of second-place finishes.
Martin has finished second in each of the last four races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like they say, second place is the first loser,'' said Martin,
who is 82 points behind Gordon in the series standings. ``I'm tired
of running well and losing. But you can't whine about it. The truth
is, if you finished second in every race, you would win the
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   A majority of most NASCAR crowds like to see Gordon lose, and
this weekend should be no exception. Loyalties among the other
drivers usually are split, but most of the 150,000 fans who will be
on hand Sunday will be cheering for Martin to win because of the
tragic circumstances he has endured this week.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is the first to admit it will take a lot more than fan
support to beat Gordon and the Rainbow Warriors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may win them all,'' Martin said after Gordon won at Watkins
Glen. ``The guy has us all covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon isn't so sure, knowing this track and this week could be
Martin's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the utmost respect for Mark,'' Gordon said. ``I like to
race him hard, but I also always race him clean. That's the kind of
respect he has always given back to me.''

RUSSIA'S ECONOMY TAKES ANOTHER TURN FOR THE WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede, 2nd &AMP; 3rd grafs on effect of market plunge, deletes
`into free fall' from lede; corrects ID for Tom Adshead to `a

 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Stock and bond prices plunged Thursday, jarring Russian
hopes that the government could avert a depletion of its finances
and a meltdown of the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a week of ominous declines, the major blue-chip index
dropped as much as 15 percent Thursday morning before the Federal
Securities Commission stepped in and halted trading. The market
later recouped all but 6.49 percent of the loss, but the blue chips
now have lost almost a quarter of their value in seven days.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for Russian bonds seemed to vanish altogether, as yields
on some short-term bonds exceeded an astounding 300 percent,
assuming anyone wanted to purchase them. Few did.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has ceased to exist, in some ways, as an actual
market,'' said Tom Adshead, a director of research for United
Financial Group in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia has seen other terrifying plunges in this decade, and
experts differed over whether this one would be fatal, or just one
more near miss.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the panic was psychological, not fiscal, and
repeated, as it has in recent days, that it has money to meet its
obligations through the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank and aides to President Boris Yeltsin dismissed
a suggestion Thursday by financier George Soros that the ruble
should be devalued, _ a move that would effectively reduce the
nation's debt but inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rumors that such documents are being worked out here
are just invention and lies,'' said Irina Yasina, the spokeswoman
for the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent amid the furious denials, however, was a more
equivocal statement by Finance Minister Oleg Vyugin. Vyugin said
Soros actually urged several measures to support the ruble, one of
which was devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Devaluation is an idea that should be considered only in a
package,'' he said. ``Soros did not call for devaluation as such.''
</P>
<P>
   But many private analysts nevertheless predict just that, saying
that the government is losing the struggle against bankruptcy, and
that its most likely escapes would be devaluation or a ``forced
restructuring'' of its debt, in which bondholders would simply be
handed new repayment schedules with no choice but to accept them.
</P>
<P>
   Either course would amount to a dramatic repudiation of the
$22.6 billion rescue plan that the International Monetary Fund, the
World Bank and Western leaders assembled only last month.
</P>
<P>
   That package, for which Russia promised more coherent and
efficient tax and budget policies, was supposed to yank the
government back from near-insolvency.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the package to give the Russian economy its much
needed stability has disappointed Washington. The White House
spokesman, Mike McCurry, said, ``It is critical that the Russian
government act quickly to restore confidence in their economy, and
that is something we have communicated with Russian officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern in Washington was reflected at meetings that
President Clinton had with his economic and national security
advisers on Tuesday and Wednesday, and in conference calls that
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers both had with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has also conferred with deputy ministers from the
Group of Seven major industrial nations to review the options,
McCurry said, but no specific proposals were made for further aid
for Russia. Politically, any proposal to increase aid for Russia
would be hugely unpopular in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF package was also supposed to cushion private investors
and the Russian people from hardship, a goal that now seems more
and more remote. Despite redoubled tax-collection efforts and
sweeping financial decrees from the Yeltsin government, foreign
investors so far have shown little faith that Russia is climbing
out of its financial hole. With fewer foreign investors, the ruble
has lost value and the government has had to raise interest rates
on bonds higher and higher to attract buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But those developments have sapped the government's financial
health, further eroding confidence and leading still more investors
to call it quits.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Moody's, the bond-rating service, lowered its rating of Russia's
foreign bonds from B1 to B2, which is five levels below investment
grade, and said the outlook is negative.
</P>
<P>
   What can the government do to pull out of the tailspin beyond
devaluation, default or some other dramatic and painful act? There
are no simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's calamity had many causes.
</P>
<P>
   The prime focus Thursday was on a Central Bank announcement made
Wednesday evening of new rules to increase bank liquidity and to
protect the ruble. One increased the number of banks with direct
access to Central Bank credit; a second limited purchases of
dollars by certain unnamed Russian banks in an attempt to prevent
currency speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, which were issued without explanation, underscored
what had long been rumored: that some Russian banks are in trouble
and that others have already walked away from debts to foreigners
and to other Russian banks. Many banks here have borrowed heavily
to invest in government bonds, only to see the value of those
investments plummet as rates for newer bonds began to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   The second trigger may have been pulled Thursday morning, when
The Financial Times in London printed a letter from Soros urging an
international rescue of the ruble. That effort should include a
ruble devaluation of 15 percent to 25 percent, Soros suggested. The
call for devaluation made headlines worldwide, and may have
galvanized wary investors with holdings in Russian companies that
would be hurt by a drop in the ruble's value.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the value of the ruble plunged Thursday, and the
government seemed to confirm the ruble's plight, saying the
reserves of hard currency and gold it can use to prop up its
currency had dropped by $1.4 billion over the last two weeks, to
$17 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Bank's action and Soros' letter came atop other
developments that have made Western investors nervous: the
declining price of oil, a staple of the Russian economy; the
economic crisis in Japan; and a government admission that tax
collections, while rising, are falling short of stated goals.
</P>
<P>
   Matters were not helped when, on Wednesday, the lower house of
parliament seemed to reject Yeltsin's call for a special session to
enact emergency laws on taxes and the budget. Yeltsin has
implemented many of those laws by decree during the parliament's
recess, but the legality of some of those decrees is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   While everyone agrees that the nation's fiscal situation is
grim, the view that the plunge in stock and bond prices is
justified by events is hardly unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A number of experts note that the government is moving steadily
if not always quickly toward fulfilling the terms of the loans
offered last month by the IMF and other lenders. And in fact the
government's finances are stable, if hardly robust.
</P>
<P>
   The real crunch may come this winter, when a large amount of
debt falls due. The government must sell new bonds to repay some of
the old ones, and it is the dead market for new Russian bonds that
has led many investors to conclude that the government will not be
able to raise the money it needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are afraid the debt situation is not manageable when in
fact, by all accounts, it is and will be manageable, at least up to
November,'' said Margot Jacobs, a banking analyst at the United
Financial Group in Moscow. ``But instead of playing wait-and-see,
people seem to be voting with their feet.''

 &HT;    Quirky Canadian band finally gets respect in the States
 &HT;    By Jon Glass
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ If Canada has its own version of the
``American success story,'' Barenaked Ladies is it.
</P>
<P>
   A decade in the making, these north-of-the-border superstars
finally have struck the right chord with U.S. music fans. The
Ladies' quirky alternative rock hit, ``One Week,'' is the summer's
most infectious radio single and their newest album, ``Stunt,''
recently entered the charts at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never would have expected it, but I'll take it,''
singer-guitarist Ed Robertson said recently from Hartford, Conn.,
where the band is touring with the H.O.R.D.E. festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a success story. The beauty of it is that we did
it the old-fashioned way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and fellow singer-guitarist Steven Page formed the
Ladies in Toronto in 1988 after dabbling in sketch comedy and
songs. They took a name that, if nothing else, would at least
attract curious music fans to their shows. What people found early
on was a sharp blend of pop-rock, country and humor that fueled
atypical live performances. Their fellow countrymen loved it, and
the Ladies' first release, ``Gordon,'' became Canada's first
independent album ever to reach gold status.
</P>
<P>
   Three more releases continued to bring them accolades, praise
and sales success in Canada. But Robertson, Page, bassist Jim
Creeggan, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Hearn and drummer Tyler
Stewart were not getting a response in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A minor radio hit, ``The Old Apartment,'' finally slipped onto
American airwaves in 1996, and the Ladies made their move. A
calculated plan put the Ladies on the road 10 months of the year to
conquer the United States _ one Yankee at a time if they had to.
</P>
<P>
   American bands like Dave Matthews Band and Hootie and the
Blowfish had done the same thing, but most Canadian acts had not
been able to duplicate that formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception in the media and music industry that
Canada is Portugal or some other foreign market, when really it's
very similar to the U.S. music industry,'' Robertson said. ``The
only way to circumvent it is to get down here and work at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country just doesn't have respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ladies' unpredictable stage show became the biggest selling
point. Between songs, Robertson and Page would break into rapping,
often covering the pop hit of the day. Spice Girls songs have been
slipping into the mix lately.
</P>
<P>
   Lasting traditions were formed as well. Fans still throw boxes
of macaroni and cheese on stage during ``If I Had $1000000,'' which
refers to not having to eat Kraft dinners again if their dreams
came true.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Ladies show is different, and that's what fans have come
to expect,'' Robertson said. ``The cool thing is that we've built
the audience that knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a typical Ladies ``tribute'' to Beach Boys founder
Brian Wilson (``I'm lying in bed/Just like Brian Wilson did'') hit
the rock charts, even though it was recorded for their first album
in 1992. It helped push the breakthrough even further.
</P>
<P>
   Then, their release ``Rock Spectacle,'' featuring live versions
of ``Brian Wilson'' and ``The Old Apartment,'' became the band's
first gold album in the United States. A small break from touring
gave them time to record Stunt, which ranges from the peaceful
``Light Up My Room'' to the Squeeze-sounding ``Alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapping style that was helping make Ladies shows so
different was laid down in the studio for the first time on ``One
Week,'' a playful number about a relationship fight that tosses in
references to Aquaman, ``The X-Files'' and LeAnn Rimes.
</P>
<P>
   H.O.R.D.E., the traveling brigade of roots rock pioneered by
fellow headliners Blues Traveler, is the Ladies' most visible
opportunity yet in their quest to build their American audience.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said they've already been joined on stage by tour
mates such as Blues Traveler frontman John Popper and have been
frequenting the festival's small workshop stage, where musicians
are left to their own devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``H.O.R.D.E. is that right kind of festival atmosphere that
lends itself to spontaneity,'' he said. ``We're winning over a
bunch of new fans because it's an audience ripe for the picking.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Robertson may joke about the Ladies' ultimate goal _
world pop domination _ it's not so unrealistic anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been such a good time so far, it's hard to believe
we've been at it for 10 years.''

 &HT;    Would Jesus be laughing?
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The magazine is outrageous, funny and
irreverent. The writers are evangelicals committed to Christ. Their
critics would like them committed to a rubber room.
</P>
<P>
   One issue of ``The Door'' claimed that Bob Dole was the
antichrist. Editors named Beavis and Butt-head theologians of the
decade and called Mother Teresa the loser of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   A few subscribers canceled for such arrogance, but staff members
think cancellations are evidence they're doing their job. They're
out to demonstrate that Christian humor only appears to be an
oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   This group of slightly wacky Christians uses laughter, sarcasm
and irony to ridicule religion's sacred cows, deflate pious egos
and expose religious charlatans.
</P>
<P>
   Slapstick humor abounds. Cartoons chastise the pope, Promise
Keepers and the pious. Satire remains the magazine's primary
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of ``The Door'' is to satirize and make fun of
anyone who takes themselves seriously in the name of God,'' said
publisher Ole Anthony. ``I'd like it to smash the idolatry that is
so common in the American church.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony, 60, is president and founder of the Trinity Foundation
in Dallas. That hybrid organization embraces an experimental
Christian community, cares for the homeless, operates a detective
agency and publishes the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   No one automatically escapes the magazine's acerbic wit. Recent
editions have poked fun at Billy Graham, Bill Clinton, Madonna,
Louis Farrakhan, Pat Robertson, Focus on the Family and countless
televangelists.
</P>
<P>
   The latest edition includes a satire of Palm Beach resident
Lowell ``Bud'' Paxson, the ``zillion aire'' born-again father of
the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   The ``world's pretty much only religious satire magazine''
prints a mock schedule for Paxson's new, ``alternative'' network,
Pax TV.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee's Christian Chatter airs at 9. All The News You
Should Believe runs at noon. Barney Believes and Sesame Street
Saves fill the after-school slots.
</P>
<P>
   Writers gleefully expose ministers who use God to get rich and
ridicule politicians who insist the Lord is on their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Door'' uses humor to attack television preachers who use
twisted theology to heal by telepathy in exchange for money by
mail. The magazine wags a satirical finger at the faithful for
naively accepting such nonsense as religious truth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bimonthly magazine can be serious. It carries
legitimate interviews with religious and secular people. The
July/August edition includes conversations with columnist Molly
Ivins, cartoonist John Callahan and respected evangelical author
Keith Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Door'' began as a newsletter for Christian youth workers
27 years ago. It originally was named ``The Wittenberg Door'' after
the place where Martin Luther made his religious protest.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Mike Yaconelli, who produces training programs for youth
counselors, grew weary of the magazine's demands. He gave the
property to Anthony's foundation in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Today, ``The Door'' has about 10,000 subscribers and loses
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave ourselves the loser of the year award for taking over
a magazine that loses $30,000 a year,'' Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal readers include a broad representation of the population
as well as seminarians and clergy, Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   They laugh at what they find funny, moan at the silliness,
rejoice when they agree with the target of satire and cry foul when
their ox is gored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' said the Rev. Simeon Corona, pastor of St. Mary's
Antiochan Orthodox Church in West Palm Beach, Fla. ``Sometimes they
push the line. When they proclaimed Mother Teresa the loser of the
decade, it was a little much.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony means to be outrageous. ``Sacred cows make good
hamburger,'' he wrote. And smashing idols is his ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to publishing ``The Door,'' Trinity Foundation
monitors _ and exposes _ the fraud promoted as faith by many radio
and television evangelists.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony has a private investigator's license. He works to expose
the greed that motivates some media preachers and the lies that
make them popular.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation report on the excesses of evangelist Robert Tilton
was seen on ``Prime Time Live'' with Diane Sawyer in 1991. ``CNN,''
``Time'' and other news agencies have used the foundation to
investigate religious fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation charges networks for expenses only, Anthony said.
Their budget is about $400,000, raised from news media, ``The
Door'' and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those friends are part of what Anthony believes is the
foundation's most important ministry: caring for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 of more than 300 foundation members live in homes
clustered together on a few blocks of the same rundown
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a Christian community in a slum area of East Dallas,''
Anthony said. ``We take in the poor and homeless, but we take them
into our homes _ not into shelters.''
</P>
<P>
   And they live by a code that makes a vow of poverty seem like an
easy way to live. Community members take this vow:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I have that you need to use, you can use. Whatever I
have that you need to own, I'll give to you. Whatever you need that
I don't have, I'll help you get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder and the foundation's 20 employees each makes $50 a
week plus room and board provided in homes rented by the
foundation, Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   The unmarried leader of this unusual Christian ministry was
raised as a nominal Lutheran. He says he was an atheist until he
had a conversion experience in 1972. Listening to a speaker, he was
overwhelmed by the graciousness of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in a room with about 150 people, and for about
an hour and a half I just sat there and sobbed,'' Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   He sold his public relations firm and became the host of a
Christian radio talk show. A year later, he quit radio when the
station was sold.
</P>
<P>
   He started Trinity Foundation as a way to offer ``honest''
Christian programming, but the corporation lay dormant for nearly
14 years. He was studying the Bible and teaching a group that
gradually became a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly, the Bible study became a body,'' Anthony said. ``The
body became a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, that community exposes religious fraud and publishes
religious satire. But Anthony insists that caring for the poor is
its primary ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``How the church treats the homeless is how God will treat the
church,'' he said.

   WHAT WOULD JESUS DO? ROOT FOR UNDERDOG Popular WWJD bracelets,
worn by Christian teens to help their decision-making, is an
acronym for `What Would Jesus Do?' ``The Door'', a magazine of
religious satire, has some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would visit Disney World, but only on `Gay Day.'
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would drive a Yugo over a Volvo, but he'd probably take
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would call pornographic actress Marilyn Chambers and not
Pat Robertson to be a disciple.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would never wear a diamond-studded cross or gold
crown-of-thorns ring.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would not be caught dead on TBN or ``The 700 Club,'' nor
would he make a special appearance at a Franklin Graham crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would not live in either Beverly Hills or Martha's
Vineyard. He'd probably hang out in Salvation Army homeless
shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would not visit a Promise Keepers rally unless they let
Mary and Martha in, too.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus would be a Cubs fan.

 &HT;    Hurry, hurry! Step right up and take advantage of no taxes
 &HT;    By Lynda Edwards
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Beginning Saturday morning, you can buy
a new wardrobe and not pay a cent in sales tax _ if each item is
$50 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-free week starts at 12:01 a.m. Saturday and ends midnight
August 21. The bargains are the state legislature's way of passing
along a windfall _ an $11 billion settlement from tobacco companies
_ to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-exempt items include most clothing: baby clothes, lingerie,
sweaters, sports and professional uniforms, safety wear, shoes
without cleats, jeans, hosiery, vintage clothes. Not included are
helmets, jewelry, hair accessories, watches, handbags, sunglasses
and track shoes. Store coupons, but not manufacturer's coupons, can
be used to reduce a price to the exempt range.
</P>
<P>
   It might be wise to take a copy of a newspaper article about the
tax break with you when you shop. An unscientific, random sampling
of calls to popular area stores found many sales clerks who had no
idea a tax-free week was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   New York's similiar tax-free week, first held in January 1997,
was a bonanza for merchants; weekly retail sales doubled. But items
up to $500 were tax-free and the boon was heavily advertised by the
state. Florida's Department of Revenue had orientation meetings
this summer but John Merchant, who heads the local office, said not
many store managers attended.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardens mall in Palm Beach Gardens is heavily promoting the
week, even encouraging its merchants to add a 15-percent cut to
non-exempt items, said Stacey Boutet, who manages a Victoria's
Secret store in the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expecting a bigger crowd than usual, particularly
college girls who want gowns...before they head back to school,''
she said. ``And guys doing early Christmas shopping.''

 &HT;    Growers still improving on harmful water drainage
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, sugar growers have done far better
than state law demands in reducing the amount of phosphorus-tainted
water they drain into the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   The water still contains phosphorus concentrations 10 times
higher than many scientists consider safe for the Everglades'
plants and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   But growers prevented 85 tons of phosphorus from reaching the
Everglades in the past year by improving their handling of water
and fertilizer, water managers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They said 159 tons of phosphorus reached the Everglades from the
sugar farming region in the year that ended April 30. That was 35
percent less than what would have flowed without the growers'
reforms, scientists estimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean the problem's solved,'' said Paul Whalen,
Everglades regulation manager for the South Florida Water
Management District. ``But it certainly means we're making
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It continues to look good,'' said Pete Rosendahl of the sugar
company Flo-Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1994 state law, the growers get a discount in a special
Everglades-restoration tax if they cut their phosphorus flows by at
least 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since that requirement took effect in 1996, growers have reduced
their flows an average of 55 percent below what scientists would
have expected based on rainfall. Rainy years are expected to dump
more phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers don't mean that phosphorus loads have dropped
dramatically from year to year. In fact, the sugar region drained
37 more tons of phosphorus this year than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the district said growers had cut their phosphorus
tonnage by 49 percent below what would have flowed without their
efforts. In 1996, the estimated reduction was 68 percent.

   An elderly widowed Italian gentleman, steeped in the old-world
tradition of secrecy as it related to money matters, was getting on
in age and was in the hospital for treatment of emphysema.
Believing his days were nearing an end, he called his eldest
daughter to his side and told her that after he was gone she should
look under his bed, where she would find a box containing stock
certificates and a substantial amount of cash. In a few days, he
was sent home, with his doctors assuring him of many more years of
active life. He called his daughter on the phone: ``Remember the
box I told you about under the bed? Its not there anymore.''

Right. When he was 50 nobody knew yet about Monica Lewinsky.

 &HT;    Woods on fire while 5 are two shots back
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Peering through the low-hanging branches at
Sahalee Country Club Thursday _ which isn't easy without a forestry
degree, by the way _ here's how things look in the 80th PGA
Championship:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiger Woods, with his driver collecting cobwebs, is the leader
at 4-under-par 66 and in possession of the new Sahalee course
record, which took all of four hours to vanish.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two shots back at 68 are Bill Glasson, who has a bum elbow and
a surgery count that would impress Evel Knievel; Bob Estes, Glen
Day (who fell from 5-under), Frank Lickliter and 1993 champion Paul
Azinger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark O'Meara, with Masters and British Open titles on his
record, is lurking at 69, precisely where you would expect to see a
man trying to match a 45-year-old record.
</P>
<P>
   _ Defending champion Davis Love III of Sea Island, whose swing
frequently was of less than textbook quality, termed himself
fortunate to be at even-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   _Billy Andrade, having entered the tournament as the eighth
alternate, provided a new approach to major championship
preparation. After arriving Wednesday and barely able to get in a
hurried practice, Andrade birdied his first four holes to
temporarily share the lead with Woods, then awoke from the dream
with a double-bogey at the 6th hole.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Woods, teeing off with 3-woods or long irons and
displaying some newly-planted patience, shot a round that included
seven birdies, three bogeys and 27 putts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just try to position myself every day,'' Woods said. ''I
just try to give myself a chance going into Sunday. And If I'm
there, hopefully I'll win. But I'm not going to put any more
pressure on myself because I'm near the lead right now. With three
days to go, it's an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, 41, who is attempting to become the first player to win
three major championships since Ben Hogan in 1953, stablized his
round after two bogeys in his first three holes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kept myself in the ballgame,'' O'Meara said. ''I tried to
remain patient and hit some better shots. I'm very pleased with my
postition.''

Cubs' Sosa enjoys career year
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
When Sammy Sosa takes batting practice, it's merely batting
practice and not some hyped-up event he dreads. When Sosa talks to
the media before a game, it's a give-and-take conversation
sprinkled with laughter, not an accusatory lecture.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from their chase of Roger Maris' home-run record, there
isn't much in common between Sosa, the Chicago Cubs right fielder,
and St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   For that, baseball fans should rejoice. At least someone
involved in the home-run chase of 1998 is having some fun.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is indeed having a joyful season, hitting home runs that
are keeping the Chicago Cubs alive in the National League Central
Division race and atop the wild-card standings. Whatever pressure
there might be, Sosa refuses to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, McGwire grouses about pitchers who won't throw him
strikes, the throngs who watch him take batting practice and
continual media questions about his home runs or lack thereof.
Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. refuses to even talk about his home-run
pace.
</P>
<P>
   And Sosa is having the time of his life during the season of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressure is what you make it,'' said Sosa. ``I'm enjoying
this. You can talk yourself into pressure. I'm coming to the
clubhouse with a smile. This is what I want to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a professional, and this is my job. When you're doing
great, people want to know about it. I'm having a good time because
I'm having the best season of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa comes to the Astrodome to start a three-game showdown
series tonight with reason to smile. He is second to McGwire for
the major-league lead with 46 home runs, has a .311 batting average
and leads the NL with 116 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Without him, the Cubs likely would be where they usually are _
deep in the second division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to hit a home run for us to win,'' said Sosa.
``If it's a double, single, walk, I'm going to take it. It's not
all about home runs. We're chasing Houston and trying to go to the
playoffs. I'm a player with more on his mind than home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to the plate, I'm thinking about ways that
will help us win games, not just hitting home runs. When you play
on a winning team, everything is different. You play better.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sosa and the Cubs, this weekend and next may represent a
fork in the road for the '98 season. They have been in a slump,
losing seven of their last 10 games and falling 8{ games behind the
Astros. The Cubs have a half-game lead over New York in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing for the wild card; we're playing for the
division,'' said Sosa, 29. ``If we shoot for the division and just
fall short, we'll be the wild card anyway. Why not catch Houston?
That's our goal right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the difference in the team this year. Everybody's
together. We're smiling, and we just go out and play. This is the
way I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a special year for Sosa, whose previous career
high was 40 homers. He took off in June, when he hit a
major-league-record 20 home runs, with 40 RBIs, to jump into the
Maris chase. In his last 68 games, Sosa has 37 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Sosa was regarded as a dangerous hitter but
one who often chased pitches out of the strike zone. The strikeouts
are not down much _ he has struck out 108 times this year and has
averaged 147 the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a huge difference. Before, he says, there were
times when he tried to ``hit two home runs every time I came up.''
This year, he better understands the role he must play.
</P>
<P>
   An example came last weekend in St. Louis, where the Cubs were
swept by the Cardinals. In a 9-8 loss in 13 innings, Sosa did
everything he could to win the game for Chicago. He used his power
to tie the game with a two-run homer in the ninth inning and his
newfound hitting savvy to produce an RBI single to the opposite
field in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   It was the single to right that Sosa wanted to talk about after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's background in the Dominican Republic might be a reason he
is able to thrive in the kind of spotlight that seems to annoy
McGwire and Griffey. Sosa's father died when he was 7. He helped
his family survive by shining shoes and selling oranges.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, at age 16, Sosa signed with the Texas Rangers for
$3,500. At that point, playing in the major leagues was a faraway
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never was a fan,'' said Sosa. ``I didn't know who this guy
was or that guy was. I was busy working, trying to make money for
my mother because she was struggling when my father died.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa had barely tasted the majors when he was traded to the
Chicago White Sox in 1989 in a deal that sent veteran Harold Baines
to the Rangers. He played without distinction for the White Sox for
parts of three seasons and was labeled as an undisciplined player
who swung wildly at anything close to the plate and made mistakes
in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tried to trade for Sosa in December 1991, offering
outfielder Eric Anthony, and actually came close to making the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a young player who just had great raw talent, and it
was matter of him putting it all together,'' said McGwire, who was
with Oakland until July 1997 and saw Sosa's developing years with
the White Sox. ``The last couple of years, he's really come into
his own. He's really good. And the thing he really loves is to play
the game of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit 36, 40 and 36 home runs from 1995-97. He is in the
second year of a four-year, $42.5 million contract and has become
one of the most popular athletes in sports-crazy Chicago. He gives
back, too, donating a reported $500,000 annually to charities in
the U.S. and Dominican.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy's done a lot of great things the last few years,'' said
Cubs manager Jim Riggleman. ``He's hit 40 homers, had 100 RBIs.
This season, he's just put it all together, and all the work he's
done is paying off. He's matured into one of the elite stars in the
game with Griffey and (Barry) Bonds and a few others.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sosa hit two home runs in a game for the eighth time this
season in Monday's 8-5 win at San Francisco, Cubs first baseman
Mark Grace struggled to put into words Sosa's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's beyond description,'' Grace said. ``I don't know the
right words to describe how great a season he's had. You say
MVP-type season, but I don't know if that's enough to describe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The best might be yet to come. Sosa needs 16 home runs in the
Cubs' final 41 games to reach 62 and beat Maris' record. Sosa
repeatedly has said he thinks McGwire is the one to watch, but that
could be a subtle way to deflect pressure away from himself.
</P>
<P>
   If Sosa surpasses McGwire and becomes the leader during the
countdown to 62, he says he will not change his approach in dealing
with the demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever Mark wants to do, I think everybody has to respect
that,'' said Sosa. ``It's probably been a little aggravating to
him, all the reporters bothering him. Every day, every day, every
day. I know how he feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I never have to go through the same situation as Mark.
I like to talk to people; don't get me wrong. To me, I'm friendly
with the media and I talk if I have the time. If I have to do
something, I'll let them know.''
</P>
<P>
   What Sosa is letting everyone know is that playing baseball for
a winning team and hitting home runs can be fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying it, believe me,'' said Sosa. ``There are people
out there with bigger problems than mine. Believe me, I know.''

AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ERRORS LEAD TO INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Safety investigators are looking into whether an
air traffic control center near Cleveland has routinely hidden
evidence of operational errors, in which planes are mistakenly
ordered to fly too close to one another, after discovering three
such incidents on June 23 that went unreported.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center, which handles
about 3 million flights a year and is the busiest of the Federal
Aviation Agency's 20 centers that guide planes flying at high
altitudes, experienced a spurt of operational errors in the last
few days, about triple the normal rate. The controllers blamed
understaffing, but some experts say increased disclosure has raised
the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The control center, in Oberlin, Ohio, came to investigators'
attention because of a complaint to a special phone line maintained
by the inspector general of the Transportation Department, federal
aviation officials said. The caller reported an incident on June 23
in which one passenger jet was told to descend through the path of
another, bringing them closer than the rules allow.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations of operational errors are generally handled
within the aviation agency, but officials of the National
Transportation Safety Board, an independent agency that regularly
receives reports on such operational errors, became involved
because an unusually large number of planes were in the sector when
the error occurred, complicating the situation in the air.
</P>
<P>
   On closer investigation, however, the FAA found that there were
three errors that night, said James Washington, acting director of
the agency's Air Traffic Services office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   According to one investigator, events identified by the center's
computers as operational errors were reviewed by managers, who
often re-interpreted radar data improperly and concluded that no
violation of the separation rules had occurred. He called it
``creative quality-assurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Why there were so many planes in the sector was another point of
concern. The immediate reason appeared to be congestion and detours
caused by thunderstorms, but a flow control center in Herndon, Va.,
is supposed to coordinate activity among the centers to prevent
overloading any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Increased error rates draw the attention of FAA headquarters,
and some experts believe that local managers were trying to keep a
low profile. Washington said underreporting in the past might be
part of the reason for the recent jump in error rates, but he
cautioned that there was no identifiable pattern to the operational
errors.
</P>
<P>
   But the president of the local union chapter of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association said that managers had an incentive
to falsify data. ``The more operational errors a facility has, the
more trouble the air traffic manager gets into,'' said the
president, Patrick Forrey.
</P>
<P>
   Washington said that his staff had not identified any unreported
errors beyond the ones on June 23, but that the aviation agency had
re-arranged management responsibilities at the center and made
quality assurance a full-time job for one manager. Previously, no
one had that job full time.
</P>
<P>
   Forrey, the union official, said the number of errors had jumped
lately, with eight in the last two weeks compared with an average
of two or three a month, because of a staffing shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working short, and they won't use overtime,'' said
Forrey, who complained that sectors that would normally be staffed
by 15 or 16 controllers were down by one or two people.
</P>
<P>
   The center in Oberlin is authorized to have 422 controllers but
has only 389, Washington said. Controllers work around the clock,
every day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Washington disputed that staffing was a problem, saying, ``none
of our follow-up investigations has identified staffing as a causal
factor of operational errors.'' He denied that managers at the
center had become more reluctant to call in controllers on
overtime. Controllers get about $50 an hour for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   He said the aviation agency would hire 15 more controllers by
Sept. 30 and more early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said that analysis of errors was crucial for
maintaining safety and that it collected extensive statistics. But
there have been signs that the agency does not find all the errors.
The agency recently removed a supervisor from duty in the tower at
La Guardia Airport in New York temporarily, after it discovered
that he had failed to report an error.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers charged with an error are relieved of duty and sent
for re-training. Those who accumulate two errors within two and a
half years can be fired or re-assigned to less busy offices.

<TEXT>
<P>
   While investigators pawing through the wreckage of the U.S.
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam have yet to find physical
evidence that would point toward the bombers, suspicion in the
intelligence community has centered on Osama bin Laden. Bin Laden
is a multimillionaire Saudi Arabian businessman who fought in
Afghanistan against the Soviet Union and has created a worldwide
network of Islamic terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden, intelligence officials and Middle East experts say,
is the most prominent suspect because he has publicly threatened to
strike at Americans throughout the world and because he has
assembled a pan-Islamic coalition of seasoned terrorists and
guerrilla fighters with the sophistication, logistics and the
motivation to carry out the almost simultaneous attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speculation centers on Osama for number of reasons,'' the
former director of counterterrorism at the CIA, Vincent
Cannistrano, said. ``He has formed a coalition of anti-American
forces, the International Islamic Front for Holy War Against the
Jews and Crusaders, and associated with it the Egyptian Islamic
Jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man with a mission,'' said a United States aide who
insisted on anonymity. ``He's got a financial empire. He's got an
international organization. He is a state unto himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden issued a fatwa, or religious edict, in February that
other groups and militant members of the Islamic clergy also
signed. The edict called for guerrilla attacks against U.S.
military and civilian targets around the world to force a
``retreat'' from Jerusalem and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies, civilians
and military,'' the statement said, ``is an individual duty for
every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible
to do it, in order to liberate Al Aksa Mosque and the Holy Mosque
from their grip,'' referring to main mosques in Jerusalem and
Mecca. The edict was printed in the Arabic newspaper Al-Quds
al-Arabi in London.
</P>
<P>
   In June, bin Laden announced at a news conference in Peshawar,
Pakistan, his International Front for Islamic Holy War Against the
Jews and Crusaders. The group, Cannistrano said, consists largely
of ``Afghani Arabs,'' Moslems from other countries, mostly from
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and North Africa, who had joined the fight
against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistrano added that the groups included the Egyptian Islamic
Gama'at, or ``gathering,'' and Islamic Jihad, which was responsible
for attacks on government officials and foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
   A communique that took responsibility for the bombings came from
a previously unknown group, the Islamic Army for the Liberation of
Holy Sanctuaries, which said it would ``pursue U.S. forces'' until
its demands had been satisfied. First among the demands in the
communique was ``the withdrawal of U.S. and Western forces from
Moslem countries in general and from the Arabian Peninsula in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   The stationing of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia has been bin
Laden's main focus, and the issue figures prominently and
repeatedly in his pronouncements. He is also a suspect in two
bombings in Saudi Arabia that killed 23 Americans who were members
of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The date of the African bombings, Aug. 7, was the day in 1990
when King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President George Bush announced
that U.S. troops would go to the kingdom to counter the invasion of
Kuwait by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's statements have also included frequent references to
what he considers the defilement of the main Islamic sanctuaries in
Mecca and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in late May with ABC News in his hideaway in
Afghanistan, bin Laden repeatedly returned to the American military
presence in Saudi Arabia, as well as mentioning his new coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allah ordered us in this religion to purify Muslim land of all
nonbelievers and especially the Arabian Peninsula, where the Ka'ba
is,'' he said. ``We must use such punishment to keep your evil away
from Muslims, Muslim children and women. We believe the biggest
thieves in the world and the terrorists are the Americans. The only
way for us to fend off these assaults is to use similar means.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquartered now under the protection of the Taliban in the
war-ruined Afghan city of Kandahar, he has repeatedly vowed to
strike at American centers in the Middle East. In a letter
published last year he said, ``The infidels must be thrown out of
the Arabian Peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   He started fighting alongside the mujahedeen rebels, whom the
CIA sponsored in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi intelligence official who insisted on anonymity said bin
Laden was a skilled executive who had set up bank accounts and
financial organizations in Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan as
fronts to channel money to his fighters. ``Mr. bin Laden,'' the
officer said, ``learned a lot of tricks from the CIA, which was
glad to help him fight the Russians. We all helped him. Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and the United States were united in the view that
the Russians must be defeated. He was a point man.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive editor of Al-Quds, Abdelbari Atwan, wrote on Nov.
22, 1996, in the paper that the most striking aspect of a long
interview that he had with bin Laden was the hostility that bin
Laden harbored for America, which he described as Israel's mentor.
Bin Laden, Atwan said, perceives the Americans as occupiers and has
called many times for their expulsion from the Middle East,
inviting the faithful to fight and kill them.
</P>
<P>
   The editor was equally impressed with the high-technology cave
hideout used for the interview. The cave reportedly had electric
generators, a satellite dish for worldwide telephone calls, a
computer, a database and a fine library of Islamic and political
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Cannistrano also noted the sophistication the operation. ``They
are very smart,'' he said. ``They use cyphered messages to
communicate. They rent space on a satellite to send their
propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Islamic militants gathered around bin Laden in
Afghanistan, Cannistrano and other experts said, were Ahmad Rifi
Taha, leader of the Egyptian Gama'at, which killed foreign tourists
at Luxor, and Ayman al-Zawahry, a leader of the Egyptian Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The Middle East expert for the Congressional Research Service,
Ken Katzman, who prepares on annual terrorism survey, said that
last year bin Laden rated only a mention, but that in the draft for
this year he had ``a whole section.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden sends tens of millions of dollars a year, intelligence
analysts say, to terrorist organizations, militant groups and
extremist movements based in places like Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon,
the Philippines, Sudan and Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   Born around 1957 the son of a construction magnate who made a
fortune as oil wealth and ostentation poured into Saudi Arabia, bin
Laden spent much of the '80s traveling to Peshawar, the Afghan
rebels' center, and Afghanistan. He dispensed millions of dollars
of aid to the rebels and was a leader of the more than 10,000 Arabs
who went to fight with their Moslem brethren.

SKUNK TRAIN SEEKING INVESTORS VIA ITS WEB SITE  
 BY KENNETH HOWE 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SKUNK   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Strapped for cash and in need of repairs, Fort Bragg's venerable
Skunk Train hopes to get back on track by selling stock to the
public over the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, local investors raised $1.6 million to save the
113-year old short-line railroad, which runs through 40 miles of
redwood forests between Fort Bragg on Highway 1 and Willits on
Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Mendocino County's biggest tourist attraction is
nearly sidelined by debt and the need to rehabilitate its tracks,
locomotives and rolling stock.
</P>
<P>
   The 21 owners of the Skunk Train hope to raise $4.6 million by
selling stock directly to investors through its Web site
( &LR; www.skunktrain.com &LR; ), thus avoiding the expense &UR;  &LR; and regulatory
scrutiny of a traditional public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this week, the train's parent company, California
Western Railroad Inc., intends to sell 614,000 shares, or 49.5
percent of the firm, for $7.50 a share, with a 100-share minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original investors saved an historic artifact; now we need
more investors to ensure its survival,'' said railroad President
Gary Milliman, as he walked through the Skunk Train's roundhouse
where mechanics greased the 2,000-pound wheels of a diesel
locomotive.
</P>
<P>
   The Skunk Train is a key draw for Fort Bragg and Willits alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly wish the railroad well,'' said Fort Bragg City
Administrator Jim Murphy. ``The depot is located in the heart of
town and the train is important to the tourist economy here.''
</P>
<P>
   But for investors, the stock could be more memento than
moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, companies that want to sell stock to the public
have hired investment banking firms to handle the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But investment bankers typically want 7 percent of the money
raised as a fee. Moreover, investment houses prefer larger deals _
$25 million minimum _ so they can sell the stock in big blocks to
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, small companies that needed money to expand or
rebuild had to plead for bank loans or rustle up a few well-heeled
investors. But the Internet, with its ability to connect with large
numbers of people, has spurred the growth of so-called direct
public offerings, in which companies sell shares to investors
without a middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 542 firms registered for direct public offerings,
according to Tom Stewart-Gordon, publisher of the SCOR Report, a
newsletter about financing alternatives. That's a 22 percent
increase from 1996 and a jump of more than 1,300 percent from 1990,
when a paltry 37 were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Although such companies are still regulated by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the state, they have fewer reporting
requirements and undergo less scrutiny than companies that go
public the traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   Direct public offerings may also be a poor short-term investment
because their stocks often aren't listed on any stock exchange and
may be traded by only one or a handful of brokers. That can make it
difficult to get an accurate value and to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the only direction (direct offering) stocks can go
is down,'' said Stewart-Gordon. ``All the people who are interested
in the company have already bought shares and may not be looking to
buy more.''
</P>
<P>
   Milliman acknowledged that if the Skunk Train can't raise the
money over the Internet, the company will have to ``restructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Since buying the train in August 1996, the owners have lost more
than $1.2 million, leaving them with only $84,200 in equity,
according to the company's latest financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The current owners say the red ink has come from having to
borrow almost $1 million to buy the line. With total debt now at
$1.6 million, interest payments alone keep the line from making
much profit.
</P>
<P>
   Winter storms also hammered the line. In January 1997, a mud
slide buried the west entrance of a long tunnel along the route.
Digging it out and replacing the portal cost hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and the line was closed for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This past winter, the line was out of commission for 60 days due
to mudslides, fallen trees and washed out track.
</P>
<P>
   The line is particularly difficult to maintain, says Chief
Operating Officer Lynn Hakin, whose grandfather was a boilermaker
for the railroad. The train crosses 31 bridges, passes around 381
curves, chugs through two tunnels and travels from near sea level
to an elevation of 1,740 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad plans to spend about $2.1 million from the offering
to replace two miles of track, install 30,000 new rail ties and
rehabilitate 13 bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing track isn't entirely a safety issue. The Skunk Train
earns roughly 12 percent of its revenue from hauling lumber for the
nearby Georgia Pacific mill. To carry bigger loads, which means
more revenue, the Skunk Train must strengthen its track.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman said he plans to spend another $630,000 to buy
additional steam and diesel locomotives as well as refurbish
existing passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   If they can make repairs, pay off debt and add more trains to
the Willits side of the line, the Skunk Train's owners think they
can make money. The railroad, which has a payroll of 24 in the
winter and more than twice that in the summer, attracts 65,000
riders a year, with adults paying $25 to $35 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Right now, the rail line owns five diesel locomotives, two
steam locomotives, nine passenger cars and two gasoline-powered
motorcars. The latter have been around since 1925 and quickly
dubbed ``skunk trains'' because of their noxious odors.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman, who was Fort Bragg's city manager for 18 years, hopes
the Skunk Train's name and history will draw investors.
</P>
<P>
   He's also counting on the services of Drew Field, a San
Francisco securities lawyer and specialist in direct public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 20 years, Field has helped a host of small
companies with direct public offerings: ZAP Power Systems, a
Sebastopol maker of electric bikes; Thanksgiving Coffee Co. based
in Fort Bragg; Blue Fish Clothing Inc., a Frenchtown N.J., maker of
handmade clothes; Ukiah's Real Goods Trading Co., which sells
renewable energy and other ``green'' products; and Mendocino
Brewing, a beer company in Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   Field argues that direct public offerings can be an excellent
financial alternative for companies that can't access traditional
markets. But he also acknowledged that a direct offering isn't
always a great short-term investment.
</P>
<P>
   Companies often choose the direct route because they are losing
money or can't finance operations through earnings or bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ZAP, Real Goods, Blue Fish and Mendocino Brewing have
all shown losses in recent quarters and their stocks are trading
well below their offering prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart-Gordon of the SCOR Report noted that a typical
shareholder of a direct public offering isn't strictly interested
in stock escalation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many people it's investing in something they believe in
and want to support, like a local winery or the Skunk Train,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, many investors look at direct public offerings like
venture capital _ a high risk investment that needs a long time to
pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman admits it could take five years to turn around the
Skunk Train.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you whether you're going to make any money or
not,'' he said. ``What you've got is a chance to own a piece of
railroad history.''

FALSE PROFITS FOR 3 YEARS AT CENDANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cendant Corp., struggling to regain investor confidence amid an
accounting scandal that has slashed its share price in half, had a
good news, bad news story to tell investors Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that profits for the first half of 1998 were
robust. The bad news? More than $640 million of the profits
reported for the last three years were fictional.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said that a board-level investigation of the
accounting problems had been completed and will be provided to its
directors in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation, said Michael Monaco, Cendant's chief
financial officer, ``uncovered much greater and more systematic
fraud than we had any conception of when we launched this effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter profits from continuing businesses were more
than 40 percent higher than last year's figure, said Henry
Silverman, chairman and chief executive of Cendant, which was
formed in December through the merger of CUC International, a
membership-club marketing service, and HFS Inc., a franchisor of
such prominent brands as Century 21 real estate services, and Avis
car rentals.
</P>
<P>
   But approximately $640 million in pre-tax operating profits will
be erased from Cendant's pro-forma ledgers for the years 1995, 1996
and 1997 when amended financial statements are filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission later this month, the company
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in 1997 pretax operating profits by $392 million
was at the high end of the range that Wall Street had been warned
to expect, but the total impact of the accounting fraud had not
previously been reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with Wall Street analysts Thursday,
Silverman apologized to ``all the people who invested with us, and
with me, over the last few years'' for the losses they have
suffered as a result of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But the erasures announced Thursday actually were made on the
books of the businesses operated before the merger by CUC
International, which provides online and telephone shopping
services marketed directly to consumers and indirectly, as
``add-on'' features for bank credit card customers.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, in response to rising pressure from institutional
investors, the former chairman and chief executive of CUC, Walter
Forbes, and eight former CUC directors resigned from the Cendant
board. Forbes has denied any knowledge of the accounting
irregularities at the company he ran since the early 1980s, and
said he was stepping down to allow Cendant to focus on recovering
investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Four other senior executives who had worked at CUC have also
left Cendant in the wake of the scandal. They, too, have denied
knowing about or participating in any wrongdoing at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take no joy in reporting these results,'' said Monaco, the
chief financial officer, as he announced the cumulative damage
uncovered by outside auditors. But he said shareholders should
``take great comfort from the thoroughness of this investigation
and the fact that we have unflinchingly accepted and reported its
results.''
</P>
<P>
   After the accounting irregularities were reported to management
by former CUC finance-office employees in April, the audit
committee of Cendant's board hired the law firm of Willkie, Farr &AMP;
Gallagher and forensic accounting specialists at Arthur Andersen to
investigate _ an effort which has taken four months and cost
between $12 million and $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Their findings will be presented to the board when it meets on
Aug. 27. The investigative report is expected to show that
deceptive accounting occurred at least as early as 1993, according
to people who have been briefed on preliminary findings.
</P>
<P>
   Separate inquiries were also begun by the SEC and the United
States attorney's office in Newark, and dozens of shareholder
lawsuits have been filed against Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said his 1998 budget includes $75 million to cover the
various costs associated with the investigation and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's core businesses have been holding up extremely
well despite the distractions the scandal has posed for management,
Silverman said. Earnings in the three-month period that ended June
30, were $210.9 million, or 24 cents a fully diluted share,
compared with a $92.3 million loss, equal to 11 cents a share, in
the period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's news was a nice change from the script of bad news,
worse news that Cendant has been stuck with since April 16, when
the first announcement of ``accounting irregularities'' at the
company caused its stock to plunge 46 percent, to $19.0625 a share.
Cendant shares fell further in mid-July, when Cendant announced
that the fraud was more extensive and of longer duration than it
had originally believed.
</P>
<P>
   They traded as recently as Tuesday at $14.125 _ down from more
than $41 in early April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the first day of the new Cendant,'' Silverman told
analysts during his hourlong, generally relaxed conference call. He
told them he was confident that Cendant could produce profits of $1
a share this year and generate 20 percent earnings growth over the
next five years, even as he refrained from the breakneck
acquisitions that marked both CUC's and HFS's prior history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results show that the growth engine is still intact,''
Silverman said in an interview after the call.
</P>
<P>
   That positive news helped extend a minor rally that has already
lifted Cendant's shares almost 17 percent since Tuesday evening.
The stock closed last night at $16.50, up 37.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the gain over the last two days came on the news that
Cendant is seeking a buyer for its software unit and is selling its
Hebdo Mag International unit, a classified advertising publisher,
for about $523 million in cash and stock.

CONDOM MAKER SPONSORS RAIDERS BROADCAST  
 BY CAROL EMERT 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - CONDOM   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Oakland Raiders fans will be getting some latex with their pigskin
this season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what is believed to be a first in broadcasting, a condom
brand is an official sponsor of this season's Raiders coverage by
KTCT ``The Ticket'' radio.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsorship, by LifeStyles condoms, may indicate a turning
point in the mainstreaming of condoms _ a product that is used by
tens of millions of Americans each year and is crucial in
preventing the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. But if KTCT
has misread the public's readiness for sex-oriented advertising,
the promotion could backfire by offending listeners.
</P>
<P>
   While condom ads have appeared sporadically on KTCT and other
radio stations in the past, this appears to be the first time a
broadcast has aligned itself so closely with condoms _ or any other
sex-related product.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Radio spots that ran during an exhibition game last weekend
said, ``Lifestyles is the official condom of Oakland Raiders
broadcasts on The Ticket, 1050-AM. Lifestyles: Because life is a
contact sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 10-second ads will run before and after 20 Raiders games
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from its relatively taboo subject matter, the LifeStyles
promotion is similar to the type of marketing that is done for any
other consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Samples will play an important role. Free condoms will be passed
out from a KTCT van at four tailgate parties at the Oakland
Coliseum and the annual Raiders FanFest in Jack London Square in
September. The LifeStyles logo will appear on posters for the
FanFest. Condom-related goodies, such as key chains with
prophylactics embedded in the fob, will be handed out on a
first-come, first-serve basis at all of the events.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And the marketing director for Ansell &LR;   &LR; Personal Products,
which makes Lifestyles condoms, will plug the company during on-air
interviews with KTCT talk show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But don't expect any condom-shaped blimps, or other blatantly
tacky promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Ansell) had said, `We want to fly planes with big condoms
behind, or do stunts with people putting condoms on cucumbers,'
that's not what we're about,'' said Rich Zirkel, local sales
manager for KTCT. ``We're not racy, we're not doing anything to
offend anybody. It's really an awareness campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I really think this will be successful because it's
being done tastefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Zirkel's confidence stems from the fact that KTCT has
already tested the waters with a couple of recent LifeStyles
giveaways that were not linked to the Raiders. Condoms distributed
from the KTCT van at various events were the most popular freebies
in the station's history, and KTCT has not received a single
complaint about the giveaway or about condom radio ads, Zirkel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody needs them and we're all embarrassed (buying) them
in the drug store,'' Zirkel said. ``I think it's refreshing to
people'' that condoms are being marketed in a straightforward
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Clarkson, a marketing consultant with Greenfield Online,
said Ansell's direct approach is the right way to go. ``One thing I
learned when I used to do advertising for Tampax was that it is
better to be brutally honest. If you try to get cute or indirect,
customers read right through it and they say, ``Why are you
treating me this way?'''
</P>
<P>
   While the LifeStyles promotion may offend some listeners,
Clarkson predicted that it will be well received by its target
audience. If any group is likely to embrace a condom promotion, it
is Raiders followers, said marketing experts.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders fans tend to be 18- to 34-year-old men with some college
education, a core group for condom sales, said Carol Carrozza,
marketing director for Ansell.
</P>
<P>
   The fan base also includes a large number of African Americans
and Hispanics, two demographic groups in which condom sales are
growing fastest, said Carrozza.
</P>
<P>
   Staging the promotion in the Bay Area, known for its social
progressiveness, also minimizes the risk. ``If this were happening
in Cleveland, there probably would be protesters when I come in in
the morning,'' said Zirkel.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Becker, president of Becker Media in San Francisco, said
he doesn't expect the Raiders to suffer from the promotion. In
fact, breaching the condom taboo may even enhance the National
Football League team's ``skull-and-crossbones, bad boy image,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Condoms and the Raiders ``really go hand-in-glove, so to
speak,'' said Becker, whose company brokers radio air time.
</P>
<P>
   A Raiders spokesman declined to discuss the matter, apart from
pointing out that the LifeStyle's promotion is KTCT's project and
does not directly involve the team.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, KTCT doesn't have a lot to lose. The station ranks
an anemic 20th in the Bay Area among its target audience of men 18
to 34, according to Arbitron. KNBR, a sister sports station, is
ranked sixth. Most of the higher-ranked stations are FM music
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Becker estimated that Ansell is paying KTCT about $50,000 for
the promotion, an amount that offers a lot of bang for the buck, he
said. Consumer product makers ``are increasingly looking for
opportunities to get one-on-one contact with the public, and these
kinds of events give them an unparalleled opportunity to do that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ansell, meanwhile, is pushing the envelope in other realms of
advertising. On August 22, the Eatontown, N.J.-based company will
run the first condom ads ever shown on national network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on network affiliates and cable, but this is a
breakthrough,'' said Carrozza. The 30-second spots, which feature
``romping'' couples, according to Ansell, will run on Howard
Stern's Saturday night talk show on CBS. Carrozza has also appeared
on Stern's radio program.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Ansell will distribute 435,000 posters on college
campuses with product information and illustrations. It also has a
Web site ( &LR; www.lifestyles.com &LR; ) with links to condom-selling sites.
</P>
<P>
   LifeStyles' share of the retail condom market has grown to 17
percent from 4 percent in 1985, but it still lags far behind the
Trojan brand, which has 58 percent of retail sales. LifeStyles
condoms comprise about 70 percent of the condoms that are
distributed through public health service organizations, Carrozza
said.

BIG APPLE AD BLITZ FOR IMAC  
 BY JON SWARTZ  
 C.1998 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE  

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - APPLE  Apple Computer yesterday said it will launch its biggest
advertising campaign ever _ $100 million _ for its new iMac
computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media blitz, which kicked off Tuesday on radio stations
across the country, will extend to TV spots on Sunday as well as
magazines and outdoor billboards this week, and will run through
the end of 1998. The $1,299 computer, sporting a gently curved
aquamarine plastic case, is scheduled to ship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach people who are buying their first
computer,'' said Phil Schiller, Apple vice president of product
marketing. ``It is easily our most far-reaching, coordinated use of
the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schiller declined to disclose the content of the TV
ads, he said they will stress the Internet terminal's ease of use,
simplicity and speed. The ads ``will be fun and factual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's billboards in 10 major U.S. cities _ including San
Francisco, New York and Seattle _ may offer a clue, however. The
placards feature a large photo of an iMac and one of the following
headlines: ``I think, therefore iMac.''; ``Chic. Not geek.'';
``Sorry, no beige.''; and ``Mental floss.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV spots were produced by TBWA Chiat Day, creator of the
widely acclaimed television commercial ``1984'' that launched the
original Macintosh and aired only once _ during the 1984 Super
Bowl. The commercials will premiere on the ``Wonderful World of
Disney'' and will run on episodes of ``Seinfeld,'' ``News Radio,''
``South Park'' and other shows next week.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 million 12-page magazine inserts will be
distributed in Time, Newsweek, Sports Illustrated, Rolling Stone
and People this quarter. The sheer volume of inserts is more than
twice what Apple has distributed in its entire 21-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino company will launch iMac campaigns in Europe and
Japan next month, according to Allen Olivo, Apple senior director
of worldwide marketing communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly is the biggest, most concentrated ad campaign for
any consumer PC in history,'' said Bradley Johnson, an editor at
Advertising Age in Los Angeles. ``To put this in perspective,
Compaq Computer recently doubled annual spending on its Presario
consumer computer, and that was $50 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The iMac blitz eclipses Apple's successful ``Think Different ''
marketing campaign. Those print and billboard ads, which debuted in
November, will continue to appear on the back covers of national
magazines, according to Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising experts said the scope of Apple's campaign is akin
to America Online's carpet bombing of floppy disks in consumers'
mailboxes. And, like AOL, such aggressive tactics come with risks.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said PC makers usually shy away from extravagant
consumer-PC ads because of slim margins and cutthroat competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple needs to sell a bunch of PCs to make this work,''
Johnson said. ``This is a huge bet.''
</P>
<P>
   The computer maker already has shattered its record for
first-week orders, with 150,000. An estimated 400,000 units are
expected to ship by the end of September.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In an oven-hot patch of California desert just
north of the Mexico border, the bodies of seven people were found
Thursday, apparently the victims of the heat and their dreams for a
better life.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said it appeared that the group had illegally
crossed into the United States from Mexico and had been abandoned
by smugglers in one of the worse cases of death along the border in
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, what we find is one or two people dead from the
heat at one time,'' said Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. ``But I can't recall a
group this large dying from the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Strassberger said the group, which included five men, a woman
and a teen-age boy, had been dead for at least three days when
their bodies were discovered about 90 miles east of San Diego and
about 35 miles north of the Mexico border in a stretch of
California desert where temperatures on a cool day hover above 100
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough area for the agents to work in,'' he said, ``so
you can imagine what it's like for someone trying to sneak in.''
</P>
<P>
   Strassberger said the group might have been part of an even
larger group making the increasingly dangerous journey across the
border and through the desert and the night, walking miles and
miles out of their way to avoid border checkpoints and being pushed
and prodded to keep moving, faster, faster by smugglers known as
``coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of foul play when the seven were found
Thursday about seven miles west of Highway 86, but the authorities
are searching for their smugglers, who could be sent to prison for
life if captured and convicted of bringing the undocumented
immigrants across the border and then leaving them to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lowest level of exploitation of another human
being,'' Strassberger said.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies were found Thursday after a farm worker stopped at a
border checkpoint at the intersection of Highways 78 and 86 at 8
a.m. and reported seeing several people possibly in distress a few
miles away. The worker did not know whether they were alive or dead
and drew a map for the border patrol agents, who then called for a
search plane.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the bodies were under a salt cedar tree about 250 yards
from Pole Line Road, a bumpy dirt track, and the seventh was about
20 feet away. There were no water bottles there, leading
immigration officials to speculate that a smuggler had dropped off
the victims nearby to wait for a connecting ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very unusual case,'' said Luis Herrera-Lass, counsel
general for the Mexican consulate in San Diego. ``We haven't in
recent times had seven people die at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrera-Lass said that usually the only other scenario where
there had been multiple deaths of immigrants was car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 10 or 12 years ago 15 bodies were found in Texas in a
boxcar that had been locked by a smuggler, said Robert Gilbert,
deputy assistant director for the Western region for the Border
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Before Thursday, California authorities said seven people had
died from the heat since last January and 29, including a man found
Thursday, had drowned. Along the nation's border with Mexico, 80
illegal immigrants have died from heat this year, 23 in California
and Arizona and 57 in Texas and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   They have died despite an extensive media campaign on both sides
of the border warning of the dangers from crooked ``coyotes,''
rivers and the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, another man was found dead in the desert, about seven
miles west of where the seven were discovered Thursday.
Strassberger said the authorities did not believe he was connected
to the larger party beyond their common fate.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, ``coyotes'' were charging a couple of hundred
dollars. These days, Strassberger said, the price can be exceed
$1,200 a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get the word out about how dangerous it is,'' he said,
``but everyone seems to believe ending up dead or hurt is something
that is going to happen to the other guy. They all say the same
thing, `I'll get through.'''

POOF! FOR MORE AND MORE MUTUAL FUNDS, A QUICK DISAPPEARING ACT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., R.I.)  (ART ADV: Graphic of fund mergers is being sent to NYT graphic
clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
(888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a merger boom that investors may not like: Responding to
a confluence of industry currents, mutual fund companies are
combining funds at a record pace this year. Such mergers, however,
can burn the shareholders they are purported to help.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher in
Chicago, 232 funds had been merged out of existence this year,
through Aug. 11, compared with 150 in the corresponding period last
year and 154 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If the furious pace continues, the total for 1998 will easily
surpass that of the record year of 1995, when 322 funds were merged
into other funds in the wake of the 1994 turmoil in the stock and
bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   Among stock funds alone, 102 have disappeared by way of mergers
this year, versus 64 in the like period last year and 77 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the trend may be oversupply. ``Fund companies
spun funds out like crazy over the past couple of years thinking
that investors would have an insatiable appetite,'' said Susan
Dziubinski, editor of the Morningstar Investor newsletter. ``But
they haven't attracted the assets they had hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may be driving the phenomenon, too. The financial
services industry has been consolidating, prompting firms to
combine fund families and reduce the number of offerings with
similar objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Bobroff, an industry consultant in East Greenwich, R.I.,
attributes the trend to the popularity of fee-based financial
planning. Advisers can use fund supermarkets and brokerage-firm
wrap accounts to assemble fund portfolios from many companies
without incurring transaction fees. As a result, a company may not
need to offer as broad a range of funds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as consumers become more sophisticated, there is a
growing impetus to get rid of lackluster funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of mistakes out there that are being merged out
of existence,'' Ms. Dziubinski said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the recent spate of fund combinations by BancAmerica
Robertson Stephens were examples of ``mercy mergers.'' In early
July, shareholders agreed to merge Robertson Stephens Global
Low-Priced Stock into the group's Partners fund.
</P>
<P>
   Global Low-Priced Stock returned an annualized average of just
1.7 percent from its inception in late 1995 through July 11, when
Morningstar stopped tracking it, compared with 17.3 percent for the
average world stock fund. Partners, by contrast, has returned an
annualized average of 14.6 percent from its inception in 1995
through Aug. 7, just less than the 15.9 percent of its peer group
of small capitalization value funds.
</P>
<P>
   Also in early July, Robertson Stephens filed a plan with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to merge its Developing
Countries fund into Partners. Developing Countries, an
emerging-markets fund, lost 10.5 percent a year, on average, from
its inception in April 1994 through Aug. 7, far more than the 7.1
percent annual average loss by its peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another high-profile merger, Strong Funds plans to fold its
lagging Small Cap fund into its Growth fund. Small Cap returned 5.6
percent, annualized, from the end of 1995 through Aug. 7, compared
with 9.4 percent for its average peer in the small-cap growth
category.
</P>
<P>
   So shareholders should pay close attention. ``Mergers usually
benefit fund families more than fund shareholders,'' Ms. Dziubinski
said.
</P>
<P>
   While mergers can sweep poor track records under the rug, they
can pose a danger: Companies don't necessarily merge funds with
similar objectives, so shareholders may end up with a different
investment than they started with.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens investors who bought Global Low-Priced Stock
and Developing Countries, perhaps with foreign diversification in
mind, ended up with a primarily domestic small-cap portfolio in
Partners. If the Strong funds merge, Small Cap investors will be
trading small stocks for larger ones in Strong Growth.
</P>
<P>
   An SEC ruling provides only ``loose guidance'' for mergers, said
Douglas J. Scheidt, associate director and chief counsel of the
agency's division of investment management.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC requires that fund companies compare investment
objectives, policies, asset totals and other attributes of two
merging funds to see which one will most closely resemble the
merged offering. The fund company then gets to use that fund's
record in its marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, fund companies engineer a merger so the better
track record survives. ``No one wants to continue a bad
performance, so they'll choose a fund that they know will be a
survivor under this test,'' Scheidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some shareholders may balk, however, after seeing the
consequences of a merger. A big tax bill can await investors who
sit tight _ even those in the acquiring fund. David J. Mangefrida,
national director of investment management tax services for Ernst &AMP;
Young in Washington, said there could be capital gains when the
manager of the surviving fund liquidates the absorbed fund's
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders can vote against a merger, of course, but such
efforts seldom succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Fund mergers are not all bad, Ms. Dziubinski said. They can
create economies of scale, cutting costs for investors. And
perhaps, she added, it is better for companies to wipe out losing
funds than to continue to pocket the fees they generate.

COWBOYS TO RETURN TO WICHITA FALLS FOR 1999 TRAINING CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The Cowboys yesterday announced an
agreement with Wichita Falls to return for training camp in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is for one year. The option to extend the deal
lies with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Midwestern State University
President Louis J. Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Cowboys' first training camp in Wichita Falls after
spending the previous eight summers in Austin. Before yesterday's
practices, some fans held up posters and banners that thanked the
Cowboys for coming here, and appealed to Jones to keep his club in
Wichita Falls for the upcoming summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training camp has gone incredibly well,'' Rodriguez said. ``If
you'd have asked me before camp started, I wouldn't think it would
have gone this smooth. But this has been a great experience. The
Cowboys are a great organization. They are always welcome back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Through Wednesday, more than 80,000 spectators had turned out
for Cowboys workouts in Wichita Falls. More than two-thirds were
from out of town, and some from as far away as Turkey and Alaska,
university spokeswoman Janus Buss said.

SCHWAB'S NEW PITCH: SEE, IT'S TIME TO SWITCH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BRENDA BUTTNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drawing a bead on full-service brokerage firms, Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., the discount broker, has begun offering its customers analyses
of the performance of their mutual funds _ including load funds
they hold in full-service firms' brokerage accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The move is an effort to persuade customers to switch from funds
sold by the full-service firms to those offered by Schwab's no-load
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them will dip their toes at Schwab and then decide to
transfer their assets to us,'' said Susanne Lyons, a Schwab
president in charge of customer segment marketing, referring to
dual-account holders, who make up nearly half of the company's
client base. ``And for us to grow, we really need to be appealing
to those types of customers who have traditionally gone to the
full-service brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   The service was started in late July and has been offered to a
few hundred thousand of Schwab's 5.2 million customers. All
customers are to receive mailings in late September.
</P>
<P>
   After filling out a form itemizing their mutual fund holdings,
investors receive a detailed performance analysis of each fund in
their portfolio, comparing 1-, 5- and 10-year returns to benchmarks
like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Russell 2000
index of small companies.
</P>
<P>
   For each fund, the profile includes a list of better-performing
alternatives that are available through Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a holder of Merrill Lynch Growth would see the
fund's return compared with the higher average annual return of the
Oakmark fund for the last one and five years.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 investment in the Merrill Lynch fund's class A shares,
which have a maximum front-end load, or sales charge, of 5.25
percent, would have grown to $20,931 over the last five years,
through June 30, compared with $26,939 for Oakmark, which does not
have a load.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to prompt investors to weigh alternatives to
lackluster funds. ``If you decide that one's a dog and you don't
want it anymore, we give you similar types of funds that have
performed much better,'' Ms. Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab is betting that simply by pointing out the relative
underperformance of many full-service brokerage funds, it can
persuade clients to send significant portions of their outside
holdings in Schwab's direction. Indeed, to help shareholders do so,
Schwab already publishes a ranking of recommended funds called the
Mutual Fund Select List.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles are based on data from Morningstar Inc., the
financial publisher in Chicago. Morningstar research shows that
over all, funds managed by the major Wall Street brokerage firms
have not performed well relative to their peers over the last three
years, even before adjusting for the loads they charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The picture is of pretty consistent mediocrity,'' said John
Rekenthaler, research director at Morningstar. ``It's clear the
funds in Schwab's Select List will have higher average rankings and
category ratings than this pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab hopes its profiles will persuade customers to follow the
example of David Monigal of East St. Louis, Ill. After he saw that
many of his Smith Barney funds were underperforming Schwab
alternatives, he switched nearly $300,000 to Schwab from the Smith
Barney broker he and his wife had relied on for nearly 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profile really brought it home to us,'' said Monigal, a
vice president of Transunion, a credit bureau. Monigal said he
would now deal with Schwab exclusively. ``The value of the
full-service broker is really challenged with all of the tools that
Schwab provides in terms of analysis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, officials at full-service brokerage firms
disagree with Schwab's take. Joe Lohrer, director of sales for
Smith Barney Mutual Funds, said his firm furnishes customers with
valuable asset-allocation services that Schwab's analysis ignores.
``With us, clients don't simply buy an individual fund; they build
an entire fund portfolio,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Thomson, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said the
Schwab program did clients a disservice by not viewing fund returns
in a broader context. ``It's a mistake to review performance of one
asset class in the absence of any consideration of a client's total
portfolio, risk tolerance and time horizon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest brokerage firm, and
several other firms are looking at providing small investors with
research and perhaps even ratings for funds sold by their brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for mutual fund money is intensifying as it becomes a
bigger percentage of assets under management at both discount and
full-service brokers. Schwab holds nearly $200 billion in mutual
fund assets, a 20-fold increase since the start of the decade. And
funds are a rapidly growing revenue source for the traditional
securities firms, too.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab representatives say response to the new service has been
strong, with 40,000 requests for performance profiles so far. The
company plans an ad campaign to reach full-service brokerage
customers who do not have Schwab accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the attempt to siphon mutual fund assets from
full-service brokerage firms would be important to Schwab's future.
``Right now, a lot of people with dual accounts use the
full-service brokers for the main part of their assets and just use
Schwab to play,'' said Steve Eisman, a financial services analyst
with CIBC Oppenheimer. ``If Schwab can convert a significant
percentage of them, this will be a big enhancement to growth.''

NOW, A PREVIEW OF CADILLAC'S COMING ATTRACTION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES G. COBB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Detroit's long-running struggle for one-upmanship, the Big
Three take their victories wherever they can get them. When General
Motors bought the Renaissance Center complex downtown, the new
landlord got a certain pleasure in sending a group of tenants
packing _ those whose office doors were emblazoned with the oval
blue emblem of Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen miles west, at Ford's ``Glass House'' in Dearborn,
executives have had a year to gloat over their own coup: The
Lincoln Navigator had tapped into an unexpectedly large vein of
demand for oversized, overstuffed, overwrought sport utility
vehicles. Each Navigator returns some $15,000 in profit, and Ford
had the market pretty much to itself.
</P>
<P>
   GM, playing catch-up, found itself in a bind. Its existing
full-size sport-utilities _ the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon, and
the monstrous Suburbans from both Chevy and GMC _ were near the end
of the line, since they are built on a truck platform that is being
replaced this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's brand managers _ a tribe of marketers who used
to purvey products like disposable diapers and laundry detergents _
decreed that GMC must establish itself as a luxury line distinct
from Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   So GM cobbled together a stopgap solution: It took the Yukon,
dressed it up in monochromatic paint and plastic lower-body
cladding, installed Bilstein shock absorbers to smooth the ride,
bolted on special Firestone Firehawk tires and six-spoke chromed
aluminum wheels. Inside, the truck cabin was upgraded with leather
captain's chairs, Zebrano wood like that in the Cadillac Seville
and a powerful Bose sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting package is the Yukon Denali, borrowing the Native
American name for Mount McKinley, the highest point in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   This concept has a few problems. First, ``Yukon Denali'' is an
oxymoron on an international scale, since Denali is the pride of
Alaska, and Canada still claims the Yukon as its own. Would they
name a mini-van the Baja California Grand Canyon or call a sports
coupe the Tuscany Matterhorn?
</P>
<P>
   And with the Denali's development well under way, GM did a
U-turn, undercutting the rationale for a project intended to
establish GMC as the company's upscale truck division. After
insisting that there was no place at Cadillac for a truck,
particularly a truck shared with lesser divisions, Cadillac
succumbed to its dealers' pleas and announced that it would sell
yet another fancy variation of the Tahoe/Yukon, to be called the
Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving this fall, it will differ from a Denali chiefly with
softer leather, extra insulation, a bit more wood, a year-longer
warranty and the Onstar security-navigation system as standard
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 GMC Yukon Denali has been on sale since winter, but
supplies were tight even before the eight-week GM strike. Now that
the trucks are being produced again, here is a checklist to
determine if the Denali is right for you: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't mind spending $44,000 for what is, at its core, a
$32,000 Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   _ You're willing to lug around a 16.5-foot-long vehicle that
seats only five people.
</P>
<P>
   _ You can't wait a year or so for the GM sport utilities that
will be built on the company's all-new, much-improved,
full-size-truck platform, with new engines and a host of innovative
features.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't feel the need to spend $3,000 more for a Cadillac
crest on the grille.

 UNDATED: the grille.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if you like the Denali's considerable size, don't mind the
price and don't care about GM's tendency to disregard its own
edicts (not long ago, the company insisted it would stop slapping
different names on the same basic vehicles), the Yukon Denali is a
pretty good example of what a big luxury sport utility ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its dated body, frame and engine, the truck feels
solid, stable and responsive _ responsiveness being a relative
term, given its heft.
</P>
<P>
   The 5.7-liter V8 has enough grunt to move the 5,867-pound truck
around pretty well, though that engine feels more eager in a
4,865-pound Tahoe. The suspension strikes a nice balance between
responsive handling and a supple, well-balanced ride.
</P>
<P>
   In a dig at the oversprung Navigator, GMC brags that the Denali
``gives the driver the feeling of mastery of the road, not a
squishy ride that rolls in the corners.'' The speed-variable
steering returns excellent feedback to the driver.
</P>
<P>
   A new push-button four-wheel-drive system has four settings:
rear-wheel-drive for ordinary use, 4WD high, 4WD low and an ``Auto
4WD'' mode that engages the front axle but sends power there only
if it senses that the rear wheels are slipping.
</P>
<P>
   The interior has many nice touches, including separate climate
settings, stereo controls and seat heaters for rear occupants; an
inside mirror with built-in compass and exterior temperature
readout; a nifty two-piece console box with a deep lower bin
alongside the CD changer and a shallow upper compartment with a
clipboard that flips forward.
</P>
<P>
   There are two power outlets up front, plus a lighter, in
addition to outlets in the back seat and cargo area. There are
eight cup holders. You can't have a third row of seats, however, in
contrast to the Navigator, Ford Expedition and Dodge Durango.
</P>
<P>
   There are dual air bags and headrests front and rear. The front
captain's chairs are superb: cushy yet supportive, and easy to
adjust. But after picking up the Denali and fiddling with the seat
controls, I headed off on one of the steamiest days of summer with
the uncomfortable feeling that although the air-conditioner was
blasting, my backside was being fried.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the seat heater was on, but where was the switch? I
scanned the dashboard, looked over the console and finally pulled
off the road. Ultimately, I found the control hidden at the front
of the bottom seat cushion, where it can easily be tripped by
anyone trying to adjust the seat. (Two passengers gave themselves
hot seats, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Roomy, comfortable and easy-riding, the Denali seemed the
perfect vehicle to take out-of-state guests on a sightseeing tour
of the Hudson Valley. It has panoramic windows and a commanding
view of the road. Yet my backseat tourists found that the rear side
windows, which are nearly 21 inches deep, retract a scant 6 inches.
So close-ups of waterfalls and wildlife had to be seen through
dark-tinted glass.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few other irritations, perhaps born of the
vehicle's rapid development. You cannot buckle or unbuckle the
front belts with the armrests down. You can't have a sunroof, a
strange omission in a luxury vehicle. The express-down control on
the driver's window was cantankerous.
</P>
<P>
   But in all the important measures of a truck _ ride, handling,
comfort, brute force and towing capacity _ the Denali genuinely
impressed, turning this skeptic into an admirer. The GMC is more
rewarding to drive than the Navigator, and it looks more serious
than frivolous. It is elegant in a low-key way, without the
Lincoln's nouveau-riche pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   At $43,500, the Denali is pricey _ $8,000 more than the top-line
Yukon SLT _ but consider that Jeeps now brush $40,000 and the
Cadillac version is expected to be nearly $47,000. It's expensive
to keep up with the Joneses, especially if they're going off-road. &QL;

   (NYT22) SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- Aug. 13, 1998 -- NOTRE-DAME-2, 8-13
-- Notre Dame's once-pristine reputation has been battered by a
lawsuit filed by Joe Moore, a former assistant coach, that featured
sordid testimony about its football program. Mike Rosenthal, an
offensive lineman, claims the summer's controversies have not
distracted the players. ``The trial has never been a factor,'' says
Rosenthal, a captain who testified on behalf of his former
offensive line coach, Moore, at the trial. (Joe Raymond/New York

   (NYT19) LOS ANGELES -- Aug. 13, 1998 -- WEST-POINT-NOVEL, 8-13
-- Lucian Truscott IV's new novel, ``Full Dress Gray,'' like his
1978 mystery, ``Dress Gray,'' is a steamy potboiler set at the
United States Military Academy in West Point. Surprisingly, the
academy has eagerly embraced the book. ``I thought I would never be
welcome up there again,'' says Truscott, who graduated from the
academy in 1969. ``Now they're in the process of milling a whole
new red carpet to run out for me.'' (Kim Kulish/New York Times

8-13 -- Jay Fetcher, who formed the Cattlemen's Agricultural Land
Trust, donated his development rights to a trust to preserve his
family's ranch. Here and across the Rocky Mountain West, tourism
and the second-home industry have spurred a land rush that is
carving up the ranch land that composes heart-stopping Western
vistas, threatening the very landscape that draws so many people to
the Rockies. (Ellen Jaskol/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT17) STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. -- Aug. 13, 1998 --
WESTERN-LAND-TRUSTS-1, 8-13 -- As condominiums encroach on a
mountain in Steamboat Springs, ranchers and farmers are using land
trusts to preserve the West's wide open spaces, one of the reasons
so many people go there in the first place. As subdivisions and
``ranchettes'' replace cattle, the new rallying cries are ``Cows,
not Condos'' and ``Herefords, not Highways.'' (Kevin Moloney/New

Pepsi's bottler in this region, but its hold on the area is not as
solid as it once was. Employee David Bright makes a delivery in New
Bern. ``It's like David and Goliath,'' says Jeff Minges, president
of of Kinston Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co., of the fight for market
share against the infiltration of Coke and a changing market. (M.J.

a music festival this weekend at the site of the 1969 Woodstock
concert. Alan Gerry has bought and tamed Max Yasgur's hayfield to
leverage the legend of Woodstock, luring buttoned-down yuppies, not
rainbow-clad hippies, to this long-depressed southern flank of the
Catskills. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

Croquet, or ``gate ball,'' is the game of the moment among elderly

MONEY ENDS COLLEGE LIST, BUT KIPLINGER'S PICKS UP THE SLACK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The intense competition among personal-finance magazines has
been thrown into sharp focus with the September issues of Money and
Kiplinger's.
</P>
<P>
   Money magazine's annual college review, a seven-year-old feature
that has usually appeared in its September issue, is history _ at
least for this year. So Kiplinger's has jumped into the fray with a
college survey of its own, perfectly timed to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   At Money, the leading personal-finance magazine with a
circulation of 1.9 million, the demise of the college feature is
part of continuing changes that will culminate in a new design
starting in the October issue. For several months now, Money
editors have added, dropped and changed editorial elements. For
example, the magazine sharply cut its annual survey this summer of
the best places to live in America.
</P>
<P>
   Money's editors have said in interviews and in notes to readers
that they want to make the magazine more relevant and easier to
read and use, all in an effort to retain its commanding lead in an
increasingly crowded field. But such a makeover runs the risk of
thinning the content. Time will tell if they are on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the previous surveys in Money, which included public and
private schools, Kiplinger's review is limited to state colleges
and universities. Kiplinger's ranks the top 100 of these schools
based on value, educational quality and student satisfaction, among
other criteria. It tallies costs for tuition _ both for in-state
and out-of-state students _ and room and board.
</P>
<P>
   It also lists the average size of financial aid packages and the
average debt of graduates, plus academic statistics like SAT scores
of incoming freshmen, admission rates and graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine concludes that students can get a high-quality
education at many public schools for a fraction of the cost at many
private colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's top 10 choices, in order, are the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Virginia, the
College of William and Mary, the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign, the University of Florida, the University of
Wisconsin at Madison, the University of California at Berkeley, the
University of California at Los Angeles, the Georgia Institute of
Technology and the State University of New York at Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Annual costs for in-state students at these schools range from
$7,184 at North Carolina to $12,142 at Berkeley. For out-of-state
students, they run from $14,184 at Georgia Tech to $20,811 at
William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger's takes special note of No. 14 on its list, the
College of New Jersey in Ewing, which the magazine considers a
``gem'' in terms of cost and quality. The liberal arts college has
5,400 students; its classes are small and none are taught by
graduate assistants. Costs for nonresidents are $13,688, only
$2,830 more than what in-state residents pay. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE As the 1998 model year comes to an end, the
September issues of Kiplinger's, Money and Smart Money all examine
new-car bargains.
</P>
<P>
   The best deals, the magazines say, can be had on 1998 models
that are being discontinued or redesigned for 1999. For example,
Kiplinger's cites Nissan's discontinued 240SX and 200SX, with
sticker prices of slightly less than $19,000 and $15,000,
respectively. They are being sold with rebates or dealer incentives
of up to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   The magazines say big discounts are also found on vehicles
facing redesigns _ including the Ford Windstar and Honda Odyssey
mini-vans, as well as Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility
vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BATTER UP Smart Money gives grades, or ``batting averages,'' to
11 leading market pundits for their predictions for the first half
of 1998. Based on a complicated formula of projections and results,
the winner was Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs, with an average
of .720. Rounding out the top three were Edward Yardeni of Deutsche
Bank Securities (.634) and Edward Kerschner of Paine Webber (.632).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these scores are based on the market's performance
through June 30. Given the sharp falloff in equities since then, a
more telling score may be the one for predictions for the second
half. Stand by.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF THE CLASSROOM The September issue of Mutual Funds
magazine examines the move by the Teachers Insurance and Annuity
Association _ College Retirement Equities Fund, or TIAA-CREF, into
public mutual funds. The group's first six offerings each require a
minimum investment of $250 and are aimed at limited-budget
investors who want to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of the new funds, according to the magazine, is
that their portfolio managers have all been involved in operating
TIAA-CREF's top-rated private pension fund assets. Another is low
expenses: The annual expense ratio of each of the six new funds is
less than 0.5 percent, below the industry average.

-- Notre Dame's once-pristine reputation has been battered by a
lawsuit filed by Joe Moore, a former assistant coach, that featured
sordid testimony about its football program. Mike Rosenthal, an
offensive lineman, claims the summer's controversies have not
distracted the players. ``The trial has never been a factor,'' says
Rosenthal, a captain who testified on behalf of his former
offensive line coach, Moore, at the trial. (Joe Raymond/New York

-- Lucian Truscott IV's new novel, ``Full Dress Gray,'' like his
1978 mystery, ``Dress Gray,'' is a steamy potboiler set at the
United States Military Academy in West Point. Surprisingly, the
academy has eagerly embraced the book. ``I thought I would never be
welcome up there again,'' says Truscott, who graduated from the
academy in 1969. ``Now they're in the process of milling a whole
new red carpet to run out for me.'' (Kim Kulish/New York Times

Catskills. (Suzanne DeChillo/New York Times Photo)

Croquet, or ``gate ball,'' is the game of the moment among elderly

war and there is no time for niceties. Harsh language is common.

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Less than three months ago, Matt Fong was little
known outside California, where he was state treasurer. Now,
Republican heavyweights like Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott regard
him as a new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Since he narrowly won the Republican nomination in June to
oppose Sen. Barbara Boxer in the fall, Fong has pulled virtually
even with her in the polls, giving Republican leaders new reason to
believe they can gain five Senate seats for a filibuster-proof
majority of 60.
</P>
<P>
   It is an alarming predicament for a Democratic incumbent at a
time when the economy is strong and voter dissatisfaction is not
the overwhelming issue it was four years ago. Yet the most recent
statewide polls show that Boxer is in for a fight. In May, the
latest poll by the Field Institute, a nonpartisan organization,
showed that she held only a slim advantage over Fong, 47 percent to
43 percent, a statistical tie. In late July, a San Francisco
Examiner poll found Boxer leading by just 43 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer has the most partisan image of any elected
official in California,'' said Mark DiCamillo director of the Field
poll. ``At this stage, it's a yes-or-no vote on her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the so-called ``year of the woman'' in Washington,
Boxer won a close race over Bruce Herschensohn, with 48 percent of
the vote. She has been consistently regarded as one of the most
liberal senators and, as such, has been a champion of abortion
rights and gun control. She is also a strong and steady supporter
of President Clinton, and her daughter, Nicole, is married to
Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials like that and the possibility Clinton could be
damaged by the Monica Lewinsky matter have persuaded Republicans to
view Sen. Boxer as one of several Democratic incumbents who might
be especially vulnerable this year. They are also why Gingrich, the
House speaker, has traveled to California to appear with Fong, and
other ranking Republicans are scheduled to follow, including Lott,
the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong, 44, a lawyer and former Air Force officer, is
predicting that after Labor Day, when Californians start focusing
on the fall elections, he will attract support for reasons beyond
Boxer's approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, carries a well-known name in California politics, not
only as state treasurer since 1995, but as the son of March Fong
Eu, a Democrat who was elected five times over 24 years as
California's secretary of state. Her popularity could help Fong win
critical swing voters like Reagan Democrats who live outside the
traditional liberal strongholds of Los Angeles County and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She could also help him with Asian-Americans, who are about 5
percent of the electorate in California and tend to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Fong would be the first Chinese-American in the Senate since
Hiram Fong, who is not related, represented Hawaii from 1959
through 1976, and the first Asian-American to represent California
since S.I. Hayakawa served one term through 1982.
</P>
<P>
   `'I'm not starting from scratch,'' Fong said in an interview,
alluding to his mother.. ``The Fong name has been on the state
ballot since 1974, so it's not a new brand name. It's no different
than if someone passes down a family drugstore that had a
reputation for integrity. My mother had the same reputation for her
integrity in public service.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The election in which Fong won the Republican nomination was
California's first open primary, and Asian-American voters played
an important role in his slim victory, 22 percent to 20 percent,
over Darrell Issa, a wealthy businessman. A poll of voters in San
Francisco found that 90 percent of Asian-Americans voted for a
Democrat in the gubernatorial primary and almost as many also voted
for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Claudine Cheng, a former vice chairman of the San Francisco
Democratic Committee, referred to a ``hostile, anti-Asian political
environment,'' arising from the indictments of several
Asian-Americans on charges of campaign finance violations. She said
of the city's Asian-Americans: ``Most people are inclined to help
Matt Fong. It's important to see one of our own do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong is counting on his expertise as a fiscal manager, his
strong support for the military and his conservative social views
to convince voters that the values he holds are closer to the
mainstream than those held by Boxer, whom he describes as a
political extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer points to Fong's opposition to gun control, campaign
finance reform and laws that protect the environment to
characterize him as the out-of-touch extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat I face is not Matt Fong; it is but voter
apathy,'' she said Thursday, predicting that a higher turnout would
help her. ``I said even before I knew who my opponent would be that
this was going to be a race decided by two to five points. That's
the way it always is in California; the state is pretty much evenly
divided along party lines. But I think the more I'm compared to him
on the issues, the better I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Fong's strategy is to plow ahead with what he calls
a common-sense approach to issues, particularly those involving
budgets and economics. He said that his fiscal skills, honed by
managing the state investment portfolio of $32 billion, would serve
the nation well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, I move anywhere from $200 million to $2
billion,'' he said of his job as treasurer. ``You take a look at
the challenges facing the country in the short and medium term,
like Medicaid and tax reform. As the chief financial officer of the
seventh-largest economy in the world, I have a far different
perspective than my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his highest priorities, Fong includes increased spending
on the military, a flat income tax and a closer balance between
environmental and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that voters are not yet focusing on key issues, he
said he could encounter problems when they do. Unlike Boxer, 57, a
native of Brooklyn who moved to California in 1965, he is not
particularly animated on the stump. On a recent night, walking the
grounds of the Stanislaus County Fair in Turlock, Calif., he seldom
stopped to greet voters or engage them in conversation. Delivering
speeches or talking casually, he sounds more rehearsed than
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides say he will loosen up soon and flash the
personable side that they say they see all the time. But for now,
Fong does not seem bothered by any stylistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as my wife thinks I have charisma, I'm OK,'' he said.
``I just want voters to think I'm competent.''

ANALYSIS: FERRARO, BANKING ON POLLS, PLAYS IT SAFE AS
FRONT-RUNNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ With politicians, it is usually wiser to watch what
they are doing rather than listen to what they are saying. From
that perspective, there is not much mystery these days about
Geraldine Ferraro's strategy as she runs for the Senate Democratic
nomination. Her public assertions notwithstanding, she is following
the unadventurous approach of a self-presumed front-runner, doing
as little as she can to spill the soup.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent Wednesday night at the candidate's second
debate in Albany. Ferraro all but vanished in her chair, offering
familiar positions and endorsements of Democratic doctrine, as her
opponents, Rep. Charles Schumer and New York City Public Advocate
Mark Green, traded attention-grabbing proposals and quotes. And it
has been obvious in her relatively light public schedule, which
attests to the low-altitude campaign she is flying.
</P>
<P>
   This approach _ take few chances, hit the right Democratic
buttons, float above any fighting among her opponents _ is, on one
level, unsurprising. Assuming that the public and private polls
Ferraro is relying on are correct (not a small assumption in the
notoriously unpredictable world of New York primary voters), there
is little reason for her to do anything unconventional or daring
before the Sept. 15 primary.
</P>
<P>
   But there are potential risks in Ferraro's relatively complacent
approach. Notwithstanding her obvious popularity and political
fame, she finds herself in a contest that promises to be
distinguished by the sophisticated political skills and sheer
hunger of all her major opponents, from Green and Schumer now to
D'Amato in November.
</P>
<P>
   All three men are dogged, wily and unceasingly energetic, with
their dusk-to-dawn attentions focused on winning the Senate race.
Their level of excitement only serves to highlight what strikes
some Democrats, by comparison, as Ferraro's lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   To further complicate matters for Ferraro, she is facing in
Schumer and D'Amato opponents with enormous financial resources.
Ferraro's aides believe she only has enough money to afford two
weeks of advertising at the end of the primary; Schumer and D'Amato
have been advertising on television almost since the start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when Ferraro replaced her campaign manager amid
signs of difficulty with her candidacy, she said the change in
staff signaled a new phase in her race, in which she would
aggressively seek to counter concerns among some Democrats that she
was taking the nomination for granted. And Thursday, during a quick
campaign hop to this city across the Hudson River from Albany, she
said she was aggressively discussing education and health care and
``talking to voters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still ahead by double digits, so I'm just going to sit and
do what I have to do, which is to speak to the issues and come and
meet with people,'' Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her campaign activities, which have in recent days
consisted mostly of shaking hands at subway stations, have been
dwarfed by those of her rivals. Green, for example, gave a
different speech almost every day this week, while Schumer
continues to flood television with advertisements. In one revealing
afternoon earlier this week, Schumer, Green and D'Amato all showed
up at the steps of City Hall in New York for news conferences.
Ferraro went to a subway station that day.
</P>
<P>
   In following this route, Ferraro and her advisers are embracing
polls that have led them to conclude that, whatever bumps she might
hit in the weeks ahead, she is the overwhelming favorite to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, that is not an unreasonable conclusion. Ferraro is
clearly popular, and starts with the instant advantage of having
been the first woman nominated by a major party to run for vice
president and having worked as a commentator on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   But annointing oneself the front-runner is a tricky business.
For one thing, taking an accurate measure of Democratic primary
voters in New York _ where it is hard to determine who is going to
vote _ is so difficult that some pollsters do not even bother
trying.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ferraro in fact lost a U.S. Senate bid in 1992,
however narrowly, in a field that many Democrats believe was not so
strong as this one. And in any event, New York voters have tended
to look more kindly on underdogs than favorites, as New York City
Mayor Edward Koch learned when he ran for governor in 1982, losing
the Democratic nomination to Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there is arguably a difference between avoiding the
crossfire, as the former television debater did Wednesday night,
and saying something that might stir the interests of voters. There
is something to be said for playing it safe, but Ferraro's
opponents are running the kind of campaigns that tend to interest
voters, which can matter in a primary where turnout is low. Voters
seem to notice and reward evidence that a politician is truly
interested in their vote _ no one, for example, campaigns more
energetically and relentlessly than Bill Clinton or Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing her debate performance Thursday, Ferraro said that
she accomplished precisely what she intended. Her ``sole goal,''
she said, was making her case to the New York State Public
Employees Federation, which sponsored the event, and thus winning
its support. ``I felt comfortable when I walked out that I had done
my part _ that I gave them, I think, sufficient grounds to vote an
endorsement for me,'' Ferraro said.
</P>
<P>
   But two hours later, the federation announced that it would be
supporting Schumer in the Democratic primary.

STOUTMIRE OUT FRONT IN RACE TO START AT FREE SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Omar Stoutmire might never start in a Pro
Bowl, as have some of his predecessors who have played free safety
for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And the second-year player might never be compared to the likes
of Mel Renfro and Cliff Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he would be the starting free safety in the Cowboys' defense
if the season were to begin today, defensive coordinator Dave Campo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stoutmire's two years of experience, Campo said, and his
run-support ability give him an advantage over former cornerback
Kenny Wheaton and veteran George Teague, his main competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo warns that the opener is still 23 days away. Stoutmire
must improve his ballhawking abilities to earn a start against the
Arizona Cardinals on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no guarantees one way or the other,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the competition at the position, left open by
the off-season departure of free agent Brock Marion, is one of the
fiercest in training camp. Stoutmire, in his second season, has
more snaps with the first team, but Wheaton and Teague bring their
own credentials to the Cowboys' defense.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton has shown the best coverage skills in camp. Teague, who
appears to be running third-string based on the number of
repetitions he has taken, is a proven playmaker. In his last stint
with the Cowboys in 1996, Teague forced two fumbles and returned an
interception for a touchdown in the Cowboys' last playoff victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm gnashing my teeth, lying awake at night
wondering what are we going to do,'' Campo said. ``We've got three
good football players. Whichever one starts, we'll be in good
shape. And then we'll have a good second guy, and a good third
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong safety Darren Woodson has an obvious interest in who will
be his running mate this year. He was Marion's teammate from
1993-97, and he depended on Marion to improve his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still blow \Rassignments\S and have bad reads, so I need
somebody that can help me get better as a player,'' Woodson, a
three-time All Pro, said. ``Brock and I competed in everything _
one-on-one drills, interceptions, passes defensed, big hits. It
didn't matter. Brock made me better because we pushed each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoutmire showed flashes of his potential to fit in the Cowboys'
defense during his rookie season. He played in all 16 games and
started twice, registering 13 tackles against the Eagles in his
first start and 17 tackles against the Oilers in his second start.
Stoutmire showed good timing on the blitz with two sacks in the
season. He had two interceptions, forced two fumbles and had 76
tackles _ which was seventh among NFL rookies.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Stoutmire's production in 1997 came as a nickel back
and at strong safety. Thus, there are no questions about his
hitting ability. But he said he has not quite mastered the mental
challenge that comes with being a free safety, which is charged
with directing the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big mental game,'' said Stoutmire, who holds his
fingers about 11/2 inches apart to describe how thick the defensive
playbook is. ``I'm just trying to get more comfortable with what we
are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Stoutmire, Wheaton is also in his second year. But Wheaton
has the least experience at free safety. He was an All Pac-10
cornerback at the University of Oregon, coached by former Cowboys
safety Charlie Waters. He was the fifth cornerback with the Cowboys
in 1997, behind Deion Sanders, Kevin Smith, Kevin Mathis and
Wendell Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton's skills as a cornerback have helped him in coverage,
Campo said. But Wheaton's 5-foot-10, 190-pound stature has been a
challenge in run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing for me is getting better at coming up, taking on the
big running back and being able to hit him and let him know that
I'm really there,'' Wheaton said. ``That will come from me getting
stronger in the weight room and working on my tackling
techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   In Teague, the Cowboys have a veteran of six years who spent
last year struggling in Miami. He started the final 10 games of the
1996 season with the Cowboys when Marion was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wheaton, ``tackling is the area that George needs to work
hardest on,'' Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Teague said his problem stems from technique, and from being
overly aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to make something happen to often instead of
just making the tackle,'' Teague said. ``I want to get the kill
shot, with the oohs and aahs. But I've come to realize that I don't
have to tear a guy's head off. I just need to get the guy down.''

CANADIAN REGULATORS INVESTIGATE LIVENT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian securities regulators said Thursday that they are
investigating the accounting problems at Livent Inc., the
Toronto-based company that brought the hit musicals ``Ragtime'' and
``Showboat'' to Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating the allegations the company has made,''
said Larry Waite, director of enforcement at the Ontario Securities
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington,
regulators said that as a matter of policy, they could not confirm
or deny whether they might be proceeding with a similar
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Livent said that the company _ whose shares
trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange and on the Nasdaq market in the
United States _ was cooperating with regulatory officials.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Livent's new management announced that an internal
investigation had found serious accounting problems involving
millions of dollars. The new managers, led by Michael Ovitz, the
former Hollywood power broker, said that they were suspending Garth
Drabinsky, Livent's chief creative director, and Myron Gottlieb, a
vice president, as a result of their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials have said that they are ``virtually certain''
that the company's financial results dating back to 1996 will have
to be restated.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's shares have not traded since the company disclosed the
problems.

WITH CEREMONY, NEW YORK STARTS USING PART OF A WATER TUNNEL BEGUN
IN 1970 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Third Water Tunnel seems timeless. In 1954, city
officials determined that it was needed, and in 1970 construction
began on what has long been billed as the biggest public works
project in America.
</P>
<P>
   There are men who have retired after spending every one of their
working days on the tunnel. City officials now expect that the
tunnel will be finished around 2020 and cost $5.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, it was expected that New Yorkers would not taste
water from the tunnel until it was completed. The Giuliani
administration decided about 15 months ago, though, that the
finished 13.5-mile segment, which was actually completed in 1993,
could be used as soon as some tests were completed.
</P>
<P>
   So in the summer heat Thursday, they paused to celebrate _ and
taste _ what they have accomplished so far.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony at the Central Park Reservoir, they also honored
those who have died during the construction. Altogether, the
legendary tunnel has claimed 24 lives, counting actual tunnel
diggers (called sandhogs), engineers, inspectors and one child who
fell into a shaft.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor Rudolph Giuliani read each of the names in alphabetical
order, a sandhog stepped forward and rang a gold-colored bell.
There were 24 single rings. The mayor also recited two sayings that
are commonly used to describe the danger of the work: the death
rate works out to about one a mile, and one a year.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Miele Sr., commissioner of the Department of Environmental
Protection, said the accident rate was no worse than at other
construction sites, but he did mention some of the details of the
underground workplace. He said that heavy dust swirled incessantly,
that the noise was terrible and that workers could be trapped by
fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be industrial accidents,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Miele said the first section of the 14-foot-diameter tunnel cost
$1 billion. It runs from Hillview Reservoir north of New York City,
through the Bronx and into Manhattan, across Central Park, under
the East River and Roosevelt Island, and into Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was his decision to reverse the original plan and
open this portion before the other three stages are finished. There
was no reason not to add to available water supplies in the Bronx
and northern Manhattan, he said. The new tunnel also makes it
possible to close one of the other two tunnels for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever portion of it we can use we should be using,'' he
said.

PALMER AHEAD IN BACKUP BATTLE

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's been no official word, but freshman quarterback Carson
Palmer appears to be making major strides toward becoming USC's
No.2 quarterback as coach Paul Hackett nears a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very impressed with No.15,'' Hackett said,
identifying Palmer by uniform number. ``He's got poise beyond his
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he would like to decide on a No.2 quarterback after
the weekend, and Palmer has been impressive in practices this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make what will not be an easy decision,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he will use freshmen only to play extensively and
not in a mop-up capacity.
</P>
<P>
   With both Palmer and freshman Jason Thomas vying for playing
time, Hackett said redshirting both ``would be a real reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a surprise, sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst will be the
Trojans' starter in the season opener against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes debuts: Wide receiver Windrell Hayes attended his first
practice, one day after receiving three years' probation and being
ordered to pay an $8,490.13 fine for writing bad checks.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes participated in some light drills and worked out
individually with wide receivers coach Mike Wilson because he must
practice his first three days without pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the court case, that's over with and I'm glad to be
here,'' Hayes said. ``I'm glad USC gave me a chance. I'm looking
forward to starting over. I figured everybody makes a mistake. I
was just hoping to get a second chance.''
</P>
<P>
   USC insisted that Hayes pay the fine by obtaining a formal loan
through a Stockton bank to avoid the appearance of breaking NCAA
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Before he practiced, Hayes met with Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of reviewed things. He needs to put all that
behind him. He'll get a clean slate,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who played two years at San Jose State before attending
San Joaquin Delta Community College, said he originally considered
attending USC out of high school. But poor grades and a fear of
leaving home helped keep him near his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left (San Jose State) because I thought I could do a lot
more,'' Hayes said. ``I didn't think I could reach my potential at
that school.''
</P>
<P>
   First day in contact: USC practiced in pads for the first time
on Thursday, and Hackett was pleased with the results. ``I thought
it was a solid first day. There was great enthusiasm (in the
morning practice) and we settled into learning and teaching in the
afternoon. From what we wanted, I feel OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Larry Parker left the field in the afternoon, but
was suffering only cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise appearance: Among the visitors on Thursday was former
USC quarterback Todd Marinovich.

No. 7 FINE FOR NOW 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Football coaches usually treat preseason rankings
with either disdain or indifference. But not Bruins coach Bob
Toledo, not this year. After learning last season that the higher
you start, the higher you can finish, Toledo welcomed UCLA's No.7
ranking in the preseason coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told our people that it's hard to come from 35th (to the
top),'' Toledo said. ``It's a lot easier if you start in the top
10.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins began the 1997 season unranked, lost to Washington
State and Tennessee, then rode a 10-game winning streak all the way
to No.5. But because of the low (and slow) start, they ran out of
time. They could climb only so high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, (the No.7 ranking) shows respect for our
program,'' Toledo said. ``Now we have to go out and earn that
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press preseason poll will be released Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Going fast: Combine the winning streak with a top-rated
recruiting class and a Heisman Trophy candidate, and the result is
a record jump in season ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have sold 29,000 season tickets, or 3,500 more than
last year at this time. The 14 percent jump is the largest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had 400-500 calls a day to the ticket office since Aug.
1,'' ticket manager Scott Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are shipping one million schedule cards to area Taco
Bells. They have hundreds of billboards around L.A. sporting a
``Heismania'' theme, with a picture of quarterback Cade McNown's
head and arm.
</P>
<P>
   In other ticket-related news, associate athletic director Rick
Purdy has received complaints from ``less than 1 percent'' of
season-ticket holders since they were informed of the new seating
chart.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of individual seats, with flip-up bottoms, has
reduced Rose Bowl attendance from 100,000 to 93,000 and forced the
Bruins to reconfigure their seating.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead: The Bruins have replaced Pittsburgh with Fresno
State on their 1999 schedule, and not by choice. In April, the
Panthers reneged on a nine-year-old written agreement for a
home-and-home series in '99 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State will visit the Rose Bowl next Sept. 18. There is no
return game scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd rather have a home-and-home with someone,'' said
media-relations director Marc Dellins, who handles the scheduling.
``But it was on such short notice.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA also needs an opponent for Sept. 9, 2000 _ a delicate slot
because it falls between dates with Alabama and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Early accolades: At least four Bruins figure to contend for
postseason awards. McNown is a Heisman Trophy and Davey O'Brien
candidate. Safety Larry Atkins (Jim Thorpe Award), kicker Chris
Sailer (Lou Groza) and offensive tackle Kris Farris (Outland
Trophy) are on preliminary lists, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule: UCLA's heralded freshman class makes its first
official appearance Tuesday morning with a workout at Spaulding
Field. The veterans report Aug. 20, and training camp opens Aug. 21
with non-contact practices at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.

CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS FREE HOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A potential drug scandal, coinciding with the
approach of a major race, has thrown Del Mar horseplayers an
unwanted challenge this week.
</P>
<P>
   How to assess Free House, a contender in the $1 million Pacific
Classic on Saturday, in light of unconfirmed evidence the 1997
Santa Anita Derby winner had performance-enhancing clenbuterol in
his system during an impressive victory the last time he raced?
</P>
<P>
   Horseplayers love a puzzle. What we hate is a guessing game.
This is a guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   Clenbuterol, a bronchial dilator that is thought to have a
quasi-steroidal effect on horses, was detected in Free House's
urine following the colt's seven-length victory over Wild Wonder in
the July 11 Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of 20 horses, spread among seven trainers, to have
positive tests for clenbuterol following races at Hollywood Park,
Golden Gate Fields and Cal-Expo between May 16 and July 11.
</P>
<P>
   We don't know, in the case of Free House, whether the finding
was accurate, because results of a split-sample test have yet to be
announced by the California Horse Racing Board. We also don't know,
if it was accurate, exactly how much clenbuterol was involved.
</P>
<P>
   So handicappers must ponder several possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The test was accurate, Free House raced under the influence of
massive quantities of clenbuterol administered in an attempt to
cheat or to get his handlers in trouble, and his Bel Air showing
should be downgraded.
</P>
<P>
   The test was wrong, Free House had nary a speck of the drug in
his blood, and his performance was as good as it looked.
</P>
<P>
   The test was accurate, Free House had a minuscule amount of
clenbuterol in him, the remnants of a dose administered legally
before a training run, a quantity detectable by increasingly
refined lab procedures but too small to help him.
</P>
<P>
   The test was wrong, Free House had nothing in him during the
race, but ran faster because of the benefits of training on
clenbuterol, and has since stopped training on the drug because his
handlers are wary of tripping the test again.
</P>
<P>
   The test was accurate, Free House had clenbuterol in him that
hadn't cleared his system, and he continues to use it in training,
meaning he could test positive after the Pacific Classic, becoming
a modern-day Dancer's Image, the horse disqualified for a drug
violation after winning the 1968 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the middle three are more likely than the first and
last of those scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Free House trainer Paco Gonzalez has publicly denied using
clenbuterol, which is prohibited in horses at race time but has
been permitted in training since the Food and Drug Administration
legalized possession in May. Gonzalez would face suspension and
owners Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan would face the loss of the
Bel Air purse if the positive test were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, McCaffery and Toffan did not appear on Wednesday at
the Pacific Classic post-position drawing and press conference,
where they would have faced questions about the implications for
this race.
</P>
<P>
   And so a cloud hangs over Del Mar's biggest race, in which Free
House is a solid 3-1 on the morning line as he and jockey Chris
McCarron face the 6-5 entry of Gentlemen and Puerto Madero, 8-5
Touch Gold and five others at 1\ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a cloud hangs over all of the trainers and horses facing
clenbuterol charges. Whose victories are legitimate, and whose was
chemically induced? This is why medication rules are important,
because fans have to believe the form upon which they base their
wagers is reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best solution for this week is the one suggested by
Jeff Siegel, the syndicated handicapper and thoroughbred owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the whole mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to evaluate Free House based on last year rather
than on the basis of the Bel Air,'' Siegel said, referring to the
gray colt's in-the-money performances in all three Triple Crown
races, and his subsequent third-place finish against Touch Gold in
the Haskell Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to hold it against him. I'm not going to pick
him. But that's just because the other three horses are better.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The undercard: &LR;  The Pacific Classic day card, starting at 12:30
p.m., features one other important race and Del Mar management's
guarantee that the pick-six pool will be at least $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7-furlong Pat O'Brien Handicap, Son of a Pistol, ridden
by Alex Solis, will try to become the first sprinter in recent
memory to reel off four consecutive victories in Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   The Pat O'Brien will be the fourth race. The Pacific Classic
will be the seventh at 3:42 p.m. &QL;

MCIVER STATEMENT DELAYED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ The statement that was to be issued by
Cowboys guard Everett McIver will be postponed until later this
week, team owner Jerry Jones said. McIver was expected to issue the
statement yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   McIver is expected to speak on several subjects, including his
relationship with teammate Michael Irvin and his future with the
Cowboys. He is also expected to address a news report that Jones
negotiated a deal with Irvin to pay McIver for his silence about a
July 29 incident that left McIver with a cut on his neck. Sources
have said Irvin inflicted the wound to McIver with a pair of
scissors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him \RMcIver\S to say something before the end of
training camp,'' Jones said.
Davis to get start
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said yesterday that Billy Davis will
get the start at No. 2 receiver in Monday's American Bowl game
against the New England Patriots in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-year veteran Ernie Mills, whom the Cowboys signed as a
free-agent in the off-season, had been listed as the starter since
the beginning of training camp because of his experience and
knowledge of Gailey's offense. Mills played under Gailey when both
were in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, however, has not caught a pass in the Cowboys' two
preseason games, while Davis has notched four receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he is not unhappy with Mills' performance, but he
thinks Davis deserves a chance to show what he can do with the
first team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy deserves a chance to start,'' Gailey said. ``We haven't
been unhappy with Ernie. But they are close enough where Billy
deserves a chance. We want to see how he'll react.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has been mainly a special-teams player since making
the Cowboys team four years ago as a undrafted free agent, plans to
make the most of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I've been waiting for a long time,'' Davis
said. ``I'm going to do the best I can.''
Mexico City field a concern
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the league is already checking into the quality of
the playing field for Monday's game against the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cowboys played the Oilers in a 1994 game in Mexico
City, the field looked like a swamp.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said a poor playing surface could increase the risk of
injury and reduce the playing time of his star players, but he said
right now he is just going to wait and see until he gets there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's dangerous, you got to be smart about it,'' Gailey
said. ``There is supposed to be some better precautions this year,
keep it covered and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he will likely limit his starters to just a quarter
of playing time before increasing their workload in preseason
matchup against the Rams Aug. 22.
Helmsley earning spot
</P>
<P>
   Gailey all but guaranteed reserve linebacker Nate Helmsley a
spot on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Helmsley, who played on the Cowboys practice squad
for much of last year before being called up late in the season,
has separated himself from the other linebacker hopefuls behind
starters Randall Godfrey, Dexter Coakley and Fred Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate has really played well,'' Gailey said. ``He has had a
good training camp. He has played well on defense and on special
teams. The guys after him are vying for positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the team could keep as many as seven linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   Another linebacker catching the coach's eye is rookie free agent
Robert Thomas. At 6-foot-1, 255-pounds, Thomas is not the
prototypical middle linebacker, but he makes plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He makes a lot of plays,'' Gailey said. ``You got to give him
credit for the things he's doing on the field.''
Waiting for Prime Time
</P>
<P>
   Even though Deion Sanders' long-awaited move to wide receiver
has been postponed by another injury, Gailey refuses to give up on
the possibility of using the speedy cornerback on offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time I talk about it, he gets hurt so I'm
going to quit talking about it and maybe he'll stay healthy,''
Gailey said. ``But I don't think we'll ever give up on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey, who couldn't play Sanders on offense during June
minicamp because he'd had ankle surgery, had hoped to finally
indoctrinate Sanders to the new offense over the next couple of
weeks. But the cornerback suffered a rib injury against the Saints
and is not expected to be available until the Sept. 6
regular-season opener against Arizona.

KIRALY STILL A FORCE ON BEACH TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DANA HADDAD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH _ Karch Kiraly is four tournament championships
away from tying fellow UCLA alumnus Sinjin Smith as the most
successful player in the history of professional beach volleyball
in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly and partner Adam Johnson are top-seeded entering today's
Miller Lite U.S. Championships at the Hermosa Beach pier, the 19th
stop on this year's Association of Volleyball Professionals Tour.
Kiraly has 135 career titles, and he and Johnson have won five this
season, including four of the past nine.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and fellow beach legends Randy Stoklos (who ranks third
with 122 championships) and Mike Dodd (fifth with 74 titles) are
not playing. But Hermosa marks the return of Tim Hovland, a 60-time
champion who retired two years ago. Hovland is playing with Wayne
Seligson.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champions Kiraly and Johnson will play their first
match at 11 a.m. against the winner of an earlier qualifying match.
Kiraly, who has earned a record $2,801,787 in prize money, holds
the tour record with seven championships at Hermosa.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 48 teams will compete for $50,000 in prize money. The
tournament, traditionally one of four AVP grand slams,paid $300,000
last year. But the AVP scaled its purse to $50,000 for all events
in 1998 to help pay off its nearly $2 million debt.
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly has reached the final 10 times and is the tour's money
leader, with over $100,000 thus far this season. But Brazilian Jose
Loiola is the AVP's top-ranked player, with seven championships
this year. He and Emmanuel Rego are seeded second. Kent Steffes,
who leads the tour with eight titles, ranks four and is seeded
third with Mike Whitmarsh.
</P>
<P>
   Action takes place from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. today and Saturday,
and 9:30 a.m. to the 3 p.m. final on Sunday. General admission is
free. Tickets for reserved courtside seats are $10 and $25.

PHOENIX ABORTION DOCTOR AGREES TO GIVE UP ARIZONA MEDICAL LICENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER AND JODIE   
 Snyder  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Phoenix abortion doctor John Biskind has agreed to
give up his Arizona medical license, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind faced a hearing next month on whether he should be
allowed to continue practicing after one of his patients bled to
death in April and he nearly aborted a full-term baby in June.
</P>
<P>
   In the agreement, reached Wednesday, Biskind admitted to
allegations made by the state about his role in both the death and
near-abortion, records show.
</P>
<P>
   His Arizona license will be revoked, and Biskind won't be
allowed to reapply.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement does not affect a pending criminal investigation
into the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Medical Examiners, which regulates the
state's doctors, will meet next week to take formal action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biskind has signed away his license,'' said Melissa Cornelius,
deputy director of the medical board.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind could not be reached for comment. His attorney declined
to say why Biskind, who initially denied the state's allegations,
entered into the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not entitled to know that,'' Lawrence Kazan said.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, 72, lives in the Cleveland area and has a winter home
in Scottsdale. Kazan would not say whether his client intends to
continue practicing medicine in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney representing the family of LouAnne Herron , who died
April 17 at the A-Z Women's Center in Phoenix, expressed relief
that Biskind won't be able to practice here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have been more pleased if he had stopped practicing
before April 17,'' said Paul Lazarus. ``We believe there was
sufficient evidence prior to April 17 for his license to be
revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   The examiners board had previously taken action against Biskind
three times. The board issued a letter of concern in 1990 after the
near-abortion of a full-term baby, a letter of concern in 1991 for
inappropriately prescribing drugs and a censure in 1996 after a
patient in his care bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 case, Biskind was admonished for gross negligence
and harmful conduct to the patient but was allowed to keep his
license.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Biskind attempted to abort a fetus that was 37 weeks
along and instead ended up delivering a baby girl. Biskind told
authorities he believed the fetus was 23 weeks along.
</P>
<P>
   The girl suffered lacerations and other injuries during the
procedure. She is reportedly being adopted by a Texas couple.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months earlier, Herron, 33, bled to death from a
punctured uterus after an abortion. State officials say that Herron
didn't get emergency medical care for more than three hours. There
was no nurse in the recovery room, and Biskind had left the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, board members called an emergency meeting and
suspended Biskind's license. Biskind faced a hearing before the
state Office of Administrative Hearings on Sept. 1 to answer
allegations about the death and the near-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, if the board agrees to the revocation, the
information will be forwarded to the National Practitioner Data
Bank, a database of disciplined doctors maintained by the
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio health officials have said that if Arizona revokes
Biskind's license, his Ohio license could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a criminal investigation into the death and
near-abortion is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidents are under investigation, and we're working very
closely with the county attorney to see exactly where we go from
here,'' said Phoenix police Detective Mike McCullough. ``They
(county prosecutors) will ultimately review all of the facts that
we find.''
</P>
<P>
   The A-Z Women's Center at 10th Street and McDowell Road was
closed by its owner, Moshe Hachamovitch, on Aug. 1. The New
York-based doctor also closed two other clinics in west Phoenix and
Scottsdale. &QL;

DISRUPTIONS DRAG ON FOR TIMES SQUARE'S MOST FRAGILE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three weeks after a construction scaffold collapsed,
raining debris on 43rd Street, killing a woman and forcing hundreds
of people from their homes and businesses, some semblance of
normality has been restored to Times Square. The glitter has
returned to most Broadway theaters, street-corner peddlers are
back, and the crush of traffic can once again be felt for miles.
</P>
<P>
   But 274 residents of the Woodstock Hotel _ many of them elderly,
frail, mentally ill and formerly homeless _ still cannot go home
because their building, badly damaged in the accident, has not been
deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city allowed hotel workers to search apartments
Tuesday for important belongings like eyeglasses and identification
cards, some residents say they still lack essential things.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Little needs the dentures he left sitting in a cup in the
bathroom of his tiny apartment. Gladys Lejuez needs the comfort of
home, period. Alvin Romans wants to gaze on the photograph of his
mother that is framed in a grandfather clock that chimes every
hour. And Margaret Lawson, 60, needs her Medicaid card so she can
go to the doctor to have a heart problem monitored.
</P>
<P>
   The accident has thrust many Woodstock residents back into a
life they thought they had long abandoned, forcing them to live out
of plastic bags in sterile hotel rooms. The residents are spread
out along Manhattan's West Side, and their temporary homes include
the Washington Jefferson Hotel in midtown, the McBurney YMCA in
Chelsea and The Times Square. The displacement has disrupted the
routines of people who can little afford such disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   It could be as long as three months before they can go home,
said Cynthia Dial, executive director of Project Find, a private
nonprofit social service agency that runs the 12-story Woodstock
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The stretch of 43rd Street between Times Square and Avenue of
the Americas, home to the Woodstock and the Kit Kat Klub, location
of the hit Broadway musical ``Cabaret,'' might reopen Aug. 20, said
Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management. But even that is not certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demolition process necessary for the reopening of the
street is a delicate process that could be slowed by inclement
weather,'' Ms. Mindel said. ``But we are hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident at the Conde Nast building has financially drained
Project Find, even though the Red Cross is paying to house the
residents at seven buildings around the city. Project Find is
trying to raise $350,000 to help pay for clothing, meals and
transportation costs for the tenants and for overtime pay for staff
members during the displacement, Ms. Dial said.
</P>
<P>
   But residents not only are in shock over being forced out of
their homes; they also are mourning the death of a friend. Thereza
Feliconio, 85, who lived at the Woodstock, was killed when chunks
of steel from the Conde Nast construction site crashed into her
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew her,'' said James Mills, 69. ``I'm thinking about going
back to my hometown, Albany. This is getting to be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents complain angrily that they have been ignored by
the city, saying that more noise was made about pets trapped in
apartments. They say that Liberty Mutual Group _ the insurance
company for the Durst Organization, the developer of the Conde Nast
building _ and Tishman Construction Corp., the construction manager
for the building, quibble over every little detail, making their
lives difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city has its priorities all screwed up,'' said Little, a
barrel-chested 69-year-old. ``They forgot about us. I turn on the
news and all I hear about is how some people are worried about
their pets. Now, I like pets, but what about me? I don't have any
teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Little, tired of living on food he does not have to chew, is
among 90 Woodstock residents staying at the Washington Jefferson
Hotel. Wednesday evening, many of them milled about the worn
wood-paneled corridors of the hotel, asking one another whether
they had heard any news about when they could go home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tenants are hard-bitten New York City characters,
shaped by harsh lives in the city. Some of them once were singers
or actors. Others describe themselves as former ``Bowery bums.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I owned, I left behind,'' said Ms. Lejuez, who
declined to reveal her age, saying only that she was over 30. ``I
walked out in a flowered nightgown that I threw a blouse over and
my pocketbook.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lejuez, a white-haired former cabaret and radio singer, had
trouble admitting that she had ever been homeless, and she glided
over the question like a skater over ice.
</P>
<P>
   She keeps her donated shoes and clothes in bags on top of two
chairs because she does not use hotel bureaus, she said, noting
that she had not had time to clean the drawers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been hard for me,'' she said. ``I need my things. I
even left my lipstick, which I had to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clyde Burton, 86, whose easygoing Southern manner made him seem
out of place amid the hustle of the lobby of the Washington
Jefferson Hotel, sat clutching a plastic bag of asthma medication
and blood pressure pills. Burton has lived at the Woodstock for
nine years. A Lower East Side residential center for the elderly is
named after him because of his work as a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Burton is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for 20
years, and said he used to panhandle on the streets of the Lower
East Side. He believes the scaffolding accident is payback for the
life he threw away when he was a Bowery bum.
</P>
<P>
   His voice cracked and trailed off when he said he was afraid of
losing his apartment. He was concerned about the delicate china
that had been given to him as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my past, you feel terrible,'' he said. ``I'm reaping what
I sowed. It's just hard luck, but God doesn't put no more on you
than you can bear. What can you do when you've lost everything you
have? This reminds me of the days when I didn't have nothing, when
I was wrecking myself. It's a terrible feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Romans, 69, also believes that the scaffolding accident was a
sign of his past catching up with him. He said he did time in
prison and slept on the streets of the Bowery, begging for change
to buy a pint of white port before finding religion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get down, I think about the life I used to lead,'' he
said. ``I don't have the comfort of my little apartment at the
Woodstock, but I'm not a drinking man. What I'm hoping and praying
is that I can go back and that it's not gone. It's all I have.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ Good news for the PGA Tour. Tiger Woods is
learning how to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   But oh, boy, bad news for the other PGA Tourists.
</P>
<P>
   If you must compete with him, watching Tiger sort out the
nuances of his chosen vocation is frightening to contemplate. But
if you need the Woods magic to sell your product, his growing up
before our eyes has cosmic implications.
</P>
<P>
   Clueless, Tiger won the Masters by 12 strokes last year. He
gripped, he ripped, and it was good. At 21, the kid was swooshing
to legendary status.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, there have been complications since. Augusta National's
inviting, broad-shouldered fairways don't punish a young man's
macho instincts. In contrast, on tight courses such Sahalee, where
they're contesting the PGA Championship, swinging a golf club like
Ken Griffey Jr. swings a baseball bat is a foolhardly tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger, Junior's house guest for the week, had no chance to win
this tournament, we assumed. Some of these holes, fenced in by
dark, brooding thickets of cedar and Douglas fir, can only be
described as claustrophobic. They resemble bowling lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The golfer formerly known as Eldrick was going to spend so much
time wandering lost among the trees, they would have to rename the
local forest the Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger's maturity showing
</P>
<P>
   He crossed us up big-time, though. His driver never left his
bag, and his golf balls stayed playable. Although he officially hit
just nine fairways, he rarely strayed into fatal terrain. By the
time he returned in triumph to the clubhouse, Woods had posted a
course-record 66, a feat roughly akin to Pete Sampras winning the
French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a more mature Tiger than you saw last year at this time,''
he said, comparing himself to the frustrated also-ran who futilely
winged it at Winged Foot. ``I've got more shots. I understand my
game. I understand how to hit shots when I'm not feeling well over
the ball, how to get the ball out there and just keep it in play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to be myself and hit good golf shots. Just let it
come; don't force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods commands a superb putting touch on his best days, such as
this one, when he holed six of 15 feet or longer, including a
35-footer on No. 17. It's reason enough for him to temper his
testosterone off the tee, letting his myriad subtle gifts come to
the fore. He needn't outdrive the world in order to outplay the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``Putting's the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Tiger revealed himself last month at the British
Open, where diabolical weather dictated he think his way around
Royal Birkdale or perish early. Three-quarter shots were mandatory
to avoid the howling gales blowing in off the Irish Sea, and Woods,
without being nagged, instinctively throttled down. He relied on
his head more than his club head and didn't bag his game plan even
after a discouraging, wind-whipped 77 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The net result would be a final-round 66 _ so he's in a real rut
now, isn't he? _ that left him only one shot removed from the
playoff between Mark O'Meara and Brian Watts. It's the closest he
has come to winning a second major and the best indication, at
least until Thursday, that he will win a bunch of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great change in the way he plays,'' his coach, Butch
Harmon, said after the British. ``Tiger is working hard to lower
his trajectory. He switched to a graphite-shafted driver because it
makes his balls fly a little lower. We've done things not just for
here but so he can control his distance all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still learning at 22
</P>
<P>
   It's a growth process, or ``evolution,'' as Tiger calls it, with
which every callow golfer copes to some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about learning how to play golf,'' Woods said. ``Ask
players in their teens or early 20s. They hit the ball pretty hard.
As they get older, they figure out how to manage their games.''
</P>
<P>
   And the better the game, the more it needs managing. What hurts
Tiger is his own perceived lack of limitations. He believes he can
do anything, with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, despite our perception that he has been mired in some
terrible slump, he has six top-four finishes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And he's No. 1 in the world rankings _ at 22 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not bad,'' Woods said. ``I've been right there in all
the majors. I'm pretty close to putting it all together and being
in the hunt where I could legitimately win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accepted the fact that I've played well and just come up
a little short. But I've given it everything I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   By, strangely enough, not giving it everything he's got. Less
can be more. In the process of growing up, it's a lesson we're all
forced to learn sooner or later.

STUDY FINDS HOW GENE'S DEFECTS CAUSE BREAST CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists at the University of North Carolina have made an
important discovery about how defects in one of the two breast
cancer genes, BRCA1, raise the risk of the disease: They leave
cells without the normal ability to correct certain mistakes that
commonly occur in their genetic machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists and experts elsewhere say the finding has potentially
important clinical implications for people known to carry the
defective gene in their cells. On the one hand, it could result in
more effective treatments for hereditary breast cancer. It could
also lead to a test that would predict which of the women and men
who carry the defective gene are most likely to develop cancer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new understanding raises questions about
the safety of starting at a young age to do regular mammograms in
women who inherit the defective gene.
</P>
<P>
   The new information, reported in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, will add to the understanding of how cancer starts and
what might be done to prevent it. The lead author of the study,
Lori Gowen, a graduate student, said, ``This is the first direct
evidence of a function for this tumor-suppressor gene, and it helps
to explain how the gene may be involved in cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, done in specially altered cells derived from a mouse,
showed that the BRCA1 gene directly or indirectly participates in a
process called transcription-coupled repair, a rapid means of
correcting mistakes that occur in the DNA of other genes.
</P>
<P>
   When people make a mistake writing with a pencil, they use an
eraser, on the typewriter they use white-out and on the computer,
the delete button. When an error occurs in the DNA of a gene, cells
rely on an error-specific repair mechanism to knock out the errant
information.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's report, Ms. Gowen, Dr. Steven Leadon and colleagues
report that the normal task of BRCA1, one of the two genes known to
be involved in hereditary cancers of the breast and ovary, is to
repair DNA damage caused by oxidation, a process that occurs
continually in the body in the course of normal metabolism and that
can also result from exposure to outside agents like radiation.
</P>
<P>
   When BRCA1 is defective, it is unable to repair oxidative DNA
damage, the most common insult to the genetic material of cells
throughout the body. A defective BRCA1 gene is responsible for
about 5 percent of all breast cancers and can affect men as well as
women in families with hereditary breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   An accumulation of genetic damage to the DNA is how overexposure
to sunlight can cause skin cancer and an overdose of radiation from
X-rays can cause cancer in internal tissues like the thyroid gland.
When oxidative damage occurs in genes that determine cell growth
and when the mechanism that normally repairs such damage fails to
work properly, the cell is no longer able to keep its growth in
check and a malignant tumor results.
</P>
<P>
   There are already several other cancers that have been linked to
genes that have lost their ability to repair defective DNA. Skin
cancers commonly occur in people with the rare hereditary disorder,
xeroderma pigmentosum, after exposure to sunlight. Another is a
rare hereditary form of colon cancer, hereditary nonpolyposis colon
cancer, or Lynch syndrome, in which a defective repair gene fails
to correct a mismatch in the DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins
University who unraveled the defect involved in the colon cancer
gene, said that someone who carried a defective BRCA gene started
out with both a normal and a defective version of the gene in each
cell. But when a particular mutation occurs in the normal BRCA gene
in breast or ovarian tissue, the pace of DNA repair changes from
that of a sprint to a slow crawl. This allows mistakes to
accumulate that may eventually result in the uncontrolled growth of
a tumor.
</P>
<P>
   But Vogelstein also suggested that an inability to rapidly
repair oxidative damage might prove to be a tumor's Achilles heel
and lead to new improved therapies. The defect suggests, he said,
that these tumors ``are likely to be extremely sensitive'' to
therapeutic radiation or to chemotherapy drugs that cause oxidative
damage. Tumor cells would be hit harder by such treatment than
normal cells, which would still have one normal copy of the BRCA
gene that could correct oxidative damage induced by the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Leadon, a molecular biologist who studies how damaged DNA is
repaired, suggested another benefit: the possibility of determining
who has a defect in BRCA1 that ``would lead to an inability to
carry out oxidative repair.'' He said that ``BRCA1 is a very large
gene that probably has multiple functions and can have mutations
that are not important.'' Leadon added that the new finding ``will
help us determine which mutations are important,'' which could
eventually lead to a test that revealed who would be most likely to
get cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Henry Lynch, an oncologist and expert on hereditary
cancers at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., suggested that the
new finding could prove to be ``a double-edged sword of Damocles.''
Lynch said that if a woman known to carry one defective BRCA1 gene
was subjected to repeated mammograms, say, starting at the age of
25, the X-rays would help detect an early, more curable breast
cancer, but at the same time the cumulative exposure to radiation
might increase her risk of developing a cancer.

AIDES SAY CLINTON WEIGHS ADMITTING SEXUAL CONTACTS 
</HEADLINE>

A. Lewis and David E. Sanger and was written by Berke.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has had extensive discussions
with his inner circle about a strategy of acknowledging to a grand
jury on Monday that he had intimate sexual encounters with Monica
Lewinsky in the White House, senior advisers have said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has not settled on this approach, discussions
have centered on a plan that would allow him to acknowledge a
specific type of sexual behavior while still maintaining he told
the truth when he testified in January that he never had ``sexual
relations'' with the former White House intern, the advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would say he based his previous denial, in a deposition
in the Paula Jones lawsuit, on a definition of sex approved by the
judge in the case. His advisers believe this definition does not
cover certain activities, including oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Clinton has publicly denied any sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. So an acknowledgment of some kind of sexual
encounter poses considerable political risk, particularly if it
were linked to a legal argument that rests on a narrow definition
of sex.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's advisers have said that telling anything less than
the truth to a grand jury about sex with Ms. Lewinsky poses an even
greater risk. It is not clear how precisely Clinton has described
his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton settles on what to say to the grand jury on Monday,
he must decide whether, and how, to explain his testimony to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   Several Clinton advisers said there is a consensus that Clinton
should speak out publicly, perhaps in a brief televised speech,
after he testifies. Several advisers said the feeling is that the
president's testimony will somehow be leaked to the public anyway,
so he should portray it from his point of view, which would oblige
him to offer some specifics about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers cautioned that preparations for the grand jury
appearance are continuing and strategy could still change as the
president continues to examine the legal and political implications
of various courses.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that some of the president's advisers are discussing
his possible approaches with reporters to gauge the political
reaction. The president has been severely limited in his ability to
take political soundings, because anyone he talks to other than his
private lawyers and his wife is vulnerable to subpoenas from
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial discussions have been confined to a small group
of advisers, all of whom have some recognized privilege that may be
invoked against prosecutors seeking to learn of their advice. They
include Clinton's wife, his lawyers Mickey Kantor, former Secretary
of Commerce, and David E. Kendall, along with other lawyers in
Kendall's firm of Williams &AMP; Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the president's advisers review his options, some have
prefaced their remarks by saying that it is still possible that
Clinton will say again, as he has publicly, that he never had
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, a senior political adviser to the president,
declined on Thursday to discuss Clinton's legal options. ``We're
not going to speculate on the latest theory of what the president
is going to testify to,'' he said. ``As the president said just the
other day, he will testify completely and truthfully.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to navigate the most politically and legally
perilous moment of his presidency, the argument for a public
explanation of some sort reflects the sense of many politicians
that the country wants to see an end to the Lewinsky saga.
Democrats and Republicans alike have suggested that even a mild and
delicately worded confession from the president might reduce the
threat of impeachment hearings based on a report to Congress from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the strategy of acknowledging some sexual activities
with Ms. Lewinsky succeeds in inoculating Clinton from perjury
problems, he may face other legal shoals. Starr's grand jury has
also been investigating whether Clinton may have obstructed justice
if he discussed with Ms. Lewinsky ways that she could conceal a
relationship with the president and avoid having to produce gifts
that he gave her when she testified in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton testifies on Monday, what else he should say is a
subject of considerable debate. Some aides have argued that Clinton
could blunt the political repercussions by offering the public at
least a brief explanation of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
Other Clinton advisers, including some outside the White House,
have argued that he should say as little as possible about his
testimony _ that he should not do much more than smile and announce
that he is leaving on vacation.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An option that is increasingly being considered would be for the
president to testify that he was telling the truth last January
when he followed a precise definition of sexual relations that the
presiding judge had approved in the Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit. Under that definition, some advisers believe, Clinton
could plausibly assert that his contacts with Ms. Lewinsky did not
constitute sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to deal with Clinton's testimony in the Jones
case in January is such a critical matter that Kendall reviewed a
videotape of the testimony on Monday. He had already seen a
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   In that deposition, when the president was asked whether he had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, his response seemed to be
straightforward: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinsky. I've never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was responding to a definition of ``sexual
relations'' that was prepared by Ms. Jones' lawyers and then
narrowed by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Ms. Jones' lawyers asked Judge Wright to allow
them to use a three-part definition of sexual relations when it
came up in the case:
</P>
<P>
   ``For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in
`sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or causes _
</P>
<P>
   (I) contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner
thigh, or buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or
gratify the sexual desire of any person;
</P>
<P>
   (II) contact between any part of the person's body or an object
and the genitals or anus of another person; or
</P>
<P>
   (III) contact between the genitals or anus of the person and any
part of another person's body. `Contact' means intentional
touching, either directly or through clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, objected, arguing that the
definition was too broad and could include such benign activities
as handshaking. Judge Wright agreed and limited the definition to
Part I, excluding the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was apparently attuned to the nuances of the definition
of sexual relations that remained after Judge Wright's ruling. When
he responded to a question of whether he had ever had relations
with Gennifer Flowers, an Arkansas singer and television
personality, he replied, ``The answer to your question if the
definition is Section I, there in the first piece of paper you gave
me, is yes.'' He had never before publicly admitted to any sexual
relationship with Ms. Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   When the subject was Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton, consulting the same
definition, denied a sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no perjury here,'' one adviser to Clinton said,
calling the definition of sexual activity the president was working
from as ``cockamamie.'' Still, the president's advisers believe the
definition used in the Jones case may not cover oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions of this strategy have been extensive enough to
include consideration of its major political drawback: it would
reinforce his critics' notion of Clinton as a lawyerly manipulator
of language used to evade responsibility, as someone who may be
technically truthful but not fundamentally honest. The president's
advisers said they fear that this strategy will invite charges that
he is ducking and weaving, exploiting a definitional loophole to
muddy the truth.
</P>
<P>
   They fear it would remind people of Clinton's careful weighing
of his words in 1992 when he and Mrs. Clinton appeared on the CBS
News program, ``60 Minutes'' after Ms. Flowers said that she had
been sexually involved with him.
</P>
<P>
   Before the television appearance, a campaign aide said, the
Clinton campaign conducted focus groups with voters and learned
that older women would react negatively to any discussion of
cheating or adultery. As a result, the aide said, Clinton chose a
more ambiguous phrase to use during the program _ that he had
caused pain in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a legal risk here,'' said one lawyer.
``The risk is really sort of political and public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since polls show that many Americans already believe that
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky had an affair, some White House advisers
hope that changing the essence of the president's story would not
be as damaging as it would have been months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the advisers said neither they nor the president have
settled on the format in which he should make his case _ or on how
far he should go in discussing his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
Part of the uncertainty stems from the fact that many of the
advisers who are debating political strategy are not privy to the
legal discussions and have no idea what Clinton will tell the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's political advisers have not directly asked him about
the nature of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, although they do
discuss the politics surrounding it. And while they stand by his
denials in public, some have privately concluded that Clinton had
some sort of sexual affair with her. They express confidence that
he found a linguistic loophole to avoid perjuring himself.
</P>
<P>
   If the president argues that he was using a narrow definition of
sex in denying an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, he will undercut
several of his senior aides, who assured the public in January that
he was not splitting hairs. Some White House officials told
reporters in January that they had been specifically told by the
White House Counsel's office that Clinton was not playing word
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is sex,'' Ann Lewis, the White House communications
director, said on Jan. 25 on the program ``Fox News Sunday.''
``Maybe only in Washington is this considered something we ought to
spend a lot of time on. But, no, a sexual relationship means what
it says, and that includes sex.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since the Lewinsky matter became public,
Clinton has flatly denied that he had an affair with the former
intern in the White House _ an assertion that he could, of course,
still repeat to the grand jury. But Ms. Lewinsky testified to the
grand jury last week that she and the president had sex on several
occasions, according to people familiar with her account. And she
turned over to Starr a dress that is being tested to determine
whether there is semen on it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Clinton is working with his legal advisers on answers to
potential questions from Starr and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The president could stick to his statement that he had no sexual
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky whatsoever _ though that would
directly contradict Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. If the grand jury
believed her, that would open the question of perjury on a much
more serious level _ in a criminal rather than a civil case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton could also resist questions about the nature of his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, claiming that they violate his
right to privacy, or he could try to use vague language in response
to specific questions. Yet it is unclear that the courts would
sustain a Fourth Amendment claim to some kind of privacy privilege.
Moreover, there is a risk that he would appear non-responsive if
Starr's team asks him very specific questions about the nature of
his involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's practice sessions, his advisers said, his lawyers
are questioning him and designing answers that allow him to
acknowledge a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky without going into
graphic detail.

SETTLEMENT IN DISPUTE OVER PAINTING LOOTED BY NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (js) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first Nazi looting case to be settled in the United
States, the relatives of two Holocaust victims said Thursday that
they had reached an agreement with a pharmaceutical company heir
over ownership of a Degas landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement essentially calls for a ``split-the-baby''
solution. In it, the Art Institute of Chicago will acquire the
work, ``Landscape With Smokestacks,'' jointly from Lili Gutmann and
her nephews Nick and Simon Goodman, the daughter and grandsons of
two Holocaust victims, and from Daniel Searle, the current owner,
who is a trustee of the art institute and a former chairman of G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The art institute will pay the Goodmans half of the work's
fair-market value, which was not disclosed, and Searle will donate
the painting. The agreement also stipulates that the names
Friedrich and Louise Gutmann, who died in Theresienstadt and
Auschwitz respectively, as well as that of Searle, be on the
institute's wall labels when the work is on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an agreement made in heaven _ nobody wins and nobody
loses,'' Nick Goodman said. ``And it was an opportunity. We wanted
to show the world that we could settle our case and maybe show the
way for all these other cases.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen claims for art stolen during World War II
have recently been made in the United States, and experts believe
there will probably be more. Claims have started surfacing only in
the past few years, as wartime archives have been opened, the Iron
Curtain has fallen and books and the news media have brought
attention to the issue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Goodman-Searle case began simmering in 1995, when Simon
Goodman found ``Landscape with Smokestacks'' listed in an
exhibition catalog as the property of Searle. In 1939, his
grandparents had sent the country landscape, along with other
paintings, from their home in the Netherlands to Paris, where the
family contends it was confiscated during the war. The painting
changed hands a few times after the war, moving through Switzerland
to New York, where Searle, unaware of its history, bought it in
1987 for $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Ms. Gutmann, a 79-year-old resident of Florence,
Italy; her brother, Bernard Goodman, who died in 1994; and his
sons, Nick, 52, and Simon, 49, both residents of Los Angeles, had
been looking for the painting.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of unfruitful discussions with Searle, the Goodman
family sued him in 1996. The trial was set to begin on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   But last Friday, Nick Goodman called Searle, suggesting one last
effort to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman also suggested that the art institute might be part of a
deal, based on consultations he had had with Hector Feliciano, the
author of ``The Lost Museum: The Nazi Conspiracy to Steal the
World's Greatest Works of Art'' (Basic Books, 1997). Feliciano,
acting on the Goodmans' behalf, had approached James Wood, the
institute's director, to see whether he could participate in a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Art Institute could help realize an equitable solution
to a very difficult legal problem, we were happy to do it,'' Wood
said. ``It's a work of art we've always wanted. And now it goes
into the public domain where its history is recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano said of the pact: ``We are rectifying history at our
modest level and showing that this is the way to resolve these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Searle is traveling, but his lawyer, Howard Trienens, said:
``I'm sure he would say, `I'm glad it's over.' The problem here is
that it would have cost much more to try this case than the
painting is worth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Landscape with Smokestacks'' will go on view at the art
institute on Oct. 9, and the Goodmans will probably be there.
</P>
<P>

looking forward to holding it for the first and probably last

   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The FBI agent in charge of solving the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy here said Thursday that the bureau had found
fragments of the truck that carried the explosives, and was piecing
together a picture of what happened in the seconds before the bomb
went off.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators are trying to put together a puzzle of
countless parts, plucking shards of glass and metal from the
shattered embassy, and sorting through sometimes contradictory
accounts by witnesses. They are trying to reassemble the scene at
the moment when an explosion set off by three unknown suspects, at
least one of whom may still be at large, killed at least 247
people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is developing slowly, and the initial stage of the
investigation may take a month, the bureau said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the embassy's private security guards have given the FBI a
detailed account of what happened just after 10:30 a.m. last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the guards, Benson Okuku Bwaku, met with the FBI Thursday
to help them draw a sketch of one of the suspects. He described a
man with a light beard, gray slacks and a plaid shirt. The head of
the private company employing the security guards said the embassy
had told him not to characterize the man's ethnic background, but
said he was not white and not black.
</P>
<P>
   ``Painstaking detective work,'' including ``literally sifting
through piles of rubble,'' has yielded potentially significant
clues, said the FBI special agent in charge of the investigation,
Sheila Horan, a counterterrorism specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been successful, we think, in identifying certain
parts of the delivery vehicle,'' she said. Shattered parts of the
truck were carried possibly hundreds of feet from the blast, over
terrain that FBI forensics teams have combed for the last three
days. She did not explain how the investigators knew the fragments
were from the delivery truck.
</P>
<P>
   That twisted metal could help trace the truck's origins and the
type of explosive used, and take the investigation a step or two
down the long road ahead, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the car,'' a senior law-enforcement official said,
describing the future course of the investigation. ``Get the VIN,''
the vehicle identification number unique to every automobile and
soldered to its body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take you somewhere,'' the official said. ``Interview
everybody. Somebody saw something. Somebody knows something.
Somebody saw someone get on an airliner. You're far, far away from
a dead end.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said that the first pieces of evidence from the scene of
the two bombings in East Africa would arrive in Washington this
weekend for forensic testing.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday at FBI headquarters, senior bureau
officials said that the investigation would come down in large part
to the analysis of tiny, even microscopic bits of evidence from the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're into the tedious task of looking for parts of cars,
trucks and other parts of the bombs and trying to determine what
happened,'' said Thomas Pickard, the director of the FBI's criminal
division. ``This is what the FBI does best, the painstaking
gathering of information that all comes together to make an
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI laboratory director Donald Kerr said that ``the evidence you
want most is part or closest to whatever explosive was used, and so
it's the small pieces that matter; it's the residues that matter.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bureau officials said that the FBI was making extraordinary
efforts to prevent evidence from the two bomb sites from
contaminating each other; evidence gathered from the sites will be
sent to Washington on separate planes and then stored at FBI
headquarters on different floors of the building. ``We're treating
them as separate incidents so as not to inadvertently come to the
wrong conclusions,'' Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to speculate on the type of explosives used in the
two bombings. ``There clearly was substantial energy release'' from
the blasts, he said. ``But it could be a relatively small amount of
a high explosive or a larger amount of a mining explosive or the
like, and we don't want to speculate on that based on the effects
we observe on the ground until we can put it into a proper
context.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said that there are 215 bureau employees in Nairobi
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and that the scene investigation _ the
gathering of rubble at the site and hundreds of interviews _ would
continue for four more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law-enforcement officials said they were confident that
the terrorists would be captured. Pickard said he had been at the
White House on Wednesday to discuss the investigation, and ``the
president asked me if the FBI would be as successful as we were in
Oklahoma City, and I said, `Yes, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is working in teams with the Kenyan police, who have
detained five people for questioning, said Peter Mbuvi, the deputy
commissioner of Kenya's criminal investigations department. But
U.S. officials said the five were not considered prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men detained was Anjum Javed, his family said
Thursday night. Javed is a Kenyan citizen of Pakistani descent. The
family said he had been arrested as he tried to rescue the wounded
at the site of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Javed's neighbors in Pangani, a predominately Muslim
neighborhood, said the police had been harassing residents whom the
police think look like Arabs. Nearly 40 percent of Kenya's people
are Muslims of African, Arabian or Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether one or more of the three bombers got away.
The security guards have given differing accounts as to whether the
driver and a passenger were still in the pickup truck when it
exploded, said their employer, William John Guidice, chief
executive officer of United International Investigative Services,
which provides the private security at U.S. embassies in Kenya and
12 other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The guards' accounts suggest that in carrying out the bombing in
Nairobi, the terrorists may not have been as sophisticated as the
overall plot, in which they managed to set off a second powerful
bomb, nearly simultaneously, at the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania more
than 300 miles away, killing 10.
</P>
<P>
   It has been assumed that the attackers in Nairobi wanted to
drive the explosives into the underground garage of the embassy.
Their initial stop at the front of the building suggests a lack of
meticulous planning, and allowed them to be seen by the guards in a
calm setting.
</P>
<P>
   Guidice said the guards had reported that the truck carrying the
explosives was a Mitsubishi Canter, a mini-pickup commonly used
around Nairobi for deliveries, and that it was first driven to the
gate into the parking lot at the front of the embassy on Moi
Avenue. The driver told the guard that he had a delivery for the
embassy. The parking lot is reserved for diplomatic cars, and
contrary to some earlier reports, the vehicle did not have
diplomatic plates, so the guards told the driver of the vehicle to
go around to the back.
</P>
<P>
   After being turned back, the pickup was driven down Moi Avenue,
made a U-turn, went around a traffic circle at the intersection
with Haile Selassie Avenue, made another U-turn and approached the
back of the embassy, Guidice said.
</P>
<P>
   A car coming out of the parking lot behind the embassy
inadvertently blocked the terrorists' path.
</P>
<P>
   The security guards, who were unarmed, saw a man jump out of the
back of the pickup, quickly pull three hand grenades out of one
pocket, and take a fourth out of another, Guidice said. The man
threw one grenade past Bwaku, who fled, calling for help on a
walkie-talkie.
</P>
<P>
   Just 20 seconds later, the vehicle exploded, realizing the worst
fears of diplomats who have served at the U.S. Embassy here in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those diplomats said Thursday that fears of a
terrorist attack and other security concerns date back a decade at
the mission, but remained unresolved by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems were known,'' one of the diplomats said. ``Anyone
can drive to that spot at the back door,'' he added, referring to
where the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   Other State Department officials said concerns mounted in the
last three years, after the attacks on U.S. military bases in Saudi
Arabia in 1995 and 1996, which showed that even U.S. outposts in
friendly nations with stricter security procedures than Kenya's
were vulnerable to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   A diplomat who served here said that ``it takes a great deal of
will to get an embassy moved,'' as well as many millions of dollars
for the land, building, and security measures. He recalled
discussions about moving the embassy out of downtown Nairobi to a
leafy suburb where other foreign missions are situated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not atypical of the way things work in the American
bureaucracy, unfortunately,'' he said.

WEB SITE RELEASED SUBSCRIBER DATA AFTER VOWING IT WOULDN'T, FTC
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs 2nd graf to change `they' to `it')   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the federal government's first Internet-privacy
enforcement action, the Federal Trade Commission said Thursday that
a popular Web site had lied when it told more than 2 million
subscribers, both adults and children, that it would not disclose
personal information it collected from them.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC and the company, Geocities, announced they had reached a
settlement under which the Web site would stop promising
subscribers it would not give out information collected during
registration _ including age, education, occupation, income and
personal interests _ without permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geocities misled its customers, both children and adults, by
not telling the truth about how it was using their personal
information,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau
of Consumer Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC also said Geocities engaged in ``deceptive practices''
by gathering information about children who played games on its
site and turning that over to third parties.
</P>
<P>
   Without admitting wrongdoing, Geocities has posted a new privacy
statement that explains how it uses the information it collects.
``The company has denied the allegations contained in the FTC's
complaint and believes that it has acted fairly with its
customers,'' Geocities said in a statement. ``However, it has come
to agreement with the FTC in order to resolve the matter in an
expeditious manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities site offers members their own Web pages, e-mail
addresses and information on topics of interest to them. It has
been in business since December 1994 and went public Tuesday. The
company's initial offering was at $17 a share, and the stock closed
after the first day at $37.31. Wednesday the stock rose to $45.50.
Thursday it closed down 7 points, or about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company disclosed that it was the subject of an FTC
investigation. In an interview Thursday, Geocities president Thomas
Evans said the settlement ``will have absolutely no impact on our
business model.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Evans added that he was happy his company could take the lead in
the online privacy debate.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Plesser, the company's lawyer, said, ``It's important to
note that there was no admission of wrongdoing, no fine or
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The company would not disclose the terms under which it gave
personal information about subscribers to advertisers and others.
</P>
<P>
   FTC attorney Toby Levin said, ``We are not trying to tell them
what their privacy policies ought to be. They just have to disclose
those policies.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's research shows that the Geocities case is not
unique. An FTC study made public in June showed that 92 percent of
600 Web sites surveyed collected personal information on visitors
or subscribers, while only 2 percent of those offered a privacy
statement that disclosed how the information would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and privacy groups have complained that more needs to
be done to protect the privacy of people, particularly children,
using the Web. But the Clinton administration has chosen to allow
the industry to regulate itself on this issue. In a broad privacy
initiative published last month, Vice President Al Gore's office
said, ``The administration will continue to press for
self-regulation'' for online privacy ``with enforcement
mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of large companies, the Online Privacy Alliance, has
drafted a self-enforcement plan, hoping to avert direct regulation.
But the FTC's leaders have indicated they are impatient with
self-regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Levin said the FTC is investigating other Web sites and may
bring additional actions.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center in Washington, a research group, said, ``It's
significant on one hand that the FTC is now ready to enforce
privacy concerns on the Internet. But this leaves open the question
of how privacy should be enforced.'' He said he would prefer a
government policy that sets limits on the dissemination of personal
information collected on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Geocities site still collects copious personal information
from new subscribers. But the new privacy statement, reached from a
tiny link on the company's home page, now says:
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who elect to receive promotional materials from
Geocities or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their
profile, we do release personally identifiable information''
including ``name, street address, e-mail address, interests,
Geocities neighborhood, and the broader personal information (e.g.,
level of education, occupation and marital status).''
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the commission said, the site's registration page
said, ``We will not share this information without your
permission,'' though the company did release it, even without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Geocities also agreed to discourage children under 13 from using
the site without parental permission.

MATT FONG: ONCE A CALIFORNIA LONG SHOT, NOW A REPUBLICAN STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Sub 1st sentence of lede to present-tense Fong's position. No

 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Less than three months ago, Matt Fong was little
known outside California, where he is state treasurer. Now,
Republican heavyweights like Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott regard
him as a new best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Since he narrowly won the Republican nomination in June to
oppose Sen. Barbara Boxer in the fall, Fong has pulled virtually
even with her in the polls, giving Republican leaders new reason to
believe they can gain five Senate seats for a filibuster-proof
majority of 60.
</P>
<P>
   It is an alarming predicament for a Democratic incumbent at a
time when the economy is strong and voter dissatisfaction is not
the overwhelming issue it was four years ago. Yet the most recent
statewide polls show that Boxer is in for a fight. In May, the
latest poll by the Field Institute, a nonpartisan organization,
showed that she held only a slim advantage over Fong, 47 percent to
43 percent, a statistical tie. In late July, a San Francisco
Examiner poll found Boxer leading by just 43 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara Boxer has the most partisan image of any elected
official in California,'' said Mark DiCamillo director of the Field
poll. ``At this stage, it's a yes-or-no vote on her.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the so-called ``year of the woman'' in Washington,
Boxer won a close race over Bruce Herschensohn, with 48 percent of
the vote. She has been consistently regarded as one of the most
liberal senators and, as such, has been a champion of abortion
rights and gun control. She is also a strong and steady supporter
of President Clinton, and her daughter, Nicole, is married to
Hillary Rodham Clinton's brother, Tony Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials like that and the possibility Clinton could be
damaged by the Monica Lewinsky matter have persuaded Republicans to
view Sen. Boxer as one of several Democratic incumbents who might
be especially vulnerable this year. They are also why Gingrich, the
House speaker, has traveled to California to appear with Fong, and
other ranking Republicans are scheduled to follow, including Lott,
the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Fong, 44, a lawyer and former Air Force officer, is
predicting that after Labor Day, when Californians start focusing
on the fall elections, he will attract support for reasons beyond
Boxer's approval ratings.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, carries a well-known name in California politics, not
only as state treasurer since 1995, but as the son of March Fong
Eu, a Democrat who was elected five times over 24 years as
California's secretary of state. Her popularity could help Fong win
critical swing voters like Reagan Democrats who live outside the
traditional liberal strongholds of Los Angeles County and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She could also help him with Asian-Americans, who are about 5
percent of the electorate in California and tend to vote Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Fong would be the first Chinese-American in the Senate since
Hiram Fong, who is not related, represented Hawaii from 1959
through 1976, and the first Asian-American to represent California
since S.I. Hayakawa served one term through 1982.
</P>
<P>
   `'I'm not starting from scratch,'' Fong said in an interview,
alluding to his mother.. ``The Fong name has been on the state
ballot since 1974, so it's not a new brand name. It's no different
than if someone passes down a family drugstore that had a
reputation for integrity. My mother had the same reputation for her
integrity in public service.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The election in which Fong won the Republican nomination was
California's first open primary, and Asian-American voters played
an important role in his slim victory, 22 percent to 20 percent,
over Darrell Issa, a wealthy businessman. A poll of voters in San
Francisco found that 90 percent of Asian-Americans voted for a
Democrat in the gubernatorial primary and almost as many also voted
for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Claudine Cheng, a former vice chairman of the San Francisco
Democratic Committee, referred to a ``hostile, anti-Asian political
environment,'' arising from the indictments of several
Asian-Americans on charges of campaign finance violations. She said
of the city's Asian-Americans: ``Most people are inclined to help
Matt Fong. It's important to see one of our own do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fong is counting on his expertise as a fiscal manager, his
strong support for the military and his conservative social views
to convince voters that the values he holds are closer to the
mainstream than those held by Boxer, whom he describes as a
political extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer points to Fong's opposition to gun control, campaign
finance reform and laws that protect the environment to
characterize him as the out-of-touch extremist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest threat I face is not Matt Fong; it is but voter
apathy,'' she said Thursday, predicting that a higher turnout would
help her. ``I said even before I knew who my opponent would be that
this was going to be a race decided by two to five points. That's
the way it always is in California; the state is pretty much evenly
divided along party lines. But I think the more I'm compared to him
on the issues, the better I'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Fong's strategy is to plow ahead with what he calls
a common-sense approach to issues, particularly those involving
budgets and economics. He said that his fiscal skills, honed by
managing the state investment portfolio of $32 billion, would serve
the nation well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, I move anywhere from $200 million to $2
billion,'' he said of his job as treasurer. ``You take a look at
the challenges facing the country in the short and medium term,
like Medicaid and tax reform. As the chief financial officer of the
seventh-largest economy in the world, I have a far different
perspective than my opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Among his highest priorities, Fong includes increased spending
on the military, a flat income tax and a closer balance between
environmental and economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Conceding that voters are not yet focusing on key issues, he
said he could encounter problems when they do. Unlike Boxer, 57, a
native of Brooklyn who moved to California in 1965, he is not
particularly animated on the stump. On a recent night, walking the
grounds of the Stanislaus County Fair in Turlock, Calif., he seldom
stopped to greet voters or engage them in conversation. Delivering
speeches or talking casually, he sounds more rehearsed than
spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign aides say he will loosen up soon and flash the
personable side that they say they see all the time. But for now,
Fong does not seem bothered by any stylistic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as my wife thinks I have charisma, I'm OK,'' he said.
``I just want voters to think I'm competent.''

IT'S ALL GOOD FOR SERENA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Though it appears that two Williams sisters
are on the women's pro tennis tour, there actually are three:
Venus, Good Serena and Bad Serena.
</P>
<P>
   Good Serena Williams showed up on Thursday in the Acura Classic
at Manhattan Country Club and beat seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud
6-4, 3-6, 6-1. The match could have been a sign that Serena
Williams' split personality, or inconsistency, is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bad Serena has been eradicated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of Bad Serena showed up in the second set, when Williams
trailed 4-1. But she fought back and did not go lightly. Testud had
13 set points before she finally won the second set.
</P>
<P>
   Serena Williams takes on top-ranked and top-seeded Martina
Hingis in the quarterfinals. Williams, ranked 21st, is in her first
tournament in six weeks and appears stronger and steadier than when
she played last. So does she have a shot at winning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Williams said. ``It depends on which Serena
shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-ranked Testud thinks so, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks she can beat anyone, so it makes it even harder to
beat her,'' Testud said.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' take: Even before Williams beat Testud, Martina Hingis
pondered the possibility of playing her. In a simple way, Hingis
pointed out that the 16-year-old appears to have a stronger upper
body than a month ago. She said, ``I saw Serena play Tuesday night,
and she's a big girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky loser wins again: Elena Tatarkova, who earned a spot in
the tournament when Mary Pierce withdrew, advanced to the
quarterfinals with a win over sixth-seeded Irina Spirlea 6-2, 6-2.
Tatarkova, ranked 63rd, will face third-seeded Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Doubles update: Two doubles teams, Hingis with Natasha Zvereva
and Chanda Rubin with Spirlea, have advanced to the semifinals. Two
quarterfinal matches will be played today.

   LOS ANGELES _ It's been done six times before.
</P>
<P>
   So if Jeff Gordon manages to win his fourth straight race at
Sunday's NASCAR Winston Cup DeVilbiss 400 in Michigan, the real
excitement comes next week. Then, Gordon can attempt a
record-breaking five straight at the Goody's 500 in Bristol, Tenn.,
where he won earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against just such a scenario unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow Warriors team fronted by Gordon is on a roll coming
off speedway victories at Pocono and Indianapolis and an impressive
road-course win last week at Watkins Glen. And when the Warriors
are at their best, they are the best _ perhaps in all of racing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon could be perceived to be the underdog this weekend
because the race is at Michigan Speedway _ and Gordon has never won
there. His chief competitor for this year's Winston Cup title, Mark
Martin, has won his last two races at Michigan and this year's
California 500 at the nearly identical California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon has won the past three Winston Cup races, Martin,
who trails Gordon by 82 points, has nearly matched that consistency
with four straight seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, of course, will be hurting this weekend, grieving the
deaths of his father, stepmother and a half sister in an airplane
crash. Such pain could be a distraction, it could be motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon should be motivated, too.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, he would join Martin, Cale Yarborough, Darrell
Waltrip, Dale Earnhardt, Harry Gant and Bill Elliott _ the only
other modern-era drivers to win four straight _ in the record book.
And he would break his personal drought at Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been close at Michigan so many times,'' said Gordon, who
has finished in the top five in five of his last six races there.
``But we just haven't been able to pull it off there.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't surprise Martin if Gordon prevails Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The way he's going, Martin said, ``Jeff Gordon might win them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely. In addition to Martin, after all, there will
be at least 41 other teams in the field week in and week out.
</P>
<P>
   But when his team is at its peak, Gordon should never be
considered the underdog to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Another breakdown: Back in June, Granada Hills' driver M.K.
Kanke was running away with the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour,
having built a seemingly unassailable 115-point lead over
second-place Steve Portenga.
</P>
<P>
   But three races later, a spate of mechanical problems has
gobbled up Kanke's lead, and the veteran racer now trails Portenga
by 43 points _ 1,458-1,415 _ with six races remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke's latest disappointment came at Bakersfield's Mesa Marin
Raceway, where he had won his previous two visits and held the
track record for his class.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a 12-point lead over Portenga into the race, Kanke
qualified 10th but lost the suspension on his Victor Valley Roofing
Pontiac on the 66th lap and finished 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Portenga was running with the lead group, headed by
winner and 1997 points champion Bryan Germone, and finished fifth,
taking the season lead from Kanke.
</P>
<P>
   Kanke will get a chance to retake the lead Aug. 29 when the Tour
runs at Colorado National Speedway in Dacono, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant memories: Valencia's Sean Woodside returns to the site
of his first NASCAR Winston West victory this weekend when the Tour
stops at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash. for Saturday's Coors
Lite 200.
</P>
<P>
   Woodside goes to Washington 16 points behind Palmdale's Kevin
Harvick in the season points battle.
</P>
<P>
   Harvick took the lead back from Woodside with a victory in
Colorado at the tour's last stop.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's race, the tour takes a two-month hiatus before
it's next race, Oct. 11 at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Words to drive by: As far as Winston Cup driver Bobby Hamilton
is concerned, the objective is clear: a top 10 finish in season
points.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing less will do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between 10th and 11th in the points is really
wide,'' Hamilton said. ``Tenth goes on the stage at the New York
banquet while 11th sits behind a pole somewhere. Tenth is big time,
11th is the beginning of everybody else. Tenth is champagne, 11th
is flat beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton didn't offer a metaphor for 13th, his current position
in the standings. Presumably, it's something too awful to mention.
</P>
<P>
   Nuts and bolts: Next year's inaugural Winston Showdown in
Tennessee will offer the richest purse in NHRA history and will
feature interclass racing between top fuel and funny cars... Next
year's NHRA season begins and ends in Pomona, as usual, with the
Chief Auto Parts Winternationals, Feb. 4-7, and the Winston Finals,
Nov. 11-14... Winston Cup Team Tobasco, Darrell Waltrip's new team,
is switching from Chevy Monte Carlos to Pontiac Grand Prixs...
Ricky Craven is out as driver of the No.50 Hendrick Motorsports
Budweiser car and Wally Dallenbach Jr. is in... IRL racer Billy
Boat, who broke his left hand and cracked his pelvis at the New
England 200 June 28, is still on crutches but will be back behind
the wheel of his Conseco A.J. Foyt racer Sunday for the Indy Racing
League's Radisson 200 in Colorado... Greg Ray, who drove for Boat
during his recovery, has picked up sponsors _ Best Access Systems
and Mitsubishi _ and a full-time IRL ride with Thomas Knapp
Motorsports for the rest of the 1998 season... Jim Guthrie, the IRL
1996-97 rookie of the year, has left CBR-Cobb racing and is looking
for a new team... Alex Zanardi's 12th-place finish in the FedEx
CART series last Sunday was his first miss of the top three since
May... North Hollywood's Jeff Shafer will drive the No.24 Derek
Daly Performance Driving Academy car at the KOOL/Toyota Atlantic
series stop at Road America in Wisconsin. &QL;

COURT BACKS PROTECTIONS FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS DENIED BY HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite starting in 4th graf; in final graf,
corrects first judge mentioned from Marquez to Wiggins)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court has ruled that Medicare
patients are entitled to immediate hearings and other protections
when they are denied care by health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In ruling on a nationwide class action suit, the court said many
HMOs had failed to provide adequate explanations for the denial of
benefits and had failed to inform patients of their appeal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued on Wednesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, in San Francisco, was a major victory for consumers.
The lawsuit was filed in Arizona on behalf of nearly 6 million
Medicare patients in HMOs around the country. The opinion, for a
unanimous three-judge panel, was written by Judge Charles Wiggins,
a former Republican congressman from California.
</P>
<P>
   For the last seven months, Congress has debated whether to
guarantee similar rights for more than 150 million Americans with
private health insurance. The White House has denounced Republicans
and HMOs for resisting President Clinton's demand for a ``patient's
bill of rights'' with such guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used executive orders to provide appeal rights to people
covered by Medicare, Medicaid and veterans' health programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's ruling sets more stringent standards, requiring
more information for Medicare beneficiaries and setting tighter
deadlines for decisions on appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said that in running the Medicare HMO program,
federal officials had not lived up to their duty to guarantee ``due
process of law,'' as required by the Fifth Amendment to the
Constitution. Indeed, it said, Medicare officials have failed to
enforce their own rules and have improperly renewed contracts with
HMOs that violated the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins said Medicare beneficiaries were entitled to due process
because the HMO decisions amount to ``government action.'' HMOs are
private corporations, but when they deny services to Medicare
beneficiaries they act ``as a governmental proxy'' and they are
``federal actors,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government cannot avoid the due process requirements of
the Constitution merely by delegating its duty to determine
Medicare coverage to private entities,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Other courts have reached similar conclusions in cases involving
Medicaid, the federal-state health care program for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Medicare is significant because it holds that
beneficiaries have rights that are rooted in the Constitution, not
merely in statutes or regulations subject to change by Congress and
the president. The number of beneficiaries in HMOs is rising
rapidly and is expected to reach 10 million, or 25 percent of the
Medicare population, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   While the administration has supported appeal rights for
patients, it argued in court that HMOs were private entities and
that the government should not be held responsible for their
decisions involving Medicare. It also objected to having a court
dictate the program's details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely believe in a strong, independent appeals
process, and we have taken steps to strengthen the appeal rights of
Medicare beneficiaries,'' Melissa Skolfield, a spokeswoman for the
Department of Health and Human Services, said Thursday. ``But we
have concern about the judge's finding that private HMOs should be
treated as if they were the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs filed suit in 1993 and won a ruling from the U.S.
District Court in Tucson, Ariz., in October 1996. The secretary of
Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, then appealed, saying the
judge, Alfredo Marquez, had usurped her authority and gone further
than necessary in protecting patients' rights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The decisions of the HMOs are not government action,'' Shalala
said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hart, a lawyer at the Center for Medicare Advocacy who
represented patients in the Arizona case, said: ``The government is
speaking publicly as if it had an obligation to protect the rights
of Medicare beneficiaries in HMOs. But in court, it took the
position that it had no legal obligation to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The government issued rules to define Medicare appeal rights in
April 1997, and Congress adopted similar requirements last August.
But Ms. Hart said, ``Many beneficiaries are still not receiving
written notice when services are denied.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court said that ``the appeal rights and other
procedural protections available to Medicare beneficiaries are
meaningless'' if patients do not receive such notices.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health
Plans, a trade group for HMOs, said: ``We were comfortable with the
Medicare rules issued in 1997. They made important changes that
responded to beneficiaries' concerns. We want to study the court's
decision to compare it with those rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Gottlich, a lawyer at the National Senior Citizens Law
Center, said: ``This ruling will provide new protection to Medicare
beneficiaries. It goes much further than current federal rules in
requiring HMOs to explain what additional evidence you need to
support your claim, and how to get that evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The court set tighter deadlines, too. Federal rules say that an
HMO must ordinarily rule in 14 days on a request for services from
a Medicare patient. The court allows just five days.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez had issued a detailed order specifying how Medicare
officials should protect patients' rights, and the appeals court
upheld that order, over objections by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   When an HMO denies or terminates a service it must issue a
notice of appeal rights, written ``in at least 12-point type'' that
will be readable by older people, Marquez said. He found that HMO
notices ``were often illegible'' and ``failed to specify the reason
for the denial.''
</P>
<P>
   In urging the appeals court not to expand patients' rights, the
Clinton administration said, ``A beneficiary denied service by an
HMO can obtain such services outside the plan and then seek
reimbursement for their cost.'' The court rejected that argument,
saying it was ``of little comfort to an elderly poor patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez also told Shalala to ``monitor and investigate the
compliance of HMOs'' with the requirement for hearings. If she
finds that a plan did not comply, he said, she ``is prohibited from
renewing or entering into a subsequent Medicare contract with the
HMO.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary objected to this part of the judge's order, saying
she should not have to impose such drastic penalties. But the
appeals court said the penalties were required by the Medicare law.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Judge Wiggins, the other members of the three-judge
panel were Judges Herbert Choy and Mary Schroeder.

RICHARD MANSFIELD BILBY, 67, JUDGE IN CHARLES KEATING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Mansfield Bilby, a senior federal judge in Arizona who
presided over the 1992 case against Charles Keating Jr., a symbol
of the savings-and-loan collapse of the 1980s, died on Tuesday as
he was walking his dog near his summer home in Flagstaff. He was 67
and a lifelong resident of Tucson, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, the U.S. District Court reported
in Tucson. Bilby was nominated by President Jimmy Carter in 1979,
was elevated to chief judge in 1984 and served as such until 1990.
He took senior status with a reduced work load two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona jury trial of Keating, a Phoenix financier and
savings-and-loan executive, and his co-defendants stemmed from a
class action suit filed by investors. The result was a
billion-dollar judgment for the plaintiffs in November 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was later tried in California on state charges and was
convicted. Both that conviction and the one in Arizona were
overturned on appeal. Keating, who was released on bail in October,
could be retried in both state and federal cases.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Bilby presided over two murder trials of a
former border patrol agent and ordered an end to overcrowding in
Arizona's juvenile correction centers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he overturned the state's ban on the medical procedure
that opponents call partial-birth abortion, terming it
unconstitutionally vague. The law as written by the Arizona
Legislature, he held, improperly restricted a woman's right to
abort a nonviable fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby graduated from the University of Arizona in 1955 and from
the University of Michigan Law School in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Practicing in Tucson, he once served as Pima County Republican
chairman even though he often voiced views resembling those of a
populist Democrat. Carter first nominated him in 1976 on the
recommendation of Sen. Dennis DeConcini, a Democrat, but liberal
Democrats in the Senate blocked the appointment that year while
Republicans supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Bilby is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Thomas Bilby; two
daughters from a previous marriage that ended in divorce, Claire
Bilby of Long Beach, Calif., and Ellen Moore of Agoura, Calif.; and
two grandsons.

BRAVES BELIEVE THEIR WAY IS RIGHT WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In the current baseball climate, championship
rewards often fall to the short-sighted _ clubs which flame
brightly in one wild, reckless stab at a World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   If this causes the farm system to go deeply into hock and the
cash reserves to tap out. Well, it was fun while it lasted. If the
team's fortunes crash soon after, there is always the prospect of
building up from the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves have taken a longer view _ and it could be
argued their title achievements have suffered for it.
</P>
<P>
   This team, built patiently and soundly around an incomparable
staff of starting pitchers, has become the most formidable. . . uh,
regular-season team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has reached the playoffs the past six years (in which
they've been held) and has but one World Series championship _
accomplished in 1995 _ to show for all that impressive staying
power. Minnesota. Toronto. Philadelphia. Florida. They all won
titles or pennants in the '90s at the Braves' expense then fell on
hard times soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Braves meticulously trained for the marathon. . . but
vulnerable in the best-of-seven sprint?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the environment in which we live and operate,'' general
manager John Schuerholz said this week as the Braves, on a 107-win
pace, prepared for a weekend series with the Dodgers, their only
visit of the season to Los Angeles. ``With the format that is in
place _ a short-series playoff _ at any given time, one team, no
matter whether they are judged to have better talent or more talent
or be the better team, might be playing better than the team that
is more talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to prepare ourselves as best we can, and also keep our
fingers crossed that we're healthy. If not, that (falling short of
the pinnacle) is always a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're hot, you're going to win,'' said manager Bobby Cox,
putting it a bit more simply. ``And if you're not, you're going to
go home. We've played great (in the regular season). It's a
crapshoot once you get into it.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, as they close in on yet another division title, a
bitter irony confronts these Braves.
</P>
<P>
   This past offseason, they made all the correct moves to address
the elements that can make a difference in a playoff season.
Right-left offensive balance? Andres Galarraga, a power-hitting
right-handed first baseman, was brought in to replace lefty Fred
McGriff. Defense? Walt Weiss was signed to replace Jeff Blauser at
shortstop, while the dazzling Andruw Jones supplanted Kenny Lofton
in center.
</P>
<P>
   But at the instant all of this began to settle into place, the
Braves were dealt a cruel dose of fate: Mark Wohlers, one of the
most overpowering closers in the game, suddenly went wiggo on the
mound, endangering subterranean creatures and low-flying fowl with
his errant fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   He currently is trying to work out his troubles in Triple-A, but
even Cox admits, ``Time's running out. We've got to set a (playoff)
roster (by the end of August).''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of Wohlers, the Braves' bullpen is a menagerie.
Its characters have performed admirably during the season but could
fray nerves _ and create an even greater burden for starters Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz _ in the intense heat of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Kerry Ligtenberg, who has 18 saves in 20 chances, is a
former strike-replacement player for Seattle whom the Braves found
pitching in Minnesota's independent Prairie League.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed setup man Rudy Seanez might be familiar to Dodgers
fans _ L.A. was one of four teams to release him in the past five
years. But he has flourished in Atlanta, compiling a 4-0 record,
1.96 ERA and 29 strikeouts in 23 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Also down there? Lefty John Rocker, a converted starter; Dennis
Martinez, all 43 years of him; Norm Charlton, whose nastiness these
days is confined strictly to his ERA (6.94 with Baltimore until his
release last month); and Adam Butler, a chubby lefty with an obese
ERA (19.29), who is filling in for injured ex-Angel Russ Springer.
</P>
<P>
   At mid-summer, as Houston traded for Randy Johnson and San Diego
picked up Randy Myers, and even the thin-hope Dodgers grabbed Jeff
Shaw, Atlanta stood pat. No panic moves that forfeited future
talent or upended the operating budget. No mad grasping for that
one missing cog.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there is a farther-reaching wisdom to the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Braves broadcaster Don Sutton, the former Dodgers pitcher who
was inducted into the Hall of Fame this summer, said he believes a
team's merit should be measured over the long term, over a period
of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you beat the Braves in a World Series, that doesn't make
you the best ballclub, it makes you the best ballclub for that
week,'' he said. ``Sure, everybody wants to be a world champion.
That's why you want to go there. But the other (teams) that have
come and gone? A lot of it is philosophy. You take one shot. You
say, `I need to do this. I need to rent a player.' But then where
do you go?
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Braves are doing is what I saw when I was in L.A. in
the '70s. Your minor leagues exist to build winners in the major
leagues. The Braves build their nucleus from within and fill (with
free agents) from without.''
</P>
<P>
   The filler in this year's bullpen, however, has raised a few
eyebrows, and these pitchers aren't oblivious to the skepticism.
Absent a miraculous recovery by Wohlers, will this bullpen will be
Atlanta's Achilles' heel as the playoffs approach?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, we've heard that for 8{ years,'' said pitching coach Leo
Mazzone. ``If you put our bullpen behind ordinary starting staffs,
you'd say, `They're pretty good.' But they have to follow such a
high standard of excellence, any little slip-up and all of a
sudden, `Whoom!' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone takes it personally,'' said Seanez.
``Everyone just takes it upon themselves to do their part.''
</P>
<P>
   Seanez then contemplated his three-year stay in the Dodgers
organization and picked his words carefully: ``It's good to be
somewhere where everybody just concentrates on doing their one job
and doesn't worry what the other guy does or says. Everyone gets
along here. Chemistry, I guess you could call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the roster, the Braves exult in what is perceived
to be better balance and overall strength.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, they were beaten twice by Kevin Brown in the National
League Championship Series against Florida. Now Brown is with
another strong contender, San Diego. Meanwhile, Houston's deadline
trade two weeks ago raised the very real specter of Johnson working
twice in a seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta vows to be ready. Galarraga has obliterated the notion
that his past numbers in Colorado were inflated by so much thin
air. He is batting .300, with 36 home runs and 94 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   It has provided a nice complement to Chipper Jones (a switch
hitter who wields much more power from the left side) and Ryan
Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be,'' said Maddux, ``you pretty much just threw any
lefty (pitcher) out there and they had a chance. Now, it'd better
be a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel really positive,'' added Galarraga. ``The unit we've
been playing has been pulling everything together _ defense,
offense, pitching. . . We've got a good chance. We're looking to
the playoffs. I hope to win everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's another good team, that's what it is,'' said Cox, who is
much more familiar with this terrain. ``Whether or not we're any
better, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers could well determine that. Or that Ligtenberg guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A source of great pride for us,'' said Schuerholz, ``is the
consistency of our success in this day and age and this
environment, where teams win and then fall, teams win and are
disbanded, teams win and, because of their rosters, off-load guys.
We've been able to make a lot of changes and still be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd like to think all of this sensible diligence will be
worthy of a further reward.
</P>
<P>
   Come October.

GATHERING OF OLD-SCHOOL POLITICIANS MOURNS A MASTER OF THE CRAFT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Their stories recalled long-forgotten eras of this
city's political history, peppered with reminiscences of
neighborhood campaigns in Brooklyn that even years ago had become
the stuff of footnotes. Their common thread was the man who had
either engineered the campaigns or produced strategies to derail
them.
</P>
<P>
   For the two dozen or so former politicians and city officials
who gathered at the Park Plaza restaurant in downtown Brooklyn on
Thursday. It was the regular Thursday morning breakfast that had
been convened for nearly 20 years by Assemblyman Anthony Genovesi.
But this breakfast came three days after Genovesi was killed in an
auto accident on a rainy highway in Dutchess County, at age 61.
</P>
<P>
   It was part wake, part celebration and partly a look into how a
political technician handled the nitty-gritty of politics on the
streets of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   There was Frank Macchiarola, the president of St. Francis
College in Brooklyn and a former city schools chancellor,
reminiscing about Genovesi as a gruff-talking architect of politics
who used the breakfasts to argue about the issues of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Seated nearby was Anthony Gliedman, a former official with the
Trump Organization whose prior career in government stretched back
to the Lindsay administration. On the other side of the table was
Peter Piscitelli, a lobbyist who was a senior aide in the
administration of Mayor Ed Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The weekly breakfasts where Genovesi held court had moved over
the years, from the old Woerner's restaurant to Junior's to
Thursday's location, a bright, airy coffee shop at Cadman Plaza,
where the late assemblyman, many recalled, typically ate a hearty
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we're going to argue about,'' said
Macchiarola, a close friend of Genovesi's. ``But he would want us
to continue, and to continue arguing.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were none of the friendly arguments that were a
staple of the breakfasts. Instead, they took turns discussing the
role played by Genovesi, the heir to the leadership of the
Canarsie-based political club once ruled by the Brooklyn Democratic
boss Meade Esposito. They recalled his role in support of school
integration in Canarsie in the late 1960s. And they recalled his
role in making _ or breaking _ the candidacies of people whose
names are in the lore of New York City politics: Sebastian Leone,
Ed Koch, Stanley Steingut and Leonard Yoswein.
</P>
<P>
   They discussed his legendary antipathy toward being interviewed,
how he would do everything at the Thomas Jefferson Democratic Club
in Canarsie, from mopping floors to editing campaign literature and
micro-managing campaign expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, they each attributed to Genovesi a single quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man of absolute integrity,'' Piscitelli said. Another
participant spoke of the time when Genovesi, struggling with his
law practice, was offered the college tuition costs for his five
children if he managed a politician's campaign. They recalled that
he had already given his word to support a rival candidate and
refused the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was gruff, but he was Brooklyn,'' said George Arzt, a
public relations consultant and former spokesman for Koch who had
worked with Genovesi. ``He was as scrappy as the old Brooklyn
Dodgers. He knew the politics of the neighborhoods like the back of
his hands. We won't see another like him.''

MASSIVE WELFARE FRAUD SCAM   USED NONEXISTENT KIDS TO COLLECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETH BARRETT and PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A welfare caseworker orchestrated the biggest
benefits scam in Los Angeles County history by arranging about
$700,000 in payments for ineligible or nonexistent children,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Thursday that they expect the case eventually
to include as many as 15 people in Los Angeles and San Bernardino
counties, with search warrants issued at nine locations.
</P>
<P>
   At least 25 fraudulent welfare cases are believed to be
involved, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The caseworker, Jennifer Castillo, 41, of suburban Van Nuys, has
pleaded not guilty to five felony counts, including embezzlement,
aid by misrepresentation, public officer crime and two counts of
forgery, according to court records. She is in custody and bail has
been set at $565,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' said George Mueller, supervising investigator in
the District Attorney's Office. ``I think internally, it's the
largest case ever involving one employee. But we're looking at all
the angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Castillo's attorney said she does not have a criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appears to be a decent person with no prior criminal
history,'' said Sherman Oaks criminal attorney Michael Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo worked in the Aid to Families With Dependent Children
division of the county Department of Public Social Services' West
Valley District office in suburban Canoga Park. She had worked for
the department for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The case broke after investigators with the department got an
anonymous tip in March, according to a case history detailed in a
search warrant filed by a District Attorney's Office investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found that Castillo's sister, Corrine Young, had
received welfare benefits on and off since 1987, according to the
search warrant. Investigators found 10 children listed in the Young
file, only one of whom could be verified with a birth certificate
or Social Security number.
</P>
<P>
   There were biological impossibilities, too: Department of Public
Social Services records showed that two of Young's ``children''
were born only five days apart. Another pair were born six months
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found Castillo had at least 15 more welfare cases
like Young's -- all involving large families with no verification
that some or all of the children even existed.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller said it is not known for sure whether Castillo worked
alone or with other county employees. She is accused in court
records of submitting false claims, forging her supervisor's
signature and failing to disclose that she was handling her
sister's case.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo used her access to case files to create phony cases so
that a ring of people could collect benefits fraudulently under the
AFDC and food-stamp programs, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: The children named in the cases either were not
eligible for benefits or were fictional characters made up using
fake birth dates, Social Security numbers and other identifying
information, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, only the adult existed, but he would get money
for eight -- and the seven others didn't exist,'' he said. ``Or
maybe you would have one or two kids, but you'd be getting aid for
eight kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the scam involved many layers of
fabrication, crossing state and international jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``parents'' of the nonexistent children in some cases are
believed to have used phony identification, taking the identities
of relatives living out of state or out of the country, Mueller
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be like a person impersonating their brother to get a
driver's license in their brother's name, and then using that
identification to cash the (welfare) check,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who cashed the checks lived in Los Angeles and San
Bernardino counties, he said. They included people from the L.A.
suburbs of North Hollywood, Van Nuys, Reseda and Highland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show Castillo had files for several clients with
her own last name.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said Castillo emigrated from Belize in Central America
about 24 years ago, is a U.S. citizen and has a large family.
</P>
<P>
   On June 23, investigators searched Castillo's and Young's
apartments, located within a few blocks of each other in Van Nuys.
Court records show investigators turned up identification and
welfare records with names that matched the illegal accounts
Castillo is accused of setting up in department files.
</P>
<P>
   While no additional arrests have been made so far, interviews
with some people have resulted in confessions of receiving money
illegally, Mueller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were made free and voluntarily,'' he said. ``Some people
feel real bad about this. They have a conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   The county is working to recover some of the money, Mueller
added.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Social Services Director Lynn Bayer said a
variety of methods were used to conceal the fraud, but
investigators were able to reconstruct records.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was clever, but not clever enough, and the district
attorney has considerable hard evidence against her,'' Bayer said.
</P>
<P>
   State and county investigators also are examining how the
alleged fraud could have gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Bayer said a new, more sophisticated fraud-detection system will
be implemented next year.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators allege in court records that Castillo quit the
department June 17, shortly after learning that she was the subject
of an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing for Castillo is scheduled Sept. 15.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The two international inspectors who know the most about Iraq's
efforts to create new weapons of mass destruction have raised an
alarm that President Clinton and other world leaders must not
ignore. Richard Butler, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, and
Mohammed Baradei, the director general of the International Atomic
Energy Agency, informed the Security Council this week that they no
longer had the means to monitor and prevent Iraqi programs to
develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from the two men means that international efforts to
keep Iraq from re-arming have deteriorated swiftly since Saddam
Hussein ended cooperation with inspectors last week. If aggressive
inspections are not quickly resumed, Iraq may soon replenish its
supply of chemical and biological weapons and take steps to rebuild
a nuclear weapons program that was far advanced before the Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   By ending cooperation with the U.N. inspectors, Saddam
effectively blocked them from visiting sites suspected of housing
weapons or the materials needed to make them. Without the ability
to make inspections with little or no notice, Butler's team is
reduced to relying on remote cameras and sensors placed in areas
where weapons work was once done. Since those locations are well
known, Baghdad is not likely to use them any longer. The world is
now blind to any new Iraqi weapons laboratories or manufacturing
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Just this sort of threat earlier this year quickly drew an
emphatic response from Washington, including the reinforcement of
American and British forces in the Persian Gulf region and a clear
warning from Clinton that Iraqi defiance would not be tolerated.
This time Washington's response has been strangely muffled, as
though the White House no longer cared if Iraq produced chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has had other things on his mind this month, including
the terrorist attacks on American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
On Thursday he spoke movingly of the 12 Americans who were killed
in the bombing in Nairobi. Clinton is also preparing for his grand
jury testimony next Monday in the Monica Lewinsky case. But he must
not let these other matters prevent him from dealing firmly with a
crisis in Iraq that grows more dangerous by the day.

JUDGE RULES BOYS HELD IN GIRL'S DEATH MAY GO HOME TO AWAIT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A judge on Thursday ruled that two boys, ages 7 and 8,
who are charged with brutally killing an 11-year-old girl for her
bicycle can return home to await trial, but must wear electronic
monitoring devices and stay inside 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Gerald Winiecki of juvenile court, said he had no
alternative since Illinois law prohibits defendants younger than 10
from being housed in a locked building. Since their arrest on
Sunday, the boys have been kept in a psychiatric hospital, which
the court ruled was a locked unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the seriousness of these charges,'' Winiecki said in
his ruling, ``it is my belief the boys cannot be locked up.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys' lawyers had agreed to keep the boys at the hospital
until psychological tests could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing Thursday, Winiecki heard testimony from two
court-appointed psychologists who evaluated the boys on Wednesday
to determine whether they would be a threat to themselves or
society if released. Both psychologists recommended that the boys
be reunited with their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``All things being equal, I think he would be best off with his
mother and father,'' said Dr. James Kraus, who evaluated the
younger boy.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors objected to the boys' release, saying that the
psychologists did not have adequate time or information to make an
informed assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is just too important to rush to a judgment like
this,'' argued Patty Sudendorf, an assistant state attorney,
fighting back tears. ``It is a mockery to say that these two
children are not a danger to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts in juvenile justice say they know of no case in which
younger children have been prosecuted for murder in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, 11-year-old Ryan Harris, was killed on July 27. The
boys are accused of knocking her unconscious with a rock, molesting
her and then suffocating her by stuffing her underwear in her mouth
and shoving leaves and debris up her nose.
</P>
<P>
   R. Eugene Pimcham, a former judge and mayoral candidate who is
representing the older boy, disputed the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way these little boys have the physical strength
to have committed this murder,'' Pimcham said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Pimcham walked the boy to the center of the
courtroom and placed him on a scale, hoping to illustrate he was
not a threat to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure a 4-foot 2-inch
boy couldn't have hurt anyone,'' Pimcham said outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   As they did at a hearing on Monday, the boys sat, legs dangling,
at the defense table occupied by coloring books and toys.
</P>
<P>
   During breaks, they hugged family members and showed off
pictures they had drawn. Immediately following the hearing they
were fitted with specially made ankle bracelets which they will
wear at all times.
</P>
<P>
   The older boy went home Thursday night, but the younger was
taken to an undisclosed location.
</P>
<P>
   Any youth convicted in juvenile court can only be held until age
21.

EDITORIAL: REVIEWING CUNY'S ADMISSIONS POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The proposal by trustees of the City University of New York to
bar admission to CUNY's senior colleges for students who have not
passed skills tests in reading, writing and mathematics is too
far-reaching not to be reviewed independently by state education
authorities. The plan, to be phased in over three years, could
affect nearly half the students entering the 11 four-year colleges.
Such sweeping change demands a full public review, as provided for
under state law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the CUNY board is resisting pressure by the state Board of
Regents, which oversees the university's master plan, to comply
with a formal review process. The trustees argue that changing
admissions standards does not require amending the university's
master plan, and therefore does not require the Regents' approval.
But the proposed change is not a minor adjustment to the entrance
requirements. It represents a fundamental shift in the mission of
CUNY's senior colleges, which up to now have provided substantial
remediation to students who failed the skills tests. By pushing
nearly all remedial instruction to the two-year community colleges,
the proposal will change the very structure of the CUNY system.
</P>
<P>
   The State Education Department and the Regents are right to call
for a state-level review. A key issue is whether the plan will
maintain sufficient access to education while it raises standards.
That question must be answered before the change is allowed to go
forward. The Regents are prepared to expedite the review so that
the new policy, if approved, can be put in place at four colleges
next year. The CUNY trustees, avowedly confident about the
rightness of their plan, should have no hesitation defending its
merits to the Regents and the public.

EDITORIAL: THE STAGGERING RUSSIAN ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   The ailing Russian economy seems to have nine lives, but they
are rapidly running out. The latest crisis, less than a month after
the International Monetary Fund provided a new bailout, is
bank-based. Russian banks owe lots of dollars and are having
trouble paying them back.
</P>
<P>
   With some banks needing to repay loans next week, and with
foreign lenders demanding additional collateral to roll over the
loans, the banks appear to have been buying dollars from the
Russian central bank as fast as they could early this week. The
central bank clumsily tried to impose new restrictions on such
transactions, only to provoke a new crisis of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The result Thursday was a virtual breakdown of Russia's
financial markets, particularly for most government bonds. That
makes it impossible to determine how much banks' bond portfolios
are worth, a fact that makes lenders nervous. But to repay their
loans, the banks need to sell their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is happening when it is too soon to know whether
Russia's latest reform efforts are working. The government says tax
receipts are up sharply, which is encouraging but not conclusive.
Foreign currency reserves have increased, but that may be
meaningless if the bank crisis intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, the international money manager, weighed in
Thursday with an innovative but unrealistic proposal for Russia to
devalue the ruble by 15 to 25 percent and then adopt a currency
board. Such a scheme would require Russia to set aside enough
foreign currency to redeem all rubles in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The depressed price of oil, Russia's principal export, may have
left the ruble overvalued, and devaluation may yet be necessary.
But a currency board seems impractical. Soros estimates
conservatively that Western nations would have to put up $15
billion or so, on top of the money already committed by the IMF.
More importantly, a currency board would effectively hand over
Russia's monetary policy to the foreign central bank administering
the currency to which the ruble was tied. Selling that idea to the
Communist-dominated Russian Parliament would probably be
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   An immediate answer to the current crisis must involve a
willingness by foreign banks to be flexible regarding their loans
to Russian banks that are suffering from a liquidity squeeze but
are otherwise solvent. The longer-term solution, though, is
unchanged. The Russians must proceed with economic reform, and show
the world they can do it successfully. Parliament should stop
stalling and pass needed tax reform bills immediately.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: JUST ANOTHER NIGHT AT THE STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beyond the right-field bleachers at Yankee Stadium, there is a
gap high in the outer wall. From most seats, through that gap you
can see the No. 4 train passing on elevated tracks. No one needs to
be reminded where he is when he's sitting in Yankee Stadium, but
when the No. 4 train passes, the sense of place is suddenly made
keener.
</P>
<P>
   It works the other way round, too. For several years I rode the
No. 4 train into Manhattan from a neighborhood near the Mosholu
Parkway, across the broken rooflines and ailanthus woodlots of the
Bronx. At 161st Street, just before the train went underground, I
always found myself, like other passengers, looking for that gap in
the stadium wall. Through it we could see a flicker of green grass
and the unmistakable blue of the stadium seats, a blue that would
be called ``cerulean'' if the sky were made of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   But now it's a night game against Minnesota _ Wells is pitching
and will win a four-hitter, 7-0 _ and the sky is blotted out by
thunderheads that refuse to take shape. The warmth of a steamy day
is trapped under the low ceiling above the main boxes and will not
dissipate. Now and then a weak breeze stirs with about as much
overall effect as a bunt rolling foul down the third-base line.
Somehow it seems remarkable when a Minnesota batter steps up to the
plate just as the scoreboard clock says 7:35, the scheduled
starting time. During all the apparent randomness near the dugouts
_ the interviews and the stretching of first basemen's legs and the
presenting of charitable donations in the form of beach-towel-size
checks _ someone has been keeping an eye on the time.
</P>
<P>
   But not in the stands. Fans seem to run in rivulets all around
the stadium, making their way to their seats or to the cavernous
outer passageways. For the young girl behind me, time is measured
by Derek Jeter's appearances at the plate. She carries a homemade
sign that says ``Nothing is sweeter than Derek Jeter,'' and she has
just told her mom that what the stadium really needs is a
heinie-cam. Like clockwork, her father bellows ``Go Boomer'' _
Wells' nickname _ in a voice that ruffles the hair of men and women
three rows away. The seal-bark of the vendors echoes through the
humid air.
</P>
<P>
   On the field the umpire gestures mutely after the catcher's
silent reception of each pitch. Planes from La Guardia pass quietly
overhead. The No. 4 train steals past. Sometimes the crowd roars _
O'Neill hits a two-run homer _ but when it doesn't roar it murmurs,
suppressing any audible evidence of a world other than the one
defined by the stadium lights. Wells forecloses on the Twins, and
the unbelievable season everyone hopes will never end is one game
shorter.

CASE FAR FROM CLOSED ON BRAVES' BULLPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Closer Mark Wohlers was still capable of knocking
down a wall with his fastball _ just not the one he was aiming at.
So, as baseball's summer swap meet opened for business, it appeared
the Atlanta Braves were one piece short of championship caliber.
</P>
<P>
   They did nothing, however.
</P>
<P>
   According to general manager John Schuerholz, only one
top-flight closer was available, Cincinnati's Jeff Shaw. The
Dodgers got to him first _ at a price widely considered
confiscatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite candidly, based on the players they (the Reds) were
asking for _ and got _ as much as we may have wanted somebody of
that caliber, obviously we determined that was too high an asking
price for us,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, in the July 4 deal, parted with the two brightest
prospects in their system, Paul Konerko and Dennis Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, San Diego acquired closer Randy Myers from
Toronto in a waiver deal, ostensibly because the Padres feared the
Braves would claim him. Atlanta reportedly put in no such waiver
claim, although Schuerholz wouldn't comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions not to leap could haunt the Braves this
postseason, particularly if Wohlers can't right himself or if
unlikely stand-in Kerry Ligtenberg falters. But Atlanta figures to
be the winner in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, in deals Cincinnati and Montreal, picked clean
their farm system and potentially their future while San Diego is
in danger of throwing its operating budget crazily out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who will earn just over $1 million with the Padres the
rest of 1998, is down for a guaranteed $12 million over the next
two seasons. Unless San Diego is able to move him, that could put a
crimp in efforts to re-sign such key figures as Kevin Brown, Ken
Caminiti, Steve Finley and Wally Joyner. All of their contracts are
up this year.

BOEING MAKES DEAL WITH UNION ON 737S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)  (js) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boeing Co. and its biggest union announced an agreement Thursday
that paves the way for Boeing to produce the 737 commercial jet at
the former McDonnell Douglas complex in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But while the deal was designed to allay union fears of job
losses, Boeing also said Thursday that it planned to cut even more
employees than it had indicated last month.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Boeing agreed that assembly of most of the
single-aisle jets would remain outside Seattle and that the major
parts, such as the fuselage and wings, would continue to be
produced at their current locations. The company also pledged that
it would not lay off any union workers as a result of the move.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the International Association of
Machinists, which represents 39,000 Boeing workers, and the company
have a deal apart from the union's regular four-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a step into the future,'' said Bill Johnson, president
of the machinists' local for Boeing. ``There are a lot of issues
that when we sit down and work together everybody can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal does not prevent Boeing from following through on
its goal of eliminating between 18,000 and 28,000 of the company's
238,000 jobs by the end of 1999. The company said Thursday that
even more cuts will come after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has provided few details about where the initial job
reductions will be made. A Boeing spokesman declined to elaborate
on the additional cuts, saying that details would not be disclosed
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   The new production line will require between 600 and 1,000
workers, saving only a fraction of the 6,200 Long Beach jobs set to
be lost when production of three McDonnell Douglas models is
scheduled to stop in 2000. Boeing bought McDonnell Douglas last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said Thursday that it would further consolidate
the operations of its fighter, satellite, space transportation,
information and communications and military transport businesses.
By the end of the decade, the moves will reduce the company's
overall office, warehouse and manufacturing space by 21 million
square feet _ three million square feet more than Boeing first
announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will begin assembling a few 737s in Long Beach later this
year, bringing the rate up to three a month by the second quarter
of 1999. The agreement with the machinists caps production at the
plant at five planes a month.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that is rich with symbolism for the former
McDonnell Douglas employees, Boeing said that it would drop the
remnant of the acquired company's name and call the complex the
Long Beach division. It is now called the Douglas products
division.
</P>
<P>
   Moving production to California will help relieve the strain at
Boeing, which has been struggling to fill hundreds of orders for
the best-selling 737. The company will use Long Beach to make the
most varied versions of the 737 _ a business version of the jet and
a combination passenger and cargo version commissioned by the
Pentagon _ so that its main assembly lines outside Seattle can
focus on stamping out similar types for the world's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Boeing closed down $1.6875, at $37.1875, on the New
York Stock Exchange Thursday.

MAGAZINE EXAMINES BILL GATES' ``P.R. MACHINE'' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the dust still swirling from his controversial first issue,
publisher Steven Brill, the nation's newest media watchdog, has
trained his sights on another big target: Microsoft's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of Brill's Content magazine features a police
mug shot of the Microsoft chairman taken more than 20 years ago and
a cover story that carries the main headline: ``Making Bill: How
Bill Gates's PR machine helped make him Master of the Universe. And
why it's failing him now.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's inaugural issue last month became the talk of
legal and media circles because of ethical questions it raised
about news leaks by special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and media
coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson cited that article in
a ruling made public last week that Starr, in repeatedly leaking
information to the reporters, had probably violated grand jury
secrecy laws.
</P>
<P>
   This month's article about Gates, covering 15 pages, examines
Microsoft's ``adroit, aggressive'' use of public relations
techniques to promote the company, its software and Gates himself.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it describes his cultivation of key
reporters and publications in order to build an image as a
visionary and standard-setter in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   The article also questions whether news coverage has been
colored by journalists' access to Gates or the prospect of losing
it.
</P>
<P>
   The police mug photo on the cover carries the caption, ``Bill
Gates under arrest for a probably minor but still unknown charge in
1977.'' But the point in publishing it was not to dredge up a
20-year-old arrest, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crimes or negligible misdemeanors of the 22-year-old Gates
are of marginal interest,'' Elizabeth Lesly Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is illuminating to examine how Microsoft's lawyers,
public relations experts and Gates himself handled the surfacing of
the potentially embarrassing mug shot.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, Gates displayed it several times life size on
projection screens during a speech to the cable industry as proof
that almost anything can be found on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Gates was not telling the truth about how he had come
across the photo,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Albuquerque police actually alerted Microsoft that Content had
asked for the photo; using it in his speech was an ``attempt to
trump our use of it'' that ``goes to the heart of our story about
the phenomenal reach of Gates's public-relations machine,''
editorial director Michael Kramer wrote in a companion column in
the new issue.
</P>
<P>
   The mug shot can indeed be found on the Internet _ on
Microsoft's Web site, along with the rest of the slides Gates
presented with his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote that Brill's Content was unable to download the
file, despite using ``nine different business and home computer
systems running both Microsoft's browser and Netscape's.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone should have called, Microsoft spokesman Dean Katz said;
the company would have explained that the slides were prepared in
Microsoft's Power Point presentation format, and could be displayed
using either the full program or a viewer that is distributed free.
</P>
<P>
   Including the mug shot was not an attempt to blunt Content's
impact, Katz said. ``He was using this as an example of what's out
on the Internet _ that's really about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Bill wasn't embarrassed by this,'' Katz said. ``He
thought it was kind of funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not his use of the mug shot was calculated to counter
Content, it was hardly the first time Gates has poked fun at
himself and the computer industry in public.
</P>
<P>
   Alone and with such celebrities as Martha Stewart, Gates has
joked about computers' complexities as a way of explaining how much
work remains to make them easier to use and more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   More personal is a montage that skewers his tendency to use the
same phrases and verbal mannerisms in speech after speech.
</P>
<P>
   The new magazine is another in a string of high-profile media
ventures for Brill. He earlier founded The American Lawyer magazine
and the Court TV cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue of Brill's Content had an initial press run of
225,000 copies, a spokeswoman said; another 50,000 were quickly
ordered when demand exceeded supply.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue includes numerous sharp-tongued reactions to
the first, including a letter from Starr. Printed in full, it
covers more than five pages _ not including a response from Brill
that consumes nearly a full page itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the Microsoft story, Stevens herself notes that, ``Adroit,
aggressive PR did not create Bill Gates or Microsoft, nor does the
reality of it negate Gates's accomplishments as a businessman or
the appeal and supremacy of his company's products.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the story of Microsoft's ability to manage its image in
the press, as well as its recent failure to do so, is a
significant, if subtle and unexamined part of the larger story of
how Gates and his company achieved their present dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many news reports have been published or broadcast over
the past several months that explore Microsoft's apparent blunders
in the face of mounting pressure from antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself made a sort of public confession early this
year when top executives apologized for certain incendiary remarks
and promised to take a more conciliatory tone in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The spate of negative news coverage is no more the public
relations ``failure'' alleged on Content's cover, Katz said, than
positive articles are a victory of spin over substance.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, ``As we've said all along, we don't control what
the press writes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public relations is important, he acknowledged, but not more
important than the products themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't buy PR; they buy software,'' he said. ``If it
doesn't work for them, they don't continue to buy it.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
Woods sets pace with course-record 66
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
REDMOND, Wash. _ At first glance, it wouldn't appear that Sahalee
Country Club is Tiger Woods' kind of golf course.
</P>
<P>
   The layout is too short for Woods to pull his legendary driver
out of the bag very often, and there are only two par-5s on the
entire course.
</P>
<P>
   But look a little closer, and it becomes easy to see why Woods
set the course record at Sahalee on Thursday with a 4-under-par 66,
and why he has a two-stroke lead in the 1998 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My length is definitely a huge advantage on this golf course
because I'm able to hit 2-irons and 3-woods where guys are
sometimes having to hit driver,'' Woods said. ``And I've always
been a pretty good long-iron player. I feel very comfortable
hitting 2-irons and 3-irons off the tees. I had a game plan today,
and I did stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee was there for the taking Thursday, but the course
managed to hold its own against the best players in the world
despite near-perfect conditions. Trailing Woods at the end of the
day was a group of eight players at 2-under 68, including Paul
Azinger, Bill Glasson and Glen Day. Houston's Steve Elkington and
Mark O'Meara headed a group of 11 at 69.
</P>
<P>
   Others struggled with the tree-lined fairways. David Duval, one
of the pre-tournament favorites, started the back side with a
triple bogey and finished at 76, while a disappointed Fred Couples
quickly left his hometown course after a 74.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's solid opening round kept him in position to win his
third major championship of the year, a feat that hasn't been
accomplished since Ben Hogan won three in 1953. Despite being
pleased with his efforts, O'Meara said the man at the top of the
leader board had the round everyone wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw on the leader board that Tiger shot 4-under and had a
super round,'' O'Meara said. ``But I expected him to play well. He
was swinging well in the practice rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   And putting well, too, thanks to O'Meara. Woods finished his
round with 27 putts, including four of 15 feet or longer for
birdie. He is using the Ping Anser 2 putter that he ``borrowed''
from O'Meara's garage before the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one I stole,'' Woods corrected. ``It's something that I
just like the look of.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was one of the keys to his round Thursday, which Wood
found especially satisfying since it was one of the things missing
in his game earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the reason why I've been finishing in the top
fours and not really getting the victory,'' Woods said. ``I can say
as a whole I feel so much more comfortable over the ball. I can't
really explain why. Putting comes in cycles. You have to ride it
when you have the highs and try to get out of the slumps as quickly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked on my putting pretty hard and just tried to get
the flow back in my stroke, just feel comfortable setting up over
the ball. I haven't really felt comfortable setting up over the
ball in a while. And if you don't feel comfortable, you're not
going to make a very good stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   His comfort zone was quite evident Thursday. After opening the
day with a bogey, Woods came back with a great birdie on the second
hole after narrowly missing the water on his second shot. He then
sank an 18-foot putt to save par on No. 3 and was off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Woods sank a 15-footer for birdie on No. 5, added an 18-foot
birdie putt at No. 7 and made the turn at 1-under. On the back
side, he sank birdie putts of six feet, four feet, 18 feet and
finally 30 feet on the 17th hole to break the course record at
Sahalee. The old mark of 67 was set by Jack Nicklaus in an
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger had a wonderful round,'' said playing partner Jeff
Sluman, who shot 71. ``He made some key putts when he needed, and
that is the difference between his round and Nick (Price)'s and
mine. He made five or six putts of 15 feet or better. That is what
you're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Others tried to keep pace. Billy Andrade made birdies on the
first four holes to get to 4-under early in the day, but he never
really recovered from a double bogey at No. 6 and finished with a
68. Day, who has had a fine season so far, was the only player in
the field to get to 5-under. Day had a front-nine 31 and then
birdied the 11th hole to move five strokes under par. But Day made
double bogey on No. 15 and bogey on No. 18 and closed at 2-under.
</P>
<P>
   That left Woods alone in the lead and hoping this final major of
the year will have his name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been right there in the majors,'' he said. ``I had a
chance at the Masters going into Sunday and didn't quite fire a low
enough round. Had a really good shot at the British Open and came
up one shot short of a playoff. So I've been pretty close to
putting it all together and being in the hunt where I could
legitimately win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about getting the right breaks at the right time. So
overall, I'm very pleased with the way I've played.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one in the field was ready to concede this
championship, and Woods knows that beginning today, he is the man
everyone will be chasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I tried to go out and play a good, solid round,'' he
said. ``And tomorrow, the same thing. I just try to give myself a
chance going into Sunday. And if I'm there, hopefully I'll win. But
I'm not going to put any more pressure on myself, because I am in
the lead right now. With three days to go, it's an eternity. Three
rounds is a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I need to go out there and hold my own for three more
days.''

BRAZEN BEANIE BABY BANDIT BAGS BEST OF BUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A gunman wearing a ski mask burst into a gift and
novelty shop, ordered seven people to the floor and demanded . . .
Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   He passed up the cash register, ignored the least-collectible
Beanies and fled with 42 of the rarest, worth a total of about
$5,000, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Even seasoned detectives were amazed by the robber's unusual
booty during the 9 a.m. robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of some weird things over the years, but the Beanie
Babies was a good one,'' said Los Angeles police Sgt. Roy VanDuyne
of the suburban Van Nuys Division. ``I had no idea how expensive
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was the first such heist in the division, and
perhaps the entire city, a wave of Beanie Baby robbers has hit this
year from Maryland to Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, crooks encouraged by Beanie Baby-mania have
targeted the most valued Beanies, some of which sell for hundreds
of dollars apiece. Newer models of the toys, made by Ty Inc., sell
in stores for about $5.
</P>
<P>
   At Aahs in suburban Sherman Oaks, the robber took the coveted
``Ty'' model, now worth $65 or more because it has been
discontinued, the store manager said.
</P>
<P>
   The toys likely will find their way to a burgeoning Beanie Baby
black market, which has outlets at swap meets and through
classified ads or on the Internet, VanDuyne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know what a Beanie Baby was until today,'' he
said. ``Hopefully we'll catch this guy. He'll probably be around
the area doing this again.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager said she believes the robber had cased the store
because he knew exactly where to find the most valuable Beanie
Babies. ``He just went right to them,'' said the manager, who
declined to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid; it's crazy,'' she added. ``There (are) crazy
people out in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The store was open just five minutes before the robber arrived,
VanDuyne said. As the gunman ordered seven employees and customers
to lie on the floor, a 10-year-old boy hid behind a display case.
No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described the robber as an African-American man about
6 feet tall, wearing a black ski mask over his face, VanDuyne said.
</P>
<P>
   When a witness said the robber may have taken refuge in a nearby
store, police launched a door-to-door search but could not find
him. Investigators believe the robber got away in a car that had
been waiting in the alley behind the store.
