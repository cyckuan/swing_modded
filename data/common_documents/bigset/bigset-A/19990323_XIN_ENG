the current financial year beginning from April 1, 1998, according

</P>
<P>
The growth rate is comparable with index of industrial

Capital goods sector from April to December 1998 experienced
the highest growth rate of 9.8 percent while basic and
intermediate goods and consumer goods grew at lower rates of 1.4
percent, 4.7 percent and 2.8 percent respectively.
</P>

Several infrastructure and core industries, namely electricity
generation, coal, steel, crude oil, refinery output, cement and
fertilizer, recorded a growth rate of 2 percent in the nine-month
period as against 5 percent from April to November 1977.
</P>

the financial year 1998-99 was under control with current account
deficit widened to 1.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product in
1997-98.
</P>
<P>
In 1998-99, the report said, the current account deficit as a
percentage of GDP is expected to come down from the previous year

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Holds Talks with Scalfaro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua)-- Both China and Italy will continue to
make unremitting efforts to ensure the friendly and cooperative
relationship between the two countries enjoys long-term and stable
development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Italian President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro made the commitment during a meeting here on
Monday morning, their second in nine months since Scalfaro's visit
to China last June.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that cooperation between China and Italy was
expanding with Italy being China's important trade partners in
Europe and the second largest technology exporter to China in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
"The economies of our two countries have their respective
advantages. Thus, there exists a great potential for us to
undertake economic and trade cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president pledged support and encouragement for its
entrepreneurs in strengthening contacts with their Italian
counterparts, in order to make the bilateral trade and economic
cooperation more fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said that China, a big country with long history, vast
territory and large population, had enjoyed rapid development in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the bilateral relationship would continue to grow,
Scalfaro said that contacts between the governments and peoples of
the two countries would undoubtedly boost bilateral cooperation in
politics, economy and trade, science and technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China and Italy, as two civilized nations with
long histories, have also enjoyed active cooperation and exchange
in literature, the arts, academic research and the protection of
historic relics.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that China and Italy had consulted
and cooperated well and shared common or similar views on many
major regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro expressed the concern that the situation in Kosovo
would affect the security and stability of Europe. He said he
hoped that war could be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president also made clear Italy's opposition to the
use of military force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the international situation was undergoing
great and in-depth changes with old problems remaining unresolved
and new ones constantly cropping up.
</P>
<P>
"History has proved that many world issues can only be solved
through negotiations rather than having recourse to power policies
and resorting to the use of military force," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"On issues such as Kosovo and Iraq, we share a similar stance
that they should be solved through peaceful negotiations."
</P>
<P>
"This world will have no way out without the development of
multipolarization," said Jiang, who also briefed his Italian host
on the situation in China.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian financial crisis and the floods which hit
China last year, China had managed to achieve sustained and rapid
economic growth, the Chinese currency, the yuan, had remained
stable and economic reforms had been running smoothly while
political reforms were continuing as planned, the Chinese
president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China would continue to take measures to
increase domestic market demand and investment in infrastructure
and raise the incomes of urban and rural citizens.
</P>
<P>
China would continue to open up to the outside world, improve
the investment environment to attract and use more foreign funds,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro praised China for keeping the Chinese yuan stable,
saying that it was a "brave" policy and has played a very
important role in stabilizing regional and international finances.
</P>
<P>
The Italian president said that Italy supported China's bid for
joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) and hoped that China
would succeed soon.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Accused of Blocking Iraqi Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Monday accused U.S. and
British representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of
blocking the implementation of contracts it signed with foreign
companies to purchase spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Iraqi Oil Ministry source was quoted by the Iraqi
News Agency (INA) as saying that 128 contracts for spare parts
under the fourth phase of the U.N. oil-for-food program were still
put on hold or under estimation.
</P>
<P>
These contracts account for 25 percent of the total deals Iraq
has submitted to the U.N. Sanctions Committee, with 92 of which
put on hold and 36 others under estimation and deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The source held the U.S. and Britain responsible for the delay
of contracts approval for Iraq to buy oil equipment spare parts to
maintain and develop its oil production systems.
</P>
<P>
Some contracts have been tabled to the Sanctions Committee for
four months, but they are still put on hold by the U.S. and
British representatives in the committee, said the source.
</P>
<P>
"Such conduct reflects the ill-intentions toward Iraq and
their desperate attempts to increase Iraqis suffering," the
source said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase of the oil-for-food program, which expired
last November, allowed Iraq to import 300 million U.S. dollars
worth of spare parts badly needed for its oil sector to boost its
oil production and export capacity.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase, Iraq was allowed to export 5.2 billion
dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
supplies for its 22 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, due to low oil prices on world markets and a severe
lack of oil spare parts, Iraq was just able to export some 3
billion dollars of oil in the fourth phase.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of blocking various contracts it signed
with foreign companies under flimsy pretexts.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have identified
proteins in tears and saliva that may kill AIDS virus, which is
conducive to explain why HIV is not transmitted through kissing,
said the Washington Post Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sylvia Lee-Huang of the New York University School of
Medicine and her colleagues have isolated the proteins, called
lysozyme and ribonuclease, by analyzing a hormone women produce
during pregnance known to inhibit the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
They said that the proteins were also found in urine, tears,
saliva and mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post said the researchers plan to try to use
the proteins to develop new drugs against HIV.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Deliver "Stark Message" to Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The White House said on
Monday that U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke would send a
"start message" to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that he
must let NATO troops enter Kosovo or face NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters that the
"stark message" to Milosevic was "it's time to sign the
political agreement or face the consequence."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who has arrived in Belgrade, is to meet Milosevic
later on Monday in a last-ditch bid to force the Yugoslav
president into the political agreement that would allow NATO
forces to implement the agreement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a negotiation," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton conducted a round of consultation
with NATO allies. Lockhart said Clinton spoke on Sunday to British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
He also sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
advising him the alliance was prepared to act despite Yeltsin's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the United States wanted to give "every chance
for peaceful solution." He described Holbrooke's mission as a
"Last chance for peace."

<HEADLINE> Territorial Aspect Important on Cyprus: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The solution of the territorial
issue constitutes an important aspect of the Cyprus issue, Cyprus'
Government Spokesman Costas Serezis said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed spokesman said the solution of the
territorial issue could pave the way for the solution of other
issues such as the refugees and fundamental freedom.
</P>
<P>
Denying reports about a specific United States plan to solve
the Cyprus issue, Serezis said there are other scenarios aiming
for a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said "the American view was, and remains, that a
solution to the Cyprus problem should be based on a bizonal,
bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
This position was repeated during President Glafcos Clerides'
meetings with U.S. State Department Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas
Miller and the contacts Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides had
with U.S. officials, Serezis added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and occupied the northern third of the island in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite the
island, but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Division Issues Wall Chart on World Contraceptive Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- As part of the ongoing
monitoring of world contraceptive use, the U.N. Population Division
of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) has issued
a wall chart entitled "World Contraceptive Use 1998," U.N.
officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The wall chart presents the most up-to-date information
available in 142 countries and areas in the world, covering 92
percent of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
Featuring a table that compiles individual country data on
contraceptive use, as well as global and regional averages, the
wall chart highlights the percentage of women using contraception.
</P>
<P>
In addition, through a series of pie charts, the wall chart
depicts in a vivid manner the percentage of women using the
various contraceptive methods, for both more developed and less
developed regions and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The wall chart displays data primarily form nationally
representative sample surveys of women of reproductive age for
dates 1970 and later, pertaining on average to the year 1993.
</P>
<P>
The chart indicates that worldwide contraceptive prevalence,
which means the percentage of couples currently using
contraception, is estimated to have reached 58 percent, with
average levels of use higher in the more developed regions than in
the less developed regions, at 70 percent and 55 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the more developed countries of Europe, Northern America,
Australia and New Zealand, nearly three quarters of married
couples currently use a method of contraception.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the average contraceptive prevalence in Africa and
the developing countries of Oceania is 20 percent and 29 percent
respectively.

</P>
<P>
In a news briefing in Bonn, Schroeder called for resolution to
what he termed the growing humanitarian crisis, saying "It is time
to bring an end to the brutality,"
</P>

Organization (NATO), would take part in any possible strikes in
Yugoslavia.

The 5,500 German troops, armed with Leopard II heavy tanks and
Sting surface-to-air missiles, have only been given the green
light to serve as peacekeepers in Kosovo following a peace deal
last month.
</P>
<P>
But, Without approvement from the parliament, German troops
currently deployed in Macedonia are not permitted to take part in
military actions.

The German cabinet is due to hold an emergency session on
Kosovo Monday evening.

In a related development, the Greens Party, junior partner in
Schroeder's coalition cabinet, warned against carrying out air
strikes against Yugoslav military targets.

HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Industry and Commerce Minister
Nathan Shamuyarira said here Monday that economic growth in
Zimbabwe can only be achieved through increased investment levels
and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy could not be expected to achieve sustained

meaningful foreign investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The policy framework recognizes the roles of both large and
small-scale enterprises," he said.

"In this twin track approach, the large-scale enterprises will
use their considerable resources and access to technology to
develop international competitiveness to achieve economic growth,"
he said.

"On the other hand, constraints confronting the small-scale
enterprises will be addressed to foster growth and employment
creation."
</P>
<P>
He said the policy framework realized that Zimbabwe had limited
 resources which needed to be directed toward sub-sectors that had
proven or potential competitiveness if they were to benefit the
country to the maximum.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the industrial policy was aimed at enhancing
the pace of industrialization, widen the manufacturing base and
accelerate export growth.
</P>
<P>
"The framework, in spirit of partnership, spells out roles and
responsibilities for each of the major parties: the public and
private sectors, organized labor and an academia in order to
improve industrial performance and competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the Export Processing Zone Authority Walter
Chidakwa said the document was vital since it recognized the need
to venture into an export drive and called for value added
exports.
</P>
<P>
"The country has been concentrating on primary export,
exporting goods in raw form which has prejudiced it in earnings
and job opportunities, but the policy is calling for the exporting
of more processed goods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The policy framework adopted by the Cabinet on December 21,
1998 was now a national policy document.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Seeks Repatriation of 50,000 Refugees from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government, in
collaboration with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees and
Tanzania, are examining ways of repatriating of about 50,000
refugees still sheltered in camps in western Tanzania Kagera
District, official sources in Kigali said.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary repatriation will be examined in a two-day
seminar re- grouping the three parties which opened in Kigali
Monday, according to the state-run Rwandan News Agency (RNA).
</P>
<P>
Representatives of Rwanda, UNHCR, and Tanzania will look at
modalities of encouraging the return of the Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
In January 1999, a similar meeting had taken place in Tanzania
and the parties involved in the repatriation process had
concluded that representatives of the refugees will be assisted
in returning to Rwanda to see by themselves the improvement of
the security situation inside Rwanda, and then inform back the
refugees in the camps.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan authorities have said that the 50.000 Hutu refugees or
so had resisted the massive repatriation of December 1996, which
ended up with the return to the country of over 400,000 Rwandans
who had crossed to Tanzania at the height of the 1994 genocide.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Estonian Parliament on Monday
authorized the prime ministerial candidate, Isamaaliit (Fatherland
Union) Party Chairman Mart Laar, to put together a new government.
</P>
<P>
The decision cleared the 101-member parliament with a vote of
53-48, the Interfax reported from Tallinn, capital of the Baltic
state.
</P>
<P>
Laar gave a 20-minute speech concerning the principles of
government formation and answered questions from the lawmakers,
who approved his report in an open vote.
</P>
<P>
He told the lawmakers that the new government would place
priority importance on Estonia's integration into the European
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that integration with the NATO states can
best ensure our security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We would like Estonia to be a European state in the 21st
century. It cannot remain on the sidelines of global integration.
We are moving towards the European Union which, in turn, is
leading us towards NATO. Our firm goal is membership in the
European Union by January 1, 2003," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Estonian President Lennart Meri instructed Laar to
form a government.
</P>
<P>
Laar was nominated for the post of prime minister by the
Isamaaliit movement, the party of Moderates and the Reform party,
the three victorious parties that won 53 seats in the recent
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Under the Estonian Constitution, the prime ministerial
candidate is to familiarize the president with the new government
within a seven-day period. The president has three days to approve
it.
</P>
<P>
Meri is expected to approve the new cabinet on Thursday,

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan First Lady Janet Museveni
has appealed for protection of children's human rights and
regarded poverty eradication as the sole solution to the problem.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks Monday when opening a regional
consultative conference of Christian Children's Fund (CCF) in
Entebbe, 45 kms south of Kampala, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
In her keynote speech, Janet said that the traditional child
survival intervention, immunization, and clean water together with
the efforts of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which work in
the field of child development are very essential.
</P>
<P>
Both must begin to seriously consider the wider context of
rural poverty and devise ways of eradicating it because children
will continue to be at risk as long as households and mothers lack
food and enough education.
</P>
<P>
At the conference which drew delegates from 10 sub-Sahara
countries, she thanked CCF for their commitment to the cause of
improving the plight of the children in Africa.
</P>
<P>
CCF is an NGO which works in the area of improving the equality
of life of children in the sub sectors of health, education,
emergency assistance, psychological support and poverty
eradication.
</P>
<P>
It has been working in Africa for the last 20 years. In Uganda,
it has built 26 primary schools and supports some 725,000 children
in various programs working with 17,000 families.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Rule of Law in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday presented his report on the situation in Bosnia
and Herzegovina, saying that "the establishment of the rule of law
is a prerequisite for a lasting peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law provides an essential safeguard for individual
rights regardless of ethnicity, it gives investors confidence in
the country's future, and it facilitates increasingly close
association between European institutions and those of Bosnia and
Herzegovina," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH)
"continues to play a central role in efforts to that end under its
mandate in police monitoring, restructuring and reform, assessment
of the judicial system and strengthening of the legal system's
respect for human rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
"UNMIBH has pursued a strategy of engaging senior officials in
the Republika Srpska and the Federation, through co-location of
the International Police Task Force (IPTF) advisers and launching
a series of inter-entity meetings between officials from the
Ministries of the Interior," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy of engagement has enjoyed some success in both
entities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all efforts, it is not clear whether these positive
steps will mark the beginning of self-sustaining progress in
police in police restructuring and reform and the establishment of
the rule of law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Monitoring, therefore, remains the central to the work of IPTF
because it enables the Mission to identify areas where IPTF must
focus its programs of training, advising and equipping," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Further progress in the Mission's central task of police
reform will require tangible material support for the
modernization of the country's police infrastructure from a donor
community whose support for police restructuring and reform has
until now been relatively modest," he added.
</P>
<P>
UNMIBH is headed by Elisabeth Rehn of Finland, the
Secretary-General's special representative and coordinator of
United Nations Operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> Salim Urges to Find Solution to African Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary
General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), called Monday
for dialog between Africa and its developing partners to "find a
just and lasting solution to the African debt crisis".
</P>
<P>
In his introductory note to the report presented to the 69th
Session of the OAU Council of Ministers which opened here Monday,
salim said Africa's external debt continued to mount.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "in 1997, Africa's external debt reached 344.1
billion U.S. dollars which constitutes 64.7 percent of Africa's
gross national products (GNP). Debt service for the same year
amounted to 33 billion U.S. dollars and the debt service ratio
reached 29.9 percent."
</P>
<P>
He said, "estimates for 1998 indicate that the total debt will
rise to 350.1 billion U.S. dollars, its percentage of GNP is
expected to reach 65.5 percent, while debt repayments and the
debt/exports ratios will reach 35.7 billion U.S. dollars and 30.9
percent respectively."
</P>
<P>
Salim said, "the worrying part is that this debt is not growing
as a result of new borrowing by our member states, but rather, as
a result of the capitalization of areas on interest and
principal."
</P>
<P>
He said, it has been estimated that two thirds of the increase
in debt since 1988 has been due to arrears.
</P>
<P>
"The solutions to Africa's debt crisis are neither technical
nor economic but emphatically political," salim said, adding that
"indeed, there is a growing consensus that this debt is not
repayable."

<HEADLINE> UK Economy Almost Grounds To Halt In Last Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The UK economy grounded to a
virtual standstill in the last quarter of 1998, official figures
showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised figures from the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) the value of the country's total output rose just
0.1 percent in the last three months of last year compared with
original estimates of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
That is the lowest quarterly growth rate for almost seven
years, since the depth of the last recession.
</P>
<P>
The revised figures took most economists by surprise, and raise
fears that the UK could be heading for another downturn,
increasing the chances of further interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller, UK economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said
the GDP numbers would "rekindle hopes of a further rate cut in the
fairly near future."
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets
next month to review rates after snipping 2 percent from base
rates since last October.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts believe that the British economy has so far
avoided plunging into recession partly thanks to aggressive
interest rate cuts by the MPC since last October. They forecast
rates will fall by a half-point to 5 percent by early Summer.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government has forecast that the UK will
avoid recession in 1999, continuing to grow at between 1 percent
and 1.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Situation in central Angola became
tense once again as the rebels of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) staged a comeback to the areas
since mid March.
</P>
<P>
The official Angolan News Agency Angog reported Monday that the
UNITA military men, ever cornered in the northern parts of
Angola's Bie Province, returned to areas around Kuito in the past
10 days, harassing civilians there.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that an important bridge linking Chiguar and
Chitembo cities, about 40 kms west of Kuito has been destroyed by
the rebels, who allegedly robbed and burned villages in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Bie provincial government charged that UNITA
men killed more than 10 villagers who refused to provide grain for
them in Catabola CIty, 70 kms northeast of Kuito.
</P>
<P>
Refugees, estimated at over 100,000, have poured into central
Angola's Kuito and Huambo cities, due to the worsening situation

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Queen Noor Pledges Support to New Queen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Queen Noor al-Hussein,
widow of late King Hussein, Monday promised continued support to
the new Queen Rania and her husband King Abdullah Bin Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Noor made the pledge when she was seen off by Rania and other
royal family members at the Amman International Airport for a
brief visit to the United States, the official news agency Petra
reported.
</P>
<P>
Rania al-Abdullah was named as queen Sunday night by her
husband King Abdullah, who described her as "my partner" in
serving the kingdom and Arabs in a designation letter read on
state television Jordan TV.
</P>
<P>
A coronation ceremony is due to be held after a three-month
mourning period for late King Hussein which is to end on May 7.
Hussein died of cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
Rania was born in 1970 to the wealthy Yassin family which had a
root in the Palestinian town of Tulkarem in the West Bank. Her
marriage to Abdullah made him extremely popular in the predominant
Palestinian population of desert kingdom even before he became the
new ruler.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said Rania's designation will have little
bearing on the status of Noor, who had held the title of queen
since her marriage in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's constitution allows for more than one queen, and Noor
had shared the title with Hussein's mother Zein until her death in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Noor was also assured of a role in Jordan's state affairs as
she is the mother of Crown Prince Hamza Bin Hussein, whom Abdullah
named as crown prince.
</P>
<P>
Noor had been a helping hand to Hussein to break the isolation
Jordan had suffered for its sympathy with Iraq following its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The America-born Noor also helped Jordan develop close ties
with the United States, which has become the largest donor of the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Washington has promised some 300 million dollars of military
and financial aid to Jordan in 1999, making the kingdom the
largest recipient of U.S. aid in the world on per capita basis.

TB kills more people than AIDs and one third of the world's

by WHO.
</P>
<P>
TB accounts for one third of AIDs deaths worldwide and is the
biggest killer of people who are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
TB accounts for more than one-quarter of all preventable adult
deaths in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Nearly two million TB cases occur a year in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
HIV and TB form a lethal combination, each speeding the other's
progress. one third of the increase in the incident of TB in the
last several years can be attributed to HIV.
</P>
<P>
HIV weakens the immune system and someone who is HIV-positive
is 30 times more likely to become sick with TB than someone
infected with TB who is HIV-negative.
</P>
<P>
TB accounts for 40 percent of AIDs deaths in Africa and in the
continent, HIV is the single most important factor determining the
increased incidence of TB in the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
If control is not strengthened it is estimated that by 2020,
nearly one billion more people will be newly infected, 200 million
people will get sick, and 70 million will die of TB.

<HEADLINE> British, French Leaders Say Milosevic Should Back Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
and French President Jacques Chirac agreed on Monday that NATO
would have no choice but to bomb Serb targets unless Belgrade
backed down over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed the situation is now grave," the Reuters quoted a
spokesman for Blair's Office as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not come into
compliance with the undertakings of last October and sign up to
the Rambouillet accord, then NATO has no option but to act," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders talked on telephone for about 15 minutes,
focusing largely on Kosovo, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"If military action is required, the UK and France will be side
by side," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo peace process failed last week after the Yugoslav
delegation refused a plan initiated by the west, which granted
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo "substantial
autonomy".
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said the plan strongly violates its
integration and sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> WFP Urgently Calls for More World Aid to Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food
Program (WFP) Monday appealed to the international community to
quickly increase aid to Sudan in order to avoid a humanitarian
crisis reminiscent of last year's severe food shortage which
caused the deaths of thousands of Sudanese.
</P>
<P>
Catherine Bertini, executive director of WFP, told a press
conference here that WFP must raise at least 64 million U.S.
dollars in the coming days to purchase 55,000 metric tons of food
to avoid complete exhaustion of its food aid stocks for the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Must urgently needed are pulses, oil, corn-soya blend and
cereals, the executive director said.
</P>
<P>
Because purchase, shipping and preparation of food aid takes up
to four months, WFP is asking donors to contribute now. Otherwise,
approximately 2.3 million vulnerable Sudanese, most of them in
the Bahr el Ghazal region, could be plunged into a series food
crisis by June.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't receive help from donors now, our food pipeline
will run dry just when the need for food becomes most critical,"
said Bertini. "To effectively prepare for this summer's hunger
gap, we need donor contributions now. The clock is ticking and
every day counts."
</P>
<P>
The "hunger gap" period in Sudan is the rainy season between
May and September when locally produced food begins to run out
because crops are harvested in October.
</P>
<P>
In January, WFP launched a new emergency operation worth 142
million U.S. dollars and requested continued donor support. But so
far, it has received only 55 percent of the aid needed.
</P>
<P>
WFP is also concerned that recent fighting between the
government troops and rebel groups in the regions of Bahr el
Ghazal, and western and central Upper Nile could endanger an
already fragile ceasefire which comes up for review on April 15.
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial that the ceasefire holds," Bertini said, "We
want to be able to expand our overland transport operations which
are cheaper that delivering food by air. But if a full-fledged war
breaks out again, that will be impossible. Even with the current
sporadic insecurity, costs are still too high because of our need
to rely on airlifts."
</P>
<P>
Thanks to donor support, WFP and its partner aid agencies
were able to prevent a widespread famine last year and reduce
severe malnutrition rates in some of the worst affected areas
from a high of 48 percent to under two percent, as in the
location of Ajiep, said the WFP chief.
</P>
<P>
However, she warned that without continued support, these
numbers could rapidly increase again.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't have enough food ready to distribute by June,
there could be a repeat of last summer when we saw images of
starving families unable to cope," she said. "It would be ian
inexcusable tragedy if the world let this happen."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, WFP distributed a total of 116,000 tons of emergency
food relief feeding some 2.6 million people in Sudan at a cost of
155.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, WFP plans to feed almost 2.4 million people of which
1.2 million are in rebel-held areas of southern Sudan while 1.2
million are located in government-held areas of the south, the
transitional zones of Southern Kordofan and Southern Darfur, and in
northern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In February, WFP, which currently has more than 100 field staff
working on the relief operation in Sudan, was successful in
delivering the largest amount of food by road in the history of
its Sudan operation. Some 2,600 tons was delivered to Bahr el
Ghazal, Jonglei and Upper Nile. WFP plans to increase this amount
to 3,000 tons in March making the most of the better road access
during the dry season months.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- In order to rebuild their
economy devastated by Hurricane Mitch last autumn, the Group of
Central American Countries this week presented a comprehensive
program of technical cooperation to potential donor countries,
totaling 6 million U.S. dollars, a U.N. release said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project proposals, presented at a meeting organized by the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, called for
assistance in multilateral trade negotiations, trade efficiency,
enterprise development, investment, trade and environment, customs
reforms, transport, debt management and competition law.
</P>
<P>
All seven Central American countries, namely Costa Rica, the
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua
and Panama, and 11 donor countries attended the meeting, chaired
by UNCTAD Secretary-General Rubeans Ricupero.
</P>
<P>
Ricupero said it was now time to undertake medium- and
longer-term activities so that reconstruction efforts could evolve
into development efforts.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first full-fledged technical cooperation
program to be undertaken by the organization that addressed an
entire region and integrated a broad spectrum of the UNCTAD'
programmatic areas.

Troops from South Africa and Botswana entered Lesotho to help
restore order six months ago at the request of the Lesotho
government.
</P>
<P>
"We want them out," SAPA quoted Vincent Malebo, leader of the
Marematlou Freedom Party and of the opposition alliance, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the South African and Lesotho governments had "broken
all known rules of international intervention as they ignored U.N.
involvement in Lesotho, he said.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the U.N. had made a positive step to
"ameliorate our anger" over the presence of the SADC troops in
Lesotho by assigning a person onto the interim political authority
preparing for fresh elections next year.
</P>
<P>
The second-in-command at the SADC troops' headquarters in
Maseru, Colonel Thulaganya Masisi of the Botswana Defense Force,
said the task force has accomplished its mandate to help restore
law and order in Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The task force is now engaged in peace-keeping operations to
consolidate the peace and stability which has returned to the
country.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Albright Warns Milosevic Time Running out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Monday that the mission of U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke to Belgrade was the last chance for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace accord on Kosovo
that allows NATO forces to enter the sovereign province or face
NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"We have made this last effort because we believe that it is
important as we put Americans into a NATO force that we have gone
the last mile here," she said, referring to the role Americans
would take in a bombing operation.
</P>
<P>
"Time has run out and that it why Mr. Holbrooke's mission is so
important," Albright said at a brief news conference at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade Monday morning. He is going to
meet Milosevic in a last attempt to force the Yugoslav president
to sign the Western-drafted peace deal on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Holbrooke was to deliver the message that
airstrikes were being prepared.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart issued the
same "stark message" that Milosevic must let NATO troops enter
Kosovo for implementation of the peace accord or he would face
airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters the "stark message" to Milosevic was "it's
time to sign the political agreement or face the consequence."
</P>
<P>
"It's not a negotiation," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton conducted a round of consultation with
NATO allies. Lockhart said Clinton spoke Sunday to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac and German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
He also sent a letter to Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
advising him the alliance was prepared to act despite Yeltsin's
opposition.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the United States would not feel constrained from
acting while Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov is in
Washington. Primakov arrives Tuesday for previously scheduled
talks with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
A timetable for possible airstrikes remained in doubt, though
Albright hinted they would not come until after Holbrooke's
mission.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was being kept up to date on developments by National
Security Adviser Sandy Berger, and was returning from an overnight
trip to the Camp David presidential retreat.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said the objective of airstrikes would be to "attack
and degrade" Milosevic's ability to fight against Albanian
separatists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
And a senior NATO general said the military alliance could
launch a long and protracted bombing campaign within hours if the
peace mission failed.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very substantial and detailed plan for such an air
campaign which can be rather long and protracted," said Gen. Klaus
Naumann, NATO's military chief of staff, in an interview with CNN
from Brussels.

<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here Monday afternoon with President of Italian Senate Nicola
Mancino.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that over the past 29 years since China and Italy
established diplomatic relations, the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC) of China has had quite many
contacts with Italian congress, which has promoted mutual
understanding and is also an important part of the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President hopes that both sides will further
strengthen contacts and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out at the time when new century is coming
around, mutual understanding between countries is of vital
importance to world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also introduced China's election system and the
amendments of the Constitution during the 2nd Session of the 9th
NPC, which was convened early this month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Mancino said he felt happy to see China has scored constant
development since he visited China in 1991. Although Italy and
China have different political systems, his country has been
following with interest China's situation.
</P>
<P>
Mancino said he himself is deeply interested in China's legal
construction and has noticed the recent amendments of the
Constitution.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Retail Sales Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Canada's retail sales jumped 1.7
percent to 21.2 billion Canadian dollars (14 billion U.S. dollars)
in January after declining 0.3 percent in December, Statistics
Canada reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
January's advance was broadly based as sales increased in all
sectors and provinces. It continued a general rally in sales over
the last few months following a slowdown that started in the
spring of last year.
</P>
<P>
The 5.1 percent year-over-year increase in sales reflects both
a strong January 1999 and a particularly weak January 1998. In
January 1998, the ice storm in Central and Eastern Canada had an
overall dampening effect on retail sales during that month.
</P>
<P>
Sales were up in all retail sectors in January. General
merchandise stores, drug stores and clothing stores led sales
advances, said the federal agency.
</P>
<P>
Sales by general merchandise stores increased 4.8 percent in
January following a 1.5 percent gain in December. Department
stores had a 5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Sales in drug stores increased 3 percent in January after
declining 1 percent in each of the previous two months.
</P>
<P>
Clothing stores reported a 2 percent sales increase in January
after a 2.8 percent drop in December.

<HEADLINE> UN Reports its Latest Financial situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- As of February 28, 1999,
Member States owe the United Nations over 2.9 billion U.S. dollars
for current and past assessments, U.N. latest sources said here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
This includes 1.7 billion for peacekeeping, nearly 1.1 billion
for the regular UN budget, and 148 million for international
tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The largest debtor, the United States, owes the U.N. 1.69
billion for past and current assessment, two-thirds of the total
due. The debt includes 620 million for the regular budget and 1.07
billion for peacekeeping and international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the U.N. is so trapped for cash that in order
to cover its regular budget expenses, it has been periodically
forced to borrow from peacekeeping funds.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Organization is unable to reimburse promptly
those countries that provide peacekeeping troops and equipment. At
the end of 1998, the U.N. owed 73 countries a total of 872 million
for troops and equipment.
</P>
<P>
But because there have been fewer peacekeeping operations in
recent years, there is less and less cash in the peacekeeping
account to cover the regular budget deficit. Peacekeeping
assessments have fallen from 3 billion in 1995 to 907 million in
1998, and are projected to drop to 650 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Cash in the peacekeeping account fell to 768 million by the end
of 1998, the lowest in five years, and is expected to decline by
another 30 million this year, leaving a shrinking financial
cushion for the Organization.
</P>
<P>
Under Article 19 of the United Nations Charter, if at the
beginning of the year a country owes the same or more than its
total gross assessments for the previous two years, it
automatically loses its right to vote in the United Nations
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The United States paid just enough by the end of 1998 to avoid
this scenario. The amount the U.S. will have to pay by the end of
1999 to retain its voting privileges will be calculated in
November.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sends Draft on Start II Ratification to Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
Monday sent to the State Duma a draft on ratification of the
Second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START II) with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The draft, which is similar to another version sent to him last
week by the lower house of parliament, laid out circumstances
whereby Russia would unilaterally pull out of the 1993 treaty that
was to cut the two countries' nuclear warheads by a half.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the circumstances
include:
</P>
<P>
-- a U.S. violation of the START II Treaty that "could
jeopardize Russia's national security;"
</P>
<P>
-- a U.S. withdrawal from the 1972 ABM Treaty;
</P>
<P>
-- a build-up of strategic offensive weapons by countries not
party to the START II Treaty, if this poses a threat to Russia's
national security;
</P>
<P>
-- the taking of actions in the military sphere by the United
States or other countries, including NATO members, that pose a
threat to Russian national security. This includes the deployment
of nuclear arms to countries that join NATO after the signing of
the START II Treaty;
</P>
<P>
-- the deployment by the United States and other countries of
weapons which interfere with the functioning of the Russian
anti-missile defense system;
</P>
<P>
-- emergency circumstances, including those of economic and
technical natures, that would prevent Russia from implementing the
START II Treaty or threaten Russia's environmental safety.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was ratified by the U.S. Senate in 1996, was
close to ratification in the State Duma last year before the
December attacks on Iraq, which triggered a backlash in the lower
house and caused a postponement of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Subsequent U.S. moves on Kosovo and the imposition of sanctions
on Russian institutions for alleged transfer of weapons technology
to Iran further hampered efforts for ratification of the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President-Elect Vows to Run Transparent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo pledged Tuesday to run an "open, fair and
transparent" government and urged his opponents to "join hand
together to make Nigeria great".
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first press conference after his election
victory, he said that his "first duty and priority is to reconcile
the people of this country and heal their wounds."
</P>
<P>
The retired general noted that "everyone in our ethnically
diverse country has suffered in many ways from the unacceptable
and undemocratic manner in which we have been governed for so
long."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo who regained power 20 years after he handed over the
power to an elected government in 1979, said, "it is my
determination to run an open,

fair and transparent government throughout the period of my
mandate."
</P>
<P>
Describing his victory as a challenge from Nigerians to salvage
the country, he promised to lead by example, restore the dignity
of the country, revive the institutions and reinvigorate the
battered economy compounded by falling prices of oil, the nation's
economic lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo pledged to fight corruption, a cancer-worm plaguing
the oil-producing country, adding that he would professionalize
the military tainted by prolonged years of involvement in
Nigeria's politics.
</P>
<P>
To his opponents, the president-elect offered an olive branch,
saying, "let's all join hand together to make Nigeria great."
</P>
<P>
"The contest is over but the process of democratization is
continuous. I will continue to widen and deepen that process. My
belief in democracy is absolutely," Obasanjo told the press
conference dominated by his People's Democratic Party (PDP)
faithfuls.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo who assumes Nigerian presidency on May 29 also
said his administration would withdraw Nigerian troops from Sierra
Leone at the appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
"Nigerian troops will not be in Sierra Leone for ever, the
issue is when they will be pulled out, and I say as soon as
possible but not a day longer than necessary," the president-elect
noted.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops form the bulk of west African peace-keeping
force ECOMOG, supporting President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah against
Sierra Leonean rebels trying to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
There has been mounting domestic pressure on the Nigerian
government to recall the troops, especially in light of the
country's dwindling economic fortunes.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said, "we are sympathetic with the plight of our
brothers and sisters in Sierra Leone and will not do anything to
worsen the situation."
</P>
<P>
But, he added, further consultations would be held before a
decision would be made for their pullout, adding, "in the final
analysis, the problem in Sierra leone will be solved by Sierra
Leoneans themselves."

LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets failed to
make any headway Monday amid a lack of positive influences.
</P>
<P>
Even a major transatlantic deal and an unprecedented
consolidation in the Italian bank sector failed to lift the
markets.
</P>
<P>
London's blue chips ended a thin session marginally weaker,
having been unable to sustain mid-morning gains which dealers said
were linked to raised hopes for further interest rate cuts.
</P>

The FTSE 100 index ended 10.4 points, or 0.2 percent, lower at
6,152.8. The index touched a 6,200.1 high at 1036 GMT and had been
as low as 6,128.9 around an hour earlier.
</P>
<P>
"It has been similar to last week in the fact that when you
expect the market to rise, it just hasn't really got going," said
Peter Caulkett, salesman at UK brokerage Teather &AMP; Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
German shares underperformed again, dealers saying that ongoing
political uncertainty is keeping buyers on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
The Xetra Dax index shed 1.5 percent, outstripping losses
elsewhere on the Continent, and closing down 74 points at 5,034.
</P>
<P>
"Politics remains a negative factor for European stocks," said
David Brown, chief European economist at Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
"There is an impasse of policy direction in Germany and
although Lafontaine has gone, policy is still diluted because of
the coalition government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Inflation fear weighed on French shares as the rising oil price
fed concerns over other commodities. The Cac 40 fell 22 points to
4,197.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here on Monday that the 15-nation bloc condemns killing of
civilians on both sides in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the EU member states said in a
statement during their meeting in Brussels that they urged the
Yugoslav authorities "in the strongest terms to stop the violence
immediately," and also urge the ethnic Albanian rebel forces "to
refrain from acts of violence."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministers said that "the EU strongly urged
President Milosevic to reverse his course of obstruction, to seize
the last chance for a peaceful solution and to accept the fair and
balanced outcome represented by the Rambouillet Accords."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
said it is trying last effort to bring peace in Kosovo. US Balkan
envoy Richard Holbrooke this morning consulted with the NATO
heads, foreign ministers of Britain, France and Germany on Kosovo
situation. He has left for Belgrade to persuade Mr. Milosevic to
accept a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher told reporters after the
EU ministerial meeting that he believes the last-ditch diplomatic
effort will be successful.
</P>
<P>
However, Holbrooke told reporters at the NATO headquarters this
morning that the NATO is at the brink of using military forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Belgrade to talk with Yugoslav leaders, the
US envoy said the strike is not too late to be avoided. "But I
don't want to leave you with the impression that we are
optimistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrook also said that the resolve of western allies is very
clear and this unity "understandably focused on small
differences, but they are very small virtually done." He said he
will do his best to achieve his mission in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Russian mediator on Kosovo, Boris
Mayorsky, also left for Belgrade on Monday to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to agree on the future of Kosovo,
the southern Serbian Province.

LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
asked a court Monday to hold up the release of four IRA prisoners
including one who tried to kill former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
He applied for a judicial review of a decision by the official
body controlling early releases of prisoners in Northern Ireland
which would have freed three of the men immediately.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Straw obtained an interim order from the court,
which would hold a full hearing Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Appreciates Cooperation with Nile Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Minister of Public Works
and Water Resources Mahmoud Abu Zeid on Monday expressed
appreciation of cooperation between Egypt and other Nile countries.
</P>
<P>
Zeid was speaking at a press conference on the occasion of
Monday's International Water Day.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his country is ready to provide assistance to
the other Nile states, including Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Egypt is helping Kenya dig 100 wells for
drinking water and that Egypt and Uganda are working on an
agreement on clearing away weeds in the Nile.
</P>
<P>
Zeid said Egypt adopts a water policy aimed at providing water
supply for further land reclamation and implementing projects in
industry and power.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian geologist Farouq el-Baz said that Egypt will not fall
prey to drought over the coming years so long as there are
well-studied strategies and policies to conserve water.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz stressed that the Toshka project and the Sallam Canal
are part and parcel of the relevant Egyptian water policy.
</P>
<P>
The Toshka project under construction is aimed at reclaiming
land by channeling Nile water to irrigate a swatch of desert in
southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also diverts water from the Nile through the Sallam Canal
to the Sinai Peninsula to reclaim land from the desert.

CAIRO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's trade deficit grew 479 million U.S.
dollars in January and February compared with the same period in
1998, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with the European Union grew by 200 million
dollars, east Asian countries by 60 million dollars and the
surplus with the United States shrank by 175 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's imports volume in February stood at 2.57
billion U.S. dollars, with 29 percent of the total for commercial
aircraft, fuel and diamonds, 41 percent for raw material, 16
percent for machinery and 14 percent for consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Exports volume in February totaled 1.62 billion dollars, 72
percent of which were manufactured goods and software, 23
percent diamonds and 5 percent agricultural products, the Central
Bureau of Statistics reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Bank of Israel reported that the country's
foreign currency reserves reached 22.7 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, up by 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to three main reasons, the Bank of
Israel's purchases of foreign currency from local banks, its
income from investing foreign currency balances and a surplus of
foreign currency loans over net current government expenses in
foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's construction activity, which is measured by
the number of building permits issued, slowed down by nearly 15
percent in 1998, compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Permits for 1998 from the Order of Engineers in Beirut and
northern largest port city of Tripoli fell by 14.4 percent, to
the equivalent of a combined area of 9.8 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
The largest drop was registered in south Lebanon, down by 24.8
percent, followed by central area of Mount Lebanon, down by 15.6
percent and Beirut by 11.9 percent.

KUWAIT CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Envoy of the Arab League (AL)
Secretary General, Hussein Hassouna, arrived here Monday for talks
with Kuwaiti officials aimed at solving humanitarian issues
between Kuwait and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hassouna told reporters before leaving Cairo that his two-day
visit to Kuwait came in line with recommendation of Arab foreign
ministers concerning setting up a mechanism for solving the
humanitarian issues between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on one hand,
and Iraq on the other.
</P>
<P>
The AL ministerial council has decided to entrust AL Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid with establishing a work mechanism to

<P>
Hassouna, AL's permanent representative to the United Nations,
is expected to meet with a number of Kuwait officials on Kuwait's
detainees in Iraq, according to Kuwait News Agency.

Kuwait insists that Iraq still holds some 600 Kuwaiti and
third country prisoners of war, as well as Kuwaiti properties
since the 1991 Gulf War set off by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
1990. Baghdad has repeatedly denied the Kuwaiti
allegation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Issues Grave Warning to Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Monday issued a grave warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to rein in his forces in the province of Kosovo or face
NATO attacks.
</P>
<P>
"If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over
peace, NATO's military plans must continue to move forward,"
Clinton told reporters at the White House as he awaited the result
of envoy Richar Holbrooke's mission in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was speaking as Holbrooke prepared for a meeting seen
as the last chance for a negotiated peace before a NATO force is
unleashed on Yugoslav forces for not accepting NATO's demand to
enter Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"There is strong unity among the NATO allies. We all agree that
we cannot allow President Milosevic to continue this aggression
with impunity," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had written a letter to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin "about the urgency of the situation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Clinton's spokesman Joe Lockhart said the U.S.
decision on the timing of an attack would not be influenced by a
visit to Washington starting on Tuesday by Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Provide Additional Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
provide 100,000 metric tons in new food aid for the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the State Department said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. government has decided to provide additional
humanitarian assistance in the amount of 100,000 metric tons of
food aid to help fill the remaining 209,000 ton shortfall in
donations" solicited by the U.N. World Food Program for the
DPRK, State Department spokesman James Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came five days after Washington and
Pyongyang reached an agreement for U.S. experts to inspect an
underground site in Kumchang-ri, where Washington suspected the
DPRK was reviving its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program expects to seek more food donations
for the DPRK shortly. But first, it needs to cover a 209,000
metric ton shortfall from the 1998 appeal. Foley said the United
States would provide 100,000 metric tons and hoped other
countries would contribute the rest.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sets Sanction List in EU Beef Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government announced
on Monday that it was preparing a new list of sanction targets to
retaliate against European Union's (EU) refusal to lift the ban on
imports of American beef treated with growth hormones.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone news conference, U.S. trade negotiator for
agriculture Peter Scher said the preliminary list covered more
than 900 million U.S. dollars of European agricultural imports to
the United States as well as some manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
The EU faces a May 13 World Trade Organization (WTO) deadline
to comply with two dispute settlement panel rulings against its
10-year-ban on imports of beef produced from cattle injected with
artificial hormones.
</P>
<P>
The new target list will be pared after an April 21 public
hearing which will be held to allow U.S. companies to make a case
that certain products should be excluded from the final sanctions
list because of potential harm to American businesses.
</P>
<P>
The United States remains willing to negotiate a "reasonable
labeling regime" for hormone-treated beef that would allow EU
consumers to decide whether to eat the product, Scher said.
</P>
<P>
If no such agreement emerges, 100 percent duties on the final
list of EU goods would go into effect on June 13 at the earliest
and July 13 at the latest, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. cattle industry has said it is losing more than 500
million dollars in sales annually because of EU's refusal to abide
by WTO rulings that there is no scientific justification for it's
ban on hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
European officials have resisted sales of hormone-treated beef,
citing fears about possible long-term health consequences.

<HEADLINE> FM: Armenia Opposes Turkish Military Bases in Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Armenian Foreign Minister Vardan
Oskanyan said Monday that the military balance in the Transcaucas
region "will be rudely upset" if Azerbaijan hosts Turkish military
bases on its territory.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Yerevan, the Armenian capital,
Oskanyan said he doubts NATO military bases will be located in
Azerbaijan but the distribution of Turkish military divisions
there was highly probable, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that certain negotiations on this subject are underway.
</P>
<P>
Oskanyan said that the purpose of the military divisions
located in Armenia is to secure the borders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States, of which Azerbaijan is a member.
</P>
<P>
That means that in case of an unwanted conflict with
Azerbaijan, Armenia will not be able to use arms from the Russian
military bases, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The military balance between Armenia and Azerbaijan is based
only on the potential of Armenian and Azerbaijan forces, and not
on the Russian military forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Oskanyan said if the Turkish military bases were to be put in
Azerbaijan, the current balance of Azerbaijani and Armenian
military forces would be upset, because in this case no
limitations would be effective.
</P>
<P>
"If Azerbaijan is really going to place Turkish military bases
on its territory, Armenia will be forced to take responsive
measures," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ex-ministers Involved in Debt Buy-back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's two former ministers have
 confessed their involvement in a debt buy-back scandal and
surrendered 58 million U.S. dollars and 30 million Deutsch Marks
to the government, a spokesman for Nigeria's head of state said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Mohamed Haruna said Minister for Power and Steel
Bashir Delhatu and Finance Minister Anthony Ani in the government
of late Head of State Sani Abacha surrendered the money during
investigations on the scandal involving the Ajaokuta Steel Complex
in Kogi State, central Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers denied any involvement in the scandal when it
cropped up at the end of last year, saying that they were not
aware of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that they were not only aware but
participated in the deal in an era which has become tainted by
fraud by government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government had owed a total of 2.5 billion dollars
to a Russian company handling the Ajaokuta Steel Complex in the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
It was because of the debt that some Nigerians went abroad and
registered a company which had reached an agreement with the
Russian company to buy back the debt for 500 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
They collected 2.5 billion dollars from the treasury and paid
the Russian company off with the 500 million dollars and shared 2
billion dollars which is the difference between what the Nigerian
government paid and what they paid.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the family of the late General
Abacha had surrendered 50 million dollars from the transaction.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) Administrator James Gustave Speth said
Monday that the World Water Day, March 22, should serve as an
impetus for creative and effective action leading to sustainable
use of the world's water resources.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the occasion, Speth said, "Water is of
fundamental importance to all social and economic activity and
integral to sustainable human development."
</P>
<P>
"Many of our actions or decisions -- whether the issue is
housing, transportation, energy, agriculture or economic
development -- are potentially linked to the use of water
resources," Speth said.
</P>
<P>
"Likewise, many critical mistakes that can result from poorly
planned development -- such as storm drain overflow, mine
drainage, excessive groundwater withdrawal or topsoil erosion from
clear-cut forests -- show up in our water in the form of toxic
pollution, dead dish and dried-up streams," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the theme of this year's World Water Day "Everyone
lives Downstream," Speth said that the UNDP's water strategy
emphasizes the continuum of watersheds, rivers, lakes and aquifers
to deltas, wetlands, coastal zones and oceans.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five percent of the UNDP country offices now implement
projects in the water sector, reflecting the high priority water
holds as a concern for development and as an entry point for
poverty alleviation.

<HEADLINE> Sao Tome President Denies Link With Financial Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Miguel Trovoada, President of Sao
Tome &AMP; Principe, an island country in Atlantic Ocean, denied
monday any connection with the financial scandal with the central
bank, and condemned the incident.
</P>
<P>
Trovoada said at a press conference that what the discharged
governor of the central bank said about his link with the scandal
is sheer slander on him, the official Angola News Agency Angog
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Quaresma, former governor of the bank, who was removed
from his position for the scandal, said Trovoada knew what's going
on with the bank before the scandal was brought to light. But the
president said he only learned this early this month after it was
exposed to the public.
</P>
<P>
News came from Belgium on March 5 said that three foreigners
were detained for illegal financial activities, holding bonds
worth over 500 million U.S. dollars, issued by the central bank of
Sao Tome &AMP; Principe.
</P>
<P>
The Sao Tome government hence removed the governor of its
central bank from his position on March 15 and demanded the case
be investigated.
</P>
<P>
Trovoada said the scandal has brought disgrace to the country
and that all those connected with it should be brought to laws.
</P>
<P>
Quaresma, the former chief of the country's central bank, said
in a letter to parliament on March 19 that Trovoada, Armindo vaz
Dalmeida and Raul Braganca Neto, former prime ministers, have good
knowledge of the state bond designed to raise fund for
development.
</P>
<P>
The political arena of the island African country had been
unstable ever since it adopted a multi-party system at the start
of the 90s, and the financial scandal brought up recently is seen
by some analysts as yet another earthquake for the government
which came to power earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Encouraged by Libyan Promise on Pan Am Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that it was encouraged by Libya's announcement of a date to turn
over two suspects for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the Libyans had
never before targeted a date for surrendering the two suspects,
but he said it would be imprudent to be optimistic before its
handing over of the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
"Precisely what we're looking for is the hand over of the
suspects on or before April 6," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Moamma Gaddafi told South African President
Nelson Mandela last week that suspects Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah will be transferred by April 6.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the two suspects would be held before a Scottish
court sitting in the Netherlands. The bombing over Lockerbie,
Scotland, claimed 270 lives, mostly Americans, and if convicted
the suspects would be jailed in Scotland under U.N. supervision.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Libyan court told U.S. state prosecutors Monday to
speed up efforts to arrest Oliver North and eight other Americans
whom Libya wants to prosecute for the 1986 U.S. bombing of Tripoli
and Benghazi.
</P>
<P>
Former President Ronald Reagan ordered the attacks to retaliate
for the bombing of a German disco in which two U.S. servicement
and a Turkish woman died.
</P>
<P>
Libyan prosecutors ordered the arrests last December of the
nine American officials, including North, a former Marine
lieutenant colonel; William Casey, the late CIA director; and John
Poindexter, former national security adviser.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Takes Measures to Block JE Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
taken a whole set of normal and emergency precaution measures to
ensure safe meat consumption, control mosquitoes and block
transmitting sources of the Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued at a joint daily press
briefing Tuesday evening by the Prime Production Department (PPD),
the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Environment, a system
for accreditation of pig farms has been introduced on a normal
basis to ensure that meat is safe for consumption.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, pig farms that want to export to Singapore
must apply for accreditation through the Department of Veterinary
Services (DVS) of neighboring Malaysia, and applications that meet
DVS' export criteria and PPD's accreditation criteria are
recommended for consideration.
</P>
<P>
PPD will then inspect the applying farm to confirm that it
meets its accreditation criteria and inspect every pig in the
export consignment to verify that the pigs are from an accredited
farm and healthy.
</P>
<P>
It is also stipulated that pigs must undergo antemortem
inspection on arrival at the point of unloading from the truck and
postmortem inspection after slaughter.
</P>
<P>
As a normal measure to control mosquitoes, abattoirs must be
routinely fogged every 10 days to kill adult mosquitoes and
larvicide should be sprayed once a week to kill the mosquito
larvae.
</P>
<P>
As emergency measures, Singapore has banned all imports of pigs
and closed the abattoirs for disinfection when another disease
agent is suspected to be involved in the JE outbreak in Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> World Demand For Oil to Pick Up: OAPEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) expects that world demand
for oil is likely to reach 75 million barrels per day (bpd) in
1999, compared with 74 million bpd in 1998.
</P>
<P>
While the second quarter of this year will see a 2.7 million
bpd drop in world demand from 75.7 million bpd in the first
quarter, the rest two quarters will witness a rise, the
Kuwait-based OAPEC said in its latest issue of monthly newsletter
for March.
</P>
<P>
The newsletter said international need for oil will be at 74.2
million bpd in the third quarter, which is likely to be followed
by a noticeable 77.1 million bpd in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
According to the OAPEC report, industrial countries will lead
the oil consumption with a total of 42.7 million bpd, up 500,000
bpd from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The oil need by developing countries except for OAPEC members
will be around 21.3 million bpd in 1999, compared with 20.9
million bpd last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The rest 11 million barrels of oil will go to OAPEC countries
and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) each day, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Rules Out NATO Use of Territory for Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Macedonia's highest military body
decided on Monday night that the country would refuse to allow
NATO to use its territory as a base for launching air strikes
against Serbian targets in neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council, chaired by President Kiro
Gligorov, "has upheld the position under which Macedonia cannot be
used for military action against neighboring countries", an
official statement said.
</P>
<P>
Asked on state television what he would do if Yugoslav forces
attacked Macedonia, Prime Minister Ljubco Georgyevsky said
Macedonia would "provide no pretext" for such an attack, nor would
Yugoslavia have any reason to attack Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 NATO troops have been stationed in Macedonia,
awaiting the outcome of peace talks in France. If the Serbs sign
the peace plan proposed by the West, these soldiers would be part
of a 28,000-member peacekeeping force to police the accord in the
strife-torn province of Kosovo in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
NATO has threatened to launch air strikes against Yugoslavia
for refusing to sign the Kosovo peace program.

<HEADLINE> Britain Committed to Mideast Peace Process: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Minister of State
at the Foreign Office Derek Fatchett said Tuesday that his
government was strongly committed to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
Fatchett said he was looking forward to the day when Lebanon
retrieves its sovereignty and peace is established in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain supports the United Nations resolution 425 which
calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from Lebanese
territories.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said the British government was aware that the
Lebanese and Syrian peace tracks were intertwined and would have
to be viewed as such.
</P>
<P>
He voiced his government's willingness to help revive the
peace talks between Israel and Syria, Lebanon, which have been
stalled since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to
power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon have pledged to negotiate with the Jewish
state simultaneously, while Israel has been attempting to
separate the two tracks and resolve its conflict with Lebanon
first.
</P>
<P>
Israel is occupying Syria's Golan Heights which it captured in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett, who arrived here on Monday night, also held talks
with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud during his two-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> Somali Currency Depreciates Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The effect of the war is
hitting back at Somalia's poor economy as the threat of more
inter-clan fighting in capital Mogadishu seems to be fading away.
The value of the Somali shilling in Mogadishu's markets Tuesday
scratched its lowest value ever in history against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. dollar equaled 8,560 Somali shilling in Mogadishu's
main markets, jumping from the previous 8,000 before the fighting
in North Mogadishu over the tax dispute between warlord Muse Sudi
Yalahow and the business community in Karan market.
</P>
<P>
According to the businessmen in the currency exchange halls,
the value of the shilling has been dwindling in the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
The exchange dealers attributed the loss of value of the
shilling against the hard currencies mainly to the livestock
exportation embargo imposed on Somalia by the Gulf countries
after suspicion rose that Somalia' s animals are suffering from
Rift Valley disease.
</P>
<P>
Yussuf Mohamed Arraleh, one of the businessmen in Mogadishu's
main Bakara market, said millions of dollars should have flown
into Somalia's economy specially this (pilgrimage) Hajj season if
hundreds of thousands of head of goats, sheep, cattle and camels
had been exported to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Another major economic setback is the problem facing the
country's banana export when its banana is now no longer going to
the European markets following the serious banana dispute between
the European Union and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Banana has been the second largest revenue making product for
the country after the livestock. An Italian firm which used to
market Somali banana into the European markets has suspended its
operations thus leaving some of the Somali banana go to the Arab
world.
</P>
<P>
Another factor affecting the economy is the abandonment by the
 businessmen of the natural port of Merca town, about 100 km south
of Mogadishu, following the increased roadblocks along the
Mogadishu-Afgoie road where militiamen loyal to faction leader
Osman Ali Atto extort money from the commercial traffic.
</P>
<P>
This had made the other natural port of El-Ma'an, about 30 km
north of Mogadishu, very busy with the commercial ferries in
queues sometimes for several days.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Loans for Indonesia's Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Tuesday approved two loans totaling 400 million U.S. dollars for
the Power Sector Restructuring Program of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Of the two loans, one is a 380-million-dollar loan to support a
government reform program while the other is a 20-million-dollar
loan for capacity building to establish a competitive electricity
market.
</P>
<P>
The program is part of ADB's overall efforts to help the
country implement major economic policies and institutional
reforms and mitigate the social distress caused by the crisis.
Successful restructuring of the power sector is critical to
Indonesia's recovery.
</P>
<P>
High inflation and reduced economic activity make it difficult
for the Indonesian government to raise electricity tariffs quickly
to meet costs which have risen sharply due to the rupiah's
depreciation. As a result, the state-owned Perusahaan Listrik
Negara (PLN) is incurring heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring program aims to establish a competitive
market for electricity in the Java-Bali region through
restructuring the power sector, establishing competition,
adjusting tariffs, increasing private sector participation and
strengthening the regulatory environment.
</P>
<P>
The overall cost of the reforms is estimated at 1 billion
dollars annually during 1999 and 2000 and 4 billion dollars in
2001. The cost is expected to be met by direct budgetary outlays,
loans from multilateral and bilateral sources and part of the
proceeds from the sale of PLN's assets in Java and Bali.
</P>
<P>
The Export-Import Bank of Japan is expected to co-finance the
program with 400 million dollars in yen equivalent under the New
Miyazawa Initiative to help crisis-stricken Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loans will be from the bank's ordinary capital
resources. They will carry an interest rate to be determined in
accordance with the bank's pool-based variable lending rate system
for U.S. dollar loans and will be repayable over 15 years,
including a grace period of three years.
</P>
<P>
The program period will be 33 months. The program loan will be
released in two tranches with the first tranche of 200 million
dollars to be made available upon effectiveness and the second
tranche expected to be released by March 2000.

<HEADLINE> Asian Women Smuggled Into Australia to Be Sex Slaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Asian women were
being smuggled into Australia by organized crime groups and were
forced to be sex slaves, a crime conference was told here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Institute of Criminology Director Adam Graycar said
the Australian brothels make 1 million Australian dollars (635,000
U.S. dollars) a week from the Asian sex slaves, a report by the
Australian Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the national crime symposium, Graycar said, "links
have been established between organized crime and the illegal
trafficking of Asian prostitutes in Australia."
</P>
<P>
"The high profit potential, combined with the difficulty of
detection and comparatively low penalties for prosecution, has
resulted in the spread of groups engaged in these activities."
</P>
<P>
Graycar said many of the women were brought into Australia by
syndicates which supplied them to different brothels.
</P>
<P>
"These women's movements are often tightly controlled," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been found that some prostitutes were escorted between
their place of residence and the brothel at which they worked -
they were not allowed out even to go shopping by themselves."
</P>
<P>
Graycar said more than 75 percent of the 1,714 people who
arrived illegally by boat and air in 1997-98 were believed to have
been brought to Australia by "human traffickers."

<HEADLINE> Canada's Atlantic Telco Union Aims for Savings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada's four Atlantic telephone
companies will save 130 million Canadian dollars (86 million U.S.
dollars) a year as they merge to create a regional player, the
Globe and Mail newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The deal to create AtlanticCo was formally announced Monday in
Halifax, an eastern Canadian city.
</P>
<P>
The new company will result from the merger of Bruncor Inc. in
New Brunswick province, Island Telecom Inc., Maitime Tel and Tel
Co. Ltd. in Nova Scotia province and NewTel Enterprises Ltd. of
Newfoundland province. The merged company will be one of the
largest private-sector employers in Atlantic Canada, with about 9,
000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The merger will result in a onetime cost of 70 million Canadian
dollars (46 million U.S. dollars) -- one-half of which will be
spent on early retirement packages and employee relocation costs.
</P>
<P>
But AtlanticCo expects to realize 130 million Canadian dollars
in yearly savings -- 80 million Canadian dollars from efficiency
gains and 50 million Canadian dollars from reduced capital
spending.
</P>
<P>
AtlanticCo will rank as Canada's third-largest phone company,
with combined annual revenue of more than 1.7 billion Canadian
dollars (1.12 billion U.S. dollars) and a market value of three
billion Canadian dollars (1.98 billion U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> ADB Approves 3 Bln Dollar Facility for Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
Tuesday approved the establishment of a new
3.06-billion-U.S.-dollar facility to help Asia's crisis-hit
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian currency crisis has adversely affected countries
such as Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Thailand. The facility, which is called the Asian
Currency Crisis Support Facility, or ACCSF, will assist such
countries," the Manila-based bank said in a statement issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the funding for the ACCSF will come through
contributions to the ADB by the Japanese government under its New
Miyazawa Initiative.
</P>
<P>
"The objective of the ACCSF assistance is to complement regular
bank assistance to these countries and help mobilizing
co-financing and private financial resources for projects and
programs approved during the next three years," it said.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the bank said, the ACCSF will provide three forms
of assistance -- grants to assist in payment of interest charges
in relation to bank-assisted projects and programs, technical
assistance grants and guarantees to support the raising of
resources in conjunction with bank loans.
</P>
<P>
For social and environment programs, the ACCSF will assist
crisis-hit countries with loan-related interest payments on a
grant basis, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bank said technical assistance grants provided under the
ACCSF will fund activities including supporting policy dialogue,
human resources development, institutional strengthening and other
efforts focused on bank and corporate debt restructuring and
developing financial monitoring, supervision and regulation.
</P>
<P>
the Japanese government will provide 7.5 billion yen (62.5
million dollars) in cash for the interest payment assistance and
technical assistance grants and 360 billion yen (3 billion
dollars) in non-interest bearing, non-negotiable government notes
to support the guarantees provided under the ACCSF, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
fired his maritime and fisheries minister on Tuesday in a partial
cabinet reshuffle, amid angry protests against a fisheries
agreement with Japan.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sun-kil had been under fire since the government signed an
agreement which South Korean fishermen claimed gave Japan several
fertile fishing grounds.
</P>
<P>
The accord, put into effect in January, restricts fishing in
each other's exclusive economic zones, but South Korean fishermen
claim it was unfairly negotiated and overtly disadvantageous to
them.
</P>
<P>
Kim Sun-kil, 64, was replaced by Chung Sang-chun, a two-term
lawmaker, former mayor of Seoul and vice-president of the United
Liberal Democrats (ULD) since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial change was made shortly before representatives
of several fishermen's groups filed a petition with the
Constitutional Court in a bid to get the agreement revoked.
</P>
<P>
The Seoul government was forced to renegotiate the treaty with
Japan this month after certain South Korean fishing boats were
found to have been excluded from the original treaty.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's partial reshuffle, President Kim Dae-jung
appointed Seo Jung-uck, former president of SK Telecom and a
career engineer to replace his science and technology minister
Kang Chang-hee.
</P>
<P>
Kang has resigned to concentrate on campaigning for a seat in
next year's National Assembly elections.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-Aided Health Project Launched in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A health project for the
improvement of maternal and child health care in Myanmar was
launched here Tuesday with the aid of Japan and the involvement of
the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The Japanese assistance of 2.7 million U.S. dollars is to be
provided to Myanmar for the procurement of necessary medicines and
medical equipment to be distributed to the country's rural areas
through the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
Notes on the project were exchanged between Kazuo Asakai,
Japanese ambassador to Myanmar, and Juan Aguilar Leon, UNICEF
representative, in the presence of Myanmar Deputy Minister of
Health U Mya Oo and a visiting group of Japanese parliamentarians
led by Shomei Yokouchi.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador said at the launching ceremony that the
aid aims to reduce the child and prenatal death rates in Myanmar
which are currently running high.
</P>
<P>
The turning-out of trained staff in the health sector of
Myanmar in the cooperation program is essential to improving the
primary health care services in the country's rural areas and to
decreasing maternal and child mortality, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the support of non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) will also further increase the chances for success.
</P>
<P>
Japan has been contributing to improving the standard of health
care in Myanmar and its cooperation extended to the country
included some hospital and nursery projects involving technical
assistance, he said, adding that Japan has also provided
grass-roots assistance to many local Myanmar NGOs in the health
sector.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF representative said at the ceremony that Japan's
grant aid will be a strong boost for the current Myanmar-UNICEF
country program.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia and Japan have
reaffirmed the importance they attach to the early accession of
candidates including China to the World Trade Organization (WTO).

the trade interests of the wider membership of the WTO and the
developing countries could benefit substantially from active
participation in the negotiations.

negotiations on industrial tariff, as well as the mandated

<HEADLINE> Rolls-Royce Keen to Develop Technical Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Rolls-Royce will continue to
develop cooperation with China in aero engine technology, a senior
official of the company said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce will develop its already significant collaboration
with China in the field of gas turbine technology, the UK-based
company's Director of Engineering and Technology Phil Ruffles said
at a two-day symposium on aero engine technology which opened here
today.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium are experts from Rolls-Royce, BMW
Rolls-Royce, and some of China's aviation industry companies and
research institutes, and airlines.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce has enjoyed a close relationship and business
activities with China since 1962. The company set up its Beijing
office in 1978 and launched a number of research programs with
Chinese universities and research institutes last year, according
to Ruffles.
</P>
<P>
Apart from technological cooperation, Rolls-Royce has set up a
training center in collaboration with the General Administration
of Civil Aviation of China in Tianjin. It has also helped train
senior administrative professionals for China's State Economic and
Trade Commission, and the State Development Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
As a global company, Rolls-Royce currently has established
production lines in 14 countries, Ruffles said, adding engines

<HEADLINE> China Puts Forward Proposals on UN Human Rights Agency Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The work and reform of the United
Nations Commission on Human Rights should move with the times so
it can better meet changing needs, said the head of the Chinese
delegation at the commission's 55th session here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The present age is of peace and development," said Ambassador
Qiao Zonghuai. "Dialogue and cooperation have become the choices
of many countries. Power politics and political confrontation in
international relations are getting increasingly unpopular."
</P>
<P>
To help the current session achieve concrete results in
promoting international cooperation in the field of human rights,
Qiao raised the following proposals:
</P>
<P>
-- Carrying out the principle of democratic consultation and
opposing monopoly by a minority of people. As the principal body
for human rights in the United Nations, the commission should
listen to the views of member states on every issue, give full
play to democracy, improve the transparency of decision-making and
promote the process of reform on the basis of broad participation
and full consultation.
</P>
<P>
-- Resolution of differences through dialogue on the basis of
equality and opposition to confrontation. The practice of
political confrontation among countries with different ideologies
and social systems during the Cold War should be discarded, and
differences should be properly resolved through dialogue and
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
-- Dealing with the two categories of human rights in a
comprehensive and balanced way and putting all categories of
rights on an equally important footing. At present, special
attention should be given to redress the imbalance towards the
right to subsistence and the right to development.
</P>
<P>
-- Correctly handling the relation between universality and
particularity, and respecting the choices of every country to
promote and protect human rights. Any attempt to insist on only
one model or one way of doing things, and lodge arbitrary
accusations on and interfere in other options can only be
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that we can initiate a good start at this session so as
to lead a commission of democracy, dialogue and cooperation into
the 21st century," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
The 55th session of the 53-member human rights commission
convenes from March 22 to April 30, 1999.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Import of Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese trade official
announced here on Tuesday that China will increase the importing
of technology to help upgrade China's technology level and raise
the competitiveness of export commodities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Xiang, vice-minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC), addressing a seminar on technology imports
which opened here today said that China will step up the efforts
on technology imports in five areas:
</P>
<P>
-- the main import focus of technology will be shifted from
government to enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- joint imports by research institutes and manufacturers will
replace unilateral import by companies;
</P>
<P>
-- the main focus of the imports will be shifted from to
production and on the replacement of China-invented technology for
international cooperation;
</P>
<P>
-- Soft technology and necessary key equipment will take the
place of production lines; and
</P>
<P>
-- Import items will be gradually changed from products to
basic industrial technology, leading technology and hi- and new
technology.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister stressed that all departments of foreign
trade and economic cooperation should step up management of
technology import information and refine relevant regulations on
such management.
</P>
<P>
He also urged officials to enhance multi-lateral industrial
cooperation and the protection of intellectual property rights in
the import of technology.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China has imported a total of 28,000
items of technology, involving a contractual volume of 111.379
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Imported technology over the past 20 years has helped Chinese

lags behind advanced foreign nations in terms of technology, and

<HEADLINE> Large Steel Plant to Be Built in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Two foreign developers will spend
some two billion U.S. dollars to build a large steel plant in
Mozambique's southern province of Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper said Tuesday that the Industrial
Development Corporation of South Africa (IDC) and Enron Southern
Africa Development Ltd. , a U.S. company, have won positive
response from the Mozambican government.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign developers in 1997 formally expressed their
intention of establishing the plant and submitted a detailed
report on the feasibility of the project. The plant will have a
designed annual production capacity of 3.4 million tons of steel
and one million tons of iron.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Mozambican government approved a principle
agreement on the establishment of the steel plant, which will
create some 6,200 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The project also includes a magnetite refinery to be set up in
Phalaborwa in South Africa and a 345-kilometer railroad linking
the refinery to Mozambique so that every year some six million
tons of iron ore can be transferred from Phalaborwa to Maputo.
And the plant to be built in Maputo will import ore.
</P>
<P>
Roads, bridges, water pipes and warehouses are also included in
the project. And the needed wharfs will be enlarged, too.
</P>
<P>
The steel plant is the third large project the country has
undertaken since peace was achieved in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The other two projects are the Maputo Express Highway and an
aluminum plant which cost 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. Both are now
under construction.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russia Tuesday denied an Azeri
official's claim that the jet fighters carried by a Russian cargo
plane were intended for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told a
press briefing that the load belongs to Kazakhstan although he did
not mention the contents of the cargo.
</P>
<P>
Vafa Guluzade, an adviser to President Haydar Aliyev, said
earlier Tuesday that Azerbaijan had intercepted a Russian cargo
plane carrying six MiG jet fighters destined for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian spokesman said the plane belonged to a private
Russian company Polyot and it was on its way to the Slovak capital
of Bratislava.
</P>
<P>
The Russian AN-124 cargo plane arrived in Baku, Azerbaijan's
capital, last Thursday for refueling, according to a Turan news
agency report.
</P>
<P>
But customs officials prevented the plane from leaving after
finding the jet fighters and other military equipment aboard the
giant cargo plane along with 30 pilots and technicians.

<HEADLINE> Major Steel Firm Reverses Money-Losing Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Changcheng Special Steel Co.
Ltd. accumulated a deficit of more than one billion yuan between
1995 and March 1998 to become the largest loss-making state-owned
company in China's metallurgical industry.
</P>
<P>
However, the company generated profits totaling 73.49 million
yuan at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Executive Deputy General Manager Wu Weiyu attributed the marked
change to the current government program to invigorate the state
sector.
</P>
<P>
The company's total debt soared to over 4.2 billion yuan by the
end of 1997, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
the 30-year old company with 5.2 billion yuan of total assets
was acquired by an investment firm in June 1998, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
"The period created bitter memories," recalled Wu, adding that
"no bank was willing to provide loans."
</P>
<P>
The unpaid non-performing debts totaling 1.8 billion yuan were
written off with the help of the government reserve fund
established to assist state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The new owner invested some 300 million yuan to install
advanced equipment and introduced a series of reform measures to
inject new vitality into the teetering company.
</P>
<P>
Over 7,000 workers were laid off in the second half of 1998,
with management withholding 60 percent of salaries for the
remaining 21,000 workers and establishing new wage scales based on
performance.
</P>
<P>
Managers at different levels were subject to immediate
dismissal for failing to achieve annual targets.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to continue reform efforts over the next two
years and will reduce its total workforce to around 15,000 from
the present 21,000.
</P>
<P>
"There is vast potential for the development of money-losing
state-owned enterprises," said Wu. "I'm fully confident of the
government plan to basically revive medium-sized and large
companies within three years."

<HEADLINE> Moroccan's Pullout Gives Thai More Hope for WTO Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand appears more likely to
win the top post of the World Trade Organization (WTO) after
Morocco's candidate Hassan Abouyoub pulled out of the race, Thai
Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Surin told reporters that lobbying had already begun to win
Hassan's backers over to Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Commerce
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
Surin said Thai embassies around the world are trying to ensure
that countries, which had supported Hassan as their first
preference, now shift their backing to Supachai.
</P>
<P>
"There are two choices left and we are likely to receive more
support for Supachai," Surin said.
</P>
<P>
The selection of a new WTO director-general has become a
two-man race between Supachai and former New Zealand Prime
Minister Mike Moore, reports reaching here from Geneva said.
</P>
<P>
Canadian High Commissioner in London Roy Maclaren, another
candidate, enjoyed little support and thus had little chance of
winning the post, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The United States reportedly prefers Moore, the most popular
second choice candidate.
</P>
<P>
Hassan withdrew from the race after losing his crucial support
base in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Supachai flew to France Monday night to meet representatives of
the European Union (EU) about several issues, including the WTO,
Surin said.
</P>
<P>
Consultations among WTO members have been going on for months
and they are to establish which candidate can be appointed by
consensus. Only if that cannot be established could a formal vote
be held.
</P>
<P>
But diplomats and trade officials say they would prefer to
avoid such an outcome, arguing that the WTO director-general has
to be the "candidate of all the members" and not a figure whose
appointment is opposed by anyone.
</P>
<P>
Until now, the WTO and its predecessor the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade have always been headed by a European, and
developing countries have been increasingly vocal in calling for
appointment of a figure from their midst.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has promised to bridge the gap between developing
economies and richer nations if he wins the position.
</P>
<P>
Supachai has already won backing from Japan and other Asian
countries and has earned international respect for his role in
ensuring that Thailand resisted pressure to put up trade barriers
in reaction to the financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Handover of Libyan Suspects Unconditional: Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Tuesday in Cape Town that the handing over of
two Libyan suspects in the 1988 Lockerbie bombing was
unconditional.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his first official engagement since his return from
Libya at the weekend, Mandela said there were no conditions
attached to the delivery of the two men, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is credited with resolving the deadlock over the pair's
trial which is scheduled to take place in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
"They will be delivered on or before the sixth of April.
Collateral matters can be discussed separately, but the delivery
is unconditional," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was replying to whether the trial of six top officials
of former U.S. president Ronald Reagan's administration might
scupper the handing over.
</P>
<P>
A Libyan court Monday continued hearing the case "for
premeditated murder" against the six Americans for their
involvement in the April 1986 bombing of Tripoli, the capital,
and Benghazi, a town in northeastern Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force carried out air strikes against the Bab
Al-Aziziya barracks in Tripoli, the headquarters of Libyan leader
Muammar Qaddafi, and Benghazi. Among those killed was Qaddafi's
adopted daughter. The strike was in response to an attack on U.S.
servicemen at a night club in Berlin, Germany, for which
Washington held Tripoli responsible.
</P>
<P>
The court asked the prosecution to speed up proceedings. It
called for the accused to be "informed quickly of the dates of the
trial so that they can appear, or if necessary, steps be taken to
arrest them in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
The next hearing was set for September 22.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) - Hundreds of Beduin fleeing into
Israel from the Sinai desert earlier this month were deported
back to Egypt Tuesday, two days after the High Court of Justice
rejected their request to stay in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The deportation also came after Egypt has promised to protect
the safety of the 800 Beduin, who crossed the Israeli-Egyptian
border on March 15 to escape a tribal feud, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers in charge of the deportation said they met
no opposition when asking the Beduin onto dozens of buses,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The Beduin, members of the Azazmeh tribe which has branches
in both Israel and Egypt, have sought refuge in the Jewish state,
saying they feared for their lives after being sent back to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But the High Court of Justice rejected their petition on the
ground that they slipped into Israel illegally.
</P>
<P>
For the last week, the Beduin have lived in camps built by the
Israeli army in the Negev near the border. The army declared the
area a closed military zone and prevented their Israeli relatives
from entering it.

<P>
SINGAPORE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Singapore authorities conducted
682 raids and inspections in their enforcement against piracy,
arresting 157 persons and seizing more than 200 million pirated
articles, the Trade Development Board (TDB) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
TDB said in a press release that the Singapore Police Force,
Film and Publications Department, Customs and Excise Department
and the intellectual property agencies joined efforts to maintain
enforcement and as a result raids, border checks and arrests were
conducted by the authorities throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
It also said intensive investigations by the police into these
illegal activities helped them smash five syndicates involved in
the production, distribution and sale of pirated items in two
island-wide operations conducted in August and October last year.
</P>
<P>
Almost 1.4 million pirated articles were seized in these
operations and a total of 89 people arrested, it added.
</P>
<P>
Singapore pursued a multi-pronged approach to fight piracy in
1998, namely through a combination of legal, policy, education and
enforcement initiatives and this approach yielded results in
strengthening the protection regime on intellectual property.

<HEADLINE> Computerized Automatic System to Replace Furnace in Machining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China is planning to replace a
large number of industrial furnaces and chimneys as a result of
the introduction of high-tech machining systems.
</P>
<P>
Using a computerized controller, a 40-kilogram stress relief
device can carry out vibration treatment on metal structures as
heavy as 50 tons.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the basic machining process was usually conducted
in a big furnace.
</P>
<P>
An official with the "Torch Program" Center of the Ministry of
Science and Technology said here today at a press conference that
the application of the patented automatic system has been listed
as one of the country's major projects for industrialization of
high and new technology products.
</P>
<P>
The system is used for removing remaining stress from metal
structures during their welding, casting and cutting, in an effort
to improve the product's quality and precision.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that compared with the popular heat-treatment
techniques, the vibration stress relief system consumes much less
energy and requires less investment.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Administration of Machinery Industry
and State Environmental Protection Administration believe that the
application of the new technique is good for both the technical
upgrading of the machinery industry generally and for curbing air
pollution in the cities.

<HEADLINE> Hackett Breaks 10-year-old Swimming World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Grant Hackett shattered the
oldest world record in men's swimming by clocking one minute 46.67
seconds for 200 meters freestyle at the Australian national
championships in Brisbane, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Swimming the first leg of a 4x200m relay, the 18-year-old
Australian took two-hundredths of a second off Italian Giorgio
Lamberti's previous mark of 1:46.69 set at the European
championships in Bonn in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Hackett, reigning world champion over 1,500 meters, had caused
a big surprise when he beat 200 meters world champion Michael Klim
and 400 meters world champion Ian Thorpe to win the Australian 200
meters crown on Monday.
</P>
<P>
His winning time of 1:46.99 on Monday was one of the fastest in
history but Hackett was able to slice another 0.32 off that on
Tuesday to prove that his earlier victory was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
Hackett had been a member of the Australian 4x200 meters relay
that won gold at the 1998 world championships but lost his place
in the team for the Commonwealth Games and had to watch from the
poolside as the new quartet, including both Thorpe and Klim,
smashed the world record in his absence.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves 7th Letter of Intent to IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet Tuesday approved
the draft seventh letter of intent to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), sources close to the cabinet said.
</P>
<P>
The letter allows the government to run a 6-percent budget
deficit of the gross domestic product for the 1998-99 fiscal year
ending September 30. In the previous agreement signed in December,
the IMF agreed to a budget deficit of 5 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
But as the economy has continued to slow down because of poor
consumer demand and lack of spending, the IMF had agreed to a
bigger deficit to simulate demand, said the sources, who refused
to be named.
</P>
<P>
The seventh letter, which followed the IMF's latest quarterly
review of Thai economic progress, also contained the announcement
of a much-awaited economic stimulus package that would be valued
at 130 billion baht (3.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But besides detailing the value of the package, the letter,
copies of which were released earlier Tuesday, would not go into
details of measures to be taken and allocations of funds.
</P>
<P>
The sources said 53 billion baht (1.4 billion dollars) of the
funds for the package would be from loans to be obtained soon
under Japan's regional economic aid plan and from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 77 billion baht (2.1 billion dollars) would be
used to accommodate increased government spending and cushion
planned tax cuts and in measures to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
As required by the IMF, Thailand must write its commitments to
economic reforms in quarterly letters to the IMF in exchange for
tranches of the 17.2-billion-dollar bailout package approved in
August 1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia-built Satellite to Be Launched in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The first ever
Malaysian-built satellite, "TiungSAT-1", will be launched into
orbit this September, Science, Technology and Environment Minister
Law Hieng Ding said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The microsatellite built at a cost of 28 million ringgit (7.368
million U.S. dollars) is scheduled to be launched from the Russian
Space Agency (RSA) launch pad in Baikonour in Kazakhstan, Law said
at the signing of an agreement on Science and Technology
cooperation between Astronautic Technology (M) Sdn Bhd, the
TiungSAT-1 owner, and the RSA here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 50 kilogram satellite applications included meteorology,
disaster mitigation and management, pollution monitoring, remote
surveillance, private e-mail communication and education and
research.
</P>
<P>
It was developed, built and completed by eight Malaysian
engineers in Surrey Space Center, Britain.
</P>
<P>
The microsatellite project was launched by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad in 1995, and the development of the
microsatellite began in 1996 and was completed by October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Law said although Malaysia paid for the technology and the
construction of TiungSAT-1 was done overseas, it had nevertheless
enabled Malaysia for the first time ever to gain tremendous
experience and confidence in the field.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the scheduled launch in September would be a success
and usher a perfect entry of Malaysia's involvement in the space
industry.

<HEADLINE> More Kenyan Girls HIV Positive Than Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRBOI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- There are more girls than boys
who are HIV positive in Kenya, said a report jointly compiled by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Kenyan
government.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "fighting the war against HIV/AIDS in
Kenya - an emergency plan of action" , said that among girls aged
15 to 19 attending ante-natal clinics, "22 percent are HIV
positive while only six percent of boys are so affected."
</P>
<P>
The main mode of transmission has been identified as
heterosexual contacts, mother-to-child and blood transfusion, said
the report which was published at the Daily Nation newspaper
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It added that due to the scourge, life expectancy for Kenyans
is expected to drop to between 53 and 54 years by 2005, against
64.5 years in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A total of 420,000 AIDS cases were reported to the Ministry of
Health by the end of February this year, saying that an estimated
1.5 million Kenyans are living with HIV virus and 90,000 of them
are children, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Results of protective surveillance for 1997 showed that over 20
percent of expectant mother in Kisumu, Nakuru and Busia, all in
western Kenya, were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
prevalence of the disease in Kenya has risen from 3.1 percent
in 1990 to nine percent in 1997, with the urban average between 12
and 13 percent at present and the rural areas between eight to
nine percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Tension Rises Again in Sambas, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tension rose again in Sambas
district in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province Monday night as
mobs brutally attacked evacuees, shooting them with bows and
arrows and homemade weapons, reports from the district said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We regret the tragedy," provincial military commander Col.
Encip Kadarusman told Antara News Agency during a phone interview
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kadarusman said police officers were unable to protect the
people fleeing the unrest in Sambas as they themselves were
targets.
</P>
<P>
A serviceman was hit by an arrow and brought to a hospital,
Antara quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police clashed with local people some two km off
Singkawang district. One was wounded by a rubber bullet.
</P>
<P>
At least six companies of anti-riot troops were flown from the
Halim Perdanakusuma military airport in Jakarta to Pontianak,
capital of West Kalimantan province, Tuesday to help 2,000 local
security personnel quell the unrest in Sambas district.
</P>
<P>
The 745 troops from the Air Force were flown aboard seven
Hercules planes.
</P>
<P>
Since ethnic violence in Sambas erupted last week between
Madurese settlers and members of the local Malay community, 165
people have died in clashes and 2,142 houses have been burned
down.
</P>
<P>
The week-long clashes have forced some 12,000 people, mostly
women and children, to flee Sambas to Pontianak.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Malays make up 40 percent of the population of West
Kalimantan province. The Madurese make up around 2 percent and
most have come to the province under a government transmigration
scheme to resettle people from more crowded islands.
</P>
<P>
The Malays were backed up by Dayaks, the region's other main
indigenous group.
</P>
<P>
The unrest was the worst in the province since early 1997 when
similar battles broke out between Dayaks and Madurese, leaving 300
dead.

<HEADLINE> ECIC Extends Premium Discount to Help Boost HK Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Export Credit
Insurance Corporation (ECIC) has decided to extend the premium
discount it had offered earlier to new and existing policyholders
for six more months and the waiver of policy fees for a year.
</P>
<P>
The ECIC said in a statement Tuesday that the extension is
aimed at helping boost Hong Kong's declining export since the
overall economic climate remains sluggish.
</P>
<P>
In September 1998, the ECIC initiated a scheme that entitled
all existing and new policyholders to a 5 percent discount on
premium payments for shipments effected from October 1, 1998 to
March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The policy fee will also be waived for another year -- from
April 1, 1999 to March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
ECIC Commissioner Thomas Yiu said that a recent survey
conducted by the ECIC among some 100 ECIC policyholders in various
industries showed all but toy exporters anticipated exports to
continue to fall or achieve no growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that Hong Kong's exports including re-exports
during the last 12 months ending February 1999 declined 7.6
percent from the same period in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
The ECIC was founded by statute in 1966 to provide export
credit insurance to protect Hong Kong exporters against risks of
non-payment for export of goods and services.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti-French Ties Unaffected by Dispute: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Kuwait
and France have not been affected by a French court ruling of
freezing Kuwaiti funds in the European country, Kuwaiti Foreign
Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah has stated.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and France were not locked in a diplomatic crisis
following the court decision, Sabah, also first deputy prime
minister, said in a statement to local Arabic daily Al-Rai
Al-A'am published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A French court ruled on March 11 to block 90 million
French Francs of Kuwaiti funds over a commercial dispute
related to a contract signed in 1991 between Sofremi Co., a
French company specialized in mine clearing, and Kuwait on
clearing mines left behind by Iraqi troops.
</P>
<P>
The freeze was lifted last Saturday after an agreement was
reached between Sofremi and its agent in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Sabah said the case of freezing the Kuwaiti accounts
"originally involved the Kuwaiti agent and the French Interior
Ministry. Thus it cannot be described as a diplomatic crisis."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait lodged an official complaint with Paris after the
move which did not develop to the level of a diplomatic
crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
The French government had expressed hope that the court
ruling would not affect "excellent" relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
recently that the two countries had been engaged in close
consultations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
"We have excellent relations with Kuwait in all areas. The
recent visit to Kuwait by (French Foreign) Minister Hubert Vedrine
confirmed this," the spokesman said.

JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has actually achieved
self-sufficiency in corn production with a total output of 10.05
million tons last year, while the domestic needs for the commodity
was only 9 million tons, Antara News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have actually achieved self-sufficiency in corn production.
And the most important thing to do is how we can maintain such an
achievement," said Jafar Hafsah, secretary of the Ministry of
Agriculture's mass guidance for food crops agency.
</P>
<P>
He said higher corn production in 1998 was mainly the result of
the expansion of the corn planting acreage and the intensification
program.
</P>
<P>
More farmers grew hybrid corn seeds, making the national
production significantly increased.
</P>

"If all farmers grow hybrid corn seeds, with a total planting
acreage of three to four million hectares, we will be able to
maintain corn self-sufficiency," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hafsah further said this year's national corn production is
estimated to reach 11 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"With such a level of production, Indonesia will be able to
export more corn to Thailand and Malaysia," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the year 2000, Indonesia's corn production is projected to
reach 11.5 million tons with a total planting acreage of 4.21
million hectares, while in the following year, corn production is
estimated to reach 12.01 million tons with a total planting
acreage of 4.22 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
"Under such estimates, we will have a corn production surplus
of some 4 million tons by the year 2001. By that time, the
country's self-sufficiency in corn production will be more
reliable," Hafsah was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Two Candidates Left to Run for New WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The sudden withdrawal of Morocco's
Hassan Abouyoub has left a Thai and a New Zealander the only two
candidates competent to go on with their campaign for the post of
the new head of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
With only one week left before WTO members make their final
decision, the former Moroccan trade minister announced his
withdrawal from the competition on Monday.
</P>
<P>
With the Canadian candidate, Roy MacLaren, virtually eliminated
from the campaign, Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand and Michael
Moore of New Zealand have become the finalists out of the four
candidates.
</P>
<P>
On March 1, 118 out of the 134 WTO members expressed their
preferences during the consultation process kept with "utmost
confidentiality."
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Supachai Panitchpakdi and Morocco's Hassan Abouyoub
got support from 39 and 35 WTO members respectively as their first
preference. They were followed by Canada's Roy MacLaren (23) and
New Zealand's Mike Moore (21).
</P>
<P>
However, Abouyoub dropped to the third position last week,
according to Ali Said Mchumo, chairman of the WTO's ruling General
Council and Tanzania's ambassador to the body.
</P>
<P>
The question now is to whom those members who backed Abouyoub
and MacLaren earlier will switch their support.
</P>
<P>
The new deadline for the selection of WTO's new chief will be
March 30. The 134-member WTO has failed to meet at least three
former deadlines to reach consensus on who will succeed the
Italian director-general Renato Ruggiero.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero has said that he will not seek re-election once his
current term expires next April.

<HEADLINE> ADB Provides Loan to Cambodia For Road Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has agreed to provide a 40 million U.S. dollar loan to help
upgrade Cambodia's 160-km highway Route 1, which links the capital
city Phnom Penh to Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement was signed by Finance Minister Keat Chhon on
Saturday while attending the third annual ASEAN Finance Ministers'
meeting in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Cambodia will pay 10.7 million dollars
toward the project.
</P>
<P>
The 40-year-long loan has a 10-year grace period and carries a
one percent annual interest rate, the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The road improvement project, which is estimated to cost 50.7
million dollars, is slated to be completed by June 2003, according
to a Ministry of Finance statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has received 100 million U.S. dollars from the ADB to
upgrade a 65-km stretch of the highway on its side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Traffic and trade flows between the two countries would be
boosted by the upgrading of the 240-km-long road which runs from
Ho Chi Minh City to Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to greatly contribute to the
development of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Works is evaluating bids from private
companies for the work on the highway.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the project will be able to start later
this year.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Plans to Purchase New Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides confirmed on Monday night there are plans for another
defense system to meet Cyprus' security needs, the local media
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the occasion of the
completion of the first year of his second term in office, he also
said even though the Russian missiles were eventually diverted to
Greece, the Cyprus government still believes an anti-aircraft
weapons system is needed to protect the Paphos air base.
</P>
<P>
"We won't leave Cypus without a defense weapons system," said
Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Declaring Cyprus is looking for anti-aircraft missiles,
Clerides added his previous commitment to the U.N. - in freezing
all weapons purchases to facilitate a dialogue - has now lapsed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered S-300 anti-aircraft missiles from Russia in
January 1997, to protect its Paphos air base, about 150
kilometers southwest of Nicosia. But Turkey repeatedly threatened
to launch a preemptive strike if the missiles were installed on
the island, leading to Clerides' agreement not to deploy the
missiles in Cyprus but in Greece's Crete island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> China to Initiate Fishing Ban in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China plans to initiate a summer
fishing ban in the South China Sea to preserve marine resources,
according to Vice-Minister of Agriculture Qi Jingfa.
</P>
<P>
Trawlers and purse seine fishing will be banned from June 1 to
July 31 in the northern part of the sea north to 12 degrees north
latitude.
</P>
<P>
China will also extend the ban by an additional two weeks in
the northern section of the Yellow Sea north to 35 degrees north
latitude. The fishing ban in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea
will be lifted on September 15, according Qi.
</P>
<P>
China adopted an absolute fishing ban in the East and Yellow
seas in 1995. The moratorium sparked an annual rise in total
output for aquatic products in related areas.
</P>
<P>
Qi noted that overfishing significantly depleted marine
resources in the South China Sea over a period of years. He added
that the declining output for aquatic products output and the
sliding economic returns of the fisheries industry have posed a
severe problem.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, director of the ministry's fisheries department,
said that the ban will involve more than 30,000 boats and one
million fishermen, including some 800 boats from Hong Kong and
Macao.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted a "zero growth rate" for this year's marine
output in order to reverse the trend, said Qi, adding that the
comprehensive fishing ban will help to ensure fulfillment of the
target.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of people who
were declared bankrupt in Malaysia last year rose by about 9.7
percent, a senior government official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8,110 people were declared bankrupt in the country
in 1998 against 7,395 in 1997, Deputy Minister in the Prime
Minister's Department Ibrahim Ali said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, a total of 1,588 companies were also ordered to wind
up their operations compared to 1,134 in 1997, against an average
of 1,000 companies receiving winding-up orders every year, he said
after visiting the Official Assignee Department here.
</P>
<P>
"This shows that the economic slowdown which hit the country is
not that bad as made out by certain groups," Ibrahim was quoted by
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Between 1950 and last year, a total of 67,986 people were
declared bankrupt in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He advised people who had been declared bankrupt to directly
contact the Official Assignee Department as soon as possible in
order to seek help to have their case discharged.
</P>
<P>
According to Ibrahim, most bankrupts go through third parties
to have themselves discharged.

<HEADLINE> Educated Chinese Enjoy Larger Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The education background of
Chinese citizens has emerged as a major factor determining their
ability to obtain larger apartments in major cities throughout the
nation.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey revealed that individuals with a master's
degrees live in apartments approximately 10 sq.m. larger than
units inhabited by people with a primary school education.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 48,704 families in major cities such as
Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Guangzhou, as well as Chengdu in
the southwest, Shenyang in the northeast, Jinan, Fuzhou and
Nanjing in the east, Wuhan in central China, Xi'an in the
northwest, and Kunming in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
The average living space for individuals with a master's degree
was 53.5 square meters. People holding undergraduate degree enjoy
living space totaling 51.4 sq.m., with figure for vocational,
primary, junior middle and high school graduates dropping to 43.3
sq.m. or less, according to the Tuesday edition of Investment
Weekly published by the Economic Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed people earning higher wages also tend
to live in larger apartments. The average floor space for families
with monthly income ranging from 2,000 to 2,499 yuan was 47.7 sq.m.
, with the figure rising to 58.9 sq.m. for families with average
monthly incomes of over 6,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Survey results indicated that over a third of families with
monthly incomes ranging between 2,000 and 2,499 yuan owned
apartments. Some 48.2 percent of families with monthly incomes of
over 6,000 yuan live in private apartments or houses.

<HEADLINE> More Kenyan Girls HIV Positive Than Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIRBOI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- There are more girls than boys
who are HIV positive in Kenya, said a report jointly compiled by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Kenyan
government.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "fighting the war against HIV/AIDS in
Kenya - an emergency plan of action" , said that among girls aged
15 to 19 attending ante-natal clinics, "22 percent are HIV
positive while only six percent of boys are so affected."
</P>
<P>
The main mode of transmission has been identified as
heterosexual contacts, mother-to-child and blood transfusion, said
the report which was published at the Daily Nation newspaper
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It added that due to the scourge, life expectancy for Kenyans
is expected to drop to between 53 and 54 years by 2005, against
64.5 years in 1995.
</P>
<P>
A total of 420,000 AIDS cases were reported to the Ministry of
Health by the end of February this year, saying that an estimated
1.5 million Kenyans are living with HIV virus and 90,000 of them
are children, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Results of protective surveillance for 1997 showed that over 20
percent of expectant mother in Kisumu, Nakuru and Busia, all in
western Kenya, were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
prevalence of the disease in Kenya has risen from 3.1 percent
in 1990 to nine percent in 1997, with the urban average between 12
and 13 percent at present and the rural areas between eight to
nine percent, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Obliged to Increase Value Added Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said Monday night Cyprus is obliged to increase the Value
Added Tax as a further step toward entering the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, Clerides acknowledged there will
be many difficulties on the way for Cyprus' accession to the EU,
but said "we will handle" all problems, Cyprus News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not envisage any dangers that Cyprus will be
left out of the EU for solely financial reasons. Cyprus applied
for accession to EU in 1990 and accession negotiations began last
March.
</P>
<P>
He said the closer Cyprus approaches the EU, the more urgent a
settlement is for the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
"The accession course will prove to be a catalyst in a
settlement of the political problem," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also said Cyprus' accession negotiations has reached a
substantial stage, with a membership estimated in January 2003.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states have cautioned that if the Cyprus problem
is not solved, the island will not be allowed a membership.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides have so far yielded no
substantial progress.

<HEADLINE> French FM Says NATO Strikes Against Serbs Will Be Rapid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 23 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said on Tuesday that if U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke's
mission in Belgrade fails, air strikes by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) against Serb military targets would
come rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Radio Europe 1, Vedrine said that the
objective of a NATO action is to "prevent and break (Yugoslav)
capacity for repression" of Kosovo Albanians as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"It would not last long between the end of this mission (by
Holbrooke) and the beginning of the operations, which will, for
the primary objective, stop this repression and prevent it from
taking on a greater scale," Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed that French warplanes would participate in such
operations.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of reopening talks on Kosovo, Vedrine said
that "a serious opening" of attitude by Belgrade would be enough.
</P>
<P>
"One turns to the use of force only as a last resort, when he
has used up all other options," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he saw little prospect of avoiding military
strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I was obliged to say this morning that I don't see any opening
which could interrupt the course of events as have already been
outlined," he said.

<HEADLINE> 14 Terrorist Suspects in Egypt Referred to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- General Prosecutor of Egypt
Counselor Ragaa Al-Araby has ordered 14 terrorist suspects be
referred to trial before the Supreme Security Court, the Arabic
daily Al-Ahram reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill of indictment accused the suspects of plotting to
suspend the constitution, transgressing on freedom and rights of
citizens and jeopardizing the national security, unity and social
peace, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It listed 21 counts conducted by the suspects, including
killing and wounding policemen and civilians, carrying out plots
and staging assassinations on officials, from 1994 to 1996 in
Egypt's southern provinces of Fayum, Beni Suef and Menya.
</P>
<P>
The governorates, 85-220 kilometers south of Cairo, are
believed to be strongholds of Egypt's Islamic militants, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The 14 accused were part of the 433 people involved in the
cases, with the others being killed in shootouts with the police
or being acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Islamic extremists began an insurgency in 1992 in an attempt to
topple Egypt's secular government and install a strict Islamic
rule. More than 1,200 policemen, civilians and terrorists have
been killed in conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's security courts usually slap harsh punishments on
terrorists.

LONDON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday night gave President
Milosevic his last chance to agree to a Kosovo peace deal and
escape NATO airstrikes. But the Yugoslav leader's political and
military regime seemed set on confrontation with the West.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Lorry drivers Monday threatened to blockade ports after
bringing severe disruption in central London in support of their
campaign to force the government to reverse its increases in fuel
and vehicle duty.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain and Germany were Monday night edging towards a
compromise on reform of the European Union's budget that would
allow Tony Blair to keep Britain's annual rebate while making
concessions on sharing the financial burden of EU enlargement.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States raised the stakes in the transatlantic
trade wars Monday night, warning that if Europe does not start
importing hormone-treated American beef it will impose punitive
tariffs on 900 million U.S. dollars of European goods.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The British government Monday night was accused of
misleading the public on tax after admitting it had ignored the 2.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Offshore Banks Post Losses in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The offshore banking
industry in Malaysia's Labuan International Offshore Financial
Center (IOFC) posted an unaudited loss of 268.9 million U.S.
dollars at the end of 1998 against a profit of 120.3 million U.S.
dollars in 1997, according to an official report issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loss for the first time since the establishment of the
Labuan IOFC eight years ago was attributed to higher provisions
made amounting to 456.1 million U.S. dollars by the offshore
banks.
</P>
<P>
The higher level of provision was a prudent move by the
offshore banks to ensure that enough capital is available to
absorb possible losses due to the deterioration of their assets as
a result of the regional financial crisis, the Labuan Offshore
Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) said in its 1998 annual
report.
</P>
<P>
In terms of sources and uses of funds, total assets of the
Labuan offshore banks declined by 4.9 billion U.S. dollars or 18
percent in 1998 from an increase of 9 billion U.S. dollars or 49
percent in 1997, mainly due to reductions in loans and advances
and in balances due from the head office and branches outside
Malaysia, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the industry continued to experience a resource gap
totaling 12.4 billion U.S. dollars, almost similar to that of 12.3
billion U.S. dollars recorded in the previous year, it said.
</P>
<P>
There was also a slight drop in the deposits of non-residents
to 2.2 billion U.S. dollars from 2.396 billion U.S. dollars in
1997, indicating continued confidence among foreign investors in
the offshore financial market in Labuan, it said.
</P>
<P>
Total loans outstanding declined by 13.3 percent to 15.1
billion U.S. dollars in 1998 from 17.5 billion U.S. dollars in
1997, it said. By the end of 1998, outstanding loans of the
Malaysian-based offshore banks dropped by 28.8 percent to 3.7
billion U.S. dollars from 5.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Loans by the foreign offshore banks also deteriorated by 7.3
percent to 11.4 billion U.S. dollars against 12.3 billion U.S.
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The non-performing loans (NPLs) of the industry rose to 10.7
percent from 1.1 percent as at 1997, due to the effects of the
regional financial crisis on the Labuan offshore banks as the bulk
of the loan exposures was to customers of the Southeast Asian
countries.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov may cut short his visit to the United States if the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launches air strikes on
Yugoslavia, the Interfax news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Primakov left here earlier Tuesday for the scheduled five-day
trip to attend the 11th session of the Russia-U.S.
intergovernmental commission for scientific, technical and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Quoting informed government sources, Interfax said Moscow
clearly understands that the American side has been informed of
this position.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Primakov reiterated that Russia is categorically
against the use of force in dealing with the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure Tuesday, Primakov held a brief meeting
with Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov, Chief of the General Staff
Anatoly Kvashnin and the leaders of the foreign and military
intelligence services to discuss the situation in Kosovo, said
Andrei Korotkov, Deputy Head of the Government Information
Department
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Kremlin said that President
Boris Yeltsin has received a message from President Bill Clinton
on Kosovo, and that Yeltsin will give a reply after studying the
message, which says "NATO is ready to act" against the Yugoslav
forces in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import 17,000 Tons of Chicken Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines may import some
17,000 tons of chicken meat products in 1999 with an in-quota
tariff of 45 percent, Agriculture Secretary William Dar said.
</P>
<P>
The importation of chicken meat and other poultry products is
allowed, provided prior Veterinary Quarantine Clearance (VQC) is
obtained and proper tariffs and taxes are paid, Dar said.
</P>
<P>
From January to March 16 this year, the Department of
Agriculture (DA) through the Bureau of Animal Industry has issued
VQCs for the import of 5,061 tons of frozen chicken meat,
originating mostly from the United States and Australia.
</P>
<P>
Some of the imported products can be found in some public
markets in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Dar said the entry of other imported chicken meat and other
products reportedly through the duty-free zones is beyond the
jurisdiction of the DA.
</P>
<P>
The DA's role is limited to ensuring that the imported chicken
comply with the country's sanitary and phytosanitary requirements.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- In an interview with Liberation, British Prime Minister Tony
Blair expressed his support to the candidacy by former Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi to the presidency of the European
Commission. He also said that the aim of a possible NATO action
against Serb forces in Kosovo is to prevent a humanitarian
disaster, caused by the fighting in the province.
</P>
<P>
-- Fear is gaining the residents of Pristina, the capital of
Kosovo, after four policemen were killed in an attack Sunday night.
Both the ethnic Albanians and Serbs who have the means are leaving
the city for neighboring Macedonia and Greece for ``holidays'' in
fear of an expansion of the conflict into the city which has been
so far spared from the fightings in the country.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In a text entitled ``rehabilitate the politics'' published
on Tuesday, the French Roman Catholic Episcopate said that the men
and women engaged in politics in France always show their
incapacity to carry out ``profound and necessary'' reforms
oriented toward the future, as are required by their voters. The
episcopate also regretted that many citizens are mere consumers
always asking for more guaranteed rights but accepting less duties.
</P>
<P>
-- The French National Assembly will begin to debate on Tuesday
the draft law presented by the Minister of Justice Elisabeth
Guigou on the protecting the presumption of innocence of the
accused, which will restrict the mandate of police to detain a
suspect during the period of primary investigation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Bans Fish Exports to Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has banned its fish
exports to Europe following the increased poisoning of fish on the
Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
The ban took effect Monday and will last until appropriate
measures are in place to pretect consumers, the New Vision paper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An official with Uganda National Bureau of standards was quoted
as saying that the bureau had instructed fish processors not to
export fish to the European market because they could not
guarantee the quality of fish products.
</P>
<P>
Up to now at least five people have died of eating polsoned
fish, and dozens of fishermen using this method to catch fish
have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
A one-month ban on fish sale has been enacted at markets in
Kampala and Entebbe to ensure the poisoned fish do not
prolifeate. As a result, price of meat has soared up due to the
ban.
</P>
<P>
Europe is the largest market for Uganda's fish products.
Exports to Europe plummeted due to a ban on fish exports imposed
in December of 1997. The value of fish exports dropped by 11.6
percent from 34.5 million dollars in 1996/1997 fiscal year to 31
million dollars in the next fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> PNA Helps Israel Thwart Terrorist Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has helped Israel thwart a serious terrorist
attack, the local daily Yediot Aharonot disclosed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily quoted Israeli security sources as saying the PNA
transfered information on the terrorist attack, which might cause
a large casualties, to Israel about three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has telephoned
the PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat to express his thanks for the
information.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the PNA is making efforts to prevent any
terrorist attack against Israel before the May elections of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that by helping Israel the PNA wants to
convince the United States and the European countries that it has
fulfilled the commitments under the peace agreement signed with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the PNA and Israel signed a land-for-security
agreement in the United States, under which the PNA should take
tougher measures against terrorism in return for the further
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel suspended the implementation of the agreement in
December, citing that the PNA had not fulfilled the
commitments.

intensified fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to
Zambia's Northern Province, bringing the total number to at least
12,000 who have fled to the province from the DRC this month.
</P>
<P>
Kaputa District Council Secretary Edmond Chikasa said Monday
that about 8,700 DRC refugees in the Zambian province are
receiving assistance from the United Nations High Commissioner of

Dominik Bartsch, as saying that 300 new arrivals are recorded in
Kaputa on a daily basis and the total number may have shot up to
at least 12,000 by Monday.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR estimated that about 4,000 other refugees have settled
in local villages without registering with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The general humanitarian situation has been put under control
despite widespread of malaria and at least two cases of measles

Uganda Vice President Specionza Kazibwe, who arrived in Cairo
on Sunday, will sign the agreement during her visit to the
country, Tuesday's New Vision newspaper quoted a press release
from her office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that Egyptian side was deeply impressed
by Uganda's efforts in handling the joint program to control the
water weed.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will also help Uganda with irrigation, water management
and training Ugandans in bio-technology.
</P>
<P>
The wild growth of water hyacinth has seriously polluted the
environment and even blocked the navigation on the lake.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government tried to remove this water plant with
chemical, physical, biological and mechanical methods, but
because of shortage of fund, its efforts are much slower than the
growth of this prolific plant. The total solution to this
environmental problem will cost more than the country can afford.

<HEADLINE> HK Administrative Secretary to Stay on Till Mid-2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Anson Chan, Administrative
Secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
will stay on her current post until the end of June of 2002, HKSAR
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa told a press conference here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I have invited Mrs. Anson Chan to extend her service with the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government as the Chief
Secretary for Administration until June 30, 2002. I am delighted
that Anson has accepted this invitation," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for asking her to stay on, Tung said
that to preserve stability was critical to Hong Kong's continued
success and prosperity. "It has always been my thinking that we
should maintain stability at the top echelon of the HKSAR
Government, so that we can keep a consistent direction for Hong
Kong's future development."
</P>
<P>
Chan, 59, was due to retire in January 2000 according to normal
rules. She had considered her retirement and discussed this matter
with the chief executive. However, the chief executive asked her
to stay on and she was persuaded.
</P>
<P>
"Since July 1, 1997, Anson Chan and I have worked well closely.
The fact is that when we were faced with some really very
difficult and tough challenges, she made some remarkable and
important contributions. She was also there to support me, to give
me the right advice for us to move forward together," Tung told
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed his decision will be welcomed by the
community as a whole.
</P>

in his work, then I am delighted to accept his invitation to stay

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua)-- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, will pay an official
goodwill visit to Greece, Turkey, Syria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and
Thailand from March 30 to April 18, Foreign Ministry spokesman
Sun Yuxi announced here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, Li was invited by President
Apostolos Kaklamanis of the Parliament of Greece, Speaker Hikmet
Cetin of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, President Abdul
Kwder Kaddoura of the People's Council of Syria, Speaker Ilahi
Bukhsh Soomro of the National Assembly of Pakistan, the Government
of Bangladesh, and President Wan Muhamad Nor Matha of the National
Assembly of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Sun said Li's visit is aimed at deepening understanding,
enhancing trust, promoting friendship, expanding cooperation and
advancing the development of the friendly relations and
cooperation between China and the six countries through extensive
contacts with state leaders, parliamentarians and people from all
walks of life.
</P>
<P>
Sun also announced that Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu
will pay an official visit to China from March 31 to April 6 at
the invitation of his Chinese counterpart Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning the current Philippines visit
by Assistant Foreign Minister of China Wang Yi, Sun said the visit
is aimed at initiating a group of mutual trust for the cooperation
in the South China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed in 1996 to establish three working
groups for the bilateral cooperation in the South China Sea, and
the two other groups, namely, groups for fishery and marine
environmental protection, were initiated in 1996 and 1997,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
When it came to European Union's decision not to introduce an
anti-China motion at this year's session of the UN Human Rights
Commission, Sun said that the Chinese government welcomes the
decision, saying "this would help promote China's dialogue and
cooperation with the EU in this regard as well as the overall
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"China has always considered dialogue and cooperation based on
equality and mutual respect as the appropriate approach to settle
differences on the human rights issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the EU foreign ministerial meeting decided
on March 22 not to submit any resolution concerning China's human
rights record and to continue dialogue and cooperation with China
in this sphere.

<P>
Concerning the Kosovo crisis, Sun reiterated that the parties
concerned should solve the issue peacefully by continuing
negotiations in an appropriate and just manner.
</P>
<P>
"The relevant parties should exercise restraint and adopt a
patient and flexible attitude in solving the problem", he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the issue should be resolved politically through
dialogues on the basis of respecting the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and safeguarding the
legitimate rights and interests of all ethnic groups in the Kosovo
region.
</P>
<P>
Sun also cited the report that China has attained two
undesignated cruise missiles from Afghanistan as "baseless and
sheer fabrication."
</P>
<P>
He also denied the charges that China has stolen nuclear
technology from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sun continued to blame a United States' bill to establish
National Missile Defense (NMD) system for "not only influencing
directly the nuclear disarmament process, but also exerting
extensive and far-reaching negative influence over the global
strategic balance and stability of the coming century."
</P>
<P>
"China is seriously concerned about it", he said, referring to
the bill which got through in the US Congress recently.
</P>
<P>
Despite possessing the world's largest and most advanced
nuclear and conventional weapon storage, the US now still fully
devotes itself to developing national and theater missile defense
systems, said Sun.
</P>
<P>
The US moves run counter to the trend of seeking peace and
promoting development, and infringe upon relevant treaties on
nuclear arms control and disarmament, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As to Sino-Vatican ties, Sun reiterated that China is willing
to "develop normal and friendly ties" with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he clearly added two conditions to developing ties
with the Vatican that the Vatican must sever its so-called
diplomatic relations with Taiwan, and that the Vatican cannot use
the issue of religion to interfere in China's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares Longmen Grottos for World Heritage List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The city of Luoyang, central
China's Henan Province, recently submitted an application to
include the Longmen Grottos on UNESCO's World Heritage List.
</P>
<P>
The application was approved by the Henan Provincial Government
and a group of experts from the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage were invited to inspect the grottos and offer advice to
ensure a successful bid.
</P>
<P>
The city government has included protection of the grottos and
application for the World Heritage List on its list of socialist
cultural and ethical progress goals for the 1996-2000 period.
Detailed measures have also been formulated to protect the grottos.
</P>
<P>
The city has established a special agency responsible for the
application process, accelerated efforts to streamline the
protection mechanism and assigned more technical workers to
cultural relics sites.
</P>
<P>
The Longmen Grottos, one of China's three renowned rock
carvings, were completed over a span dating back from the Northern
Wei State (386-534) and running through the Sui (581-618), Tang (
618-970), Song (960-1279) and Yuan (1279-1368) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The grottos feature more than 2,100 niches, some 40 Buddhist
pagodas, 100,000 statues of Buddha, and 3,600 inscribed tablets.
The site was placed under state protection in 1961.
</P>
<P>
Some 21 scenic sites and cultural relics in China are included
on the World Heritage List. China and India ranks fourth place in
the world in terms of the number of scenic sites and cultural
relics listed.

<P>
ANKARA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Ankara State Security Court
Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel has filed a suit with the Court of
Appeals, demanding a ban on the pro-Islamist Virtue Party (FP).
</P>
<P>
Yuksel Monday cited an array of evidence, including speeches
made by FP deputies, various newspaper dispatches and his recent
indictment against four former Islamist deputies for whom he
asked for capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
In his indictment, Yuksel accused the FP of being the successor
to the former pro-Islamist Welfare Party (RP), which was closed
down in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that to succeed a party that has been banned is an
illegal practice according to the country's constitution and
certain political parties laws.
</P>
<P>
Yuksel attacked the FP for trying to lift bans on some former
RP members by trying to persuade parliament to revoke Article 312
of the Political Parties Law.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Turkey's Constitutional Court has banned 14
political parties, with RP being the latest one on the grounds
that it had become center of anti-secular activities.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a predominantly Muslim state with a secular
government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Prepares Scenarios for Cyprus Solution: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. is preparing a series of
scenarios for a settlement of the Cyprus issue, Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides confirmed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the Cyprus government is not aware of the
specifics of the scenarios.
</P>
<P>
During a live TV interview, the president stressed the Greek
Cypriot side has not set preconditions for resumption of
bicommunal talks aimed at a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said U.N. Security Council resolutions set the framework
for talks and for the U.N. Secretary General's good offices,
adding the framework cannot be considered as preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"We do not set preconditions, Rauf Denktash does, because he
does not wish to keep to the basis set up by the Security
Council," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash has put forward a proposal
for a confederation of two states on the island which run contrary
to U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for a bicommunal,
bizonal federation with a single sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that earlier Turkish claims for separate
sovereignty and rotating presidency are equal to recent direct
demands for confederation.
</P>
<P>
He said all those who became refugees as a result of the 1974
invasion of Cyprus by Turkey should have the right to return to
their homes whether under Greek Cypriot or Turkish Cypriot
administration.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation formula, but so far no
tangible results have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai Province
plans to use World Banks loans totaling 40 million US dollars
between 1999-2004 to develop a new aid-the-poor project.
</P>
<P>
The project will focus on relocating 62,000 needy farmers and
herdsmen to make way for a new irrigation area in the Qaidam Basin.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has approved the project which is scheduled to
begin in May, according to Vice-Governor Liu Guanghe.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the project is to open a new 21,440 ha irrigation
area in Xiangridebalong Prefecture in order to develop the farming,
forestry and animal husbandry industries, as well as the area's
abundant land, water and solar energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Needy people in six mountainous counties located in the arid
eastern part of Qinghai and Dulan County in the west will be
relocated to facilitate the project and speed up local
agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai, an under-developed inland province, has a population
of five million people, with ethnic minorities accounting for 42.8
percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
More than half a million people of the Han, Hui, Tibetan, Tu,
Mongolian and Salar ethnic groups in the area continue to live in
relatively poor conditions in the area.

BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China today blamed a United
States' bill to establish National Missile Defense (NMD) system
for "not only influencing directly the nuclear disarmament process,

Despite possessing the world's largest and most advanced

The US moves run counter to the trend of seeking peace and

JERUSALEM, March 23 (Xinhua) - The following are major news

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A nationwide public-sector strike set for Wednesday
appeared all but inevitable Monday night, as another meeting
between Treasury and Histadrut, or the labor federation, ended
with both sides claiming no progress toward resolution. The
dispute centers on compensation the Histadrut is seeking for what
it claims erosion of real wages.

Haaretz:

<P>
-- During his visit to Washington Wednesday, Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat will look for
firm American support for an alternative date, on which he will
declare an independent state, in exchange for not declaring
statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials, however, said the United States is unlikely
to accede to this request.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The PNA has helped the General Security Service foil an
attempt by Palestinian extremists to stage a major attack against
Israelis. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Arafat about
three weeks ago to thank him for the cooperation.

<HEADLINE> India Opposes EU Social, Environment Clauses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- India is opposed to special
incentives extended by the European Union (EU) to its trading
partners to meet social and environmental clauses under the
Generalized System of Preference (GSP), the Statesman newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Its (the social and environment clauses) is in conflict with
twin objectives of GSP, namely, improving market access and
integration of developing countries with global trading system,"
the daily quoted a senior official of the Commerce Ministry as
saying.
</P>
<P>
India did not dispute the social standards, especially labor
and environment protection, but these issues could be dealt with
effectively on other forums like the International Labor
Organization, Nripendra Mishra, additional secretary of the
Commerce Ministry, told a seminar on EU-India GSP mechanism here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU to review the provisions, saying such issues
should not be brought through the backdoor like these measures
under GSP.
</P>
<P>
EU Ambassador Michael B. McGeever said at the seminar that
India would benefit from the EU revamped GSP.
</P>
<P>
McGeever asked India to use major opportunities in areas like
garments and footwear, saying that under the EU scheme, India
could take maximum benefit in marine products, clothing and
footwear against its competitor Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Although the GSP utilization rate by India stood at 82 percent
in 1997, the percentage of exports covered is on the decline now,
official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
India urged the EU to give more market assess under GSP without
insisting on firm commitments on environment protection and social
clauses.
</P>
<P>
Mishra said India supported steps to protect the environment
and eliminate child labor, but the government was not in a
position to give firm commitments on these issues to earn tariff
preferences.
</P>
<P>
Environmental clauses would be used only for timber and its
products for countries which conform to standards relating to
sustainable management of tropical forests, he added.

ABU DHABI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Dubai police are to be put on
full alert in the run-up to December 31 in order to combat
criminals who may take advantage of any chaos resulting from the
Millenium Bug, the UAE's Gulf News daily said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Criminals might take advantage of the potential chaos that
could result from any crisis," the paper said, quoting Major
General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim, the Dubai Police Chief.
</P>
<P>
"Dubai Police will help monitor banks and exchange offices, to
catch criminals who may attempt to conduct transactions in money
laundering schemes," the police officer was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the police will contact the Civil Aviation, the Dubai
Electricity and Water Authority and hospitals, to ensure they are
ready for Y2K.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that banks have made arrangements to combat
the millennium bug, or clients may rush to withdraw their
assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem is a result of memory saving by computer
software designers in the 1970 and 80s, which means many
computers, or machines operated by silicon chips, might not
recognize the year 2000, and might crash.
</P>
<P>
International finance, banks, computer networks and air traffic
control systems are believed to be most prone to the the Y2K
problem.
</P>
<P>
According the paper, a survey of companies in six GCC states
showed that 30 percent are not even talking about the Y2K problem,
20 percent are still in the first stage of planning to solve it,
10 percent will never touch the problem, while 20 percent have
just started doing their job and 20 percent have no problem.
</P>
<P>
UAE banks, the public sector, health service, Dubai's water
and electricity services and Emirates airline have all said that
they believe they will have overcome any potential Y2K problems
by the end of this year, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Flood-Stricken Areas Report Low Disease Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent report released by the
Ministry of Health shows flood-stricken areas had a lower
incidence rate for diseases than other areas throughout China in
1998.
</P>
<P>
However, one ministry official noted that flood-stricken areas
must continue disease eradication and epidemic control efforts.
</P>
<P>
The report reveals the average 1998 nationwide incidence rate
for 26 epidemic diseases stood at 195 out of 100,000 people. The
rate for eight flooded provinces stood at 187 out of 100,000
people, with the figure for areas not affected by flooding hitting
198 out of 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The disease control official from the Ministry of Health named
Cui Gang attributed the achievement to strict and intensified
supervision carried out by related provincial governments and
health departments.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that dangerous elements associated with the
epidemics are emerging due to the drought affecting north China
since last winter and the arrival of warm weather.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cui urged health departments at all levels to
strengthen environmental protection and guarantee quality of
drinking water and food.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health is closely supervising potential
epidemics related to hepatitis A, the plague and typhoid fever.
The ministry has also dispatched work groups to monitor epidemics
in central China's Hunan and Hubei provinces, southwestern Guizhou
and Sichuan provinces, and Jiangxi and Anhui provinces in east
China, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions in
northern China.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Offshore Insurance Industry Records Big Leap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Gross premiums recorded by
the offshore general insurance industry in Malaysia's Labuan
International Financial Center rose 23.2 percent in 1998 to 53.0
million U.S. dollars, it was announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The rise was attributed to an increase in the number of
insurers in operations to 11 in 1998 from six in 1997, Labuan
Offshore Financial Services Authority (LOFSA) said in its 1998
Annual Report.
</P>
<P>
The increase also reflected the expansion of reinsurance
business in the domestic market as the island's offshore insurers
started to gain wider recognition and acceptance among domestic
insurers, it said.
</P>
<P>
All sectors of the offshore insurance industry posted higher
gross premiums except for the engineering sector which declined
by 16.8 percent, it said, adding the motor sector registered the
highest growth of 84.8 percent, followed by the marine sector with
51.7 percent and miscellaneous by 19.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of total business share, the fire sector continued to
dominate the business portfolio of general insurers although its
share fell to 42.7 percent in 1998 from 48.8 percent in 1997,
LOFSA said.
</P>
<P>
Payments for gross claims in 1998 registered a 8.6 percent
decline to 25.4 million U.S. dollars from 27.8 million U.S.
dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
As for total premiums transacted by the offshore insurance
brokers, a phenomenal growth of 406.2 percent was recorded in 1998
to 16.2 million U.S. dollars, LOFSA said, adding total earnings
from brokerage fees also increased significantly to 1.6 million
U.S. dollars in 1998 from just 400,000 U.S. dollars in 1997.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand To Sell State-owned Energy Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government has
decided to sell 40 percent of the shares in Contact Energy, a
state-owned energy company, to the Californian power giant Edison
Mission Energy.
</P>
<P>
According to local media reports, The government and Edison
will hold a signing ceremony on the sale Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Edison is paying 1.2 billion NZ dollars (637 million U.S.
dollars) for its 40 percent stake in Contact Energy. The 40
percent stake had been expected to sell for about 600 million NZ
dollars, but has gone for twice that amount.
</P>
<P>
The price paid by the United States group is equal to five NZ
dollars a share and is conditional on selling the balance of 60
percent of Contact Energy in a public share float next month. The
New Zealand government is set to collect a staggering three
billion NZ dollars (1.6 billion U.S. dollars) from the sale of the
energy retailer and generator, which controls 27 percent of New
Zealand's power generation.
</P>
<P>
About 250,000 New Zealaners have registered their interest in
the impending Contact Energy share float, a latest official media
release disclosed.
</P>
<P>
At three billion NZ dollars, Contact Energy would be the second
biggest New Zealand company on the NZ sharemarket after Telecom.
</P>
<P>
Edison Mission Energy is wholly owned by Edison International,
which has more than 47 billion NZ dollars (25 billion U.S.
dollars) in assets and owns Southern California Edison, one of the
biggest electricity utilities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there were initially six bidders in the
race for Contact Energy, but four players dropped out at an
earlier stage, leaving Edison Mission Energy and Canadian-based
TransAlta in the final binding bid.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Restrict Foreigners to Certain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has decided to restrict foreign businessmen in certain areas in a
bid to break their monopoly in some sectors, the Tanzania
Information Services (TIS) said.
</P>
<P>
The TIS said in a statement Monday that effective from May 1,
some areas are identified for Tanzanians only and some others are
open to foreigners but with Tanzanians' owning 50 percent or more
of the shares.
</P>
<P>
"The move is aimed at safeguarding the interests of Tanzania
under the liberalized economy," the statement said, arguing that
for a long time Tanzanians have been facing difficulties in
finding jobs in both public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The types of business to be strictly for Tanzanians include all
retail and sub-wholesale, small hotels (up to 20 rooms) and
restaurants, photographing, beauty clinics, tailoring and
butchery.
</P>
<P>
Others are chicken rearing; carpentry workshop; painting;
laundry; bakeries; guest houses; forex bureaux; business of
auction; brokerage; repairing of shoe, watch and iron; and selling
of vegetables, fish (retail), gas, furniture, chicken and eggs.
</P>
<P>
Those sectors which are open to foreigners but 50 percent or
more of their shares are owned by Tanzanians include consultation
services, cargo handling, catering services, publishing and
printing and pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
Others are super markets, dressing and suiting materials, gold
and silver smith, petrol and filling stations, garages and
wholesale of spare parts, shipping agencies and ema business.
</P>
<P>
"Even business undertakings which Tanzanians could run have
been monopolized by foreigners," the statement said, adding that
the situation contributed to increased poverty among local people
and fuelled criminal incidents in the society.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Details Added-1 Man Sentenced to Death for Killing Five Hong Kongers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Li Yuhui, who killed five Hong
Kong residents with poison and stole 1.2 million Hong Kong dollars,
today was sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for
life.
</P>
<P>
The Intermediate People's Court of the city of Shantou
announced the sentence after first instance and ordered
confiscation of Li's property.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Li, a resident of Shantou in south China's
Guangdong Province, was charged with killing the five people on
July 21, 1998 by offering them some so-called magic water, which
was in fact mixture of mineral water and potassium sodium that Li
produced himself.
</P>
<P>
Li was asked to tell the fortune of three Hong Kong women
surnamed Choi, Hsu and Lim in June last year in the southern city
of Shenzhen. In July in Hong Kong, he promised to prolong their
lives for a price of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars for each year he
extended their lives.
</P>
<P>
On July 21, Li arrived in Hong Kong with about two grams of
potassium sodium, and made a mixture of so-called magic water with
the poison and mineral water as he performed some sort of
religious services at Hsu's home.
</P>
<P>
Hsu and her two daughters, Choi and Lim, died after drinking
the fatal mixture.
</P>
<P>
Li left some notes at the scene of his crime that were
supposedly suicide notes left by his victims.
</P>
<P>
Li returned to Shantou that same day with 1.2 million Hong Kong
dollars which he claimed were tributes from the victims.
</P>
<P>
Li hid 600,000 Hong Kong dollars with one of his relatives, and
he and his girlfriend Yin Li, who will also be tried, exchanged
the rest of the money into yuan and deposited it in a bank.
</P>
<P>
Li then fled to and hid in the central China city of Wuhan, and
in the city of E'zhou and Tongcheng County before he was arrested
on September 15 last year.
</P>
<P>
The police recovered 600,000 Hong Kong dollars and 666,000 yuan
of the stolen money and handed it over to Hong Kong police to
return to the victims' relatives according to legal procedures.

Defense lawyers Zhou Wei and Chen Ruilin defended Li at the
public trial conducted by the Intermediate People's Court of
Shantou.
</P>
<P>
Li said he was then in Hong Kong at the time of the killings,
helping others perform religious services for Hsu and the other
victims. He said that he did not kill the five directly but that
other people did, and he only provided the poison and helped
handle the stolen cash.
</P>
<P>
The defense lawyers put forward the argument that the direct
evidence was not enough to prove the defendant had murdered the
five people.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that enough evidence was presented to prove the
defendant had committed the crime, including the testimony of
witnesses and conclusion drawn by legal medical experts, as well
as records of on-the-spot inquests, fingerprints taken from the
crime scene, and the confession of the defendant.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that Li had committed the crimes of intentional
murder and robbery and should be given concurrent punishment for
his crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China,
the court sentenced Li to death, deprived him of political rights
for life, and ordered confiscation of all his property.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people of various circles were in the courtroom
to hear the announcement of the verdict of first instance.

<HEADLINE> Judiciary to Promote Implementation of New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Justice Minister Gao Changli
pledged here today that judicial administrative departments
throughout China will accelerate efforts to promote the general
public's awareness of the amended Constitution in order to
safeguard constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans to reform the country's legal service
system and help protect the legitimate rights and interests of the
general public in the course of implementing the amended
Constitution, according to Gao's remarks during a scholarly
symposium covering the new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Incorporating the principle of rule of law in constitutional
law readily indicated that the Chinese leadership is making
progress in terms of inheriting and developing Deng Xiaoping
Theory regarding building a democratic legal system, said Gao.
</P>
<P>
"It also indicates a major change in the form of government and
leadership," he added.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the ministry is charged with the duty of facilitating
implementation of the principle of rule of law and will play a
unique and irreplaceable role in related efforts.
</P>
<P>
Judicial administrative departments will place priority on
enhancing general public awareness of the Constitution and recent
amendments.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will also join various departments in adopting
effective measures to check on violations of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of the amended Constitution include:
</P>
<P>
-- Further improving the legal service system and bringing the
role of attorneys, notaries public and grass roots mediators
involved in legal affairs into full play in the realm of economic
and social life in order to provide essential social conditions
for practicing the rule of law in China;
</P>
<P>
-- Comprehensively enhancing the work level of prison
management and education through labor by giving scope to their
functions of deterrence and reform in order to maintain social
stability; and
</P>
<P>
-- Educating the general public on all aspects of the
Constitution and safeguarding their legal rights and interests in
order to effectively establish a solid foundation for practicing
the rule of law.

<HEADLINE> Trust Firms in Malaysia's Financial Center Record Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Total pre-tax profits of
trust companies operating in Malaysia's Labuan International
Financial Center increased by about 1.9 percent for 1998 over
those for 1997, according to an official report issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pre-tax profits of trust companies in Labuan amounted to
5.5 million ringgit (1.447 million U.S. dollars) for the year
ending December 31, 1998 against 5.4 million ringgit (1.421
million U.S. dollars) in 1997, according to the 1998 annual report
issued here by Labuan Offshore Financial Services Authority
(LOFSA).
</P>
<P>
Profits after tax in aggregate also increased by 2.1 percent to
4.8 million ringgit (1.263 million U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 4.7
million ringgit (1.236 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The economic crisis affecting the region did not prevent trust
companies from recording growth in their operating incomes, LOFSA
said.
</P>
<P>
Year 1998 saw the operating incomes of the trust companies in
aggregate increased by 22.7 percent to 11.9 million ringgit (5.973
million U.S. dollars) in 1998 from 9.7 million ringgit (2.552
million U.S. dollars) in 1997, it said.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributed to the increase in the number of
offshore companies as well as foreign exchange gains due to the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the ringgit between 1997
and 1998.

<HEADLINE> Manila Bans Import of Pigs From Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
impose a total ban on the import of pigs and pork from Malaysia
and its neighboring countries within the next 21 months.
</P>
<P>
National Meat Inspection Commission (NMIC) Executive Director
Edgardo Dimalanta said in an interview the ban will be made
effective during the period to protect the local livestock
industry and consumers from pig-related Japanese encephalitis (JE)
viral disease.
</P>
<P>
Dimalanta said agriculture regional offices and quarantine
officers of the Bureau of Animal Industry will also closely
monitor all ports to ensure Malaysian pigs and pork could not
enter the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
These measures will be undertaken by the government while
Malaysia is addressing the outbreak of the JE disease, including
fogging and vaccination of people and pigs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dimalanta said Malaysian pigs and pork will be only allowed
from coming into the country once there is already an official
declaration from International Organization of Animal Diseases
these are already safe for consumption.
</P>
<P>
The official said the government has also to conduct a risk
analysis of the disease once Malaysia applies as exporter of pigs
and pork in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines so far has no importation of such products from
Malaysia. It now only ships in pigs and pork from Europe,
Australia, Denmark, France, Holland and Canada.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Reforms Cotton Export System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, China's leading cotton producing base in the northwest,
has recently reformed its cotton export system in a bid to spur
exports and enhance its competitiveness in the international
cotton market.
</P>
<P>
The region merged part of its textiles import and export
company into the Xinjiang Cotton and Hemp Corporation so that the
latter can handle cotton export in a unified way.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has also established a high-power
leading group to oversee cotton exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation has placed the cotton company of the China National
Textiles Import and Export Corporation under the region's cotton
export leading group, which was set up late last year.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the group is to coordinate cotton prices and
allocate materials and transportation capabilities according to
need.
</P>
<P>
In the past, too many circulation chains in the exportation of
cotton resulted in high costs and declining exports.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the ministry also granted direct
cotton exporting right to the autonomous region and the Xinjiang
Production and Construction Corps, the country's largest state
farm.
</P>
<P>
Since the Xinjiang Cotton and Hemp Corporation was granted
export rights late last year, it has signed a contract with a
United States company for the exportation of 5,000 tons of cotton.
Another contract to export 20,000 tons of cotton is still under
discussions.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang produces one-third of China's cotton output.

<HEADLINE> Detained U.S. Plane Crew Cleared of Spying Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States-registered
plane, detained in India since March 17, was reportedly cleared of
charge of taking photographs over "restricted areas" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
After examining the cameras in the aircraft, Indian experts
said that they were not capable of taking pictures at night and
not working when found inside the plane, the Times of India
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
J. C. A. Cooper, a British pilot, and his female navigator, J.
M. Kondgaj, were detained on charge of spying last Wednesday in a
hotel in Ahmedabad, 915 km southwest of here, and questioned by
intelligence officials, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
No offense had been registered so far against the crew, but
their passports have been kept with local immigration authorities,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the only mistake made by the crew members
of the twin-engine turbo-prop private survey plane was that they
did not mention anything about the cameras they had kept in the
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The crew reportedly told their interrogators that they took off
from Calcutta for Karachi at 20:52 on March 16 and landed at
Ahmedabad for refueling.
</P>
<P>
They said that the director general of Indian civil aviation
had cleared them when they landed a day earlier in Calcutta, about
1,900 km east of Ahmadabad.
</P>
<P>
They were on their way to Dubai via Karachi when they were
detained at Ahmedabad on charges of over-flying Indian airspace
without permission and for not possessing proper immigration
papers which were not true, claimed Cooper, who holds a British
passport, and Kondgaj, who has an Australian one.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday that further
investigations were in progress while top officials of Indian Home
Ministry, General Security Agencies, Director General of Civil
Aviation (DGCA) and Airport Authorities of India met in New Delhi
to analyze the feedback received from the occupants during their
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
DGCA sources said that clearance would be given to the aircraft
only after all agencies involved in the investigations give a
green signal.

YANGON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has planned a new setup of
its Meteorological and Hydrological Department (MHD) to serve more
effectively in mitigating the adverse effects of natural
disasters, weather and climate on human health.
</P>
<P>
The new setup includes building of eight new related stations
and two more forecasting offices this year, official newspaper The
New Light of Myanmar reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strength of the staff members of the department will be
extended to 1,425 in the new setup from 1,028 in the old one.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has established 34
new meteorological and hydrological stations in the past ten
years, bringing the total number to 130 in 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The MHD was able to forecast that the strong El Nino
phenomenon, which caused widespread climate variability in many
places around the globe in 1997-98, affected the climate of
Myanmar partially.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Feels Sting of Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
admitted he was feeling the stinging effect from the economic
recession as the government's earnings looked likely to fall short
of expenses, the Bangkok Post said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to students of the King Rama VII Institute Monday, the
prime minister said that the government was finding ways to cut
fixed expenditure which kept rising.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was considering downsizing the bureaucracy
because salaries and other benefits to civil servants usually took
up almost half the annual budget.
</P>
<P>
But he was also aware that the move would never be easy, since
state agencies were reluctant to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
The government may have to borrow more, as new bodies were
being set up as required by the constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government was reported to be planning a tax cut
recently in a bid to jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
Under a proposal, the personal income tax will be cut by two
percent and the value-added tax to the pre-crisis level of seven
percent from the current 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The expected overall loss of 102 billion baht (2.76 billion
U.S. dollars) in government revenue resulted from the dramatic
tax-cut package will be a big blow to the already strapped state
coffers.

<HEADLINE> No Significant Change of Situation: Holbrooke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke described his emergency talks with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic late on Monday as having achieved "no
significant change of situation."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press Tuesday after the talks, the American who
brokered the Kosovo cease-fire deal with the Yugoslav authorities
last October said that it would be misleading to say the talks
that lasted four hours Monday night resulted in any significant
change in the situation.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke spent the rest of the night at the U.S. embassy
discussing the matter over the phone with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, National Security Advisor Samuel Berger, and
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said the talks were held against the backdrop of
increased military action in Kosovo, which further intensified the
crisis in the province.
</P>
<P>
"These actions now going on in Kosovo made it extraordinarily
difficult to pursue peace by seeking an agreement with the
Rambouillet accords and compliance with the October 12 and October
25 agreements," said Holbrooke, who flew to Belgrade after meeting
NATO decision makers earlier on Monday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The special envoy declined to take any questions from the press
who waited the whole evening for him. He said his team would
reassess the situation Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
After the international cease-fire monitors evacuated Kosovo on
Saturday, terrorist acts took place in Pristina, capital city of
Kosovo. Four policemen were killed and a fifth wounded by a drive-
by shoot-out on Sunday while three civilians were killed by hand
grenade and shotguns on Monday.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit last month reached 42.87
billion dollars, following a 70.35 billion dollars surplus in
January, the Treasury Department said Monday.

75 billion dollars a year ago. But it was slightly narrower than

<HEADLINE> South-China Tiger Cub Attracts Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of people here
have visited a six-month-old female South-China tiger cub since
she was shipped to the Fuzhou Zoo from Guangzhou, capital of
Guangdong Province, a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Princess, the cub's temporary name, is growing well with a
present weight of over 40 kilograms, and she eats fresh beef and
chicken every week to ensure healthy growth, the zookeepers said.
</P>
<P>
Her mother, called Min Min, was sent by the Fuzhou Zoo to
Guangzhou in 1996 to mate with a male partner there, and gave
birth to twin tiger cubs on September 8 last year. The mother
tiger and the male cub are now remaining at the Guangzhou Zoo.
</P>
<P>
The South-China tiger is one of the ten most endangered species
in the world and is under state-level protection in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the zookeepers, there are less than 20 wild South-
China tigers left in the world, and 53 are in zoos around China.
</P>
<P>
The people of Fuzhou have been asked to chose a name for the
tiger cub for the occasion of her first birthday.

BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister
Zivorad Jovanovic said Monday that the restraint policy
implemented by the Yugoslav government has in fact encouraged
terrorism in Kosovo, reported Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
This was demonstrated by the developments of the Kosovo
situation since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reached an
agreement with U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke last October,
Jovanovic said during a meeting with foreign diplomats in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that Kosovo terrorists launched 357 attacks
against civilians and 685 attacks against policemen, killing 159
people, including 127 civilians, and kidnapping 101 people, which
also included seven policemen from October 13 to February 21.

No country in the world would adopt a policy of doing nothing
in the face of terrorism, said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Southern Thai Provinces Free of Pig Disease: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai officials claimed that the
country's southern provinces, bordering Malaysia, are free of the
deadly Japanese encephalitis virus, the Bangkok Post reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Suwithaya Pollarp, Livestock Department
director-general, as saying that no report was received so far
about human or animal ailments resulting from the Japanese
encephalitis infection.
</P>
<P>
But he also said that the country has beefed up its security
inspections at border provinces in the south to prevent an
outbreak of the disease, which has claimed at least 53 lives in
neighboring Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of the disease has resulted in plummeting prices
of live animals in Malaysia. The price of live pig is quoted at 38
baht (1.02 U.S. dollars) per kilogram, compared with 48 baht (1.29
dollars) per kilogram in markets in the southern provinces of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The Livestock Department has informed governors in border
provinces to keep a close watch, for fear that price differences
could entice animal and carcass smuggling to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that although aware of the disease, pork
consumption in the southern provinces does not appear to have
fallen yet.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 live animals are delivered to market in the
southern provinces every month.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Thai authorities have banned the import of pork
from Malaysia, following a similar decision by Singapore.

The committee's would-be president Germano Rigotto said that

tax contributions they have to make, which amount to almost 30
percent of the administrative costs of Brazilian companies.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds Seminar on Hospital Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar health authorities are
holding a seminar on hospital administration here to further
strengthen the capability of hospital administrators.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar, which began Monday, is sponsored by the
Medical Science Department of the Ministry of Health and attended
by officials of the ministry as well as a representative from the
Bumrungrad Hospital of Thailand and a resident representative of
the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
As part of the overall health system, hospitals should play
their role in supporting the primary health care strategy as a
referral and support mechanism, Minister of Health Major-General
Ket Sein was quoted by Tuesday's official newspaper The New Light
of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has initiated health sector reforms in
order to make use of the country's resources as efficiently as
possible both in terms of maximum health gain for the funds
invested and minimum cost for the range of services.
</P>
<P>
The hospital care system in Myanmar comprises of township
hospital as the first referral level, district and state or
division hospital as the second referral level, and the specialist
hospital as the tertiary referral level.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Ministry of Health has conducted in-service
training courses on hospital administration and a recent diploma
course for hospital administration.
</P>
<P>
The role of private hospitals and private practitioners has
also been called for.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been implementing primary health care programs in
an effort to realize the goal of "Health for All by 2000". The
six projects of the country's national health plan (1996-2001)
include a hospital project.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, up to the 1997-98 fiscal
year, there were 734 hospitals with 28,943 beds, 350 dispensaries,
1,410 rural centers and 348 maternal and child health centers in
the country with 14,007 doctors, 11,840 nurses and 9,524 midwives.

<HEADLINE> Army Daily Slashes US's Including Taiwan into TMD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States' plan to
incorporate Taiwan into its Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system "
violates China's sovereignty and territorial integrity", and will
be "strongly rejected by all Chinese people including those
residing in Taiwan," a signed article carried on today's
Liberation Army Daily has said.
</P>
<P>
The article, entitled "China's internal affairs brooks no
intervention," also lodged strong opposition to US's increasing
arms sales to China's Taiwan, saying that this will heighten
Taiwan's military strength and intensify the situation across the
Taiwan Straits, thus again a rude interference in China's internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
From the early 1990', US had noticeably increased its arms
sales to the Taiwan authorities . From 1990 to 1995 only, US's
arms sales to Taiwan valued at 8.3 billion US dollars and Taiwan
has become US's second largest arms sales destination. Recently,
the U.S. sold to the Taiwan authorities 3 sets of PAC-2 Patriot
missile system and the authorities still demand the purchase of
US's AGIS air defense weapon system and its PAC-3 Patriot missile
system, the article notes.
</P>
<P>
If the US continues its arms sales to Taiwan and its plan to
incorporate Taiwan the TMD disregard of China's strong opposition,
there will occur serious consequences: the severe interference in
China's internal affairs and the infringement upon China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and the improvement of
Taiwan's anti-missile capability to a large extent which might
instigate the Taiwan independent forces to take risky actions. The
third consequences will be related to the sharing and transfer of
missile technology and information, a risky move related to the
proliferation of missile technology, the article stresses.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Rejects Solution Imposed by Force to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic rejected any forcefully imposed solutions to the Kosovo
crisis Monday evening when he met with U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke in last-minute efforts to avert NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic told Holbrooke that "anybody who tries to impose a
solution by force will have to face responsibility for moves
against a peaceful policy and for consequences that may occur,"
the Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Yugoslav government and people stick
firmly to a peaceful solution to the crisis and that Kosovo, a
separatist Serbian province dominated by ethnic Albanians, is an "
internal matter" for Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no solution to the Kosovo problem if the
interests of the Albanian separatist movement are imposed on
Serbia," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic claimed the final text in the Paris peace talks was
written before the talks even began, without any consideration for
the interests of the state concerned.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced Sunday
that Holbrooke is being sent to Belgrade to deliver a final
warning to Milosevic concerning potential airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
Albright made clear that Holbrooke's mission was a last-ditch
chance for Yugoslavia to avert a military attack.
</P>
<P>
"He will make clear that Milosevic faces a stark choice: to
halt aggression against the Kosovar Albanians and accept an
interim settlement with a NATO-led implementation force, or bear
the full responsibility for the consequences of a NATO military
action," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that because the meeting failed to change
Milosevic's stand, NATO air strikes have become imminent. They
warned that NATO air strikes would not only cause the loss of
people and property, but also lead to an escalation of terrorist
activities in Kosovo and even endanger the security of the Balkan
region and the entire Europe.

third consecutive term (1999-2003).
</P>
<P>
Eight out of nine magistrates held that it would not be
legitimate if Menem, who is in his second term, was allowed to run
in the general elections next October.
</P>
<P>
According to Argentina's Constitution, the president can serve
no more than two consecutive terms.

<HEADLINE> China Explores Risk Investment Mechanisms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China is exploring ways to
establish risk investment mechanisms to promote the
commercialization and industrialization of high-tech achievements.
</P>
<P>
Wang Songqi a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences
(CASS), said the establishment of a risk investment system will
not only be conducive to economic development, but will also be a
major step in financial and overall economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Venture investment funds, an important form of risk investment,
play an important role in commercializing the high-tech
achievements of small to medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
China began exploring risk investment mechanisms in the mid-
1980s after the Communist Party of Chine Central Committee
announced its decision to reform the nation's science and
technology system.
</P>
<P>
The decision, which introduced the concept of "Venture
Investment Funds" and solicited support for using related funds to
developing risky high technology, ushered in the founding of a
number of risk investment institutions nationwide.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 risk investment companies and credit cooperatives
for science and technology were established in 22 provinces and
municipalities by the end of 1988, with a total capital of over 3.
5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, Beijing established two related companies with
total capital of 810 million yuan, and three risk insurance funds
in 1998 alone which currently underwrite insurance valued at four
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has raised over three billion
yuan to invest in the high-tech industry, including government
funding of 1.85 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the commercial and industrial center of the country,
plans to earmark 600 million yuan to support the establishment of
a high-tech risk fund. The risk investment concept was also
included in the annual municipal government report released during
the recent Shanghai Municipal People's Congress meeting.

<P>
Some 100-odd centers have opened nationwide to support the
rapid growth of small and medium-sized high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The center in Chengdu, capital of southwestern China's Sichuan
Province, has increased profits by close to 80 percent on an
annual basis, with annual profits for the center in Wuhan, capital
of central Hubei Province, growing by 32 percent since the
introduction of venture investments in 1989.
</P>
<P>
However, economists note that venture investment funds have not
as yet reached maturity and capital shortages continue to restrain
the development of high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 20 percent of China's high-tech
achievements are applied for commercialization at present, with
merely 15 percent of them earning profits due to the limited scale
of production.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that risk investment involves a cycle
represented by investment-growth-exit-investment and an outlet for
stock exchange listing and equity transfers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the current immaturity of China's stock and
property markets have a direct affect on the ability to raise risk
investment funds, especially from individuals.
</P>
<P>
"An effective risk investment system can only be established
with a coordinated effort to improve the policy and economic and
financial systems, and a simultaneous effort to promote the
combination of capital with high technology," according to Wang
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), said preferential policies will be introduced
for high-tech enterprises regardless of their ownership.
</P>
<P>
He added that the CSRC, China's securities watchdog, is
currently studying regulations for founding Sino-foreign
cooperative funds.

<HEADLINE> Experts Warn Water Crisis in Mexico in 2005 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An Expert has warned that by
the year 2005, people in Mexico City will suffer an acute water
shortage if lakes in the Mexico basin, seat of the Mexican capital
city, are not prevented from running dry.
</P>
<P>
Calos Padilla, president of the Municipal Council for
Environmental Protection in Morelia, capital of the state of
Michoacan, which is located some 250 kilometers northeast of
Mexico City, made the forecast on Monday, World Water Day.
</P>
<P>
Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Mexican
National Water Committee show that the average daily water
consumption in Mexico City is about 200 liters per person, as
compared with the 50 liters per day the WHO has established as a
norm.
</P>
<P>
Padilla is also warning of an environmental collapse in Mexico
City in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Water shortages are emerging as a global issue. Also marking
World Water Day, experts in the United Nations say more than one
billion people -- nearly one fifth of the world's population -
lack safe, clean water, and the problem will only worsen in the
early 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Treasury Bill Rate Falls to Pre-crisis Levels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine's bellwether rate,
the 91-day treasury bill (t-bill) rate, fell by 25.4 basis points
Monday to 11.917 percent, the lowest since the start of the Asian
crisis in July 1997, local newspaper Malaya reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's auction, the 182-day t-bill rate declined to 12.112
percent from 12.471 percent while the 364-day bill's inched down
to 12.394 percent from 12.708 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Treasury auctioned off 5 billion pesos (about 40
pesos to one U.S. dollar) worth of securities, 500 million pesos
lower than the usual offer.
</P>
<P>
Total tenders amounted to 12.109 billion pesos with the
six-month term bills having the biggest applications at 4.830
billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
Market players vied for the longer term government securities,
expecting the continuous slide in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Finance Secretary Gill Beltran said the low rates
were due to increasing confidence in the economy with the lower
inflation and improving foreign exchange conditions.
</P>
<P>
Beltran also pointed out, "International market conditions are
improving and that's why the premium on emerging markets is
declining. It appears that the severely affected economies have
touched bottom and are recovering."
</P>
<P>
"We are going back to normal interest rates," he said.
</P>
<P>
Beltran, however, cautioned that interest rates should not fall
to single-digit levels because the fluctuation in inflation is
something that has to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inflation figure would depend on the
fluctuations in the price of food and oil.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Auto Sales to Fall Further: Businessman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's automotive sales may
decline further to 50,000 cars this year from 58,000 cars last
year, as demand remains low in the crisis-hit country, the Jakarta
Post Tuesday quoted a businessman as reporting.
</P>
<P>
"The country's economic crisis and political instability are
the main contributors to the further fall in automotive vehicle
sales," said Herman Z. Latief, president of PT Krama Yudha Tiga
Berlian Motors.
</P>
<P>
The car market would remain depressed despite expected
improvement in the country's economy in the second half of 1999,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the crisis, Latief said, the country's automotive
market had shown impressive growth, with annual sales of 400,000
vehicles of various makes.
</P>
<P>
Sales dropped to 58,000 units in 1998 as the economic crisis,
which began in the middle of 1997, became more severe and the
country's political situation became tenuous following the
downfall of former president Soeharto in May last year.
</P>
<P>
"If the prediction comes true, Indonesia will, for the first
time in the country's automotive history, record lower sales than
Singapore, which records 60,000 units annually," he said.
</P>
<P>
Latief said he was optimistic Indonesia has a good car market
in the future, considering the 203 million population and the wide
territory that will need many vehicles for transportation.

SOFIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkey supports Sofia's intention
to join NATO, said Turkish President Suleyman Demirel on Monday
during his two-day state visit to Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
NATO is "unthinkable" without Bulgaria and Romania, Demirel
said at a joint news conference with his Bulgarian counterpart
Peter Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said he has written letters to the top leaders of the
United States, Britain, France and Germany asking that NATO take
special steps to admit Bulgaria and Romania.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov has said that the applications from Bulgaria and
Romania, and even Macedonia, should be considered in the light of
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current Kosovo crisis, Demirel said diplomacy
should be the highest priority in solving the crisis, but if it
fails to achieve that goal, force must be used.
</P>
<P>
"We hope things will not go that far and that there is still a
chance for a political resolution, but if it requires a military
solution, I don't see any reason for it to go beyond Kosovo's
borders," Demirel said. He said there is no apparent danger for
Bulgaria.

development in the new century, due to unremitting efforts from
both sides, said visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Rome,
Italy.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that China will realize its

</P>

Jiang made the remarks yesterday while meeting Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. The discussions were held

Standing Committee, expressed his hope here yesterday that China
and Ukraine strengthen cooperation in law enforcement and
procuratorial fields.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during his meeting with Mykhail Petebenko,
procurator-general of Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao yesterday called for effective
measures to prevent forest fires this spring, as the relatively
high temperatures last winter may make their occurrence more
likely.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out
that less snow had fallen last winter, which meant that

However, China has two preconditions for improving ties with
the Vatican, said Zhu Bangzao, who is accompanying President Jiang
Zemin during the state visit.
</P>
<P>
One condition is the Vatican must sever relations with Taiwan,
he said, because there is only one China, and the government of
the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government
of China, and the second condition is the Vatican must not use
religion to interfere in China's internal affairs, including
China's international matters, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China to Rectify Vehicle Insurance Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC), the industry's watchdog, is set to bring order
to the chaotic vehicle insurance market by enforcing unified
insurance policies and premiums as of April 1.
</P>
<P>
Wu Dingfu, vice-chairman of CIRC, was quoted in Tuesday's China
Securities daily as saying that unifying vehicle insurance
documents is an important move toward cleaning up this vast
insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle insurance achieved a turnover of 28.1 billion yuan (3.4
billion U.S. dollars) last year, 56.2 percent of all premiums, and
15 million vehicles were insured during the period.
</P>
<P>
However, the market is seriously disturbed by rampant illegal
activities, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Some insurance companies have raised the insurance commission
and return rate, while lowering the premium rate and enlarging
insurance obligations to win more customers.
</P>
<P>
Others wrote different premium sums on the alternate policies,
and, the most harmful of all, are fake policies by which car
owners receive no indemnities after car accidents.
</P>
<P>
Wu also attributed the confusion in the sector to poor
management of insurance companies and lack of supervision.
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies have been entrusted to design and issue
their own policies, and these policies are easy to forge, while
ambiguous clauses often lead to discrepancies between insurers and
the insured for lack of set standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC will first tackle this problem by supervising the
creation of uniform policies, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
All six types of policies will have their own unified forms and
standardized contents, and the CIRC will administer the policy
numbers itself.
</P>
<P>
In addition, one policy will insure only one vehicle, compared
with the old practice of insuring several cars with one policy.
</P>
<P>
New anti-forgery techniques will also be applied in the
printing of new policies.
</P>
<P>
The new policies will be brought into use beginning April 1,
and policies already printed will be allowed in use for one more
month.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC has also laid down two management provisions to unify
the clauses and premium rates of vehicle insurance in a bid to
eliminate illegal competition.
</P>
<P>
Those who break these rules will be fined 10,000 to 100,000
yuan, or be forced to cease their business activities for a period
ranging from one month to one year, according to Wu.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Parties Object to President's Statement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Romania's major political
parties criticized President Emil Constantinescu's remarks on
Yugoslavia Monday and insisted that Romania stick to finding a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday, Constantinescu urged the Yugoslav
government to make concessions and voiced support for a possible U.
S.-led military action against the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the peace talks in Paris represent the last opportunity
for a political settlement of the crisis. Once the peace talks end,
NATO intervention to end the conflict would be necessary and legal.
</P>
<P>
The number one opposition party, the Party of Social Democracy,
accused the president's remarks of being "irresponsible". NATO's
announcement of military action would be a wrong and an
adventurous decision, said the head of the party, Ion Iliescu, who
warned that Yugoslavia might become the second Vietnam if the
military action materializes.
</P>
<P>
The stand on the issue should be very cautious, Iliescu, also
the former Romanian president stressed, adding that the country
should insist on a political solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Romanian National Unity Party Valeriu Tabara
claimed that NATO military intervention is illegal. He said that
Romania should never take part in any military action in Yugoslav
territory. Participation would imply that Romania has declared war
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Another major party, the Alliance for Romania, said in a
statement that when the legality of a military attack remains
unclear, it is inappropriate for a president to make known his
stand.
</P>
<P>
According to reports by the popular Romanian TV channel Antenna
1, most of the people living in the capital of Bucharest expressed
their sympathy and support to Yugoslavia, with which Romania has
traditional friendship.

HELSINKI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russians Elena Berezhnaia and
Anton Sikharulidze proved that the sub-par performance in the
Grand Prix finals last month was just a lapse when they won the
pairs short program on Monday here at the world figure skating
championships.
</P>
<P>
The titleholders, who skated first of the title contenders,
went back to their slick and silky best after seven mistakes at
the Grand Prix, where they placed second.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo of China, who snatched the title of
pair dance at the Grand Prix finals, took a step backwards when
Xue touched one hand on the ice landing a throw triple loop.
</P>
<P>
But they were still rated second best on the night, ahead of
European silver medallists Dorota Zagorska and Mariusz Siudek of
Poland, who fell behind for their lack of the class of Shen and
Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Canadian champions Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz placed fourth
before Russians Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov. Tikhonov scaled
down the opening triple toe loop to a double and touched a hand
down on the landing.

<HEADLINE> China, US Promoting Environmental Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China and United States have
great potential to strengthen collaboration in environmental
protection, top environmental officials of the two countries said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
According to Today's China Daily, both countries are ready and
willing to cooperate extensively in conserving the environment and
resources and in promoting sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
During talks with a US environment delegation headed by Carol M
Browner, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency,
Director of the State Environmental Protection Administration (
SEPA) Xie Zhenhua said the two countries have established a good
relationship in the last two decades in coping with environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
However, cooperation has been on a small scale and should be
further developed, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government has attached great importance to
Sino-US environmental cooperation and such collaboration has
become a major part of Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
The government and the people of the United States wish to
continue to build their relationship with China, and this benefits
both countries and environmental protection worldwide, Browner
told a press conference after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China should cooperate to find solutions
to many outstanding environmental problems, including climate
changes and green house gas emissions, she added.
</P>
<P>
She said she hoped that extensive exchanges and cooperation
would enable China to profit from US experiences and avoid the
mistakes her country had made during industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Browner was invited by SEPA to visit China to inspect
implementation of the Sino-US cooperation project on the
monitoring of urban air quality. This project was launched last
year during US President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also being used to make preparations for Premier
Zhu Rongji's visit to the United States next month.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, SEPA and the US delegation discussed proposed
projects for cooperation in the near future. The US delegation
raised 12 projects that are mainly related to air quality
assessment, reduction of air pollution and the relationship
between air pollution and respiratory diseases.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Insists on Political Solutions to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic Monday stressed that his federal republic as well as
Serbia can never accept any solutions to make Kosovo a "state
within a state."
</P>
<P>
He made the remark when meeting three international Kosovo
mediators - Chris Hill from the United States, Wolfgang Petrisch
from the European Union and Boris Mayorsky from Russia - here
Monday afternoon, the official Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The three mediators were sent by the six-nation Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia to try to persuade Milosevic to sign a
political settlement drawn up at peace talks in France last month.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, expressed his full supports to the
stance adopted by Serbian delegates in the two rounds of Kosovo
peace talks held separately in Rambouille and Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslavia and Serbia insisted that sovereignty and
territorial integrity as well as ethnic equalities be the
preconditions for a political deal of autonomy for Kosovo to be
reached.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic also handed over a letter addressed to British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Huber
Vedrine - the co-chairmen of the peace talks in France which ended
last week. The ethnic Albanians alone signed the deal.
</P>
<P>
"Your peoples should be shamed because you are threatening a
small European nation which is defending its territory from
separatism, their citizens and their historical dignity from
hooligans who don't know what either history or dignity means,"
Milosevic said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
He said his federal republic will insist, as always, on
political solutions to the Kosovo crisis through peaceful
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Budget Deficit Hits 42.87 Billion Dollars in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. budget deficit last
month reached 42.87 billion dollars, following a 70.35 billion
dollars surplus in January, the Treasury Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the February deficit widened from 41.
75 billion dollars a year ago. But it was slightly narrower than
the Congressional Budget Office's estimate of a 45.8 billion-
dollar deficit earlier last month. January's budget surplus
swelled because of a calendar irregularity having accelerated
certain payments in December.
</P>
<P>
In February, government receipts rose 1.5 percent to 99.41
billion dollars while outlays increased 1.9 percent to 142.28
percent, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of the current federal fiscal year
beginning on October 1 government receipts increased 5.7 percent
to 683.74 billion dollars from 646.94 billion dollars a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department said fiscal 1999 outlays, which totaled
711.25 billion dollars, are running about 1.2 percent ahead of the
702.99 billion dollars recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the February number shouldn't be seen as the
start of a new trend because of seasonal factors.

<HEADLINE> China Overhauls Waterworks and Conservancy Structures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Most of China's water conservancy
projects damaged during last summer's flood have been rebuilt or
renovated with the support of local authorities.
</P>
<P>
As of this month, 87 percent of post-flood reconstruction
projects have been completed, sources from the Beijing-based State
Flood-Control Headquarters (SFCH) confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, public bidding has been used in 60 percent of the
projects and strict supervision by professional engineers in 52
percent of them to ensure quality, sources were quoted by today's
China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the safety of key cities and major industrial bases
along China's flood-prone rivers during this year's flood season,
9.7 billion yuan (1.16 billion US dollars), 70 percent of total
funds available, have been used for reconstruction so far, the
SFCH's latest statistics indicated.
</P>
<P>
More than 28 billion yuan worth of waterworks, including flood-
control and irrigation projects, were damaged during last summer's
floods, which scoured many areas along the Yangtze and Songhua
rivers.
</P>
<P>
To withstand floods during this year's flood season, central
and local governments have poured a record 14 billion yuan in post-
flood reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
The funds were expected to be used for completing about 90
percent of 550,000 scheduled projects before this year's flood
season.
</P>
<P>
"It will be hard for China to accomplish all of its scheduled
post-flood reconstruction, because last summer's floods receded
later than usual," one SFCH's official said.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 165 in Indonesian Ethnic Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 23 (Xinhua) -- The official death toll in
week-long clashes between local residents and migrant Madurese in
Sambas regency in Indonesia's West Kalimantan province reached 165
Monday, according to reports reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, refugees, mostly women and children, continued to
pour into the provincial capital of Pontianak on tightly guarded
land and river transportation. Official estimates put their number
at from 8,000 to 12,000.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Madurese refugees have taken shelter in Pontianak's
Pangsuma indoor stadium. Others are accommodated in a local haj
dormitory and military barracks.
</P>
<P>
Reports said thousands of Madurese are in hiding in forests.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 2,142 houses were burned in Sambas since
clashes broke out last week.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, the Armed Forces (ABRI) dispatched reinforcements,
numbering between 750 and 1,000 troops, to the province to support
the existing 2,000 personnel.
</P>
<P>
Antara News Agency reported that the control of the security
forces -- including those of the police's Mobile Brigade, Army's
Strategic Reserves Command, Air Force's Special Force and the
Navy's marines -- was handed over from the Sambas police chief to
the local military chief.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Tanjungpura Military Command overseeing Kalimantan
Maj. Gen. Zainuri Hasyim said security personnel would crack down
on the mobs, including confiscation of their weapons.
</P>
<P>
ABRI Commander Gen. Wiranto, who is also minister of defense
and security, urged members of the public not to comment on recent
disturbances without an understanding of their causes.
</P>
<P>
ABRI's main task was to contain the spread of the unrest,
Wiranto was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said the violence erupted after a group of men, believed
to be Madurese, attacked a truck loaded with Dayaks in Parapakan
village, leaving one dead Monday last week.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted Edi Petebang of Kalimantan Review
weekly as saying that the clashes were mainly between Malays and
Madurese.
</P>
<P>
He said a small number of Dayaks became involved in Samalantan
and Sanggau Ledo subdistricts only after a Dayak man was allegedly
murdered by a mob of Madurese.
</P>
<P>
The unrest was the worst in the province since similar battles
between Dayaks and Madurese that left 300 dead in early 1997.

</P>

Statistics from the city's foreign investment bureau show that

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will have to stay
for extra 60 days in a Maryland jail after his one-year sentence
is reduced, Indiana authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A judge's ruling Friday could reduce the former heavyweight
champion's sentence for assault to time already served. But Tyson
then would have to begin serving 60 days for violating terms of
his Indiana probation for a 1992 rape conviction.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is, even if the Maryland sentence is modified,
he will not be released from jail on Friday," spokeswoman Beverly
Phillips of the Marion County prosecutor's office said.
</P>
<P>
Tyson has requested that his assault sentence be reduced to
eight month, and a hearing is set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Marion County prosecutor Scott Newman, Tyson lawyer James
Voyles and Indiana judge Patricia Gifford also talked Monday and
agreed Tyson still must serve the extra time.
</P>
<P>
"If the judge modifies his sentence, at that point his Indiana
sentence will begin," Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
Once the Indiana sentence begins, Tyson could serve as little
as 30 days, depending on time off for good behavior and other
provisions, Phillips said. That means Tyson could leave jail by
April 26.

<HEADLINE> Centuries-Old Tea Trees Discovered in SW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Local people in southwest China's
Yunnan Province have found a large number of ancient tea trees
that were planted hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
The tea trees, covering 1,900 ha. and growing 1,400 meters
above sea level, have been described as a "natural museum of tea
trees" and reckoned to be one of the places where such trees
originated.
</P>
<P>
According to records, local ethnic people, mostly living by
hunting, developed a habit of drinking tea to revitalize
themselves and began planting tea trees as early as 696.
</P>
<P>
Recently, four tea trees, aged 700-800 years, were removed from
their hometown of Lancang County to Kunming, the provincial
capital where the '99 World Horti-Expo is due to be held from May
1 to October 31. Two of them have survived the transplanting.

<HEADLINE> China's Paper Industry Faces Tougher Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- China's paper market will recover
this year, even though many Chinese paper manufacturers are
finding it difficult to expand their business, because of
intensifying competition.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's overseas edition of People's Daily,
China's paper industry will remain stable this year, and the
foreign-funded paper mills which came into production lately will
also increase the market paper supply and make competition much
tougher.
</P>
<P>
It is said that China's total consumption of newsprint will
continue to rise this year, as some China-based newspapers are
expanding their pages and circulation. The Chinese government's
order banning the felling of natural forests will also affect the
production of newsprint and imports are still needed to help
balance the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The country's demand for cement-bag paper will increase as a
result of increased investment in capital and infrastructure
projects this year, with imports of copper plate paper to increase
marginally this year.

<HEADLINE> Learning Has No Age Barrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Everyone knows the saying, "It's
never too late to learn." For 72-old Fu Jianye in southwest China,
retirement has allowed him to catch up on the lost opportunities
for higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Fu, a retired worker in Guiyang, capital of Guizhou Province,
was forced to quit his schooling upon graduation from primary
school due to poverty.
</P>
<P>
Before his retirement, the eager-to-learn man had succeeded in
passing examinations on professional school courses and became a
technician by his own efforts.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his retirement in 1987, Fu began to study
literature and calligraphy at a local university for the aged and
by 1993, he had passed national level tests in all his subjects.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the retiree joined a communication course for a
master's degree in modern literature, which was jointly sponsored
by the China Southwest Normal University and the Guizhou Normal
University. He is expected to get the master's degree this year.
</P>
<P>
"The more I have learned, the more I want to learn," says Fu
who now plans to continue his studies until he acquires a
doctorate which will take him to around 80 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Fu is among the best students, according to his classmates. So
far, he has written reading notes in 80 notebooks totaling 500,
000 Chinese characters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese telecommunications
companies awaiting approval from the Ministry of Information
Industry to start Internet phone services will possibly obtain
licenses in the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to officials with MII, three major Chinese
telecommunications companies, including China Telecom, China
Unicom and China Jitong Telecommunications Company, are piloting
IP services in 25 major Chinese cities for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Baoxin, deputy director of the Telecommunications
Administration Department of MII, said that the ministry is
considering granting licenses to the three or more
telecommunications companies after the aforementioned dealers end
their trials later this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that in order to maintain the healthy development of IP
services, a fixed charging rate will be given to the three
pioneering telecommunications companies during the trial period.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said that IP services can effectively lower the
costs of international long distance dialing, compared with those
offered through the current Chinese telecommunications networks,
since the Internet-based services transmit voice and speech sounds
through the global web.

<HEADLINE> New Jersey Lawmaker Calls for Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A New Jersey lawmaker proposed
a bill Monday that would require state officials to appoint and
pay boxing judges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Richard Codey introduced the bill after the
undisputed heavyweight title bout between Evander Holyfield and
Lennox Lewis ened in a disputed draw.
</P>
<P>
Codey says the three international main boxing bodies appoint
judges for boxing matches in New Jersey and the promoter pay their
fees and expenses.
</P>
<P>
Critics said the current system makes judges to feel beholden
toward their employing bodies and the promoter because they select
the judges and offer them pay.
</P>
<P>
"Having promoters involves in paying the judges and apparently
selecting them smells of fight-fixing, whether that occurs in
reality or not," said Codey.
</P>
<P>
But IBF president Bob Lee dismissed Codey proposal as a "knee-
jerk reaction."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's right for the public sector to take the
authority away from a private company," Lee said. "If the title
belongs to the IBF, then we ought to have something to say about
the people who are officiating."

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 23 (Xinhua) -- "This is a water plant built
with the help of Shanghai," says a local friend, pointing to a
group of modern industrial buildings at the entrance of Shigaze
City, in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
While visiting in this southwest China city, outsiders are
shown around a number of new public facilities which have been
built with financial and technical assistance from Shanghai, the
country's largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
"I think I've got a Shanghai dialect," says Zhaxi Cering, a
middle-aged local resident, "When I was a child, I made friends
with some young people from Shanghai and they taught me a lot
including Mandarin and other useful things."
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Zhaxi has become acquainted with new friends from
Shanghai, sent by the metropolitan government to assist Shigaze in
various development programs. In his leisure hours, the Tibetan
man plays bowling games in Shanghai Square, the largest
recreational center in Shigaze.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the central government asked inland provinces and
municipalities to help develop Tibet's local economy. Shanghai was
assigned to assist Shigaze Prefecture, where Shigaze City is
located.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the Shanghai Coordination Office,
this largest metropolis in China has, so far, sent nearly 100
officials to Shigaze and invested 146 million yuan to finance 306
local projects in economic, social, cultural and medical fields.
</P>
<P>
Puncog, a leading official in the prefecture, says great
changes have taken place in Shigaze, thanks to the assistance from
Shanghai, and in recent years, the prefecture has achieved an
average annual growth of over 10 percent, faster than the national
average.
</P>
<P>
"The 610,000 people of Shigaze Prefecture will remember the
profound love of Shanghai people for ever," he says.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a southwest China
city which was promoted in 1997 to a municipality under the direct
administration of the central government, has made remarkable
progress in building democracy and a legal system over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
The municipal people's congress and its standing committee have
issued 96 local laws and regulations governing various fields
including urban planning, environmental protection and land-use.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local law-makers have conducted wide-ranging
investigations and examinations on the implementation of laws, in
order to ensure the area's social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
A legislative consultation board has been set up and local law
experts and universities were consulted to help speed up the
promulgation of local laws.
</P>
<P>
The municipal legislative body has exercised its supervisory
role in dealing with a number of key issues that have drawn great
concern from the public, such as the resettlement of people
affected by the Three Gorges Hydro-Power Project, the
implementation of poverty-relief programs, the re-employment of
layoffs from state factories, and the implementation of court
orders.
</P>
<P>
Under the supervision of the legislative body, local
governments have demolished a large number of unsafe and old
buildings, exposed over 86,000 cases involving the illicit use of
land, and closed down 466 small enterprises that have violated the
law.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- A dinosaur exhibition hall has
been built close to Beijing's suburban Museum of Zhoukoudian
Peking Man Ruins.
</P>
<P>
And the new hall has quickly grown into a must-see item for
tourists to the area, especially children, since it was opened to
the public recently.
</P>
<P>
An official with the museum explained that construction of the
new dinosaur hall near the Peking Man Ruins is calculated to help
visitors better understand the concept of evolution and popularize
the knowledge of evolution.
</P>
<P>
With a floor space of 300 sq m, the hall displays fossils of
four dinosaurs, most of which have never been exhibited elsewhere.
Dinosaur fossils at the hall are inlaid inside simulated rock
layers so that visitors will have a real sense of the outdoor
world.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Longgu (dragon bones) Mountain some 50 km
southwest of Beijing, the Zhoukoudian Ruins of Peking Man is a
world-class relics protection site that boasts the richest
resources for studying palaeoanthropology.
</P>
<P>
The many relics include huge natural caves used as habitat by
Peking Man some 700,000-230,000 years ago, more than 40 male and
female fossils of Peking Man, large amounts of stoneware and
animal fossils, and fire remains, as well as the first cranium
unearthed by Professor Pei Wenzhong in 1923.

Clinton told reporters at the White House as he awaited the result

WASHINGTON -- The United States on Monday announced its second

200,000 tons.

the remaining 209,000 ton shortfall in donations solicited by the
U.N. World Food Program for DPRK.

U.S. officials said the second 100,000 tons in food aid would
be part of a $32 million program that aims to introduce new, more
successful potato crops to DPRK.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Sales of personal computers will
reach 5.1 million in China this year, up a quarter from that of
1998, according to officials with the Ministry of Information
Industry.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qi, director of the Information Products Administration
Department of MII, said that Chinese computer manufacturers will
face tougher competition this year, as many large Chinese
enterprises involved in the manufacture and retailing of
electrical appliances have also elbowed into the PC market.
</P>
<P>
"This will increase both China's production capacity and market
supply of computers, and computer manufacturers need to improve
their technology and after-sales services in order to consolidate
their market position," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
She said that it would become a new trend for manufacturers of
computers to operate in accordance with the specific needs of
customers rather than at their own whims. China's software and
information services industries will maintain a strong momentum of
development in the coming years, she added.
</P>
<P>
The advancement of the sector will also help push forward the
development of China's PC market as costs of telecommunications
services have been cut and Internet services are growing rapidly
in China.
</P>
<P>
The invention of more multi-media software for educational
programs and family entertainment purposes will become a driving
force supporting the growth of PC sales in China.
</P>
<P>
China manufactured 4.4 million PCs last year, and domestically-
made computers accounted for 72 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also called on Chinese computer manufacturers to develop
more network products to meet the strong market demand.

<HEADLINE> Moya's Top Ranking on the Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Perhaps being the world's top-
ranked player was a little too much pressure for Spaniard Carlos
Moya.
</P>
<P>
Moya was outlasted by 20-year-old Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean
in a thrilling third-set tiebreaker today in the fourth round of
the Lipton tennis championships and could lose his spot at the top
tonight.
</P>
<P>
If second-seeded American Pete Sampras beats No. 15 Albert
Costa of Spain this evening, Moya will fall from his perch.
</P>
<P>
Moya claimed the first set 6-3, but lost the second 6-4.
Grosjean, who had never beaten a top-10 player and is ranked 74th
in the world, forced the tiebreaker and won the final set 7-5.
</P>
<P>
Moya, 22, ousted Sampras from the top spot by reaching the
final at Indian Wells tournament last week.
</P>
<P>
To regain the No. 1 ranking, the two-time champion Sampras need
only beat Costa tonight.
</P>
<P>
Seventh seed Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands routed Marat
Safin of Russia 6-3, 6-1.

<P>
YINCHUAN, March 23 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged drought conditions in
the arid Xihaigu area in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region since last autumn have affected spring planting and created
water shortages affecting local residents and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The precipitation level since last August has dropped by 21
percent, with temperatures some three degrees centigrade higher
than normal, according to the local meteorological bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau reports that Yanchi, Tongxin and Haiyuan counties
have witnessed a rare 140 day period without rain.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the region's 320,000 wells used to sustain
production and life are dry, with water shortages affecting more
than 350,000 people and 120,000 head of livestock.
</P>
<P>
Local agricultural officials note that the continuing lack of
rain will make it impossible to plant summer grain on nearly 66,
000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The region has launched a "Life Program" to battle drought
conditions, in addition to organizing 29 special work teams and
allocating over 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) to
purchase equipment and machinery.

<HEADLINE> WBU to Change Judging System for Title Fights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The World Boxing Union, one of a
fistful of organisations sanctioning world title fights of various
merit, said on Monday that its judging system will be changed from
April 11.
</P>
<P>
Without mentioning the controversial undisputed world
heavyweight title bout between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield
nine days ago, the WBU said in a statement that it was time for a
change "in light of recent events".
</P>
<P>
The WBU, whose lightly-regarded titles have tended to be
between lesser known fighters, was not involved in the heavyweight
clash at Madison Square Garden between Britain's WBC champion
Lewis and the American WBA and IBF champion.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the WBU would change its system from a 10
point system to a 20 point one which it said would give judges
more flexibility in scoring championship contests.
</P>
<P>
The organisation said it looked at the scoring pattern for each
judge over their past six championship fights, looking for any
signs of scoring irregularities.
</P>
<P>
"WBU judges are then rested or dismissed if they fail in any
way to keep within the WBU regulations," it said.
</P>
<P>
The WBU also said it had strict rules banning any fraternising
with the fight promoter.
</P>
<P>
The Lewis-Holyfield fight was declared a draw after American
judge Eugenia Williams scored it 115-113 in favour of Holyfield,
South Africa's Stanley Christoudoulou ruled it 116-113 for Lewis
and Briton Larry O'Connell had it 115-115.
</P>
<P>
A New York grand jury is investigating whether or not the
judges took illegal payments, according to investigative sources,
and how the judges were selected.

reserve Nigell Martyn, who has come down with a slight back
problem.
</P>
<P>
Walker, whose form went to pieces because of personal problems
earlier in the season, has battled back at club level and helped
Tottenham win the League Cup on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> WBU: We Sacked Lewis-Holyfield Judge Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Eugenia Williams, the American
boxing judge at the center of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
controversy, was sacked by the British-based World Boxing Union
last year, according to the president of the WBU on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Williams, the Independent Boxing Federation's nominee from New
Jersey, was the only one of the three judges to score the fight in
Holyfield's favor and has been subjected to intense criticism
since the unification fight.
</P>
<P>
Jon Robinson, president of the WBU, revealed that Williams was
removed from his judges panel for being "a loner" last spring.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that the organisation had no problems with
Williams' scoring and confirmed that on the last two occasions she
worked for the body she was in accord with her two colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Robinson said: "We consider the WBU to be a family and Eugenia
Williams didn't fit in. She was a loner and not a team player.
</P>
<P>
"We have got rid of about 30 judges and she was one of them.
But I think the people who picked her for the Lewis fight were
more at fault than she was. She should never have been put in that
position."
</P>
<P>
Robinson said that Williams had been employed by the WBU once a
year over the last four or five years.
</P>
<P>
Her last WBU fight was an all-Italian welterweight contest
between Alessandro Duran and Michele Picirillo which Picirillo won
on a unanimous points verdict. Williams' score of 117-111 was
identical to that of the other two judges.

<HEADLINE> Welcoming Banquet Held for Visiting Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua)-- A welcoming banquet was held for
visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin here Monday evening by
Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro at Quirinale, the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said in his toast that China and Italy are important
members of the international society, which hold common or similar
views on many important international issues.
</P>
<P>
Peace and development are the key theme of the contemporary
world, Jiang said. However, it is still not peaceful and the
mankind faces many new challenges, he added.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to strengthen consultation and cooperation
with Italy on international affairs, so that to make contributions
to safeguarding world peace, promoting common development and
establishing a peaceful, stable, just and reasonable international
political and economic order," Jiang elaborated.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that China can only develop together
with the rest of the world. It values the exchange and cooperation
with Italy and other European countries in every field.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to study and learn from the good experiences of any
other country through contacts, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said in his toast that Jiang's current visit has
turned a new leaf for the bilateral ties, which is just what the
Italian government has been expecting.
</P>
<P>
He praised that China's amendments to the Constitution
concerning the construction of legal system, market economy, the
role of private economy are measures good for opening to the
outside world and looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
Scalfaro said that no matter in Italy or other part of the
world, the drastic social and economic progress China has scored
in its 20 years of reforms has won great appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Along with the strengthening of mutual contacts, Italy and
China will have more and more common points on major international
issues, Scalfaro said.
</P>
<P>
He made a positive comment on China's effort concerning the
future of the United Nations and the reform of UN Security
Council, hoping that the effort will contribute to the efficiency
and the quality of being representative and democratic of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The President also expressed appreciation of China for its
constructive role in maintaining regional and world stability when
dealing with such issues as international safety and regional
crisis, saying that China has proceeded from the attitude of being
conscientious and responsible.

WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Albania has asked to meet
with NATO's North Atlantic Council to talk about the danger of
violence spreading across the border from the Serbian province
of Kosovo, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.

"We understand that Albania is concerned about the problem of
spillover of violence into their territory and coping with the
possible influx of refugees," State Department spokesman James
Foley said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Albania has now about 18,500 refugees from Kosovo. About
20,000 Kosovars took refuge in Albania during an offensive last
year and the number could increase the fighting continues, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States had expressed its willingness to
help Albanians to cope with the possible influx of refugees.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Issues New Rulings on Steel Dumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Steel producers in five
countries and Taiwan province of China have illegally dumped
stainless steel in the United States at prices below production
costs or home-market prices, the U.S. Commerce Department
announced on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that three of the countries -- Belgium,
Italy and South Africa -- also gave their producers unfair
subsidies that effectively lowered prices. Canada, South Korea and
Taiwan were guilty only of dumping, it said.
</P>
<P>
Those producers face tariffs of up to 60 percent on that
product if the independent U.S. International Trade Commission
determines the practice has injured or threatens to hurt U.S.
steel makers. The commission is to rule by May.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce's finding on Monday applies only to a specialized
steel product known as stainless steel plate in coils. It comes
rolled up like carpet and is used in specialized tasks such as
chemical processing, pollution control and petroleum refining.
</P>
<P>
Although the product makes up a small part of overall steel
consumption, it is among the first of the dumping complaints to
wind their way through the administration since steel import
levels began to rise dramatically in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A much larger case involving hot-rolled carbon steel is pending
before the Commerce Department, with a final ruling due next
month. The department issued last month preliminary rulings
finding evidence that Japan, Russia and Brazil had engaged in
illegal dumping.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel industry contends that low-priced imports have
resulted in thousands of layoffs and three company bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives defied a presidential veto
threat last week and passed legislation imposing quotas on foreign
steel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Second Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
announced its second donation of 100,000 metric tons of food aid
to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, raising the total of
the new aid to 200,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier the State Department said the United States had decided
to provide 100,000 metric tons of food aid to help fill the
remaining 209,000 ton shortfall in donations solicited by the U.N.
World Food Program for DPRK.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said the second 100,000 tons in food aid would
be part of a $32 million program that aims to introduce new, more
successful potato crops to DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The two announcements came five days after Washington and
Pyongyang reached an agreement for U.S. experts to inspect an
underground site in Kumchang-ri, where Washington suspected the
DPRK was reviving its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
The potato project was announced in general terms last week
after the agreement reached by the two countries. But details were
not known until now.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said a U.S. technical team could leave as early
as this weekend for the DPRK to work out details for the potato
project.

<HEADLINE> Annan Says It Is Never Too Late to Seek Peaceful Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday said that "it's never too late" to try to solve
the issue of Kosovo, a Yugoslav province in the Republic of
Serbia, through diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Annan, upon leaving the hall of the U.N. Trusteeship Council,
made the statement in response to a press question on the visit to
Belgrade by U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrook.
</P>
<P>
"Well, at least an effort has been made, and I think that, when
it comes to attempts to solve the issues or conflicts
diplomatically, it's never too late to try; one should try, up to
the last minute," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And each moment gained for peace and each moment that war is
deferred, is a victory for peace," he said. "And I think that we
should keep at it."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan, in a statement issued through his spokesman,
said that he "is gravely concerned at the escalation of violence
in Kosovo," and "urges the Yugoslav authorities to halt their
military offensive in Kosovo, which clearly violates the agreement
of last October, and to act to alleviate the humanitarian
situation and, even at this late hour, to cooperate fully with the
members of the Contact Group in their efforts to prevent further
confrontation and reach a settlement in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Holbrook was in Belgrade in a final bid to persuade Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace plan on Kosovo or
risk getting bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no sign yet to show that Belgrade has made
any compromise on the Western proposal following the meeting
between Milosevic and Holbrook.

during the past week due to the ongoing offensive by Yugoslav
security forces with intensified fighting between them and Kosovar
Albanian paramilitary units."
</P>
<P>
"In addition to 269,000 refugees in Western Europe and
neighboring countries, the number of those displaced within Kosovo
has now reached 235,000 civilians, including 25,000 who have fled
their homes since March 20," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Displacement has been accompanied by renewed burning of
houses by the security forces and destruction of means of
livelihood," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Increasing insecurity has led most humanitarian agencies to
reduce their presence in Kosovo over the past 48 hours," the
statement said, "Nevertheless, the delivery of humanitarian aid
continues."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after U.S. President Bill Clinton once again
issued a grave warning to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
rein in his forces in the Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians
make up some 90 percent of Kosovo's population of 2 million, or
face NATO military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Eofgang Petritsch, one of the international mediator
who met the Yugoslav president in Belgrade on Monday, said that
Milosevic is not ready to compromise on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
President Milosevic Monday sent a fierce letter to the French
and British foreign ministers in response to their plea for him to
accept a peace plan for Kosovo, saying that his government was
ready for negotiations, but not an imposed solution.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrook met President Milosevic in
Belgrade on Monday in what was reported as a final bid to persuade
him to accept a peace plan on Kosovo or risk getting bombed by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in February last year after ethnic
Albanians have been fighting with Serbs for independence.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Proposes Probe of UN Response to Rwanda Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
kofi Annan on Monday recommended to have an independent probe into
the way the United Nations reacted to the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the President of the Security Council Qin
Huasun, Annan said "in view of the enormity of the genocide that
occurred in Rwanda... questions continue to surround the actions
of the United Nations immediately before and during the period of
the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore my intention to set up an independent inquiry
into the actions which the United Nations took at that time,"
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been reproached for its failure to halt
the 1994 genocide in Rwanda in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsis
and moderate Hutus were butchered between April and June 1994.
</P>
<P>
The killings began the day after plane carrying the presidents
of Rwanda and Burundi was shot out of the sky on April 6 by a
missile as it prepared to land in Kigali, the Rwandan capital.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Renews Call for More U.S. Military Base Closures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen Monday renewed his request for another round of military
base closures and said communities near bases should look at
shutdowns as an opportunity, not a setback.
</P>
<P>
"Base closure need not be an economic death knell," Cohen said
in an address to a Pentagon-sponsored conference of community
leaders and military officials. "It can, in fact, be a starting
bell for the future."
</P>
<P>
Cohen said he would soon make his base-closing pitch again on
Capitol Hill, where many members of Congress strongly oppose the
Clinton administration's proposal for holding two more rounds of
base closings, in 2001 and 2005.
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult task," Cohen said of the challenge of
persuading Congress to agree to more base closures.
</P>
<P>
The administration has not said how many bases it thinks should
be closed. That decision would be made by a congressionally
authorized Base Realignment and Closure Commission, subject to
presidential approval. The Pentagon lacks the authority to close
bases on its own.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said the billions of dollars expected to be saved by
closing excess military bases is needed urgently to finance
military modernization and to improve the quality of life for
troops. Without those investments, he said, "we will see an exodus
out of the military" and a slide in combat readiness.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday urged Belgrade to halt their military offensive
in Kosovo, the Serbian province, and cooperate fully with the
six-member Contact Group in their efforts to prevent further
confrontation and reach a settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued through the U.N. chief's spokesman, said,
"The Secretary-General urges the Yugoslav authorities to halt
their military offensive in Kosovo, to act to alleviate the
humanitarian situation and, even at this late hour, to cooperate
fully with the members of the Contact Group in their efforts to
prevent further confrontation and reach a settlement in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> New GEF Project to Protect Mekong River Basin Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) had signed an agreement for a new
Global Environment Facility (GEF) project to promote the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in the Mekong
River Basin Wetlands, the UNDP said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong River Basin, which includes Cambodia, Lao PDR,
Thailand and Viet Nam, is home to a rich biodiversity and is
increasingly threatened by human pressure and has suffered
deforestation, soil loss and siltation, water pollution, habitat
destruction ans the accumulation of hazardous wastes, according to
the UNDP.
</P>
<P>
The project will ensure that major developments in the area
give due consideration to conservation needs and that rural
communities do not lose their resource base.
</P>
<P>
It will include a transboundary environmental assessment,
training and information exchange as well as establishment and
strengthening of regional networks and the development of a
strategy wetland action plan.
</P>
<P>
The budget for the project's initial phase is 450,000 U.S.
dollars, while the second phase is estimated to cost 10 million.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Agriculture, Jiang Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the Chinese Government has always attached great
importance to agriculture and issues of the countryside and has
given priority to the food and agricultural production and to the
guarantee of the people's basic living standard.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is now on a state visit to Italy, made the remarks
while meeting here this afternoon with Jacques Diouf,
Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations, Fawzi H. Al-Sultan, President of the International
Fund for Agricultural Development, and Ngongi, Deputy Executive
Director of the World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President, on behalf of the Chinese Government and
people, expressed his thanks to the three organizations for their
concern and support for the development of China's agriculture.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Computers Seen Vulnerable to Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Military computer and
communications systems are "increasingly compromised" and
vulnerable to attack by hackers and high-tech enemies, according
to a Pentagon-sponsored study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The study said although the Defense Department is working to
improve cybersecurity, technological advances are outpacing the
Pentagon's sluggish moves to protect vital information used in
today's battles.
</P>
<P>
"We're unchallenged on the muscle side of this equation," said
James McGroddy, chairman of the National Research Council
committee that wrote the study. "The problem here is the invisible
enemy."
</P>
<P>
McGroddy said command, control, computer, communications and
intelligence systems -- "the nervous system of the military" --
are aging fast while the high-tech tools to attack it are
generally thought to be improving by a factor of 10 every five
years.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon, recognizing the problem after hacker attacks on
its computers and cyberwar games, set up a "network computer
defense" joint task force of military and intelligence agencies
last December.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, a national security team of about 20 people, in a
cyberwar game lasting three months, gained access to unclassified
Pentagon computers, giving the team the ability to disrupt troops
movements.
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, teen-agers in the United States and Israel
attempted to break into Pentagon computers. The intrusion was
quickly detected, but it took days before military and law
enforcement officials determined it was not an attack by a foreign
government or an enemy.
</P>
<P>
The incidents prompted the Pentagon to make cybersecurity a
high priority, but the National Research Council committee
recommended the Defense Department move far more quickly and
change a military culture that puts more emphasis on warfighting
tanks than technology.

<HEADLINE> EU Governments Hope to See New Arm Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the 15
European Union (EU) governments agreed here Monday that a new
European Commission should be appointed as soon as possible and in
compliance with the procedures specified in the bloc's basic law,
the Amsterdam Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Observers here in Brussels believe this means that the
governments want a new and definitive EU executive branch instead
of an interim acting arm. The foreign ministers said they expect
the new commission speedily to put into effect the necessary
reforms, in particular for the improvement of its organization,
personnel management and financial control.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also said in a declaration that they expect the
outgong commission to remain in office until a new team is
appointed as the EU founding treaty requires them to do so.
</P>
<P>
The 20-strong European Commission led by president Jacques
Santer resigned last week after a damning report accused them of
being involved in mismanagement, fraud and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
During their regular meeting, the foreign ministers expressed
willingness to encourage the outgoing commission "resolutely to
represent the interests of the European Union to the outside world
as well. "It is most important that the commission remain
operational in dealing with the tasks immediately before us,
especially Agenda 2000," they said.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Ficher, as current EU Council
president, told reporters after the meeting that the EU heads of
government will just make a deal on how to choose a new commission
without mentioning any name at EU Berlin summit meeting on
Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Germany, as current rotating EU presidency, has said the
union's governments will hold a special meeting later to nominate
new leaders of the European Commission, which is mainly
responsible for drafting and implementing regulations.

Swazi Border Adjustment Committee chairman, Prince Khuzulwandle

and Ingwavuma in KwaZulu-Natal would continue, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not say when the prince sounded the

<P>
Khuzulwandle said people should not be misled by the
Organization of African Unity's ruling that borders of African
countries would stay as they were at independence.
</P>
<P>
The ruling only applied to countries formally colonized. This
excluded Swaziland which was made a British protectorate at the
request of Swazi King Mbandzene, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mpumalanga and Ingwavuma were ceded by Britain to South Africa
without the Swazi king's permission, said the prince.
</P>

He told the Swazi Times newspaper at the weekend that if the
land claim efforts failed, Swaziland would take South Africa to
the International Court of Justice in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> China on Its Population Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- To address aging, China
was placing a greater focus on the family and social structure,
China said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the thirty-second session of the Commission on
Population and Development, Chinese delegate Yang Kuifu said
China's population totaled 1.25 billion, of which 370 million
were urban residents and 870 million were rural.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to 20 years of family planning efforts, the birth rate
has declined from 33.4 percent in 1970 to 16.3 percent in 1998,
and the age structure of China's population was in the process of
rapid change, due to decreased fertility rates in a short time,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the number of people aged 60 years and older
would reach 130 million, making up 10 percent of the total
population, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of the new century, she said, China faced
increased population pressures resulting from its huge number of
people and the aging of its population.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government believed that the key solution lay in
its commitments to develop the economy vigorously, enhance its
comprehensive national strength, integrate its population
programs into its general strategy for development, and utilize
its natural resources rationally, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
To addressing aging, China was placing a greater focus on the
family and social structures, and in that regard, China had
recently passed a law on the protection of elderly rights, which
would, among other things, improve social security systems, Yang
added.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Vows to Work for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Monday vowed in his first major policy speech to follow
his father Hussein's policies and to work for a durable and
comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter addressed to the nation, Abdullah said his
country would continue to support the "brotherly Palestinians to
attain their rights and establish their independent state on
their national soil."
</P>
<P>
The open letter was Abdullah`s first major policy speech since
he took the Jordanian throne on February 7, hours after his father
Hussein died of lymphatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
The new ruler said Jordan would also look for ways of lifting
the international sanctions on Iraq, Libya and Sudan to put an end
to the sufferings of the people in these countries.
</P>
<P>
The open letter marked the fact that Abdullah has begun to
focus part of his attention on the Middle East affairs, for which
he had been known as a fresh hand before he became the ruler of
the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah was expected to fill a unique diplomatic vacuum in
the Middle East affairs left by Hussein, who had been a key and
active role in the peace process of the region.
</P>
<P>
On home affairs, Abdullah stressed he would work to safeguard
the national unity of his kingdom, and would not accept any
outside interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the Jordanian people for their concerns
devoted to his father during his seven month battle against
cancer, and called on them to unite under the late king's polices
to build the kingdom into a modern country.
