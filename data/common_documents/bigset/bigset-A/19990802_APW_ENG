<HEADLINE>  Minor League Umps Work Their Way Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Eight years of long drives, cheap motels  
and ballpark food finally paid off for minor league umpire Jim 
Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	He made it to the big leagues as a substitute this season. And  
it looks like he's there to stay because of the labor dispute 
between umpires and major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a completely different atmosphere'' in the majors,  
Reynolds said last week from Anaheim, Calif., where was working a 
weekend series between the Angels and the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big difference between going into Toronto and  
working in front of 30,000 or 40,000 people and four or five 
thousand in Syracuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds is talkative about the life he's giving up, but he says  
little about being in the middle of a labor mess. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just hope they can get it all resolved up there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Major League Umpires Association, wanting a new  
collective bargaining agreement, said in July they were quitting 
Sept. 2. The leagues called their bluff, accepting 22 resignations. 
Reynolds is one of 25 minor league umpires hired as replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the magnitude of it all is more than I expected,''  
Reynolds said. ``The intensity and the atmosphere -- I don't think 
you can anticipate that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professional umpires usually get their start at one of two  
schools -- Jim Evans' Academy of Professional Umpiring and Harry 
Wendelstedt's Umpire School -- where they pay roughly $2,500 to 
$3,000 for a five-week course in umpiring. Students are monitored 
during the course by Professional Baseball Umpire Corp. scouts, who 
pick the top candidates for minor league openings. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most baseball players, umpires must work their way up  
league by league until they have a chance at the majors. But unlike 
players, who can bypass the minors if they're talented enough, 
umpires don't usually skip levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a prospect player, you're going to play maybe two or  
three years in the minor leagues. There are some guys who have 
never been in the minors,'' Reynolds said. ``Umpires, the way the 
system is set up now, it's six or seven years before you even get a 
look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reynolds said, the players remember the umpires from  
their early days. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you see the guys who you used to see in the minors, they  
have a smile on their faces and so do you. You spend a lot of time 
with a lot of those guys,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A minor league umpire's season starts with spring training in  
late February and can last through September if he is selected to 
work the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pay is nothing to brag about. Umpires in Single-A make an  
average of $1,800 to $2,000 a month while the top minor league umps 
in Triple A make $2,500 to $3,400, said Eric Krupa, administrator 
for the St. Petersburg, Fla.-based PBUC. 
</P>
<P>
	Life on the road in the lower minors can be tough. Umpires have  
to drive hundreds of miles after a night game to be in a new city 
for a game the next afternoon, Reynolds said. And the motel 
accommodations are lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	``You try to figure out which bed has the least bend in it,''  
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Triple-A umpire, Reynolds was making more money and getting  
to fly between cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires are booed almost nightly by sometimes ruthless  
spectators. But Reynolds and his International League crew, during 
a stopover earlier this season at the Columbus Clippers' stadium, 
said they usually have fun at the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 14 teams in this league,'' Reynolds said. ``There's  
two teams that think you're the worst crew and can't believe that 
you ever made it to Triple-A. There's two teams that think you're 
the best crew in the league and can't do anything wrong. The other 
10 teams tolerate you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds was finally called up to the majors in June, when the  
Boston Red Sox were home against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``That signified the major leagues to me -- Fenway Park,'' said  
Reynolds, who grew up about 100 miles southwest of Boston outside 
Hartford, Conn. ``It was absolutely incredible.''

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The main terminal of the Des Moines  
International Airport was evacuated today when a construction crew 
struck a natural gas line outside. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 people were ordered out of the building after the  
10:30 a.m. accident, said fire department spokesman Ron Wakeham. No 
one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	By 11:30 a.m., a crew from Mid-American Energy Co. had capped  
the 4-inch low-pressure gas line. Passengers were allowed back 
inside several minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Twins Admit to Shooting Father </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HENDERSON, N.C. (AP) -- Eleven-year-old twins have admitted that  
they fatally shot their father and wounded their mother and sister 
four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally charged with first-degree murder, the boys entered  
pleas Monday to lesser charges and avoided a public trial. Their 
identities were not released. 
</P>
<P>
	One pleaded responsible to second-degree murder and two counts  
of assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury. The 
other pleaded responsible to involuntary manslaughter and assault 
inflicting serious bodily injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers face sentencing in 60 days after counselors  
interview them. The maximum sentence would be confinement in a 
juvenile facility until they are 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mother, Deborah Bawcum, 44, and their 16-year-old sister,  
Robin, sat behind them during the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor David Waters told Judge H. Weldon Lloyd the shooting  
occurred April 1 after the mother went to their room and found a 
.223-caliber assault rifle under the covers of one bed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Bawcum tried to take the weapon, one twin wrestled  
with her for it and the other -- the only one to fire any shots -- 
fired at her with a .38-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bill Bawcum, 45, heard the shooting, he rushed upstairs and  
was shot twice. The same boy shot his sister as she called police. 
</P>
<P>
	After the proceeding, the prosecutor said there was no evidence  
the boys planned the attack despite a cache of ammunition in their 
room. The shootings happened with weapons the parents kept for 
personal protection at their rural home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a situation in which children disobeyed their parents  
and it had tragic consequences,'' Waters said.

	Barton's Children Laid to Rest  
</P>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Boy and girls dressed in their scout  
uniforms escorted the caskets today of Matthew and Mychelle Barton, 
whose father killed them and tucked them into bed with their toys 
before going on a deadly shooting spree. Pictures of the victims in 
soccer and cheerleading outfits had been placed in a hallway 
outside the White Columns Chapel in this Atlanta suburb, where they 
were eulogized as lovable and active children. Their father, Mark 
O. Barton, killed the children Wednesday, a day after he had killed 
their stepmother. He bashed in their skulls with a hammer and 
dunked them in a bathtub to make sure they were dead.

	Hillary Interview a Political Move

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An unidentified confidante of Hillary Rodham  
Clinton said the first lady's candid interview with Talk magazine 
about her husband's infidelities was a political calculation to put 
personal questions to rest before they popped up in her Senate 
campaign. Mrs. Clinton called her husband's adultery ``a sin of 
weakness,'' and the product of emotional scars -- ``abuse,'' she 
termed it -- left by battles between his mother and grandmother when 
he was 4 years old. White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said 
President Clinton was ``comfortable with the views expressed in the 
article.''

	Russia Denies Yugoslavia Arms Sale  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's top arms dealer denied today a report  
that the government exported anti-aircraft missiles to Yugoslavia 
shortly before NATO began its bombing campaign. Jane's Defense 
Weekly, based in Britain, reported today that Russia shipped parts 
for the S-300 surface-to-air missile system to the government of 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The report said Russians hid 
the components in railway cars full of scrap metal. A spokesman for 
Russia's Rosvooruzheniye arms company called the report 
``non-scientific fantasies,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

	Feds Boast of Exposing Tax Cheats

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal officials boasted today that they  
have finally breached Cayman Islands bank secrecy with the aid of a 
former bank owner who provided records that exposed hundreds of 
U.S. citizens as tax cheats. The one-time banker, John M. 
Mathewson, 71, was sentenced in federal court here on conspiracy 
and money laundering charges. U.S. authorities claim the case 
demonstrates that the approximately 500 banks in the tiny British 
colony exist only to serve as illegal tax shelters for a mainly 
American clientele.

the wreckage of two trains that crashed early Monday, killing 215 
people. The accident also injured 310 people, and authorities 
expected the death toll to climb. Some 2,500 passengers were on the 
trains. Officials said a signal error may have put the trains on

	TOKYO (AP) -- North Korea is improving and expanding facilities  
at its ballistic missile launch base on the country's east coast, a 
Japanese newspaper reported Tuesday. The Sankei newspaper, quoting 
unnamed Japanese and U.S. sources, said North Korea is constructing 
facilities for storing and injecting liquid fuel and oxidizing 
agents inside the compound of the launch base. U.S. and Japanese 
officials in Tokyo refused to comment. The report came amid fear 
that North Korea is preparing to test a long-range ballistic 
missile. The reclusive regime test-fired a missile last August that 
flew over Japan and landed in the Pacific.

	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley is gaining on Vice  
President Al Gore in polling in New York and actually outdoes the 
vice president when matched against Republican George W. Bush. In a 
Democratic primary matchup, Gore led Bradley 47 percent to 38 
percent in a survey by the Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. 
That's just half the margin of the poll released in early July, 52 
percent to 34 percent. Against Bush, Bradley led 46 percent to 39 
percent in the poll released today, up from the earlier survey that 
had Bush at 44 percent and Bradley at 43 percent.

	Woods Beats Duval in Prime Time

<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Tiger Woods went prime time Monday  
night, winning his showdown over David Duval under floodlights at 
Sherwood Country Club and the spotlight of a national television 
audience. Fittingly, Woods closed out a 2&AMP;1 victory on the par-3 
17th with a two-putt par. He won the first four par-3s to take a 
commanding lead, and hung on when Duval made one mistake too many. 
With a sun tucked behind the foothills, Duval conceded the match as 
the floodlights cast long shadows across the green. Whether the 
first golf event televised live in prime time by a network was a 
success won't be clear until overnight ratings for ABC Sports are 
released on Tuesday. Woods won $1.1 million, and Duval had to 
settle for $400,000.

<HEADLINE>  Sturm Vows Not To Meddle With Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Describing himself as a devoted sports fan who was  
determined to maintain local ownership, Donald Sturm vowed to 
operate the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche much like his 
other businesses: as an overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, whose $461 million purchase of the two franchises and the  
new $160 million Pepsi Center still must be approved by the city of 
Denver and both the NBA and NHL, addressed the media for the first 
time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he planned no immediate changes in either team, Sturm  
called the Nuggets' Dan Issel and the Avalanche's Pierre Lacroix 
``very competent general managers'' and said he would defer to them 
on player personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to be the same kind of owner I've been in  
my other businesses,'' said Sturm, 67, who made his fortune in 
telecommunications and banking and lives in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody gave me the advice in the newspaper that I ought to  
get the best people and give them authority and responsibility. 
Well, that's about what I've done in everything I've been involved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oversee things. I want to know what the strategic plans are.  
I want to know what the budgets are. I want to know why there's 
going to be deviations there. But on a day-to-day basis, I'm not a 
micromanager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he intended to be a visible owner like the New York  
Yankees' George Steinbrenner or more private, he said, ``I have no 
concept of that. I'm going to be my own person and handle it as I 
see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a low-key billionaire who has stayed out of the public  
eye until now, admitted he isn't comfortable in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in business for over 40 years, and I've been  
involved in many major transactions, some a lot larger than this 
one,'' Sturm said. ``But this is my first press conference. So be 
kind to me, be gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit to you that I didn't expect the notoriety that  
we're getting. Maybe I was naive. I hope that once these events 
pass it will become more of a stable situation and we won't find 
our names all over the place every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Ascent Entertainment Group believed it had sold the  
three properties to Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie of 
Columbia, Mo., for $400 million. However, after Ascent shareholders 
sued, saying the price was too low, the sale was set aside and a 
two-stage bidding process was established. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, whose inquiries into purchasing the properties originally  
were rebuffed during Ascent's negotiations with the Lauries, then 
prevailed in the first round over two other groups, one of which 
included former Broncos quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Sturm the right to advance to the second stage and  
engage in a bidding war with the Lauries, but they declined to 
participate.

<P>
	``I wasn't shocked at all,'' Sturm said when asked about the  
Lauries' abruptly withdrawal. ``I must admit to you that part of my 
strategy was to bring in a number that perhaps would dissuade the 
Lauries from bidding. I've done that before in other 
transactions.''

<P>
	Sturm said he had two principal reasons for purchasing the  
Nuggets, Avalanche and Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are Colorado assets, and they ought to be owned by  
somebody in the community,'' he said. ``The other reason is the 
intense interest that I have had and continue to have in sports. 
You name it, I've played it. I grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and I 
played street hockey on roller skates. I played high school 
basketball. I stopped playing three-man basketball maybe 10 or 15

years old, the art, assuming I have any, of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to the last two Broncos' championship games, and  
I've been to the French Open and Wimbledon. So I have a long-term 
interest in sports and I love the games. I watch a lot of sports on

relaxing.''

<HEADLINE>  Sturm Vows Not To Meddle With Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Describing himself as a devoted sports fan who was  
determined to maintain local ownership, Donald Sturm vowed to 
operate the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche much like his 
other businesses: as an overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, whose $461 million purchase of the two franchises and the  
new $160 million Pepsi Center still must be approved by the city of 
Denver and both the NBA and NHL, addressed the media for the first 
time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he planned no immediate changes in either team, Sturm  
called the Nuggets' Dan Issel and the Avalanche's Pierre Lacroix 
``very competent general managers'' and said he would defer to them 
on player personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to be the same kind of owner I've been in  
my other businesses,'' said Sturm, 67, who made his fortune in 
telecommunications and banking and lives in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody gave me the advice in the newspaper that I ought to  
get the best people and give them authority and responsibility. 
Well, that's about what I've done in everything I've been involved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oversee things. I want to know what the strategic plans are.  
I want to know what the budgets are. I want to know why there's 
going to be deviations there. But on a day-to-day basis, I'm not a 
micromanager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he intended to be a visible owner like the New York  
Yankees' George Steinbrenner or more private, he said, ``I have no 
concept of that. I'm going to be my own person and handle it as I 
see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a low-key billionaire who has stayed out of the public  
eye until now, admitted he isn't comfortable in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in business for over 40 years, and I've been  
involved in many major transactions, some a lot larger than this 
one,'' Sturm said. ``But this is my first press conference. So be 
kind to me, be gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit to you that I didn't expect the notoriety that  
we're getting. Maybe I was naive. I hope that once these events 
pass it will become more of a stable situation and we won't find 
our names all over the place every day.''

<HEADLINE> Mexico Beats U.S. 1-0 in Overtime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The new kid on the block won the respect of  
the big boys, even if it lost the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States lost to Mexico 1-0 in sudden death overtime  
Sunday at Azteca Stadium in the semifinals of the FIFA 
Confederations Soccer Cup, but gained respect as a powerful 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. plays Saudi Arabia in the third-place game Wednesday,  
while Mexico and Brazil play for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil routed Saudi Arabia 8-2 in the other semifinal in  
Guadalajara, with Ronaldinho scoring three times and Alex twice. 
</P>
<P>
	With less then 48 hours of rest, the Americans faced a Mexican  
squad that has never lost to the United States at Azteca Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Kasey Keller inspired a solid U.S. defense that survived  
a Mexican siege for 95 minutes and occasionally threatened the 
Mexican net. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the sixth minute of overtime, Cuauhtemoc Blanco pushed a  
loose ball into the net to dash the Americans' hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was a very good game,'' U.S. coach Bruce Arena  
said. ``There were two champions out there. Both teams played well. 
I congratulate Mexico for a very fine victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blanco had been tied up by Jeff Agoos and later Eddie Lewis for  
most of the game. But he broke through early in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	He first tried to kick the loose ball with his right foot, but  
it bounced off a defender as Keller went to his left. Blanco then 
pushed the ball in for his fifth goal of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their goalie played very well,'' Mexico coach Manuel Lapuente  
said. ``It was a tough game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss dropped the Americans' record to 6-3-1 this season and  
to 0-16-1 at Azteca. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. got to the semifinals by defeating New Zealand 2-1,  
losing to world champion Brazil 2-1 and then shocking Germany 2-0 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobi Jones and Frankie Hejduk missed with wide shots during a  
stretch, but the U.S. attackers never posed a serious threat to 
Mexican goalie Jorge Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 53rd minute, Jones got away down the left side. He passed  
to Ernie Stewart whose clear shot was stopped by Campos. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones took advantage of a Mexican mistake in the 66th minute and  
swept down the left side. But his lob went high over the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena criticized FIFA organizers saying, ``the schedule was not  
well thought out.'' He said his players did not have enough time to 
adjust to Mexico City's 7,350-feet altitude or have enough rest 
after playing Germany on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not to be disrespectful to FIFA, but the tournament is very  
unfair to the players,'' Arena said. ``It has been a great stay for 
us in Mexico. The competition has been great to help build our 
team. Unfortunately, we have not been able to put our full team 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil suffered an early shock when Saudi Arabia tied it 2-2  
early in the first, but recovered for an 8-2 route. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldinho scored three times and Alex twice, and goals also  
came from Joao Carlos, Ze Roberto and Roni. Marzouk Al Otaibi 
scored twice for the Saudis -- the first points Brazil has given up 
in the entire tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy,'' Ronaldinho said. ``It was a good team and a  
tough game. Now we have to do everything we can to come out of here 
as champions.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gore Bid Friend Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remembered Washington  
lobbyist Dan Dutko on Monday as an irreverent, funny man, a devoted 
Democrat and loyal friend who stuck by him during the toughest 
moments of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Vice President Al Gore and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, attended a packed memorial service at Washington's 
Temple Sinai for Dutko, 54, who died July 25 in a mountain bike 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a major  
Democratic fund-raiser, fell and struck his head while biking in 
Aspen, Colo., while participating in a weekend of fund-raising 
events for Democrats that Clinton also attended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have laughed and I have cried, and still I miss him  
terribly,'' Clinton said. He said he first met Dutko 27 years ago 
when they both worked in Texas for George McGovern's unsuccessful 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dan insisted on leading the campaign in west Texas, where it  
was hard to find anyone who would mention Senator McGovern's 
name,'' Clinton said. ``All his life he loved big challenges. He 
stayed with me and I turned out to be a bigger one than he 
bargained for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore remembered Dutko with an excerpt from the Talmud: ``His yes  
meant yes. His no meant no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really honored to have him as my friend,'' Gore said.  
``No matter what the goal, he surpassed it; no matter what the 
task, he achieved it. Dan was just irreplaceable, and I'm going to 
miss everything about him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A leading fund-raiser for Clinton and Gore, Dutko was also  
co-chairman of Leadership 2000, the Democratic National Committee's 
top finance committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1980, he founded the Dutko Group that grew to encompass three  
entities. One lobbied for businesses such as oil and gas companies 
and telecommunications groups. Another did public policy public 
relations. A third focused on state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko's widow, Deborah Jospin, is director of AmeriCorps.

<HEADLINE> PBS To Launch Saturday Kids' Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- PBS is breaking into the competitive  
Saturday morning children's television market with a $40 million 
project to develop six animated programs for preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	Books including Maurice Sendak's ``Seven Little Monsters'' and  
Rosemary Wells' ``Timothy Goes to School'' will be the basis for 
the programs, set to air in fall 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're delighted to extend the joy of reading to television,''  
John F. Wilson, PBS Programming Services senior vice president, 
told the Television Critics Association on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Children under 5 generally are ignored by commercial television,  
said Toper Taylor, president of Toronto-based Nelvana 
Communications Inc., producer of the PBS series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Advertisers have no desire to sell to a preschool audience,''  
Taylor said, with most Saturday morning programs aimed at 6- to 
11-year-old children. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelvana will get international sales rights and also rely on  
production partners and corporate underwriters to finance the 
three-year project. 
</P>
<P>
	Other books to be adapted for the series are ``George Shrinks''  
by William Joyce; ``Corduroy Bear'' by Don Freeman; ``Junior 
Kroll'' by Michael and Betty Paraskevas, and ``Elliot Moose'' by 
Andrea Beck. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two of the series will become part of PBS' daily  
schedule. Also joining that lineup will be ``Dragon Tales.'' The 
animated series about a brother and sister and their adventures in 
Dragon Land debuts on Sept. 6 . 
</P>
<P>
	PBS also announced a new logo intended to give public television  
a more appealing image to children and to unite the service's 
``kid-friendly'' activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having hit shows is not enough. We have to be a hit channel,''  
said Carole Feld, PBS senior vice president for brand management. 
</P>
<P>
	The cartoon-style design features a grinning child --  
alternatively a boy or girl -- to be used during children's 
programs, on the network's web site and for the upcoming PBS Kids 
Channel. The 24-hour channel debuts in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Other announcements made by PBS during the Television Critics  
Association meeting: 
</P>
<P>
	-- LookSmart, an Internet directory and search tool, will  
underwrite ``Sesame Street'' and four other programs for three 
years in what PBS called its most ``far-reaching'' corporate deal 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The LookSmart deal helped the PBS' national underwriting sales  
force reach a total $65.5 million in program sponsorships, up 110 
percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Writer-director Bruce Paltrow (``St. Elsewhere'') is joining  
the new ``PBS Hollywood Television'' series, which will feature 
drama and comedy, as executive producer for the first production. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fledgling venture PBS Records will release six new albums in  
the coming months, including four accompanying upcoming PBS shows.

<HEADLINE> Sean Elliott Awaits Word on Kidney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Sean Elliott of the San Antonio Spurs will  
have to wait at least another two weeks before possibly undergoing 
a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's brother has a kidney that appears compatible for a  
match, but commitments prevent him from traveling to San Antonio 
for another week or so, the San Antonio Express-News reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	When Elliott's brother arrives he will face several days of  
further tests to determine if he can be a donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott has been working out to remain in good shape before  
surgery, the Express-News reported. The 31-year-old forward hasn't 
identified which of his two brothers is the potential donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott wants to play for the Spurs after the transplant. He  
fought back from knee injuries and performed well this season in 
helping San Antonio to its first NBA championship.

<HEADLINE> 'Blair Witch' Good for Indie Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Blair Witch Project,'' shot for  
$60,000, is a reminder for movie moguls that filmmakers with cheap 
cameras can outdo a $70 million blockbuster at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which went into wide release nationwide over the  
weekend, was a close second behind ``Runaway Bride,'' the Julia 
Roberts-Richard Gere reunion. ``Runaway Bride'' took in about $35 
million over the weekend, roughly half what it cost to make. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' cost just $60,000 for filmmakers Eduardo Sanchez  
and Daniel Myrick to produce, plus $300,000 in other production 
expenses by distributor Artisan Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	It has already has made almost 100 times that much. ``Blair  
Witch'' did $29.2 million over the weekend, with the rest coming 
from a two-week limited release at a handful of packed moviehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch's'' per-screen average was $26,528, nearly 2.5  
times that of ``Runaway Bride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year there's a phenomenon, and `Blair Witch' is this  
year's,'' said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
	A sequel already is in the works, said Artisan President Amir  
Malin, and sales of ``Blair Witch'' books, T-shirts and other 
merchandise are bringing in millions more. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie history is filled with stories of out-of-nowhere films,  
such as ``Easy Rider,'' ``Dirty Dancing'' or ``The Full Monty,'' 
that rise to commercial success. Even Steven Spielberg and George 
Lucas were relatively unknown before ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' 
launched the era of blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's been nothing quite like ``Blair Witch,'' which has  
captured attention largely through word of mouth and promotion on 
the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	With the movie expanding from 1,100 theaters to about 2,000 next  
weekend, it's a safe bet ``Blair Witch'' will easily pass $100 
million in ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In terms of return on initial investment, ``Blair Witch'' is in  
good position to become the most profitable movie ever made, said 
Tom Borys, president of ACNielsen EDI Inc., which tracks the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reminder that there's no substitute for originality.  
Expensive stars and big-budget films aren't the only path to 
success,'' Borys said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fictional movie, ``Blair Witch'' presents itself as a  
documentary pieced together from video shot by three student 
filmmakers who disappeared in the woods while hunting for a witch. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing has played on that ``mockumentary'' notion,  
leaving some moviegoers guessing about whether the horror story is 
real or imagined. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan bought ``Blair Witch'' for $1 million after the  
distributor's executives saw it at the Sundance film festival. 
Malin said the company has spent $10 million on distribution and 
promotion, still relatively cheap by Hollywood blockbuster 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent film business as a whole is likely to benefit.  
Studios -- always trolling for low-budget gems -- will be searching 
harder after the success of ``Blair Witch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know these kinds of movies are out there,'' said Tom  
Sherak, head of distribution for 20th Century Fox. ``They are 
needles in haystacks, but this sort of energizes you as a company 
to look harder.''

treasured writers who wrote stories based on his childhood in the 
Delta and other experiences, died Monday night. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris died at St. Dominic Hospital, where he had been taken  
earlier Monday after an apparent heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris, who developed what he called a ``good ole boy' love for  
the South, grew up in Yazoo City, the small town that would become 
the focal point for many of his stories. 
</P>
<P>
	In his work, ``North Toward Home,'' he described Yazoo City as  
``on the edge of the delta, straddling that memorable divide where 
the hills end and flat land begins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris had more than a dozen books to his credit. Among his  
better known works are ``North Toward Home'' (1967), and ``Terrains 
of the Heart and Other Essays on Home,'' (1981). 
</P>
<P>
	His latest published book was ``The Ghosts of Medgar Evers,'' a  
1998 work about the history of the production of the 1996 film 
``Ghosts of Mississippi.'' That film was about the 1963 
assassination of the civil rights figure and the conviction of 
Byron De La Beckwith for his murder. 
</P>
<P>
	In his last book, Morris explores what the three trials and the  
film of the surrounding events say about race in America, 
especially in his home state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The basic crisis in America is that of racism,'' Morris wrote.  
``Mississippi has always been the crucible of national guilt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris became associate editor of Harper's Magazine in 1963, and  
in 1967, became the youngest editor-in-chief of Harper's, the 
nation's oldest magazine. He left Harper's in 1971, and stayed in 
the New York area until 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Mississippi, serving as writer-in-residence at  
the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he wrote ``The 
Courting of Marcus Dupree'' (1983), based on a standout football 
player. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, he was the winner of the Richard Wright Medal for  
Literary Excellence. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris and his only child, son David, a freelance  
photojournalist living in New Orleans, were collaborating on a new 
book. The author is also survived by his second wife, JoAnne 
Prichard, who he married in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Andrea Bocelli Sings for Pope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) -- Best-selling tenor Andrea Bocelli  
had a tough audition last week: He sang in front of the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian singer -- whose works were No. 1 and 3 last week on  
opera's Top 10 charts -- sang for John Paul II on Friday at the 
pope's summer palace outside Rome, Italy's ANSA news service said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Paul appeared pleased with Bocelli's interpretation of the  
Holy Year hymn, giving the tenor a pat on the head after the 
private performance, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The hymn of the 2000 Holy Year will be the anthem of church  
celebrations marking Christianity's third millennium. It's expected 
to be performed publicly for the first time when the pope 
inaugurates the Holy Year on Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Bocelli, whose works include a duet with pop star Celine Dion,  
has performed previously before the pope and President Clinton.

<HEADLINE> Report: Magic May Trade Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Nick Anderson, the only player remaining in  
Orlando from the Magic's inaugural season, is reportedly on the 
verge of being traded to the Sacramento Kings for Tariq 
Abdul-Wahad. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel reported Monday that both teams had agreed  
to the deal, but an announcement could be delayed by salary cap 
complications. The Magic, rebuilding after losing in the first 
round of the playoffs, had no comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to comment on speculation regarding any player  
transaction,'' director of media relations Joel Glass told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, who has averaged 15.4 points and 5.3 rebounds in 10  
NBA seasons, was the first college draft pick of the expansion 
Magic in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The move to get the 24-year-old Abdul-Wahad would be in line  
with Orlando's commitment to put a younger, more athletic team on 
the floor under new coach Doc Rivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The talk (of a trade) followed me throughout my career in  
Orlando,'' Anderson told the Sentinel on Monday from Los Angeles, 
where he played in a charity basketball game Sunday night. ``It 
seemed that every year, I was going somewhere else. Maybe now it 
has finally happened. I love Orlando, but I'll be going to a pretty 
good situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Kings, the 31-year-old Anderson would be united with  
good friend Jason Williams, the former University of Florida star 
who lived in Orlando with Anderson before Williams' rookie season 
with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Abdul-Wahad has played two seasons with the Kings, who made him  
the 11th pick in the 1997 draft. He played two seasons at Michigan 
and his final two at San Jose State. He changed his name from 
Olivier Saint-Jean early in his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
	As a starter with the Kings last season, Abdul-Wahad averaged  
9.3 points and 3.8 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 77.25; Nasdaq Up 9.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose solidly today, recovering from some  
of last week's big losses, after a new report suggested the economy 
has not expanded quite as fast as market watchers had feared. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 77.25 at 10,732.40. The index had risen as much as 136 points 
earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were modestly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 9.21 at 1,337.93, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was up 9.70 at 2,648.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, stocks reeled amid a growing belief that hints of  
inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 
when its policy-making group meets later this month. The Dow fell 
255.81 points, or 2.3 percent, for the week, and the Nasdaq lost 
53.91 points, or 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, stocks rebounded from a sluggish opening when the  
National Association of Purchasing Management said the U.S. 
manufacturing sector grew in July for the sixth consecutive month, 
but not as strongly as most analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had expected that the report, which gauges  
manufacturing activity, would show continued economic expansion and 
raise the likelihood of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates 
later this year. The report is the first reading on the U.S. 
economy's performance for July. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the excuse for some buying today,'' said William  
Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald, who said 
investors were also lured by buying opportunities resulting from 
last week's steep market losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices also rebounded once the report was released. The  
yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, which had reached 6.17 percent 
this morning, dropped back to 6.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The high yields on bonds have been contributing to a difficult  
environment for stocks, presenting an attractive and less volatile 
investment vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, which were battered last week as the threat of  
higher interest rates rattled the market, rose today. Chase 
Manhattan was up 1 at 78 1/16. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter gained 
13/16 to 91 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seeking bargains boosted Daimler Chrysler 2 3/4 to 74 7/8 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. The automaker's shares slid last week 
after the company reported flat operating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears rose 1 7/8 to 42 3/8 following reports that the company will cut  
10 percent of the work force at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on the  
NYSE, where volume came to 491.09 million shares, behind Friday's 
quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said the low volume indicated many investors are staying  
out of the market for now and looking ahead to the Aug. 24 meeting 
of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volume is sluggish and will remain so until Aug. 24 unless we  
get some really negative news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.71 at 628.78, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 4.17 at 784.06. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller  
companies, slipped 1.30 to 443.47.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Soccer Coach, Directors Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The board of directors of the Egyptian  
Football Federation and the team's coach resigned Monday amid 
widespread shock at Egypt's 5-1 defeat against Saudi Arabia at the 
Confederations Cup tournament in Mexico last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The team returned home Sunday to shouts of ``shame, shame'' from  
disappointed fans and blistering criticism in the local media for 
its unexpectedly poor performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Two men in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria were so saddened  
by the defeat that they reportedly died of heart attacks, according 
to Egypt's leading Al-Ahram newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	President Hosni Mubarak demanded Sunday an urgent report from  
Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzoury detailing why the team, which 
returned in triumph in February 1998 after winning the African Cup 
soccer tournament, suffered such a humiliating loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a meeting of EFF's board of directors, its president,  
Samir Zaher, headed to el-Ganzoury's office to hand in the 
resignation of the nine-member body. The team's coach, Mahmoud 
el-Gohary, also resigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The Youth and Sports Committee at the People's Assembly, or  
parliament, will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss 
``the reasons for the heavy defeat of the Egyptian soccer team,'' 
said the head of the committee, Abdul-Rahim al-Ghoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The players complained that the criticism was too harsh, noting  
that Paraguayan referee Ubaldo Aquino expelled three Egyptian 
players during the game, leaving only eight to compete against 
Saudi Arabia's 11 players. 
</P>
<P>
	Egypt did not qualify to the second round of the tournament  
after it tied 2-2 with Bolivia and Mexico and following its loss to 
Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Portland Acquires Detlef Schrempf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers completed a  
busy day of deals Monday by landing free agent forward Detlef 
Schrempf, hours after trading Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson to 
Atlanta for veteran guard Steve Smith and Ed Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the trade, which had been rumored for a couple of weeks,  
Portland re-signed 20-year-old Jermaine O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just brought two guys to the roster today that are  
all-stars,'' Blazers president and general manager Bob Whitsitt 
said. ``We did not have an all-star going into today. But they're 
not worried about their individual stats or awards. They've been 
there, done that. These guys are playing for one reason -- to try to 
win an NBA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, a three-time all-star, averaged 15.0 points and 7.4  
rebounds last season, both second-highest on the Sonics, while 
Smith, who has never been chosen for an all-star team, has career 
averages of 17.4 points, 3.9 rebounds and 4.1 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, 36, signed a two-year contract with Portland after  
turning down Seattle's reported one-year, $1 million offer. The 
Blazers can use the middle-class salary-cap exception of $4.2 
million over two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, who played the last six seasons in Seattle, had been  
courted by Utah and San Antonio. The Spurs had the most money to 
offer him -- $2.6 million -- because of an injury exception the 
league made for Sean Elliott, who needs a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schrempf reportedly chose Portland to stay close to his  
Seattle-area home and his two sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people may insist that my decision not to re-sign with  
the Sonics was motivated by money, but the reality is that the 
decision was based purely on issues of fairness and loyalty,'' 
Schrempf said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	By trading Smith, 30, the Hawks would end a commitment of $36  
million over the next four seasons to a player who missed 14 games 
last season with bruised knees. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, 28, will make $5.4 million next season in the final year  
of a $25.5 million rookie contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, 29, will get $3 million over the next two seasons.  
Gray, 23, was Atlanta's first-round draft pick out of California in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider is among the most heavily fined and suspended players in  
the NBA. He was suspended three games last season and 12 overall 
during three seasons in Portland for violations ranging from 
flagrant fouls to spitting on fans. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, the youngest among the league's 156 free agents, signed  
a four-year contract. As per its policy, the team did not disclose 
terms of the deal, but O'Neal said he turned down a one-year offer 
of $9 million-$10 million from another team to stay in Portland. 
His agent, Arn Tellem, did not immediately return a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here for the next 10-15 years,'' O'Neal said at a  
news conference. ``So hopefully I'll play to my potential the next 
two to three years, and then we can talk about some extensions, but 
overall I really want to be here. I want them to retire my jersey 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, a 6-foot-11, 226-pound center-forward, is a strong  
rebounder with good leaping ability. But playing behind Blazers 
center Arvydas Sabonis and power forwards Rasheed Wallace and Brian 
Grant, he hasn't gotten much opportunity to shine. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal averaged just 2.6 points last season, and just 1.6 points  
in Portland's playoff drive to the Western Conference finals. Over 
three seasons, he has averaged 3.9 points, 3.0 rebounds and 11.3 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Blazers think he can live up to the expectations they  
had when they selected him with the 17th pick in the 1996 NBA draft 
out of Eau Claire High School in Columbia, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're even more excited now than we were three years ago,''  
Whitsitt said. ``He's continued to improve each year. He's earned 
time on a very talented roster. There's no question Jermaine has 
not even reached his potential and will continue to get better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal's warm and fuzzy news conference came just two days after  
he called the Blazers' initial offer -- reportedly a seven-year deal 
worth $30 million -- ``almost a smack in the face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal arrived in Portland from Columbia late Sunday night to  
work out details on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said he decided to re-sign for four years instead of  
seven -- the maximum allowed under the NBA's collective bargaining 
agreement -- to make sure everything is ``totally right between 
myself and the organization.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Breaks in Midwest, East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICACO (AP) -- Cooler temperatures brought some relief Monday to  
the scorching heat that has struck much of the Midwest and East, 
but the death toll kept rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide total since July 19 is at least 213 deaths  
attributed to the heat. 
</P>
<P>
	After almost two weeks of unbearable temperatures, most  
Chicagoans are returning to normal life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was doing the best I could last week, but I was tired of the  
whole situation,'' said Samuel Mensah, who spends his days parking 
cars on a sizzling asphalt lot downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a day after the heat finally broke, Midway Airport  
reached a high of 81 degrees -- 23 degrees lower than Friday's high 
temperature of 104 degrees there. Temperatures in central Illinois 
were around 80 degrees Monday, and southern Illinois was a few 
degrees warmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths were reported in 20 states and many shared a tragic  
thread: People most at risk from the heat were often the ones who 
wouldn't -- or couldn't -- wrap themselves in the icy blast of an air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Illinois officials reported that the hot weather has contributed  
to the deaths of 95 people, up from 80 on Sunday. The state with 
the next highest total is Missouri, with 44. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, a woman driving home after a night of drinking left  
her car at a gas station and forgot her 8-month-old son inside. The 
child died Sunday and the woman was charged in his death and faces 
up to 20 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, federal officials declared West Virginia and parts of  
Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia disaster areas 
because of drought.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Basketball Team Loses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- His team trailed by a point, he was  
trapped near the basket with no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
	For Travis Williams, it was shoot or die. So he shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams pump faked and then knifed between two defenders for  
the go-ahead basket as the United States beat Brazil 73-71 Sunday 
night for a key victory in Pan American Games basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was open, but they submerged real quick and I had nowhere to  
throw the ball,'' Williams said. ``There was no way out. I had no 
choice but to go up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women had a much easier time, beating the Dominican  
Republic 92-80 to clinch a berth in the medal round. But the 
Americans (2-2) couldn't hold a 16-point lead against Brazil today 
and lost 77-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which came from 21 points down to beat Cuba earlier in  
the tournament, slowed the United States with a zone defense in the 
second half and scored six straight points in the final 2:11 to 
take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' basket with 20 seconds left gave the U.S. men a 72-71  
lead, and then Doug Smith made the defensive play of the game, 
sliding over from the weak side to block Tesch Aylton's driving 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
	Where did Smith come from? That's what U.S. coach Mo McHone  
would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great play,'' McHone said. ``I've been around him a  
long time and I don't know if I've ever seen Doug block a shot. I 
wasn't expecting that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith slapped the ball to teammate Damon Bailey, who got fouled  
and sank a free throw with six seconds remaining. Brazil still had 
time, but Vanderlei Mazzuchini lost the ball driving to the basket 
and Williams grabbed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey and Michael Hawkins scored 13 points each to lead the  
Americans, who are 2-0 with one game left in their four-team pool. 
While the victory didn't assure the United States of a berth in the 
medal round, it puts them in great position to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told our guys going in that whoever won this game would  
probably be the top seed in our pool,'' said McHone, whose team is 
made up of CBA players. ``Brazil beat the Dominican Republic and we 
beat Cuba, so we felt like we were playing for the No. 1 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It almost didn't happen. Brazil, getting the support of the fans  
who stayed after Canada's game, rallied from an 11-point deficit by 
getting the Americans in foul trouble and making their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the United States' best inside players, 7-foot Mikki  
Moore and burly Byron Houston, committed late fouls. Luckily for 
the Americans, the 6-10 Smith stayed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tremendous help defense,'' Hawkins said of Smith. ``You can't  
stress that enough. That was the game right there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's game with the Dominican Republic, the Americans  
were taller and deeper than their opponent and capitalized by 
taking the ball to the basket for a succession of layups and 
close-in shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, bouncing back from a 95-64 loss to Cuba that  
was its worst ever in Pan Ams play, shot 52 percent and only two of 
its 35 baskets came from beyond 10 feet -- a pair of 3-pointers by 
Michelle Marciniak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we really wanted to redeem ourselves more than  
anything,'' said Lynn Pride, who led the Americans with 20 points 
and 11 rebounds. ``It was a real confidence booster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marciniak scored 16 points, Danielle McCulley had 11 and Edwina  
Brown 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Cuba, the United States missed some good shots early,  
fell behind 14-3 and never recovered. The Americans trailed again 
on Sunday, but their early shots were falling and they took control 
midway through the first half by scoring on four straight fast 
breaks to finish a 12-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we felt good about what we were doing,'' U.S. coach  
Nell Fortner said. ``They were much more confident with their 
transition game and just being able to really get the ball to the 
hole and get it inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong inside play enabled the United States to withstand  
Teresa Duran's 33 points for the Dominican Republic.

<HEADLINE> Jets Re-Sign Keith Byars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Over the first three days of training  
camp, New York Jets coach Bill Parcells lost two prime candidates 
for the F-back position. On Sunday night, he called an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Parcells announced Monday that he has re-signed 14-year veteran  
Keith Byars, the team's starting fullback last season, to a 
one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	An All-Pro with the Philadelphia Eagles, Byars immediately steps  
back into his starting role in the Jets offense, a hybrid 
fullback-tight end spot. Serving primarily as a blocker for running 
back Curtis Martin, Byars rushed for 34 yards on four carries last 
year, adding 258 yards and three touchdowns on 26 catches. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been talking to Keith in the spring and (Sunday) a little  
bit,'' Parcells said. ``We've been on the same page. He knew that 
if I couldn't find what I wanted, I'd call. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's like every other vet. I told him, `You're going to have  
to show me you can still do something.' He understands that. He 
knows I'm going to be patient with him and give him some time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-1, 255-pound Byars, who also played two seasons for  
Parcells with the New England Patriots, was en route to the Jets 
camp from his home in Cherry Hill, N.J., on Monday and was 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The need for Byars heightened when, in a two-day span, former  
first-round draft pick Johnny Mitchell quit and left camp and 
second-year player Blake Spence partially separated his right 
shoulder. Mitchell was officially waived by the Jets Monday, while 
Spence faces up to a month of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran Richie Anderson also is working at F-back. But, Parcells  
said, ``I can't risk going into the season with just one guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Spence nor Anderson would comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Soured by his costly fumble after a reception in the Jets' 23-10  
conference championship game loss to the Denver Broncos, Byars said 
he wasn't sure if he wanted to continue to play football. During 
the offseason, however, the ex-Ohio State standout continued to 
work out alongside receiver Cris Carter of the Minnesota Vikings, 
an old friend from their days in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't ever tell players when it's time for them to do  
something,'' Parcells said. ``I only tell them what I'm going to 
do. I told Keith at the end of the season I was going to try to 
replace him if I could. I was looking for younger players, more 
cap-friendly players. Keith always said he wanted to play if he 
could. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were certain situations I don't think Keith would go  
back into, like a team just starting to come up,'' Parcells added. 
``He doesn't want to go through that. He wanted to be someplace 
where he thought he had a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets are favored to repeat as AFC East champions, and are  
forecast by many as the favorite to represent the conference in the 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question I'm very excited about Keith coming  
back,'' quarterback Vinny Testaverde said. ``He was a big part of 
our offense last year and he's a leader, a veteran and a player 
that can help our offense like he did a year ago.''

<HEADLINE> Tomko Makes Reds Feel Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Juan Guzman will make the Cincinnati Reds'  
rotation whole. Brett Tomko could make it much more dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	A few hours after the Reds got Guzman from Baltimore in a trade  
to restock their rotation, Tomko pitched the second complete game 
of his career Sunday to provide another measure of hope. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Reds are to stay in contention in the NL Central, Tomko  
is going to have to come through in the last two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, when we had (Pete) Harnisch or Tomko going, you  
knew you had a chance to win,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``Now, 
you can say that again. Sometimes guys go into ruts and it takes a 
while for them to work out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's taken Tomko half of a season to get out of his.  
</P>
<P>
	When Harnisch had to be scratched from his opening day start,  
Tomko took over and took the loss, lasting only 3 2-3 innings. It 
was a bad beginning that only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 0-1 in five starts with a 7.76 earned run average when  
the Reds optioned him to Triple-A Indianapolis on April 29. The 
best young pitcher in the organization was getting a wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander was still erratic when he returned on May 16.  
He would pitch well one game, then give up five homers to the New 
York Mets in his next outing. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have smoothed out in his last four starts. Tomko has  
given up three or fewer runs each time out. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got his confidence again,'' McKeon said. ``He's pitching  
the way he pitched last year. It's nice to see the Brett Tomko that 
we're used to seeing. He's pitched four or five pretty good 
ballgames in a row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomko was 11-7 with a 3.43 ERA as a rookie in 1997 and 13-12  
with a 4.44 ERA last season as the Reds began rebuilding. They need 
him on top of his game now that they're contending. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch is limited by a sore shoulder that might need surgery  
after the season. Steve Avery and Steve Parris are on the disabled 
list. Ron Villone has been erratic as he's tried to adjust to 
starting. Denny Neagle just returned after a second stint on the 
disabled list because of a weak shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds have never needed him more.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know everybody's been pulling for me,'' Tomko said. ``(Sean)  
Casey is always yelling at me to stay focused. It's a big push 
knowing your teammates are behind you. I'm just trying to stay 
relaxed, see the strike zone and throw the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He allowed only five hits Sunday in a 9-1 victory over San  
Francisco, only his second complete game in 73 career starts. He 
threw 126 pitches on a steamy afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his manager over as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about Tomko anymore,'' McKeon said. ``What I  
see, I like. In his last three or four starts, he's been 
consistent. He's realized that if you go after the hitters, you can 
beat them.''

<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Veteran reliever Jim Corsi was recalled Monday  
by the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Corsi was signed off waivers from the Boston Red Sox on July 2  
and assigned to Triple-A Rochester. He joined the Orioles in 
Oakland and will work mostly in middle relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Corsi made 23 relief appearances with the Red Sox this season,  
compiling a 5.25 ERA in 24 innings pitched. He walked 19 and struck 
out 14. Last season, he was 3-2 with a 2.59 ERA in 59 games.

<HEADLINE> Woods Beats Duval in Prime Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Tiger Woods went prime time Monday  
night, winning his showdown over David Duval under floodlights at 
Sherwood Country Club and the spotlight of a national television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, Woods closed out a 2&AMP;1 victory on the par-3 17th with  
a two-putt par. He won the first four par-3s to take a commanding 
lead, and hung on when Duval made one mistake too many. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sun tucked behind the foothills, Duval conceded the match  
as the floodlights cast long shadows across the green. Whether the 
first golf event televised live in prime time by a network was a 
success won't be clear until overnight ratings for ABC Sports are 
released on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but it's basically up to the ratings,''  
Woods said. ``How high the ratings are will determine how 
successful it was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods won $1.1 million, and Duval had to settle for $400,000.  
Each will donate $200,000 to charity, including $100,000 each to 
the PGA Tour-sponsored First Tee program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I can play better against him than I did,'' Duval said.  
``My game did not feel really good today. I don't know why.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods, who has won three times and has finished no worse than  
seventh since his post-Masters break, is No. 1 in the world 
rankings -- a position Duval previously held by becoming the first 
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't at stake Monday night, in what essentially was an  
exhibition, a chance for the top two players in the world to 
finally go head-to-head. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't approach the match that way,'' Woods said. ``I  
approach the match that David and I are good friends, and we're 
going to come out here and put on a good show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a masterpiece by any stretch.  
</P>
<P>
	Two-up after the first two holes, Duval didn't win another one  
until the 13th. He tried to push Woods down to the wire, but wound 
up in the rocks. Duval hit his drive into a cluster of stones and 
shrubs on No. 16, making the match dormie. 
</P>
<P>
	He then hit his tee shot on the 17th about 50 feet away, and  
Woods only had to two-putt for par from about 40 feet to win the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as anything, it was a lack of execution,'' Duval said.  
``I didn't play as well as I would have liked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods and Duval have been paired together only one other time,  
in the third round of the World Series of Golf last year, a 
tournament that Duval went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Both would gladly trade Monday night's made-for-TV event for a  
real showdown, perhaps next week in the PGA Championship at Medinah 
Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, those clamoring for a rivalry to develop had to settle  
for this. 
</P>
<P>
	It was clear throughout this was not a major, not a regular PGA  
Tour event, not anything but two young stars playing a round of 
golf with about 2,000 people scrambling to watch their every move. 
They walked the fairways together -- at one point, Woods had his arm 
around Duval's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods said they would try to beat each other's brains out on the  
course, but it didn't look like anything other than what it was -- 
an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our rubber match,'' Duval told him on the driving  
range. ``Remember in Ireland. We were 1-1 in our Nassau (bets). Of 
course, I won the money on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods only smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval took the lead quickly, making an 8-foot birdie putt on the  
first hole and taking the next one when Woods three-putted from 
about 20 feet away on the fringe. But Duval went 10 holes before 
winning another one, and Woods won half of those. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of those came on the par-3s.  
</P>
<P>
	Duval caught a plugged lie in a bunker on No. 3, blasted out 40  
feet long and two-putted for bogey. On the 186-yard sixth, a 
spectacular downhill hole below the foothills with water guarding 
the green, Woods hit it to 8 feet and Duval came up short with an 
8-iron, landing in the rocks below. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods went 2-up when his 30-foot birdie putt on the par-3 eighth  
came to a stop, then dropped in the left side. And he made it 3-up 
with a 5-foot birdie on the par-3 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of general admission tickets was slashed in half  
because of poor sales -- those who bought in advance were given a 
chance at a rebate or an additional ticket. Those who came to the 
``Showdown at Sherwood'' were boisterous, seemingly broken into two 
camps -- Woods or Duval. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty exciting atmosphere,'' Woods said.  
</P>
<P>
	What they saw was an awesome display of power from two of  
biggest hitters in golf -- and consistency from Woods, who missed 
only three greens over 17 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval was wild, but he also showed some mettle. Right when it  
looked as though Woods might wrap up this match early, Duval found 
a way to hang around. 
</P>
<P>
	He saved par from a bunker after pushing his drive into the  
water on No. 11, good enough to halve the hole when Woods blasted 
out short from the same bunker. And Duval finally won a hole again 
on No. 13 when he saved par from another bunker, and Wood took 
bogey after a tee shot into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval shaved the margin again with a two-putt from 10 feet for  
birdie on the 14th, but he missed his chance to square the match on 
the next hole when a 12-foot birdie slid by the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was never threatened again. Duval threw away the 16th by  
hitting into the rocks, and his tee shot on the 232-yard 17th, 
where only a birdie could keep him in the match, caught a ridge and 
drifted 50 feet away.

<HEADLINE> Attitude Linked With Heart Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Having a positive outlook may help stem the  
risk of recurring coronary problems, according to a study released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which appears in the current issue of Psychosomatic  
Medicine, looked at nearly 300 patients who had undergone an 
angioplasty -- a procedure in which a balloon-like device is used to 
relieve arterial blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients with lower measures of self-esteem, optimism and  
feelings of control over their lives were more likely to experience 
a second blockage within six months than those with better 
attitudes, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study certainly suggests that health care professionals  
can try to identify people who are at risk for subsequent events 
and perhaps monitor their behavior,'' said Vicki Helgeson, a 
psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University who directed the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers questioned 292 angioplasty patients to measure their  
feelings of self-esteem, optimism and control. Patients were then 
divided into three groups based on their scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Follow-up visits showed that in 20 percent of the patients,  
arteries began to close again within six months, a condition known 
as ``restenosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, of the third that scored the highest on  
the attitude tests, less than 10 percent reported a second coronary 
problem. Correspondingly, of those who scored the lowest on the 
tests, more than 29 percent reported experiencing restenosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Helgeson said she looked for other indicators, such as age,  
education, occupation and race, but could find no correlation as 
strong as the one seen with the attitudinal measurements. 
</P>
<P>
	The study has its limitations, however. The researchers could  
only collect data on the patients who reported restenosis -- others 
could have experienced it and not known it or kept the information 
from their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha Hill, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School  
of Nursing and past president of the American Heart Association, 
said the study is another example of why medical research must take 
social factors and behavior -- as well as physiological indicators -- 
into account. 
</P>
<P>
	Past studies have shown that people with depression may suffer  
more heart problems. This, she said, appears to show the inverse is 
also true. 
</P>
<P>
	``One reason we have a big problem now ... is that our studies  
have been too narrow,'' Ms. Hill said. ``This is another piece of 
information that tells us the psychological variables are 
important.''

<HEADLINE> Another Defection From Cuban Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuban officials denounced organizers  
of the Pan American Games on Monday after defections and 
disappearances that have plagued the team. 
</P>
<P>
	With 19-year-old pitcher Danys Baez leaving the world champion  
baseball team, and in the wake of a demonstration at the ballpark 
by a man carrying a sign saying ``Human Right First,'' the Cubans 
insisted that organizers tighten security. They also criticized 
officials for failing to stop the demonstrator from disrupting 
Sunday's semifinal victory over Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' a statement from the Cuban 
delegation said. ``From now on we will react with full energy to 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They already did that Sunday night as four Cubans got into a  
street fight with the demonstrator. The police said the protester 
was speaking to someone when the Cubans noticed him and ``became 
involved in a dispute. Prior to police arriving there was a 
physical confrontation between those parties that was brought under 
control immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No charges were filed, but the protester, who police said gave a  
Miami address, was detained by immigration authorities and was in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports agent Joe Cubas, responsible for helping many Cubans  
defect to the United States, claimed in a release Monday that Baez 
sought asylum in Canada after the semifinal win. Although 
immigration officials were not available for confirmation -- Monday 
was a civic holiday -- Baez spoke to Miami television station WSCV 
51 via telephone and said he was moving to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell the people of Miami that another Cuban in  
search of freedom is about to become part of the people of Miami,'' 
Baez said. ``Wait for me over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's departure brings to eight the number of Cubans to leave  
that nation's delegation during the games. Runner Michal Ortiz, an 
unidentified female artistic gymnast and a soccer goalkeeper -- the 
goalies here were Rene Castro and Rodney Valdes -- also left the 
team on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans met the United States for the baseball gold medal at  
night.

	Canadian roller hockey goalkeeper Steve Vezina apologized for  
testing positive for three banned substances, costing his team a 
gold medal. At a news conference in Saint-Adele, Quebec, Vezina 
said, ``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete 
that represents Canada.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It apparently wasn't enough for teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined the chance of a lifetime for nine guys,'' Kerr said.  
``I know he's my teammate and I should be sticking up for him. I 
know I, along with nine other guys, we're clean. We did it the way 
we were supposed to do it.''

	A Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report said Juana Rosario of  
the Dominican Republic, winner of the women's high jump, failed the 
`A' portion of her drug test. Games officials would not confirm 
that report; rarely is drugging information made avilable before 
the `B' sample is tested. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women's soccer team advanced to the gold medal game by  
beating Costa Rica 2-0. Marcia Wallis and Kim Patrick scored for 
the Americans, who outshot Costa Rica 22-0 in the second half and 
34-1 for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico beat Canada in a shootout for the other spot in the  
finals, but Canada's baseball team beat Mexico 9-2 for the bronze 
medal. 
</P>
<P>
	The world champion American softball squad gave up its first run  
in 100 innings of Pan Ams competition, but still won easily, 8-1 
over Colombia. Lori Harrigan pitched a three-hitter, striking out 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Tennis phenom Alexandra Stevenson got her first test at the Pan  
Ams, needing a third-set tiebreaker to edge Renata Kolbovic of 
Canada 7-6 (9-7), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4). She advanced to the semifinals, 
but teammate Lilia Osterloh lost to Maria Vento of Venezuela 6-4, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	In men's action, Bob Bryan beat Mexico's Marco Osorio 6-2, 6-3,  
and Cecil Mamiit beat Adrian Garcia of Chile 6-2, 7-6 (7-4). 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. women played their best basketball game so far, but  
couldn't hold a 16-point lead and lost to Brazil 77-72. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's zone defense in the second half slowed down the  
Americans (2-2). The Brazilians chipped away steadily before going 
ahead for good with a 6-0 run in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this team played like they're capable of playing,''  
said U.S. coach Nell Fortner, whose team already has made the medal 
round. ``Take away some defensive errors in the second half and we 
win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans collected one gold, by Ed Moses in the 100-meter  
breaststroke in games record time (1:00.99), and four silvers in 
swimming.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Unites Indian Reservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALAMANCA, N.Y. (AP) -- The only U.S. city built almost entirely  
on Indian land has erupted in anger in recent years over tax and 
land issues that have pitted Indians and whites against each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in town braced for more trouble when a white woman was  
found raped and strangled near a wooded running path and a teen-age 
member of the Seneca tribe was charged with her murder. 
</P>
<P>
	But the killing -- the first in Salamanca in 27 years -- seems to  
have had the opposite effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Salamanca, population 6,500, has come together in mourning the  
victim, 39-year-old Penny Brown, a nurse and midwife who had 
delivered many of the town's children. The town even closed its 
schools for a day in honor of Mrs. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Her killing was Salamanca's first major crime in memory  
involving a white victim and an Indian suspect. Prosecutors were so 
worried about interracial violence that they asked a judge to seal 
all court records in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the documents is a statement that the suspect, Edward  
Kindt, now 16, allegedly gave police after his arrest, possibly 
containing a motive. Several news agencies have gone to court 
seeking the release of the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of dividing over the case, Salamanca's residents  
seem to have put the tensions of the past behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Several people, both Senecas and non-Indians, gathered outside  
the municipal building when Kindt, described as a troubled boy with 
a mean streak, was taken into custody May 11, two days after Mrs. 
Brown was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was our friend!'' they shouted as Kindt was led inside.  
</P>
<P>
	Later that week, in a remarkable outpouring of sympathy, the  
town declared a day of mourning. About 2,000 people -- Indians and 
non-Indians -- wept, hugged and prayed during a service at Veterans 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Help us as we heal, help us be a unified community,'' the Rev.  
Mike Peters prayed before the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Salamanca is built on the Seneca Nation of Indians' Allegany  
Reservation, in a picturesque valley between a ski resort and a 
state park. Lumber and furniture are the main industries. 
</P>
<P>
	Its unique setup is a result of a 1892 treaty. Since then, the  
Senecas have collected rent from non-Indians who live here and the 
races have lived, worked and gone to school side by side. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been easy. Tempers flared a few years ago over  
a decision to raise the rent non-Senecas pay to live in town. While 
most agreed to the new terms, 16 families loudly refused and were 
evicted from their homes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	About the same time, non-Indian gas station and convenience  
store owners were crying foul at the tax-exempt status of their 
Indian competitors. Indians burned tires and felled trees across 
roads as state lawmakers temporarily considered requiring Indian 
businesses to tax their non-Indian customers. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, state troopers were called in to keep the peace in  
town. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have been very different this year. Mrs. Brown was  
well-known throughout the community because she worked at a 
reservation health center and in a hospital off the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	When she didn't return home after a jog on Mother's Day, 100  
volunteers helped her husband and two daughters with the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The search ended the next day near the well-worn jogging trail  
Mrs. Brown had set out on with her two dogs. Her body was found 
partially buried beneath leaves and branches. Her last breaths had 
been taken with a dog leash pressed to her neck. 
</P>
<P>
	One of her dogs had returned home. The other had stayed by her  
side. 
</P>
<P>
	As Kindt, now 16, awaits trial on murder, rape and weapon  
charges, Seneca Nation President Duane Ray and Mayor Carmen 
Vecchiarella say they haven't sensed any rise in racial tensions 
since the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents echo their sentiments.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a mutual respect,'' said tribe member Tracie Brown.  
</P>
<P>
	In fact, townspeople want to pay another tribute to Mrs. Brown --  
more than 200 residents have signed a petition asking that her 
street be renamed Penny Brown Drive.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Plane Crash in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTH LIMA, Ohio (AP) -- Investigators examined the engine of a  
wrecked small airplane today to determine why the craft plunged 
into a cornfield shortly after taking off, killing four. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-seat Piper Cherokee went down Sunday about a half-mile  
north of the runway at Youngstown Elser-Metro Airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses gave conflicting reports about whether the plane's  
engine was running when it went down, said Trooper Howard Craft. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the National Transportation Safety Board and  
the Federal Aviation Administration were at the scene today, 
checking the engine and other wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	Adam Wetzl, 57, said he heard the plane from his home near the  
crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	``His engines were roaring. It looked like he couldn't get  
enough elevation,'' said Wetzl. 
</P>
<P>
	He called 911 after hearing the crash. ``I jumped up on a hay  
wagon to see where he went down,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescue workers had to trample 6-foot-tall corn stalks in an area  
about the size of half a football field to so medical helicopters 
could land. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was flying from Oshkosh, Wis., to Pennsylvania and had  
stopped to refuel at the airport in North Lima, about 65 miles 
southeast of Cleveland, said Highway Patrol Lt. Brian Girts. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were identified as Lendon Pridgen, 43, of  
Collegeville, Pa., believed to be the pilot; Daniel Diggin, 56, of 
Chester, Md.; Kenneth Tubman, 47, of Norristown, Pa., and Pridgen's 
stepson, Anthony Cipparone, 15, of Collegeville, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The only survivor, Tyler P. Johnson, 15, of Perkiomenville, Pa.,  
Pridgen's nephew, was in serious condition today at MetroHealth 
Medical Center in Cleveland, a nursing supervisor said

<HEADLINE> Drug Test Takes Away Canada Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Steve Vezina broke no laws, his agent  
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	But the professional hockey player has broken a few hearts and  
tarnished the host country at the 13th Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina, whose urine sample revealed two stimulants and an  
enormous quantity of anabolic steroid, cost Canada the gold medal 
in roller hockey. The United States, which fell to the Canadians 
7-6 in the final, was awarded the title Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels sorry for his teammates, his coach and his country,  
but he didn't take any illegal substance, law-wise,'' agent Paul 
Hamel told The Canadian Press. 
</P>
<P>
	A urine sample showed unacceptable levels of both  
pseudo-ephedrine and ephedrine, contained in over-the-counter 
decongestants such as Sudafed that professional hockey players 
often use as stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a massive amount of Nandrolone, a steroid that  
builds muscles and increases strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said at his drug test that he had taken Sudafed prior to  
competition. He will be subject to an automatic four-year ban, but 
that would not appear to affect his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the only mistake he did was not being aware Sudafed was  
not legal for the Pan Am Games,'' Hamel said. ``Keep in mind Steve 
is a professional hockey player and not used to competing with the 
amateurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Broadcasting Company reported that Juana Rosario,  
the winner of the women's high jump, tested positive for illegal 
substances. The CBC said her A sample came out positive and now her 
B-sample must be tested. If it comes back positive as well, she 
would be stripped of her medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said professional athletes must adhere to the games' 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say he did it because he was a professional,'' Rana  
said. ``He was foolish and he made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The level of steroids in the drug test stunned Canadian  
officials, erasing any thoughts of an appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very large amount,'' said Andrew Pipe, chair of the  
Canadian Centre for Ethics and Sport. ``It is probably the largest 
level that I have ever seen reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Olympic Association officials now must reclaim the gold  
medals from the 10 members of the roller hockey team. Argentina 
gets the silver and Brazil the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina, 23, is a distant relative of Georges Vezina, the Hall of  
Fame goaltender after whom the Vezina Trophy is named. In the last 
six years he's been a hockey vagabond, playing for 12 teams in 
eight leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	He now plays ice hockey for the Utah Grizzlies of the  
International Hockey League and roller hockey for the Buffalo Wings 
of Roller Hockey International. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a big shock ... Steve is not an abuser of anabolic  
steroids,'' said Lou Franceschetti, his coach with the Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have a chance to gather all of the facts and speak to  
everyone involved, Steve Vezina is scheduled to be in goal Friday 
against Dallas,'' Wings vice president of operations Benny Gulakiw 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode is a body blow for in-line hockey, which hoped to  
use its Pan Am debut as a springboard to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that due to the actions and poor judgment on  
the part of one player the entire team must suffer the 
consequences,'' said Maxine McKenzie, Canada's team leader for 
roller sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Burfoot, a member of the Canadian team, was stunned by the  
news, which he got by telephone from his sobbing wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach,'' he said when  
reached in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was conducting a hockey 
clinic. Burfoot said giving up the gold medal will be ``the hardest 
thing I'll probably ever have to do.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Judge: Electric Chair Not Cruel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A judge ruled Monday that Florida's  
electric chair is not cruel and unusual punishment, saying it 
worked as intended in the bloody execution of a 344-pound killer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen Lee Davis did not suffer any conscious pain while being  
electrocuted in Florida's electric chair,'' Judge Clarence Johnson 
ruled. ``Rather, he suffered instantaneous and painless death once 
the current was applied to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The execution of Davis, 54, who bled from his nose during his  
execution, prompted lawyers for the next man scheduled for death to 
argue that the chair is cruel and unusual punishment and that Davis 
suffered pain as he died. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Supreme Court ordered a hearing held by Johnson, a  
retired circuit judge. The high court will still hear arguments on 
the constitutionality of the electric chair. That hearing is 
scheduled for Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Monday's ruling will receive substantial weight by the  
high court, according to Assistant Attorney General Kenneth 
Nunnelley. 
</P>
<P>
	``The burden is going to be on the losing party to convince the  
Florida Supreme Court that the circuit court is wrong,'' Nunnelley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	David was executed July 8 for murdering a pregnant woman and her  
two daughters in Jacksonville in 1982. Thomas Provenzano, 50, is 
awaiting execution for a 1984 shooting spree in an Orlando 
courtroom that killed two bailiffs and left another paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin McClain, one of Provenzano's attorneys, said he believed  
the high court will overturn the judge's order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful, and or optimistic, that the Florida Supreme  
Court will see things differently,'' McClain said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorneys said photos of Davis following the execution  
showed him grimacing as a leather mouthstrap covered his mouth and 
pushed up against his nose. They argued that the photos indicated 
Davis suffocated before electricity was sent to his body. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to rectify the photos with any state position  
that this is a humane or a dignified death,'' said lawyer Harry 
Brody, who also represents Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state argued there is no evidence that Davis  
suffocated. They said the mouth strap is necessary to keep an 
inmate's head in place during execution. The judge agreed, but 
suggested a smaller mouthstrap might be preferable. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also concluded the electrical current did not cause  
Davis' nose to bleed, although he said he was not sure what did. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the electrocution of Pedro Medina in 1997, the state  
decided to photograph inmates if anything unusual occurred during 
an execution. When Medina was put to death, flames shot out from 
behind the leather mask covering his face.

<HEADLINE> Predators Re-Sign Bob Boughner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Nashville Predators have re-signed  
restricted free agent Bob Boughner, making him the team's 
highest-paid defenseman. 
</P>
<P>
	Boughner, 28, signed a two-year, $1.8 million contract that will  
pay him $850,000 this season and $950,000 the following year, The 
Tennessean reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Boughner had been scheduled to go to arbitration today in  
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Boughner was selected by the Predators from the Buffalo Sabres  
in the 1998 expansion draft. The 6-foot, 205-pounder had 
career-highs with three goals and 10 assists in 79 games with 
Nashville last season. He also had 137 penalty minutes and recorded 
233 hits, fourth-best in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	The Predators still have two arbitration hearings scheduled.  
Defenseman Joel Bouchard is set for Wednesday and left wing Denny 
Lambert's is next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Soar on Weather / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures soared anew Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as hot, dry weather threatened to reduce 
crop yields. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices continued their sharp gains even as temperatures in  
Midwest growing regions fell back to more-tolerable temperatures in 
the lower 80s from highs in the 90s and 100s late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While the threat of heat stress no longer appears to be in the  
picture, vulnerable corn and soybean crops could suffer from a lack 
of rainfall. Forecasters currently say there is no chance for 
appreciable rainfall in the next week, which could affect crops 
that are seeing dangerously low moisture levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of heavy rainfall in recent weeks has caused alarm bells  
to go off across farming regions. Parts of Maryland, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia were declared drought 
disaster areas by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, with 
some farmers reporting their expected average yields had been 
reduced by half. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields in Illinois and Iowa, the two largest corn and soybean  
growing states, were expected to fare better, but dryness also 
persisted in those regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures investors were expected to closely examine the USDA's  
latest crop development update, which was to be released late 
Monday. The report could provide a more reliable indication of 
final production numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 19 cents to $2.98 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose the limit 12 cents to $2.26 1/2 a bushel; December 
oats jumped 6 1/2 cents to $1.18 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose the 
limit 30 cents to $4.63 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork bellies advanced on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while feeder cattle retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle rose .48 cent to 64.70 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 76.82 cents a pound; October lean 
hogs rose 2 cents to 45.35 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 
the limit 3 cents to 55.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Highway, Railroad Safety Bills Filed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration recommended two  
bills Monday aimed at improving safety on the nation's highways and 
railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999'' calls for strengthened  
commercial driver's license requirements, increased use of trip 
data recorders and a $50 million appropriation to help states 
increase roadside truck inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Federal Railroad Safety Enforcement Act of 1999'' would  
require train operators to submit fatigue-management plans, provide 
help for improving grade crossings and give industry employees new 
whistle-blower protection to encourage reporting of dangerous 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to the highway bill, Transportation Secretary Rodney  
Slater said: ``It will help keep high-risk drivers from taking the 
wheel of a big rig.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Railroad Administrator Jolene Molitoris said rail safety  
has been improving, ``but in order to achieve our goal of zero 
tolerance, our challenge must be to greatly accelerate this pace 
and build upon the lessons we have learned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the last year for which official statistics are  
available, 5,355 people died in truck-related accidents on the 
nation's highways. Many accidents were caused by drivers who 
traveled too closely to trucks or cut in front of them, reducing 
the truckers' safety buffers. 
</P>
<P>
	The highway bill would strengthen trucking oversight through a  
variety of means. The administration has been criticized for being 
lax on the industry, and a recent audit found that the federal 
Office of Motor Carriers worked with truckers in an effort to foil 
a plan to change oversight of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	One proposal would record all moving traffic convictions on a  
trucker's record, not just those committed in commercial vehicles. 
In addition, new applicants for a federal commercial driver's 
license would have to have alcohol- and drug-free driving records 
for three years prior to their application. 
</P>
<P>
	Another provision would launch a study to examine how existing  
compensation plans, such as payment-per-mile-driven, push drivers 
to operate when tired. A third proposal would require regulations 
providing for some carriers to use onboard recorders or other 
technology to manage drivers' time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill challenges everyone to take responsibility for  
saving lives on our nation's highways,'' said Federal Highway 
Administrator Kenneth Wykle. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad bill seeks to address fatigue and grade-crossing  
safety through a variety of means. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them is asking major railroads and commuter lines to  
submit fatigue-management plans covering their train, dispatching 
service, signal and track maintenance employees.

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Pill Outsells Viagra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Viagra grabbed the headlines, became the topic  
for jokes on late night talk shows and made it acceptable to talk 
about male impotence. 
</P>
<P>
	But while sex sells, the promise of pain relief, apparently, is  
what really makes for hot sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, a new pill that offers arthritis pain relief with less  
stomach irritation, has surpassed Viagra to become the fastest 
selling new drug ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, which was introduced in January, sold 6.86 million  
prescriptions during its first six months on the market, compared 
with 6.05 million for Viagra during its first six months, according 
to IMS Health, a research company. Celebrex began to outpace Viagra 
in prescriptions after four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Celebrex in the first six months added up to about $600  
million, said Monsanto, which co-markets the drug with Pfizer. In 
comparison, Viagra had $552 million in sales its first six months 
beginning in April 1998. Viagra is also made by Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra serve huge markets. Arthritis effects  
about 37 million Americans; impotence affects 30 million men. 
</P>
<P>
	But Celebrex has some key advantages.  
</P>
<P>
	Many arthritis sufferers need pain relief every day. Men only  
need to take Viagra when they plan to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Celebrex users also have largely stayed with the drug.  
Industry experts said thousands of men were inspired by the hype 
surrounding Viagra, and tried it only as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``A significant amount of usage of Viagra was recreational and  
after a while those users got over the novelty of it,'' said Jack 
Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big factor is insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Most insurance programs consider Viagra a lifestyle medication,  
and as a result either don't cover it or severely restrict coverage 
to a few pills per month. As a treatment for a serious, chronic 
disease, Celebrex enjoys greater insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Without coverage, patients may balk at paying the $2.42 a day  
for Celebrex or $8 per Viagra pill, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex was the first in a class of new arthritis drugs called  
cox-2 inhibitors, which target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase-2 
that causes inflammation. Unlike earlier drugs, cox-2 inhibitors 
don't act against a second enzyme, cyclo-oxegenase-1, which 
protects the stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects  
are a major problem with many painkillers, such as ibuprofen or 
aspirin, causing an estimated 16,500 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While tests show that cox-2 inhibitors may cause fewer ulcers  
than other drugs, the Food and Drug Administration still required 
Monsanto to put the same warning about side effects on Celebrex's 
label as the older drugs. Monsanto is conducting further tests to 
confirm that Celebrex is safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Sudol, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y,. has taken medications for his  
rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. When he heard about Celebrex, he 
immediately asked his doctor for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sudol has suffered no stomach problems from the other  
drugs, he also takes an ulcer medication just in case. Sudol said 
he can stop taking that medication because he feels more confident 
he is not hurting his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about quality of life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra are expected to surpass $1 billion in  
worldwide sales in 1999 as they are introduced in new countries. 
But analysts then expect Celebrex sales to continue climbing to 
nearly $4 billion in 2002, while Viagra grows more slowly to about 
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketers note that despite its rapid launch, Celebrex still has  
just 20 percent of the market for arthritis drugs. Many people 
still rely on generic or over-the-counter medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Does carrying the mantle of the hottest selling new drug really  
matter in the long run? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for publicity's sake and the company that  
introduced it,'' Lamberton said. ``It helps keep the drug in the 
public eye.''

	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police have caught 35,000 suspected  
criminals in a month-long nationwide campaign to ensure stability 
ahead of the 50th anniversary of Communist Party rule, state media

<HEADLINE> Injury Forces Breedlove To Postpone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- A painful bone spur has forced Craig Breedlove  
to scrap his quest for a sixth world land speed record and a return 
of the title to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little disappointed. We're just going to have to  
readjust our plans, be optimistic about it and start planning for 
next year,'' Breedlove said Monday from his home in Rio Vista, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove's last attempt at the record was a dismal outing in  
the Black Rock Desert in the fall of 1997 that saw him fall far 
short of a record-breaking British effort that shattered the speed 
of sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Breedlove was the first person to reach 400, 500 and 600 mph on  
land, but the world mark has been in British hands since October 
1983, when Richard Noble streaked across the desert 100 miles north 
of Reno at 633.47 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Noble handed over his car to Andy Green, his  
35-year-old protege from the Royal Air Force. Green sent shock 
waves thundering across the desert on Oct. 15, 1997, when he roared 
along the dry lake bed at 763.035 mph, becoming the first person to 
officially break the sound barrier on land. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the playa, Breedlove struggled to edge  
Noble's record of 13 years earlier with a peak speed of 636 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	He took last year off to regroup financially, emotionally and  
physically. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the bone spur, pressing against a rotator cuff, had been  
a problem for about four years that he tried to control with 
physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It got to the point where it was very painful. It was keeping  
me up at night and wasn't responding to cortisone and lidocane. 
It's just got to be repaired,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That nixed a speed run this year because of the pain involved in  
lowering himself into the cockpit of the car and, more importantly, 
the likelihood of his getting out quickly in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will be conducted within the next two weeks at the  
U.C. Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, Calif. While it's a 
relatively minor procedure, the 12-week recovery time will last far 
too late into the fall to allow any runs in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll put the time to very good use ... on the car. It'll give  
us more time to be better prepared,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the back of his mind, Breedlove can't dismiss turning 63 next  
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in excellent health except for my shoulder. One more year  
is not going to be that detrimental. I'm in very good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he concedes a sense of urgency in his quest for one more  
outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it is a diminishing return. Eventually I'm not going  
to be able to do this. I realize that time's not too far away,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar rises against euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro Monday, boosted  
by an early rally on Wall Street and a report that eased inflation 
and interest rate worries. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0683, down  
from $1.0705 late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 114.22 
Japanese yen, down from 114.48. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar initially followed stocks higher and held on to those  
gains against the euro even as share prices retreated and finished 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9 points on the day after  
rising as much as 136 points following a report showing that U.S. 
manufacturing businesses grew at a slower pace in July than 
analysts had expected. Investors have been edgy about signs of 
rapid economic growth that could aggravate inflationary pressures 
and prompt the Fed to nudge interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4947 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4907, and 1.5048 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5046. The British 
pound fell to $1.6173 from $1.6221. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8308 German 
marks, up from 1.8272; 6.1387 French francs, up from 6.1275.

<HEADLINE> Ford Resolves Conflict in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- The Brazilian subsidiary of Ford Motor  
Company reached an agreement Monday with labor leaders, ending a 
10-day strike that paralyzed the company's truck plant in Sao 
Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor leaders, aware of Ford's plan to move its truck-making  
facilities out of a working-class district in Sao Paulo, demanded a 
commitment that no one be fired for a year and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford responded with an offer of job stability through the end of  
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	After seven hours of negotiation, the stalemate was broken when  
both sides compromised on a one-year guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strike is over,'' said Paulo Pereira da Silva, president  
of the Sao Paulo Metalworkers Union. ``Production resumes 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Da Silva said the union will have a say as to where, when and  
how the factory will be transferred and has received guarantees 
that workers from the factory will be employed at the new 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's press office confirmed da Silva's comments.  
</P>
<P>
	The factory's nearly 1,500 workers went on strike July 22 after  
a local newspaper reported Ford would shut down the plant and 
transfer it to the northeastern state of Bahia. The strike stopped 
daily production of 120 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said it was not planning to move the plant to Bahia, but  
rather to one of two other factories it has on the outskirts of Sao 
Paulo.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Sign Maneluk Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers boosted their depth  
at left wing by signing Mike Maneluk to a one-year contract Monday, 
nine months after dealing him away to the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Maneluk recorded six goals and nine assists in 46 regular season  
games with the Flyers, Blackhawks and New York Rangers last season. 
The Flyers dealt Maneluk to Chicago for left wing Roman Vopat in 
November. The Rangers picked him up on waivers late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke said Maneluk will probably start this  
year with the AHL's Philadelphia Phantoms.

<HEADLINE> Sturm Vows Not To Meddle With Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Describing himself as a devoted sports fan who was  
determined to maintain local ownership, Donald Sturm vowed to 
operate the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche much like his 
other businesses: as an overseer. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, whose $461 million purchase of the two franchises and the  
new $160 million Pepsi Center still must be approved by the city of 
Denver and both the NBA and NHL, addressed the media for the first 
time Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he planned no immediate changes in either team, Sturm  
called the Nuggets' Dan Issel and the Avalanche's Pierre Lacroix 
``very competent general managers'' and said he would defer to them 
on player personnel matters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to be the same kind of owner I've been in  
my other businesses,'' said Sturm, 67, who made his fortune in 
telecommunications and banking and lives in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody gave me the advice in the newspaper that I ought to  
get the best people and give them authority and responsibility. 
Well, that's about what I've done in everything I've been involved 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I oversee things. I want to know what the strategic plans are.  
I want to know what the budgets are. I want to know why there's 
going to be deviations there. But on a day-to-day basis, I'm not a 
micromanager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he intended to be a visible owner like the New York  
Yankees' George Steinbrenner or more private, he said, ``I have no 
concept of that. I'm going to be my own person and handle it as I 
see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, a low-key billionaire who has stayed out of the public  
eye until now, admitted he isn't comfortable in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in business for over 40 years, and I've been  
involved in many major transactions, some a lot larger than this 
one,'' Sturm said. ``But this is my first press conference. So be 
kind to me, be gentle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I must admit to you that I didn't expect the notoriety that  
we're getting. Maybe I was naive. I hope that once these events 
pass it will become more of a stable situation and we won't find 
our names all over the place every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Ascent Entertainment Group believed it had sold the  
three properties to Wal-Mart heirs Bill and Nancy Laurie of 
Columbia, Mo., for $400 million. However, after Ascent shareholders 
sued, saying the price was too low, the sale was set aside and a 
two-stage bidding process was established. 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm, whose inquiries into purchasing the properties originally  
were rebuffed during Ascent's negotiations with the Lauries, then 
prevailed in the first round over two other groups, one of which 
included former Broncos quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave Sturm the right to advance to the second stage and  
engage in a bidding war with the Lauries, but they declined to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't shocked at all,'' Sturm said when asked about the  
Lauries' abruptly withdrawal. ``I must admit to you that part of my 
strategy was to bring in a number that perhaps would dissuade the 
Lauries from bidding. I've done that before in other 
transactions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sturm said he had two principal reasons for purchasing the  
Nuggets, Avalanche and Pepsi Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are Colorado assets, and they ought to be owned by  
somebody in the community,'' he said. ``The other reason is the 
intense interest that I have had and continue to have in sports. 
You name it, I've played it. I grew up in Brooklyn, N.Y., and I 
played street hockey on roller skates. I played high school 
basketball. I stopped playing three-man basketball maybe 10 or 15 
years ago, but I'm still teaching my son, who is going to be 9 
years old, the art, assuming I have any, of basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to the last two Broncos' championship games, and  
I've been to the French Open and Wimbledon. So I have a long-term 
interest in sports and I love the games. I watch a lot of sports on 
television. I find sports to be extremely entertaining and 
relaxing.''

<HEADLINE>  Bills' Smith Loses Weight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- When the Buffalo Bills opened camp over  
the weekend, one of the first things that caught their attention 
was a new and improved Antowain Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's model was pretty good. But in the NFL, pretty good  
doesn't cut it. Smith knows there's no shortage of running backs 
who would gladly take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Smith heard that the Bills were taking a serious look at  
troubled Lawrence Phillips during the offseason, he decided to step 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
	He got up early to lift weights. He went running in the searing  
heat of Houston's summer afternoons. He peeled the skin off chicken 
and piled vegetables on his plate. 
</P>
<P>
	He shed pounds like winter clothes, but he still feared losing  
the Bills' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were trying to tell me something,'' said Smith, who  
gained a respectable but unspectacular 1,124 yards last season 
while averaging what for him was a disappointing 3.8 yards per 
carry. 
</P>
<P>
	Message sent, message received.  
</P>
<P>
	Carrying a dozen fewer pounds than last year, a lean and wary  
Smith showed up for the start of training camp at Fredonia State 
hopping lightly and cutting sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good out there,'' Smith said.  
</P>
<P>
	He looks good, too, his teammates say.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's always had a lot of ability but now he's really starting  
to work to do everything that's asked of him,'' fullback Sam Gash 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith will be asked to do more than just run the ball, as he'll  
likely figure more prominently in the passing game. Last year he 
caught only five passes after making 28 catches as a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	Propelled by rigorous workouts and guided by countless hours of  
studying tape with running backs coach Bishop Harris, Smith is 
determined to prove that Buffalo made the right choice when it 
drafted the former University of Houston star in the first round in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, at 229 pounds, has the physical tools. Success will  
depend on how well he learns to use them, and how effectively he 
runs behind Gash, who last year helped Smith begin the transition 
from the one-back set. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was my first season with a fullback in front of  
me,'' Smith said. ``I was just of the mindset that I was going to 
follow Sam through hell or high water or wherever he went. 
Sometimes your fullback will lead you to the Promised Land, but he 
also draws a crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, who eventually signed with the 49ers even though  
problems with the law, alcohol and weight cost him jobs with the 
St. Louis Rams and Miami Dolphins, was a threat to Smith's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say the Bills were unhappy with me, but I haven't  
reached the full potential they saw when they drafted me,'' Smith 
said. ``It's kind of a wakeup call. This is a very important year 
for me.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Offensive Starters Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Randall Cunningham loved what he saw when  
he lined up Monday as the Minnesota Vikings opened training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	To his right was Jake Reed, a four-time 1,000-yard receiver who  
was bothered by a bad back last season but has pronounced himself 
fit. 
</P>
<P>
	And to his left was 12-year guard Randall McDaniel, who reported  
to training camp despite the team's unwillingness to renegotiate 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	That meant all 11 starters were back from an offense that set  
the NFL record last season with 556 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so happy our whole offense, including Randall McDaniel,  
stayed together,'' said receiver Randy Moss, who made the Pro Bowl 
as a rookie last year, thanks in large part to the protection that 
allowed the Vikings to throw the ball deep. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel was the league's highest-paid interior lineman when he  
signed a four-year, $12.5 million deal in 1997. But since then, 
he's become the third-highest paid player on his own offensive 
line, behind left tackle Todd Steussie and right tackle Korey 
Stringer. 
</P>
<P>
	McDaniel skipped the team's mandatory minicamp in May after his  
agent said Jeff Diamond, the team's former vice president of 
football operations, had promised to renegotiate his deal, which 
runs through 2000.

	After Diamond resigned, the Vikings said they wouldn't redo any  
contracts with more than a year remaining on them. 
</P>
<P>
	So, McDaniel, a 10-time Pro Bowl selection, considered retiring  
but ultimately decided he couldn't stand to see the Vikings go to 
the Super Bowl without him. He put the acrimony behind him and 
focused on football, not finances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here now,'' McDaniel said. ``I'm going to go out and do my  
job like I always have and we'll see what happens after that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I start playing, the last thing I want to talk about is  
contract,'' McDaniel added. ``So, I'll be out playing football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, to the delight of the Vikings and their faithful,  
there was that familiar weather worn jersey with the huge No. 64 
that was first issued to McDaniel back in 1988 and has faded from 
purple to baby blue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, indeed. I'm just happy,'' Cunningham said. ``I knew that  
situation would work itself out. He's a great player, amongst the 
best in the business. I'm not going to politic or anything we all 
love him as a teammate. And I guess they'll take care of him and do 
what they need to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even second-year pro Matt Birk, who might have taken over at  
left guard, said: ``I'm thrilled Randall's back. I've said all 
along, I hope he comes back. That's what's best for the team and 
ultimately it's best for him not to end his career on a bad note 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New offensive coordinator Ray Sherman, who coached the Vikings  
quarterbacks from 1995-97, knows how important it is to have 
McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what, when you've got a guy who's been a Pro  
Bowler, I mean, you don't want to lose guys like that,'' Sherman 
said. ``And he still keeps himself in great shape. He's still a 
leader on this team and you need all the good players you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Red McCombs said McDaniel's presence ensured against  
distractions as the team begins its quest to atone for last year's 
playoff debacle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really big to have everybody in camp. But to have a guy  
like Randall is super big because that would be the story of the 
camp if Randall were not in camp,'' McCombs said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green was just glad it didn't come down to a  
holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't talk about distractions. All we do is go with the  
guys that are here,'' Green said. ``Randall's one of the great 
players in the National Football League and he worked very hard 
today.''

<HEADLINE> Baby's Death in Hot Car Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Police are investigating a woman who allegedly  
abandoned her 8-month-old son at a gas station, where he died 
inside her locked car while outside temperatures hit the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	A sheriff's deputy found the boy, Senon Arteaga, in the car  
Sunday afternoon. The boy appeared to have been dead for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston's high temperature was 97 Sunday. A thermometer police  
used to measure the heat inside the car only went as high as 106, 
but officers estimated the temperature to be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother, Sandra Ann Arteaga, who police say was  
intoxicated, had driven to the gas station early Sunday but decided 
to take a taxi home with another of her children, who is 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours later, the children's father asked the woman where the  
younger child was, and the woman said she did not know but 
remembered leaving the car at the gas station, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Ms. Arteaga, 30, was charged with reckless injury to  
a child. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Her 
arraignment was scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In San Jose, Calif., on Sunday, a 2 1/2-year-old boy disappeared  
while playing and later died in a locked car parked in warm 
afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Fernando Pineda was found unconscious on the back floor of  
the car three hours after his family began searching for him. 
Paramedics could not revive him. 
</P>
<P>
	``One minute he was playing here,'' said an aunt, Lorena  
Salgado. ``Then we could not find him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was 76 degrees when Luis disappeared, but authorities said  
the temperature inside the car could have been 95.

<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENLAND, N.H. (AP) -- A fire damaged an abortion clinic that is  
often picketed by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Feminist Health Center of Portsmouth sustained water and  
fire damage Sunday, when the clinic was closed. Police Chief Scot 
Blanchard said today the fire ``may be suspicious,'' but wouldn't 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire badly damaged a ramp providing access for the  
handicapped and charred a back corner of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Braun, the clinic's executive director, said anti-abortion  
protesters picket outside the building once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have, in the past month, gotten a couple of things in the  
mail that were anti-choice materials,'' she said. ``One of them was 
enough to be taken seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The materials were turned over to police, she said.

<HEADLINE> 1st Lady Explains Husband's Actions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton called her  
husband's infidelity ``a sin of weakness'' and insisted in a 
magazine interview that she has stayed with him out of love and not 
for her own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Times said Mrs. Clinton emphasized in the Talk  
magazine interview that her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky 
happened after the deaths of his mother, her father and the 1993 
suicide of their close friend Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	``You known in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and  
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' Mrs. Clinton was 
quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was impeached by the House for lying about his  
affair with the former White House intern; the Senate acquitted him 
after a trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't protect me, so he lied,'' Mrs. Clinton said.  
</P>
<P>
	The article's author, Lucinda Franks, told CNN today she  
believes Mrs. Clinton chose to talk now about her marriage and its 
problems to fight her public image, which ranges from ``cold, 
calculating political wife'' to a ``kind of soft thinker of romance 
and fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been stereotyped in a way that has been very painful  
to her. I think she feels that people don't understand her, don't 
get her,'' Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Mrs. Clinton said she thought her husband's  
infidelity ``was resolved 10 years ago. ... I thought he had 
conquered it,'' according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, White House spokesman Jake Siewert would not  
comment on Mrs. Clinton's statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The article paints a portrait of Mrs. Clinton that is quite  
positive and it speaks for itself,'' he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton blamed her husband's infidelity on a desire to  
please women that can be traced to his childhood, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse. There  
was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother,'' she 
said in the magazine article, according to the London-based 
newspaper, which obtained a copy of the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying. ``There is always a desire to 
please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks -- the wife of Manhattan District Attorney Robert  
Morgenthau, a prominent Democrat -- said Clinton's mother, Virginia 
Kelley, wrote in her autobiography about a physical tussle with her 
son's grandmother over who would raise the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She describes the chaos. ... She describes an incident in  
which Bill's grandmother and she literally were pulling him 
apart,'' with one tugging on a shoe and the other on an arm, Franks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton told Franks that, since the Lewinsky scandal, her  
husband ``has been working on himself very hard. ... He has become 
more aware of his past and what was causing this behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She defended him as a good man, but said: ``Yes, he has  
weaknesses, yes he needs to be more responsible, more 
disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also refuted suggestions that she stuck with the  
president for her own benefit, The Sunday Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has some dysfunction in their families. They have to  
deal with it. You don't walk away if you love someone. You help the 
person,'' she is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it is love, isn't it?'' Franks asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, it is. We have love,'' she replied, according to the  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton acknowledged the pain of the infidelities, but said  
it did not outweigh the close relationship the couple have built. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this negate  
everything he has done as a husband, a father, a president?,'' Mrs. 
Clinton asked. ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but 
I have been with him half my life and he is a very, very good man. 
We just have a deep connection that transcends whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And despite the very public scandal, Mrs. Clinton said the  
couple remain close. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talk. We talk in the solarium, in the bedroom, in the  
kitchen -- it's just constant conversation,'' she was quoted as 
saying. ``We like to lie in bed and watch old movies, you know, 
those little individual video machines you can hold on your lap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton also talked about her move toward a run for a U.S.  
Senate seat from New York. ``Now for the first time I am making my 
own decisions. I can feel the difference. It is a great relief,'' 
she said, according to a news release from the magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine, edited by former New Yorker editor Tina Brown,  
hits U.S. newsstands Tuesday. A spokeswoman refused to provide a 
copy of the article to The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Woods Beats Duval in Prime Time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Tiger Woods went prime time Monday  
night, winning his showdown over David Duval under floodlights at 
Sherwood Country Club and the spotlight of a national television 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittingly, Woods closed out a 2&AMP;1 victory on the par-3 17th with  
a two-putt par. He won the first four par-3s to take a commanding 
lead, and hung on when Duval made one mistake too many. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sun tucked behind the foothills, Duval conceded the match  
as the floodlights cast long shadows across the green. Whether the 
first golf event televised live in prime time by a network was a 
success won't be clear until overnight ratings for ABC Sports are 
released on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods won $1.1 million, and Duval had to settle for $400,000.  
Each will donate $200,000 to charity, including $100,000 each to 
the PGA Tour-sponsored First Tee program.

	President Offers Heat Relief  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the mid-summer heat wave has caused  
great hardship, President Clinton today announced emergency drought 
assistance. He said he would work with Congress on a $10 billion 
request ``to provide the resources to help our farmers and 
ranchers.'' Clinton also said $100 million was being allocated to 
provide air conditioners and fans for low-income families and 
senior citizens. At least 191 people have died nationwide as a 
result of oppressively hot temperatures since July 19. Temperatures 
eased today in many areas.

	Clinton Backs Wife's Candor on Sex  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today expressed approval of  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's candor about his infidelities. 
She told Talk magazine that her husband's adultery was based on 
emotional ``abuse'' left by a dispute between his mother and 
grandmother when he was 4. Speaking of Clinton, White House 
spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``He told me from the reports he's 
gotten that it's a generally favorable article about the first 
lady, that he's comfortable with the views expressed in the article 
and the fact that she did the interview.''

	MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa (AP) -- With a new emphasis on values,

House as a ``bully pulpit'' to show the difference between right 
and wrong. ``I don't think President Clinton has been the leader 
that he should be,'' she said. The Republican presidential 
candidate said: ``I'm speaking of things like integrity, honesty, 
respect for your fellow man, personal responsibility.''

	GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Two high-speed trains collided in a remote  
section of eastern India near the border with Bangladesh, killing 
190 people and injuring 310. Railway officials said the toll was 
likely to climb to 250, and news agencies said it could reach 400 
or more. The impact flipped coaches on top of each other and hurled 
sleeping passengers though flaming compartments. Rail officials 
blamed a signal failure.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today threw out most of the  
charges in a government lawsuit accusing the Christian Coalition of 
illegally aiding GOP candidates. U.S. District Judge Joyce Green 
rejected arguments by the Federal Election Commission that the 
coalition's contact with campaigns and its distribution of voter

they were still consulting on the matter. Javier Solana is ending 
his four-year NATO term a few months early to be the European

	Good Cholesterol Gene Found  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have identified a gene that regulates  
the body's level of so-called good cholesterol, a breakthrough that 
could someday lead to a new way to treat one of the most common 
causes of heart disease. Flaws in the gene, known as ABC1, prevent 
the production of a protein that the body needs to rinse excess bad 
cholesterol and other fats out of cells and the bloodstream. ABC1 
was isolated in separate studies by scientists in Germany and in 
Canada. Their results appear in the August issue of Nature 
Genetics.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's 120-day suspension for his  
arrest on solicitation and drug charges was cut short today by one

Yankees outfielder eligible to play Wednesday. Strawberry will 
report to Triple-A Columbus of the International League. ``I'm 
ready to get going,'' Strawberry said in Tampa, Fla. He's is 
recovering from colon cancer.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Seeks To Boost US Airways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- A group of US Airways shareholders upset  
with the performance of the airline's stock is exploring a sale or 
merger of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Management LLC, a hedge fund led by Julian Robertson Jr.,  
holds 22.4 percent of US Airways Group stock. The investment fund 
said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing released Monday 
that it is exploring the options because the company's stock value 
``does not properly reflect the intrinsic value of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A US Airways representative declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline reported in July that profits for the second half of  
1999 would be lower than analysts had expected. Analysts blamed the 
company's fast expansion of its discount carrier Metrojet, as well 
as problems associated with a change in its computer reservation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for New York-based Tiger, which has held US Airways  
stock since 1996, said the filing allows it to enter discussions 
with the company's management, although it has no plans to push for 
a change in the US Airways board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows Tiger to speak directly to management about  
strategic options,'' spokesman Fraser Seitel said. ``Tiger is 
looking for ways to gain shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Tiger will take any action, the  
filing said.

	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Unhappy with the performance of US Airways  
Group, a major bloc of shareholders said Monday it is exploring a 
sale or merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Management LLC, a hedge fund led by Julian Robertson Jr.,  
holds 22.4 percent of US Airways stock. The investment fund said in 
a Security and Exchange Commission filing that it is exploring the 
options because the company's stock value ``does not properly 
reflect the intrinsic value of the business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A US Airways representative declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of US Airways rose $2.87 1/2, or 8 percent, to close at  
$38.50, well off their 52-week high of $77.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline reported in July that profits for the second half of  
1999 would be lower than analysts had expected. Analysts blamed the 
company's fast expansion of its discount carrier Metrojet, as well 
as problems associated with a change in its computer reservation 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for New York-based Tiger, which has held US Airways  
stock since 1996, said the filing allows it to enter discussions 
with the company's management, although it has no plans to push for 
a change in the US Airways board. 
</P>
<P>
	``This allows Tiger to speak directly to management about  
strategic options,'' spokesman Fraser Seitel said. ``Tiger is 
looking for ways to gain shareholder value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Tiger will take any action, the  
filing said.

<HEADLINE> Dole Puts Emphasis on Values </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa (AP) -- With a new emphasis on values,  
Elizabeth Dole said Monday that a president should use the White 
House as a ``bully pulpit'' to show the difference between right 
and wrong. ``I don't think President Clinton has been the leader 
that he should be,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate was asked her reaction to  
Hillary Rodham Clinton's discussion of her husband's affairs in an 
upcoming magazine article, mistakes that Mrs. Clinton referred to 
as ``a sin of weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even reading it or looking at it because, frankly, I'm  
focused on campaigning and the issues that are important to 
people'' Mrs. Dole said. ``In terms of what's going on in their 
marriage, that's their business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as she was declining to wade into the latest discussion of  
the Clinton marriage, Mrs. Dole was trotting out a new stump speech 
with a heavy emphasis on values. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have sort of lost touch with that sort of universal  
set of rights and wrongs,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``I think right now 
that what we have to reiterate is that, while the soundness of the 
economy is very important, ... we need to reaffirm those basic 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With her approach, Mrs. Dole was seeking to take advantage of a  
worrisome issue for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economy is sound and polls show most voters happy with  
the direction the country is headed, Vice President Al Gore, lags 
in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attribute that to weariness with Clinton and White House  
scandals. The president was impeached in the wake of an affair with 
a young intern, and Mrs. Clinton's latest comments inject that 
issue back into the public debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole hammered hard at values.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've begun to lose touch with that sort of universal set of  
right and wrongs,'' she said. ``We have to lead a crusade across 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If elected, Mrs. Dole said she would lead the way to ``a rebirth  
of our values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Integrity never goes out of style,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	She pointed to student test scores and youth drug use as  
evidence of a fraying of the social fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly it's a matter of leadership, using the bully pulpit to  
stress what is right and change what is wrong, and we have not had 
that kind of leadership from the president,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole also made it clear she was referring to personal  
characteristics that some find lacking in Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm speaking of things like integrity, honesty, respect for  
your fellow man, personal responsibility,'' said Mrs. Dole.

<HEADLINE> Calif. May Cut Sulfur in Gas Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California agency may lower the amount of  
sulfur allowed in the state's gasoline so autos can more 
effectively cut smog-producing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Air Resources Board issued a preliminary proposal  
Monday to lower the amount of sulfur allowed in gas from a maximum 
of 80 parts per million for any single batch to a maximum of 20 to 
30 parts per million, according to documents written by the 
agency's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of sulfur allowed in gas at the pump in California  
currently is 30 parts per million on average over six months -- not 
as a per batch maximum. That average would also be reduced, 
although the preliminary draft proposal did not indicate by exactly 
how much. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Air Resources Board was to hold a public workshop  
Wednesday to hear the views of engineers for automakers, 
environmentalists and others. Its final proposal is expected by 
late October and probably would be phased in for gasoline in 2003 
or 2004, said a spokesman for the agency, Allan Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
	California, which has the nation's worst air quality, has long  
set the pace for the strictest sulfur standard in gasoline in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently proposed a  
national sulfur standard that would match that in California today. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic automakers have been pushing for lower sulfur gasoline,  
arguing cars need it to allow their catalytic converters to 
effectively cut hydrocarbon and nitrogen oxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	With catalytic converters, emissions flow out of the engine's  
combustion chamber and over metals, such as platinum and rhodium, 
that chemically react with the gases to filter them. Sulfur can 
coat those metals, reducing their effectiveness permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sulfur is the Achilles' heel of the catalytic converter,''  
Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline across the county on average has about 340 parts per  
million of sulfur, but it can be as high as 1,000 parts per million 
in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary proposal by the California Air Resources Board  
staff also called for increasing the options available to refiners 
to reduce or eliminate oxygenates in gasoline, Hirsch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was in response to California's recent ban on MTBE,  
methyl tertiary butyl ether, used in so-called reformulated 
gasoline that allowed for a cleaner burning fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1990 required that gasoline sold in areas with  
severe air pollution contain a higher amount of oxygen. Oil 
companies responded by using MTBE, the most widely used additive. 
</P>
<P>
	But a study showed that the additive has affected at least  
10,000 groundwater sites throughout California, and Gov. Gray Davis 
declared it an environmental risk, banning it by the end of 2002.

<HEADLINE> Harricks Sever Ties With R.I. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Ties between the Harrick family and the  
University of Rhode Island have been officially severed. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant basketball coach Jim Harrick Jr. resigned over the  
weekend, according to school spokesman Mike Ballweg. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballweg does not know where the younger Harrick will go next,  
but The Providence Journal reported he is being considered for an 
assistant's position at Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 30, Harrick's contract expired and was not renewed.  
Instead, the contract was extended one month. That provision ended 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senior has gone down to Georgia and junior has gone now,  
too,'' Ballweg said. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 1, Jim Harrick Sr. left Rhode Island to accept the head  
coaching position at the University of Georgia. He hesitated before 
finally accepting the job because of the state's anti-nepotism law 
but his son supported his father's decision anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	URI has already started the search for Harrick Jr.'s  
replacement, Ballweg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballweg said it was Harrick Jr.'s decision to leave the program,  
not URI's. He said Harrick submitted his resignation before URI was 
able to extend a new contract to him. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches from several major colleges told The Journal they saw  
Harrick Jr. on the recruiting trail in July and said he spoke 
freely about the end of his employment at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	In their two years at URI, the Harricks led the Rams to two  
straight appearances in the NCAA tournament. They reached the 
regional final in 1998 and lost in the first round last season.

<HEADLINE> Heat Breaks in Much of Midwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The heat wave death toll kept rising today even  
as cooler temperatures brought an end to the heat wave across the 
Midwest and most of the East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office reported today that the  
state's heat-related death toll had reached eight with the deaths 
of four people in their 70s and 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	That number, plus two more reported today in South Carolina and  
30 names added to Chicago's list on Sunday, brought the nationwide 
total since July 19 to at least 197. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago authorities said they were sure the number of deaths  
there would go even higher. 
</P>
<P>
	A cold front that pushed across the region during the weekend  
brought much-needed relief, dropping high temperatures by 10 
degrees to 20 degrees from last week's levels. Chicago's high on 
Sunday was just 84, compared to Friday's high of 104. 
</P>
<P>
	By late morning today, temperatures were in the 70s across most  
of the Ohio Valley into the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wisconsin, the mercury had slipped to an almost crisp 59  
degrees when Bill Hansche left for work. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, it's just perfect,'' Hansche said Sunday as he headed  
for the Maple Grove County Club in West Salem, Wis. ``I wish you 
could box these up and bring one out every day you need one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisville, Ky., the afternoon temperature was down to 78 --  
from a high of 104 on Friday and 99 on Saturday. In Missouri, where 
44 people died, temperatures returned to seasonable levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``This feels wonderful,'' said Scott Kissell as he took a Sunday  
morning walk along Brush Creek near Kansas City's Country Club 
Plaza shopping district. ``It's been nutty. A hundred and six! 
That's a little much. This is a lot better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths were reported in 20 states and many shared a tragic  
thread: People most at risk from the heat were often the ones who 
wouldn't -- or couldn't -- wrap themselves in the icy blast of an air 
conditioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill and Sandy Folak repeatedly offered to pay the electricity  
bill and install an air conditioner in Eddie Slautas' apartment 
above their tavern. Each time, they said, he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, `Why should I make my electric bill higher. The fan  
is good enough,''' Sandy Folak said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday night, with his fan still running, the heat killed  
Eddie Slautas, two days before his 75th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Chicago resident, Ilko Homziak, also didn't want any  
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to get him (air) conditioning,'' said Olga Romanei of  
her 82-year-old younger brother, whose body was found in the 
upstairs room of the house they shared. ``He say, `I no want, I no 
want.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In dozens of states, authorities found heartbreaking scenes when  
worried neighbors or friends called about those missing or at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Nashville, Tenn., kicked down a door and discovered  
the body of a 95-year-old woman in her 95-degree home. Gertrude 
Williams was dressed for church and sitting in a wheelchair with an 
offering check in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Church members say they wanted to help Ms. Williams get an air  
conditioner but she refused, saying it would make her sneeze and 
uncomfortably cold. 
</P>
<P>
	In Newnan, Ga., a 14-year-old boy confined to a bed and  
requiring a ventilator to breathe died of heat stroke in a home 
where the electricity had been turned off by the utility company. 
</P>
<P>
	The teenager's ventilator continued to run on batteries, but the  
home's central air conditioning shut down. The boy's body 
temperature was 107 degrees when he died, the coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis McEntire of Newnan Utilities said the power was turned  
off as a result of miscommunication. The family had moved in last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Six bodies were found Sunday in South Carolina, and Charleston  
County Coroner Susan Chewning said some of the victims had access 
to air conditioners but weren't using them. 
</P>
<P>
	In Chicago, where the heat wave of 1995 contributed to more than  
700 area deaths, officials said they've learned many lessons about 
helping the elderly and other vulnerable residents handle the heat. 
Mayor Richard M. Daley said people must take responsibility for 
checking up on loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't family members check on other family members and  
parents?'' he asked. ``Why are they calling the city to do that? 
That is the most frustrating thing in any crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Jackson, executive director of the Chicago Housing  
Authority, agreed. ``We found out that there is no substitute for 
human contact,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that isn't always enough. The Folaks, for example,  
brought breakfast, lunch and dinner to their upstairs neighbor 
every day, including the meal the couple's daughter was bringing 
him when she discovered his body.

<HEADLINE> House Finishing $12.6B Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many House Democrats are supporting a $12.6  
billion foreign aid bill in hopes that spending can be increased 
and anti-abortion language deleted to avoid a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate already has approved a similar measure but without  
the one amendment sure to bring a veto: a ban on any U.S. funding 
for groups working to liberalize abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The House, voting 315-103 late Monday, rejected an effort to  
stop the government's Overseas Private Investment Corp. from 
insuring any more corporate investments abroad. Debate on the bill 
continued into the evening, but lawmakers put off votes on any 
further amendments or the final bill until Tuesday or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Democrats on the Appropriations Committee's foreign  
operations panel said they would support the foreign operations 
legislation in the hope it can be modified before it goes to 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, lawmakers last week approved a parallel  
provision that is more palatable to family planning groups that 
view the abortion language as a prohibition on free speech and an 
effort to stop family planning, not just abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The second amendment, approved 221-208, reflects the contention  
that family planning prevents abortions. It would require that 
groups receiving aid certify only that they work to reduce the 
number of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The original amendment, a version of which has doomed several  
foreign affairs bills in the past five years, passed 228-220. It 
would ban aid to any group lobbying for changes in abortion laws 
even if the group uses privately raised funds. Family planning 
groups hope that language can be removed during the House-Senate 
conference committee that will shape the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the legislation's cuts of $1.9 billion  
from Clinton's requests would harm a wide range of foreign policy 
efforts, hurting the poorest countries and diminishing the ability 
to respond to foreign crises, to prevent nuclear smuggling, to deal 
with the Asian crisis, to expand the Peace Corps and to help 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's funding is $715 million below that of last year's  
bill and $20.7 billion below this year's actual spending on foreign 
assistance, including emergency appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration statement said senior advisers would  
recommend a veto if foreign operations funding is not increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding at this level would seriously impair the president's  
ability to conduct an effective foreign policy,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the bill would cut funding to international lending  
institutions by $493 million from amounts needed to meet U.S. 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major provisions of the foreign operations bill include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$2.88 billion for Israel, representing a $120 million reduction  
in economic and a $60 million increase in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 billion for Egypt, a $40 million reduction in economic aid  
but no change in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$725 million for former Soviet states, $307 million below  
Clinton's request. It would withhold 50 percent of aid to Russia 
unless it ends missile cooperation with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	--$680 million for child survival programs.  
</P>
<P>
	Among hotly contested provisions, the bill includes the first  
cut in funding for a military school in Fort Benning, Ga., which 
has been criticized for human rights abuses committed in Latin 
American by some of its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2606.

<HEADLINE> Packers' Robert Brooks Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Robert Brooks played football longer than  
he ever thought he would. When his body couldn't endure any more 
pain, he accepted it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't cover it up any more,'' the Packers wide  
receiver said. ``I found myself missing so many practices and 
taking so much medication just to practice. When you get to that 
point, I think it's time to call it quits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks retired Monday after seven injury-plagued seasons with  
the Green Bay Packers during which he never became the superstar 
many thought he would. He said his knees, back and hamstrings could 
no longer withstand the punishment of pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can fool a lot of people, but you can't fool yourself,''  
he said. ``I'm 29 years old, and after a practice, I feel like I'm 
50.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks retires as the Packers' career leader in postseason  
catches and receiving yards. He is the seventh-leading receiver in 
the club's 80-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	His career followed the arc of the Packers' franchise rebirth,  
and he was one of the team's most popular players during its run to 
consecutive NFC championships and a league title. Brooks originated 
the ``Lambeau Leap,'' the Packers' trademark jump into the Lambeau 
Field stands to celebrate a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert has meant a great deal to this organization and to me  
personally,'' offensive coordinator Sherman Lewis said. ``If he 
couldn't perform at the level he wanted to, then I understand 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks was drafted out of South Carolina in 1992, the same year  
coach Mike Holmgren and Lewis were hired. In 1995, Brooks caught 
102 passes for a team-record 1,497 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	But the next three seasons he had just 114 catches for 1,774  
yards while missing 16 games with injuries. He had 31 receptions 
for 420 yards in 12 games last season while playing in he what 
called ``almost constant pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks participated in a team minicamp this summer and said he  
was in the best shape of his life. But when he dropped several 
balls during his first day of practice Friday at training camp, it 
was obvious something was still wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	He skipped weekend workouts and told coach Ray Rhodes on  
Saturday he would retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't put up the facade any more of being a tough guy,''  
Brooks said. ``I think I've done that long enough. It's allowed me 
to play in this game longer than I think anybody expected me to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His departure leaves the Packers alarmingly short of depth at  
wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's top receiver, All-Pro Antonio Freeman, is in the  
midst of a contract dispute which the team may now be ready to 
resolve quickly. Freeman's agent, Joel Segal, did not immediately 
return a phone call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Corey Bradford, Bill Schroeder, Derrick Mayes and an assortment  
of free agents and rookies are left to be quarterback Brett Favre's 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that concerns me a great deal,'' Lewis said. ``But  
we'll get Antonio in here and some of our young guys will step up. 
We have a fine group of receivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers' first exhibition game is Aug. 14 against the New  
York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' injury problems began in October 1996, when he tore both  
the ACL and the patellar tendon in his right knee on the first 
offensive play of a game against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a catastrophic injury would have ended many careers, but  
Brooks surprised team doctors by returning for the 1997 season and 
catching 60 passes for 1,010 yards and seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brooks said his gimpy knee caused him to overwork his other  
joints, leading to chronic back pain. He had arthroscopic surgery 
during training camp last year for a herniated disc, and he had a 
similar operation Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks attended minicamp in June but various aches remained. He  
thought about retiring then but reconsidered after talking with 
Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me the feeling as if they were counting on me,''  
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks, who signed a five-year, $15 million contract in 1998,  
agreed to a $1.1 million pay cut in June, which the Packers said 
eased their salary-cap restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he will keep a home in Green Bay and he plans to  
focus his energies on his interest in music and a ministry he 
recently founded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel comfortable about closing this chapter of my  
life and opening whatever chapter God has for me,'' Brooks said.

<HEADLINE>  Canadian Apologizes for Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ADELE, Quebec (AP) -- Steve Vezina, Canada's roller hockey  
goaltender, apologized Monday for costing his country the Pan 
American Games gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop one of his teammates from lashing out at him.  
</P>
<P>
	Vezina admitted taking the over-the-counter cold remedy Sudafed  
during the games and capsules of the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, 
purchased at a pharmacy, in June. During a news conference with his 
agent, Paul Hamel, Vezina said he took Nandolone because he was 
losing weight during the busy roller hockey schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete  
that represents Canada,'' Vezina said. ``I would like to apologize 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It apparently wasn't enough for Vezina's teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>
<P>

16,000 parts per million of Nandrolone, when one or two parts per 
million raises immediate suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I'm not a doctor,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm a bad person because I did that. I don't

something I should not take when you play at the Pan Am Games. I

	Vezina played last season for the Utah Grizzlies of the  
International Hockey League. He also is a goalie for Roller Hockey 
International's Buffalo Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the future, Hamel said his client has signed a two-year  
deal with a professional ice hockey team, but would not identify 
that team. Hamel said Vezina orignally had three offers and that 
two teams he contacted Monday still were interested in his client 
should he become available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect his ice hockey,'' Hamel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Pipe, chairman of the Canadian Centre for Ethics and  
Sport, said Monday that blanket testing of athletes before events 
such as the Pan Am Games won't guarantee a dope-free games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will it provide an absolute guarantee there are going to be no  
embarrassment? The answer is no,'' said Pipe, Canada's top 
anti-doping official. 
</P>
<P>
	Pipe said athletes could test clean in the days prior to a  
games, then inadvertently, or purposely, ingest a banned substance 
prior to their event.

<HEADLINE>  Canadian Apologizes for Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ADELE, Quebec (AP) -- Steve Vezina, Canada's roller hockey  
goaltender, apologized Monday for costing his country the Pan 
American Games gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop one of his teammates from lashing out at him.  
</P>
<P>
	Vezina admitted taking the over-the-counter cold remedy Sudafed  
during the games and capsules of the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, 
purchased at a pharmacy, in June. During a news conference with his 
agent, Paul Hamel, Vezina said he took Nandolone because he was 
losing weight during the busy roller hockey schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete  
that represents Canada,'' Vezina said. ``I would like to apologize 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It apparently wasn't enough for Vezina's teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury  
securities rose in Monday's auction to the highest level in just 
over one month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department sold $8 billion in three-month bills at  
a discount rate of 4.695 percent, up from 4.535 percent last week. 
An additional $8 billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 
4.750 percent, up from 4.520 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-month rate was the highest since June 28 when the  
bills sold for 4.750 percent. The six-month rate also was the 
highest since June 28 when the rate was 4.960. 
</P>
<P>
	The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors  
-- 4.831 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling 
for $9,881.30, and 4.947 percent for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,759.90.

	In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the  
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index

percent last week from 4.98 percent the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Christie's Opens Shop in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- After helping liquidate artworks seized  
from bankrupt Thai finance companies, the auction house Christie's 
is bidding on a revival of the post-Asian crisis luxury market and 
setting up shop in Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	The famed auctioneer will inaugurate its presence in Bangkok  
this weekend with auctions of paintings, rare books, maps, 
manuscripts and photographs. Thailand will host the company's 
fourth salesroom in the region after Australia, Singapore and Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	Christie's gained the limelight in Bangkok some months back when  
it handled the auction of paintings owned by 56 finance companies 
that were closed by the government, part of the shakeout from the 
regional economic crisis that struck in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Financial Restructuring Authority, charged with  
liquidating the assets, ranging from luxury cars to condo projects, 
asked Christie's to handle the art sale. The 400 lots were expected 
to fetch $270,000, but pulled in five times that. 
</P>
<P>
	Dimitri Karukin, manager of client services for Christie's  
Thailand, said Monday that the luxury market is showing signs of 
life as the economy slowly recovers from the worst recession since 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is getting better,'' Karukin said. ``We don't just  
have buyers, we have sellers, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first auction Saturday, Christie's will sell 286 lots of  
rare books, maps, manuscripts and photographs on Thailand from the 
collection of an unidentified single owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Choice items include a four-volume, 1873 first edition of French  
explorer Francois Garnier's account of his travels up the wilds of 
the Mekong River, with maps, plates, and plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday, 146 lots of important Thai paintings, prints and  
sculpture go on the block. Two extremely rare portraits of kings 
Rama III and Rama IV being offered. No public price estimates were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	They were painted in the early part of this century by Phra  
Soralaklikit, court painter to King Rama V, considered the greatest 
of the Chakri Dynasty monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also paintings by Thai artists Fua Haripitak, Tawee  
Nandakwang, Suchao Sisganes, Pratuan Emjaroen and Thawan Dachanee, 
with estimates ranging from $16,200 to $95,000.

<HEADLINE> Celebrex Beats Viagra in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't create a national sensation like  
Viagra, but the new arthritis pill Celebrex has surpassed the 
impotence medicine as the nation's fastest-selling new drug ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex promises pain relief with fewer stomach problems than  
other drugs. Unlike Viagra, patients take it every day and it's 
usually covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, which was introduced in January, sold 6.86 million  
prescriptions during its first six months on the market, compared 
with 6.05 million for Viagra during its first six months, according 
to IMS Health, a research company. Celebrex began to outpace Viagra 
in prescriptions after four months. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Celebrex in the first six months added up to about $600  
million, said Monsanto, which co-markets the drug with Pfizer. In 
comparison, Viagra had $552 million in sales its first six months 
beginning in April 1998. Viagra is also made by Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra serve huge markets. Arthritis effects  
about 37 million Americans; impotence affects 30 million men. 
</P>
<P>
	But Celebrex has some key advantages.  
</P>
<P>
	Many arthritis sufferers need pain relief every day. Men only  
need to take Viagra when they plan to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Celebrex users also have largely stayed with the drug.  
Industry experts said thousands of men were inspired by the hype 
surrounding Viagra, and tried it only as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``A significant amount of usage of Viagra was recreational and  
after a while those users got over the novelty of it,'' said Jack 
Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big factor is insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Most insurance programs consider Viagra a lifestyle medication,  
and as a result either don't cover it or severely restrict coverage 
to a few pills per month. As a treatment for a serious, chronic 
disease, Celebrex enjoys greater insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Without coverage, patients may balk at paying the $2.42 a day  
for Celebrex or $8 per Viagra pill, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex was the first in a class of new arthritis drugs called  
cox-2 inhibitors, which target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase-2 
that causes inflammation. Unlike earlier drugs, cox-2 inhibiters 
don't act against a second enzyme, cyclo-oxegenase-1, which 
protects the stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects  
are a major problem with many painkillers, such as ibuprofen or 
aspirin, causing an estimated 16,500 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While tests show that cox-2 inhibitors may cause fewer ulcers  
than other drugs, the Food and Drug Administration still required 
Monsanto to put the same warning about side effects on Celebrex's 
label as the older drugs. Monsanto is conducting further tests to 
confirm that Celebrex is safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Sudol, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y,. has taken medications for his  
rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. When he heard about Celebrex, he 
immediately asked his doctor for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sudol has suffered no stomach problems from the other  
drugs, he also takes an ulcer medication just in case. Sudol said 
he can stop taking that medication because he feels more confident 
he is not hurting his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about quality of life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra are expected to surpass $1 billion in  
worldwide sales in 1999 as they are introduced in new countries. 
But analysts then expect Celebrex sales to continue climbing to 
nearly $4 billion in 2002, while Viagra grows more slowly to about 
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketers note that despite its rapid launch, Celebrex still has  
just 20 percent of the market for arthritis drugs. Many people 
still rely on generic or over-the-counter medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Does carrying the mantle of the hottest selling new drug really  
matter in the long run? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for publicity's sake and the company that  
introduced it,'' Lamberton said. ``It helps keep the drug in the 
public eye.''

<HEADLINE> Meyer Named CEO at Warner Bros. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Longtime Warner Bros. executive Barry Meyer  
was named chairman and chief executive officer of the studio 
Monday, while Castle Rock Entertainment chairman Alan Horn was 
appointed president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer will take over from departing chiefs Terry Semel and Bob  
Daly, who had worked together running studio operations since 1980. 
Semel and Daly announced their resignations last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry Meyer and Alan Horn are the ideal team to run Warner  
Brothers,'' Gerald Levin, Time Warner Inc. chairman and chief 
executive, said in a statement. ``Both are seasoned entertainment 
executives with the right mix of business and creative savvy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer will head film and TV operations but will not inherit  
Semel and Daly's duties overseeing Warner Music Group. A new leader 
at the music division will be named soon, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 56, has been executive vice president since 1984 and  
chief operating officer of the Burbank-based studio since 1994. He 
came to work for Warner television in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn co-founded Castle Rock in 1987. The production company's  
films include ``When Harry Met Sally,'' ``City Slickers'' and ``A 
Few Good Men.''

</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.04 yen in late afternoon trading, down  
1.22 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 114.48 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen also weighed on sentiment in the stock market.  
</P>
<P>
	``Most analysts were using 125 yen in their calculations for  
this year, and now they will have to revise them downward,'' said 
Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative strategy group at Jardine 
Fleming Securities.

<P>
	A weak dollar makes Japanese exports costlier abroad while  
reducing the yen value of foreign revenue.

	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section closed down 10.31 points, or 0.70 percent, to 
1,468.62. The TOPIX closed down 11.20 points, or 0.76 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 437 million shares traded on the first section,  
down from Friday's 512 million. Declining shares overwhelmed 
gainers by more than two to one. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar's basic weakness  
remained unchanged amid concerns about inflation in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Those fears had also driven the Dow Jones industrial average  
down for a second straight session Friday, losing 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns of U.S. inflation have grown since the U.S. Labor  
Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered the best 
measure of changes in wages and benefit costs, rose 1.1 percent in 
the second quarter of this year. The jump was larger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Signs of inflation have led investors to fret about the overall  
health of the U.S. economy, driving the dollar to a five-month low 
of 114.20 yen in New York on Friday. The greenback trades as low as 
113.95 yen and as high as 115.00 yen in Tokyo on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 121.78 yen, down  
from 123.46 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.8250 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7850 percent, 
driving its price down to 99.78 yen from 100.12 yen.

<HEADLINE> A-to-Z Guide To War-Time Atrocities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chechnya, Bosnia, Rwanda, Kosovo. Deportation,  
torture, willful killing of civilians, ethnic cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
	The century in which ``genocide'' and ``concentration camp''  
entered the vocabulary is ending with a decade that has forced the 
world to confront crimes against humanity, not once but several 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	It is easy to forget that wars have rules.  
</P>
<P>
	But 50 years after the Geneva Conventions outlined the laws of  
war in the aftermath of World War II, a group of combat 
correspondents and legal scholars has written a guide to the ways 
fighting men have broken those codes of conduct. Their goal is to 
build political support for rules that are all too rarely enforced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Humanitarian law and international rights law have never been  
more developed; yet never before have so many innocent civilians 
been the victims of war crimes,'' South African jurist Richard 
Goldstone, the first chief prosecutor for the Yugoslav war crimes 
tribunal, writes in ``Crimes of War: What the Public Should Know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book, published by W.W. Norton, is an alphabetical catalogue  
of international humanitarian law, from act of war and biological 
weapons through death squads, forced labor and refugees' rights to 
torture and wanton destruction. It is both legal text and battle 
glossary. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN correspondent Christiane Amanpour writes about Bosnian Serb  
paramilitaries. German law scholar Horst Fischer describes the 
legal ambiguity of carpet bombing. Retired British Army Maj. Gen. 
A.P.V. Rogers sets out rules governing civil wars, which are 
murkier than those of cross-border conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Former U.S. Army law professor H. Wayne Elliott offers a how-to  
guide for judging whether prisoner of war camps meet the Geneva 
Conventions' standards: Is it located far enough from the combat 
zone? Are the prisoners adequately fed? Are they properly clothed 
or uniformed? 
</P>
<P>
	Most compelling are case studies on the horror such warfare  
inflicts and the vagaries of war crime law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Khmer Rouge's slaughter of more than a million of their  
fellow Cambodians in the mid 1970s was ignored by the United States 
and others because of Cold War politics, says former New York Times 
reporter Sydney Schanberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Realpolitik, not (international) law, was the governing  
force,'' writes Schanberg, who won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting 
on ``the killing fields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Renfrew, Moscow bureau chief for The Associated Press,  
recounts the nationalism and ethnic hatred that plunged into 
carnage the Russian enclave of Chechnya in 1991. International law 
had little to say about the Chechens' right to secede. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian troops indiscriminately killed civilians, who in turn  
were used by the Chechens as human shields. And while both sides 
broke the laws of war, the international community treated the 
fighting as an internal matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The conscription of children younger than 15 is a recognized --  
if oft-ignored -- war crime. Yet Reuters photographer Corinne Dufka 
writes about the child soldiers she came across in Liberia, all 12 
or younger, putting their assault weapons aside to play soccer with 
a human skull. 
</P>
<P>
	Writer David Rieff and Newsday correspondent Roy Gutman, the  
book's co-editors, argue that war doesn't have to work this way. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Geneva Conventions of Aug. 12, 1949, and other accords  
covering crimes against humanity whether in war or peace, ``were 
intended to establish, even in war, a firebreak between 
civilization and barbarism,'' they write. 
</P>
<P>
	These laws, rarely put to use since the war crimes trials in  
Nuremberg and Tokyo after World War II, can be complex and their 
enforcement often complicated by political factors. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the Clinton administration avoided using the word  
``genocide'' during the 1994 massacres of at least a half-million 
people in Rwanda, even though that case clearly was genocide as 
defined by international law. Members of one ethnic group, the 
Hutus, tried to destroy another ethnic group, the Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the  
Crime of Genocide would have required signatory states, including 
the United States, to intervene -- something American leaders feared 
after 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Somalia during a peacekeeping 
mission the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The book's authors hope it will be used by journalists  
chronicling future Rwandas, Bosnias or Kosovos to report on the 
arcane laws of war in ``real time,'' and thus provoke public 
outrage and build political support for intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the outside world pays no attention, war turns into war  
crimes on both sides,'' Gutman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, the only two war crimes tribunals set up since the  
post-World War II period were established, for Rwanda and the 
former Yugoslavia. And last year, 120 countries approved a treaty 
to create a standing war crimes court. The United States has yet to 
sign on.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Hard Times for Kosovo Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The parents of the first Albanian Kosovar  
refugee born in the United States say they face a destitute life 
because of unfulfilled promises of aid, the New York Post reported 
today. But the agency charged with helping the family denies the 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are having a hard time,'' said Naim Karaliju, who named his  
baby boy Amerikan in honor of his new life in the United States. 
``There is not enough money to buy milk for the baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karaliju, 28, said his 63-year-old mother, a hotel cleaner, is  
the only employed member of the family, which now lives in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are being told that our food stamps will be cut off and we  
will have to pay the rent,'' Karaliju told the Post through an 
interpreter. ``For me it's just too depressing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Refugee advocates claim that Refugee Services of North Texas,  
which is funded by federal taxpayers to help refugees for their 
first 30 days of resettlement, failed to provide the family with 
adequate housing, furniture, food and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is then supposed to enlist charities and social  
services to further assist refugees if they still are in need. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Corcoran, the executive director of Refugee Services, said  
today that his agency has provided the family with quality housing 
and helped 11 of the 24 refugees in the Karaliju family gain 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply don't understand where the claims are coming from,''  
Corcoran said. ``Some of our people visited them last week, and 
their only complaint was that they did not have enough money for 
cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the agency's national organization, Church World  
Services, also denied the complaints and said Karaliju had turned 
down a job. 
</P>
<P>
	``My assumption is he was offered a job and refused,'' CWS  
spokeswoman Deborah DeWinter said in New York. ``These people are 
not in need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amerikan was born in May, days after his mother, Lebibe  
Karaliju, was airlifted to Fort Dix, N.J., from Macedonia. He drew 
national attention and was photographed holding an American flag. 
His name follows Albanian spelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Karalijus, who were showered with blessings, including one  
from President Clinton, await word from family members in Kosovo on 
the condition of their properties there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any optimism,'' said Karaliju, who added that he  
is willing to ``take any job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what will happen,'' he said. ``Who is going to  
pay the bills?''

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Get Real' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	As if dating when you're a teen-ager isn't hard enough, imagine  
being a gay teen-ager in an elite private school in an insular 
English town. 
</P>
<P>
	This is Steven Carter's reality in ``Get Real,'' a funny,  
engaging film about growing up and falling in love under difficult 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven (Ben Silverstone) has known he's gay since age 11, a  
secret he keeps from everyone in his homophobic environment except 
his best friend, Linda (Charlotte Brittain), whose ample size and 
brash demeanor make her somewhat of a misfit herself. 
</P>
<P>
	As his high school graduation looms, his yearnings to come out  
of the closet grow stronger, yet he must continue meeting men 
furtively. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of funny, awkward scenes, we see Steven at a gay  
cruising spot in a park bathroom. ``He's got eyes like Brad Pitt,'' 
Steven coos to Linda about an attractive blond with whom he's 
become intimate and who turns out to be married. 
</P>
<P>
	One sunny afternoon, he finds an unlikely partner in the park --  
the best-looking, most popular guy at school, track star John Dixon 
(Brad Gorton). John has a girlfriend -- who models underwear for 
mail-order catalogs -- but clearly is confused about his sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys are more than a little startled to find each other,  
and seem a mismatched pair. Skinny Steven is all gangly limbs and 
long eyelashes. John is rugged and muscular, with wavy dark hair 
and a strong jaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Quickly, each finds in the other a much-needed friend and  
companion, and the scenes in which Steven and John explore their 
relationship are tender and sweet. 
</P>
<P>
	A sense of melancholy blankets their bliss, however, because we  
know it can't last. John is wealthy, athletic and Oxford-bound. 
There's no way his love affair with Steven can be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Wilde's screenplay, adapted from his play, ``What's  
Wrong With Angry?'', is lively and warm. The teen-agers are smart 
and endearing, and they talk like young people really talk. 
Throughout the adaptation process, the filmmakers held readings at 
several schools, and the input they received from students makes 
the dialogue ring true. 
</P>
<P>
	Even a scene at a school dance -- obligatory for any movie about  
teen-agers -- feels authentic. The students don't appear to be 
having fake, contrived fun, and director Simon Shore even let the 
young actors choose the music playing in the background. 
</P>
<P>
	But what truly makes this film shine are the performances.  
</P>
<P>
	Silverstone seamlessly embodies his character. He adeptly shows  
a wide range of emotions -- awkwardness, anxiety, adoration, 
confusion, frustration and, ultimately, joy. His moment of truth at 
the end is a little too feel-good, but he plays it with great 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Gorton, whose character simply could have been a vapid pretty  
boy, is surprisingly compelling as the complacent jock who doubts 
everything he's made of, even though he's truly fallen in love for 
the first time. As John, he shows an impressive balance between his 
love for Steven and his paranoia of being found out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brittain is terrific as Linda, who's tough and saucy on the  
outside but clearly lonely and a little sad underneath. A scene in 
which she tells off a drunk jock at the school dance is a powerful, 
you-go-girl moment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shore's direction is edgy and reminiscent of ``Rushmore,'' also  
set in a private school, with its wide-angle shots and variety of 
camera angles, and while his film is about a gay relationship, its 
themes of loneliness, love and loss are universal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get Real,'' a Paramount Classics release, runs 110 minutes and  
is rated R for language and sexual issues.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Coach at Rutgers-Camden Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Wilbur ``Pony'' Wilson, athletic director at  
Rutgers-Camden for nearly three decades, has died at age 66. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, of Cherry Hill, N.J. died Saturday night at the Hospital  
of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia after a brief 
battle with pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached the men's basketball team for 18 1/2 years during three  
stints, compiling a 187-273 record. He led the Pioneers to NAIA 
district championships in 1972 and 1976. But the school landed in 
NCAA Division III history books in the mid-1990s, compiling a 
117-game losing streak that spanned five seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	When the streak reached 84 games in March 1995, Wilson returned  
as coach. The team lost 14 more games before health problems forced 
him to step down. He lost 50 pounds and his wife, Betty, got 
worried when he began yelling out the names of players in his 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The publicity got so bad that then-Provost Walter Gordon decided  
to eliminate the program in 1996, over Wilson's objections. Gordon 
later reversed his decision, and the streak finally ended on Jan. 
7, 1997, with a 77-72 victory over Bloomfield College. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson became athletic director in 1969 when the branch campus  
only had five men's sports teams and no playing facilities of its 
own. He retired in 1998. The school currently has 14 teams for men 
and women, an intramural program and a gym with two basketball 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his wife, Wilson is also survived by two children  
from a previous marriage, a son, Darryl, a daughter, Diane, a 
step-daughter, Saundra Umstead-Capers, and five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Meyer Named CEO at Warner Bros. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Longtime Warner Bros. executive Barry Meyer  
has been named the studio's chairman and chief executive officer, 
while Castle Rock Entertainment chairman Alan Horn was appointed 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer will take over from Terry Semel and Bob Daly, who had  
worked together running studio operations since 1980. Semel and 
Daly announced their resignations last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry Meyer and Alan Horn are the ideal team to run Warner  
Brothers,'' Gerald Levin, Time Warner Inc. chairman and chief 
executive, said Monday. . ``Both are seasoned entertainment 
executives with the right mix of business and creative savvy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer will head film and TV operations but will not inherit  
Semel and Daly's duties overseeing Warner Music Group. A new leader 
at the music division will be named soon, Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 56, has been executive vice president since 1984 and  
chief operating officer of the Burbank-based studio since 1994. He 
came to work for Warner television in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn co-founded Castle Rock in 1987. The production company's  
films include ``When Harry Met Sally,'' ``City Slickers'' and ``A

<P>
	CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- Citing illness, Whitney Houston canceled  
a concert in the San Francisco Bay area an hour before she was to 
perform on the last scheduled stop on the U.S. leg of her world 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the audience had already arrived for Sunday's show, said  
Michael McNally, the house manager at Concord Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Walden, a spokesman for Ms. Houston's label, Arista, said  
he didn't know the nature of her illness. Her management company, 
Nippy Inc., said it couldn't provide information on the 
cancellation until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Houston also canceled or postponed shows in Tennessee,  
Missouri, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The show in Concord will not be rescheduled. Ticket-holders will  
receive full refunds, McNally said.

<HEADLINE> 6 Major Phone Cos. Announce Fee Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Normally feuding local and long-distance  
telephone companies disclosed a joint proposal Monday that is aimed 
at consolidating residential phone bills and reducing long-distance 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups oppose the plan on grounds that reductions in  
long-distance charges will not offset monthly increases for most 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the plan, to be phased in over five years, local companies  
would reduce by $5.6 billion a year the ``access'' fees they charge 
long-distance carriers to connect calls. If long-distance companies 
pass on the savings, consumers will see lower rates, supporters 
contend. In turn, certain flat-rate fees on local phone bills would 
go up. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance companies AT&AMP;T and Sprint joined with major local  
phone companies Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, GTE and SBC to create the 
proposal, which they submitted to the Federal Communications 
Commission last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators have cut access charges by several billion dollars  
over the past few years to reflect better local phone companies' 
connection costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But the unusual industry coalition could heighten chances that  
the commission will give the plan extended consideration and let 
the public, advocacy groups and industry weigh in before making a 
final decision. Supporters would like the FCC to implement the plan 
by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan is a blueprint for a regulatory cease-fire during  
the most important five years in the history of 
telecommunications,'' said John Nakahata, a lawyer with the 
Washington firm Harris, Wiltshire &AMP; Grannis, who arranged 
discussions among the companies over the past five months. 
</P>
<P>
	Before going into private practice, Nakahata was FCC Chairman  
Bill Kennard's chief of staff and served in a number of positions 
at the FCC. 
</P>
<P>
	An FCC spokeswoman said Kennard is encouraged that the industry  
is working together but wants to hear from consumer advocates as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the companies, consumers pay about $1.50 a month to  
cover long-distance companies' use of the local phone network. The 
proposal folds that fee into another charge: the cost of the phone 
line from the local phone company into the home -- now $3.50 a 
month. Known as the Subscriber Line Charge, the combined single fee 
would start at $5.50 a month and increase over five years to as 
much as $7.00. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said their proposal would keep local phone service  
affordable to poor people and customers living in rural and other 
high-cost areas by adding $650 million to a universal service fund. 
It was unclear how carriers would pass on that extra money to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups balked at the proposed changes. They say that  
long-distance companies traditionally do not pass on savings to the 
average user. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office of  
Consumers Union, estimated that the plan would add more than $2 a 
month to consumer phone bills, amounting to more than $2 billion in 
fees a year. ``This is an enormous assault on the consumer 
pocketbook with no assurances of compensating gains,'' Kimmelman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, noticeably absent from the coalition, would not  
comment on why it did not sign on to the plan. The company plans to 
study it, said spokeswoman Stephanie Elrod.

<HEADLINE> Congress Negotiates Final Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House and Senate lawmakers, facing an  
end-of-week deadline and the certainty of a presidential veto, are 
seeking to forge a common version of their similar 10-year, $792 
billion tax cut packages. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee; Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., 
and others planned to meet tonight to try to resolve differences in 
the two bills. The goal is to win final passage of a bill before 
Congress begins its summer recess at week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, however, would not be sent to the White House until  
September, preventing President Clinton from vetoing it while 
Congress is away. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton aides and congressional Democrats kept up their attacks  
on the GOP plans Sunday. They contended the tax cuts were far too 
large and endangered the nation's economic future and that a better 
course would be to forget about any cuts for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be better to do nothing and pay down $100 billion of  
our national debt than to sign a large and irresponsible tax cut 
that would signal to the world that the era of fiscal discipline in 
the United States is over,'' Gene Sperling, chairman of Clinton's 
National Economic Council, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The projected $1 trillion surplus over the next decade that  
Republicans assume in their tax cut plans ``is all imaginary and I 
think we ought to get with the reality that now is the time to pay 
down the debt,'' Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., added. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans insisted that the money is there and that unlike  
Democrats, who would spend it on new government programs, they 
believe it should be returned to the American people. ``We are much 
further apart than the public understands,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, 
R-Texas, said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate moderates who last week unsuccessfully floated a $500  
billion plan that roughly splits the difference between the GOP 
proposal and the $290 billion cut offered by Democrats said they 
still hold out hope for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We actually called our bipartisan tax cut the October plan,  
because we believe that there's the makings here of a grand 
compromise,'' Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said on CBS' ``Face 
the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said  
any such compromise must include a very large tax cut. ``If they 
don't want to start with that, then we will have gridlock on their 
terms; it will be their fault,'' he said on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's do a Medicare compromise first,'' Sperling, also on CNN,  
replied, invoking the White House argument that the future of 
Medicare and Social Security must be secured before any 
consideration of a tax cut. He said even a compromise figure of 
$400 billion would be unacceptably high. 
</P>
<P>
	Another opponent of tax cuts, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn.,  
said that with a continuation of current government spending levels 
and normal emergency spending for such things as droughts, the 
surplus would be closer to $46 billion than $1 trillion after 10 
years. ``And that means the tax cut sends us into a deficit,'' he 
said on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The House-Senate conference is not about the size of the cut --  
both bills are for $792 billion. The main difference is that the 
House would initiate an across-the-board 10 percent tax cut, while 
the Senate would reduce the lowest tax bracket from 15 percent to 
14 percent and, beginning in 2006, include some now in the 28 
percent bracket in the 14 percent bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also some differences in reductions in capital gains  
and estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who voted for the Senate bill after  
leading the effort behind the $500 billion compromise plan, said he 
had told Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., that if the final 
version has the across-the-board cut, ``don't count on me'' to vote 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats and some Republicans say an across-the board approach  
would shift a large percentage of the benefits of the tax package 
to well-off taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved its bill nearly along party lines. In the  
Senate four Democrats, including Torricelli, voted for the GOP 
plan, while two Republicans opposed it.

<HEADLINE> Brooklyn Man Charged in Bank Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An assistant treasurer at the Bank of New York  
has been charged with bank fraud for allegedly embezzling $700,000, 
prosecutors announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sanchez, 31, of Brooklyn was accused in a complaint filed  
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan of illegally transferring 
millions of dollars since January 1998 in a scheme to siphon away 
interest for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White alleged in court papers that Sanchez  
moved the money into an account at one of the bank's subsidiaries 
in the Cayman Islands during weekends to generate interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez has been an assistant treasurer in the Foreign Banks  
Custody Department of the Bank of New York since 1997, supervising 
six administrators, according to a release from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanchez had the authority to open accounts, transfer funds and  
approve check requests and overdrafts for accounts belonging to the 
bank's customers, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint said Sanchez had provided the FBI a written  
confession, conceding that he pocketed interest from the bank 
account for his own personal use. 
</P>
<P>
	It said he used the money to buy a $40,000 sports utility  
vehicle, to open a stock trading account and to provide loans to 
friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Sanchez faces a maximum of 30 years in prison and  
a fine of up to $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Butler Chides Annan on Arms Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Former U.N. weapons chief Richard Butler  
has accused U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan of trying to destroy 
the weapons inspection operation he headed because it was ``too 
independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in the debut issue of Talk magazine, Butler said  
Annan repeatedly confused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
``superficial cooperation'' with U.N. weapons inspectors ``with 
substantive compliance'' on Baghdad's disarmament obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general and his staff reacted to systematic  
cheating by Iraq in destroying and accounting for its banned 
weapons by ``papering over'' problems with diplomacy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk magazine issued a press release with excerpts from the  
interview, to be published Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Monday to comment on Butler's accusations, Annan said: ``I  
don't think I have to comment. Everybody knows what happened. ... 
It's not relevant in the scheme of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two stormy years, Butler left his job as executive  
director of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, when his 
contract expired on June 30. He is now a diplomat-in-residence at 
the Council on Foreign Relations and is writing a book. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Butler said he decided against seeking another  
term because ``the situation within the U.N. had become 
untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, an Australian diplomat, pulled UNSCOM inspectors out of  
Iraq in mid-December on the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes, and 
Baghdad has banned them from returning. The Security Council is 
debating a new Iraq policy that will likely include a successor 
organization to UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iraq possesses the knowledge required to make a sophisticated  
atomic bomb, has long-range missiles and has been hard at work on 
extending their range, (and) possesses the means to make both 
chemical and biological weapons,'' Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described UNSCOM as a ``thorn in the side'' of both Saddam  
and Annan and said the secretary-general wanted the ``destruction'' 
of UNSCOM because it was ``too independent to work within the 
mainstream of the U.N.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNSCOM was created by the Security Council after the 1991  
Persian Gulf War to ensure the elimination of Iraq's nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and the long-range missiles to 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said its tough inspection provisions were weakened, and  
Annan at one point asked him to exclude American inspectors as Iraq 
demanded. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on ABC's Nightline, Butler said Annan had make a  
mistake in seeking diplomatic solutions ``rather than dealing 
substantively, practically with the weapons issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a wonderful person. But I think in professional terms,  
that was a mistake,'' Butler said. ``When you separate process from 
substance in the way that he did, then I think you inevitably have 
failure. And the failure is now in our hands. We've been out of 
Iraq for a year, and Lord knows what Iraq is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Butler denied allegations by former UNSCOM  
inspector Scott Ritter, an American, that the CIA was directing the 
organization's activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter ``misrepresented facts and reconstructed events,  
conversations, and decisions in which he played no part'' and his 
assertions hurt UNSCOM's credibility, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler also said former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov  
told him Moscow was motivated to act as Iraq's ``most aggressive 
advocate'' because it hopes to recoup $7 billion in war debts if 
sanctions against Baghdad are lifted.

<HEADLINE> Manufacturing Sector Grows in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturers reported a slowing of  
growth in July with only modest increases in prices of raw 
materials, easing Wall Street fears of an overheating economy. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey released Monday by the National Association of  
Purchasing Management indicated that the U.S. manufacturing sector 
grew in July for the sixth straight month, but not as strongly as 
in the previous month and below analysts' predictions. Price 
increases also were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures, which suggest that a second-quarter slowing of the  
overall economy's growth is continuing into the third quarter, 
sparked a rally in the stock and bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average, down almost 40 points in early  
trading before the figures came out, reversed course and was up 
about 100 points Monday afternoon. Interest rates, which had shot 
up in the inflation-sensitive market for government bonds before 
the report, quickly returned to Friday's levels on relief over the 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has indicated he is  
poised to raise interest rates for a second time this year on signs 
of a re-emergence of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report put a damper on any plan by the Fed to immediately  
raise interest rates,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn at Wells 
Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Jordan, an analyst with Banc One Investment Advisors,  
noted that the manufacturing figures, which followed last week's 
report that the nation's economic growth slowed to 2.3 percent in 
the second quarter, ``are part of a pattern indicating the economy 
is starting to moderate.'' This, he said, ``will keep the Federal 
Reserve from being too aggressive about interest rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers group, which represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for industry, said its monthly index 
of manufacturing activity registered 53.4 percent in July, compared 
with 57 percent in June. Figures above 50 percent indicate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic analysts had predicted an index reading of 56 in July.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey results are watched closely because they are the  
first national reading for July on U.S. manufacturing performance, 
a key sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Commerce Department reported construction  
spending rebounded slightly in June, rising 0.5 percent, after 
falling for two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual  
rate of $699.4 billion, following drops of 1.4 percent in both May 
and in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said that the purchasing managers' report indicated  
that growth in manufacturing was slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we are seeing some cooling off in the economy,'' said  
Gary Thayer, chief economist with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. in St. 
Louis. ``Manufacturing certainly isn't overheating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thayer said that ``keeping the lid'' on growth was the strength  
of the dollar, which makes U.S. exports less competitive, as well 
as strong import competition. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that production and new orders were up, though the rate  
of growth slowed. The new orders index registered 54.4 percent in 
July, compared with 61.7 percent in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very soft,'' Thayer said. ``It suggests manufacturing  
is likely to be moderate going forward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey's price index, at 54.7 percent in July compared with  
53.5 percent in June, marked the third consecutive month with a 
price reading above 50 percent. Some analysts had expected it to 
exceed 55. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 20 industries represented in the survey indicated  
they were paying higher prices for raw materials during July, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The employment index, meanwhile, fell to 49.6 percent in July  
from 51.9 percent in June. Employment in the manufacturing industry 
has been declining for nearly a year.

<HEADLINE> Defense Health Care Fraud Said Ample </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department may have lost more than  
$1 billion from health care fraud and abuse during the past three 
years, according to a congressional report that criticized the 
Pentagon for lax oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1996 through 1998, companies providing health care services  
for Pentagon employees reported 100 potential fraud cases, a 
fraction of the 50 million claims filed during the three-year 
period, said the report by the General Accounting Office, the 
investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	No precise accounting could be made, but the GAO said more  
accurate estimate of the amount of fraud would be 10 percent to 20 
percent of the $5.7 billion in managed health care claims -- or 
between $570 million and $1.14 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said $14 million in fraudulent payments was  
retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The small amount of recoveries indicates that DoD efforts have  
considerable room for improvement and that DoD's vulnerability to 
fraud and abuse is still high,'' the report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO recommended that the Pentagon require health care  
providers to train their employees to better detect fraudulent 
claims, develop computer software and enforce existing anti-fraud 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	In its response to the report, the Pentagon criticized the GAO's  
estimate of fraud, suggesting it was unfair to suppose abuse is 
being ignored just because few fraud cases were reported compared 
to overall claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Sue Baily, assistant secretary of defense for health  
affairs, said the Pentagon agreed with the GAO's recommendations to 
take steps to improve its implementation of anti-fraud measures. 
But she questioned setting any goal that would assess contractors 
based solely on their ability to crack down on abuse and fraud 
rather than their ability to provide health care services. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not aware of any methodology that would allow us to  
establish such goals without creating perverse incentives,'' Baily 
said in a written response. 
</P>
<P>
	Some contractors the GAO interviewed said they were not  
adequately trained to identify fraud and abuse, and were unclear 
about what potential fraud cases to report to the management of the 
Pentagon health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,  
requested the GAO review of the program, which provides health care 
to about 1.5 million beneficiaries, including dependents of 
active-duty military personnel.

<HEADLINE> Russian Grain Harvest Doing Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian farms will harvest 66 million tons of  
grain this year, according to Ministry of Agriculture estimates 
released Monday, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure is higher than previous estimates. It suggests that a  
drought and locusts in the south, where most of the country's grain 
grows, have not cut into output as severely as originally feared. 
Estimates for 1999 have fluctuated nearly every week, dipping as 
low as 55 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	But Minister of Agriculture and Food Vladimir Shcherbak said  
yields per acre were up about 20 percent compared with last year. 
Fuel shortages brought on by domestic gas price increases are the 
main worry for farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As of Aug. 1, farmers had harvested 19 million tons of grain on  
19.5 million acres, or 18 percent of the country's total planted 
area, Shcherbak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous reports were less optimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, a top grain official, Leonid Chesinsky of the baking  
company Roskhlebprodukt, predicted that Russia's harvest would 
reach only 55 to 60 million tons. He said the government should ask 
for another package of food aid from Western countries to cover the 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	A 53-million ton harvest in 1998 prompted the Russian government  
to accept food aid from the United States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Three more Cuban athletes sought  
asylum in Canada this weekend, bringing to seven the number of 
Cubans to leave the delegation during the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Royal Canadian Mounted Police authorities confirmed Sunday that  
an athlete walked into their downtown office Saturday and said he 
wanted to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	The athlete, whom sources close to the Cuban delegation said was  
a member of men's 4 x 100 relay team, was turned over to 
immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the RCMP nor the sources, speaking to The Associated  
Press on condition of anonymity, would reveal the name of the 
athlete. Track and field concluded Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday, the same sources told the AP a female artistic  
gymnast and a men's soccer goalkeeper sought asylum, as well. The 
two goalies for the soccer team are Rene Castro, who played every 
minute in the games, and Rodney Valdes. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the games began, pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes asked  
for asylum. Reporter Lisette Cepero of Radio Rebelde also has 
sought to defect, as did a softball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Another shooter, whom the Cubans say did not accompany the team  
-- sources say he did, indeed, come to Canada -- disappeared last 
week. The sources said he, too, was seeking to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	This latest episodes came hours after the heads of the 42  
delegations to the games denounced agents they claimed were 
inciting Cuban athletes to defect. They condemned ``the negative 
actions that have affected not only Cuba, but all of the Americas, 
and have interfered with the Olympic movement and the spirit of 
equality and good sportsmanship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last Monday, Cuban President Fidel Castro said: ``We have never  
seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan American Games. We 
are competing in enemy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ramon Fernandez, president of the Cuban Olympic Committee,  
said sports agents have been seen near the athletes village trying 
to contact Cubans and encourage them ``to desert.'' He said these 
agents are plying the athletes with offers of million-dollar 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez also has criticized media coverage of the defections,  
claiming the media had worsened the situation with its reporting.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Review Pesticides for Dangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- EPA Administrator Carol Browner on Monday said  
the agency within 18 months will complete studies and decide 
whether to ban or sharply curtail the use of more than 40 high-risk 
pesticides that may pose a threat to children. 
</P>
<P>
	As an immediate step, Browner announced agreements with  
manufacturers to stop the sale for most uses of one of the 
high-risk pesticides, methyl parathion, and to sharply curtail the 
use of another because of the health risks they pose to infants and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozens of pesticides, including a class of organophosphates  
used for decades on most fruits and vegetables, have been a focus 
of controversy because of concern that the residue levels the 
government deems acceptable pose risks to infants and children who, 
when compared with their weight, eat large amounts of these foods. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowable residue levels for many pesticides were set decades  
ago when the potential health impacts on infants and children were 
not taken into account. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner told a news conference that fruits and vegetables are  
safe and that children and adults alike should not stop eating 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The benefits of a diet that includes fruits and vegetables far  
outweigh the risks of pesticides,'' said Browner. However, she 
said, ``It is becoming increasingly clear that foods can be made 
even safer, especially for children,'' adding that ``today's 
technologies allow our farmers to use safer alternatives and safer 
approaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's intention to end the use of methyl parathion on fruits  
and vegetables and curtail the use of azinphos methyl was reported 
last week. The pesticides are widely used nationwide on such crops 
as apples, peaches, pears, grapes, carrots and certain beans. 
</P>
<P>
	Several environmental groups -- angered by EPA's pace in  
confronting the issue -- said Monday they planned to sue the agency 
Tuesday, accusing it of failing to meet a series of deadlines 
directed by Congress in 1996 to address pesticide dangers to 
children in the food supply. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is ample evidence that infants and children are being  
exposed to unacceptable levels of pesticides,'' said Jacqueline 
Hamilton, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, 
one of the groups filing the lawsuit. ``Yet the government is 
dragging its feet and caving to pressure from the pesticide 
industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browner dismissed the criticism even as she acknowledged that  
the EPA had not met its own deadlines in completing the pesticide 
reviews demanded by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA a year ago said it would complete reviews of the  
riskiest pesticides -- the organophosphate family of chemicals -- 
within 12 months. That deadline would have been Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing with these pesticides ``has proven to be more difficult  
than we thought,'' Browner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics contend the EPA delayed taking action because of  
pressure from agriculture interests. Earlier this year, a number of 
environmentalists quit a pesticide review task force, created at 
the urging of Vice President Al Gore, claiming the agriculture and 
chemical industry participants had taken over the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Browner, nevertheless, said she is determined to push  
aggressively for the reviews and for new scientific studies to 
examine the health effects of pesticides on children. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her schedule will leave the EPA ``ready to take action  
by the end of next year to ensure our children are protected. In 
addition to the organophosphate class of pesticides, the EPA will 
review whether such widely used agricultural pesticides as 
atrazine, aldicarb and carbofuran should be curtailed or taken out 
of use entirely, she said.

<P>
	When Jack Nicklaus explained the ground rules for the making of  
a rivalry, he also disclosed a key component that explains Monday 
night's ``Showdown at Sherwood,'' the made-for-television event 
between the game's top two players. 
</P>
<P>
	``These two guys have been way above everybody else in the past  
few months, in the last year or so,'' Nicklaus said at the Masters. 
``They certainly are the two that you're going to talk about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A major championship rarely goes by without some clamoring for  
Woods and Duval, the only players to hold the No. 1 position in the 
world rankings the past year, to trade shots down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	They have been the most talked about players in the game, a  
rivalry played out more in the imagination than between the ropes, 
driven by the vast differences in their style and background. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is the ruthless robot in wraparound sunglasses, the son of  
a head pro from Jacksonville, Fla., who became the first player in 
25 years to win four times before the Masters. He also owns the 
only Sunday 59 in PGA Tour history. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is a showman, the first Masters champion of color with a  
penchant for shotmaking and a personality that transcends golf. He 
has been part of every rivalry discussion that has cropped up since 
his record victory in the Masters -- Phil Mickleson, two-time U.S. 
Open champion Ernie Els, and even Justin Leonard after he won the 
British Open the same year Woods won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	A new prospect was thrown his way at Carnoustie.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, it's Sergio now?'' Woods said, shaking his head at the  
reference to 19-year-old Sergio Garcia of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Considering the mass of talent in today's game, rivalries are  
rare because of the sheer chance that two players can continually 
emerge in the final round of a major. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to say David and I are the best players in the  
world and that we're going to see each other heading down the 
stretch on Sunday in major championships,'' Woods said. ``It's 
possible, but it's difficult in this sport. It's more difficult now 
because of the competition and depth of field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, any talk about Duval usually involves comparisons to  
Woods, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
	All they need now is to compete each other -- not at Sherwood  
Country Club, but at Medinah for the PGA Championship next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would say that a rivalry is a product of it being written  
about and talked about for a length of time,'' Duval said. ``It's 
hard to make a case for a rivalry when you haven't faced off in an 
event, much less a major. Our event at Sherwood isn't even a 
tournament, so I don't think it can really be considered a fuel for 
a rivalry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That much is true.  
</P>
<P>
	No one really talked about Gene Sarazen and Walter Hagen until  
they began winning all the majors in the 1920s, particularly after 
the Squire beat Hagen on the 38th hole of the 1923 PGA 
Championship. Sam Snead and Ben Hogan didn't become rivals until 
they won five of six Masters from 1949 to 1954 -- the last year 
featured Snead's one-stroke victory over Hogan in an 18-hole 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus and Tom Watson became rivals after the 36-hole duel in  
Turnberry, followed by Watson's chip-in on the 17th to steal the 
U.S. Open from Nicklaus at Pebble Beach in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf hasn't had a good rivalry since.  
</P>
<P>
	The closest has been Nick Faldo and Greg Norman. Faldo dusted  
Norman in the third round of the 1990 British Open, but Norman 
dropped off the map after that until he won his second British Open 
in 1993, holding off a strong charge at Royal St. George. 
</P>
<P>
	Faldo also took advantage of the Shark's greatest collapse,  
winning the 1996 Masters with a 67 to Norman's 78. Still, they 
rarely met any time else, and Norman is linked more to failure and 
bad luck than any one player. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest prospect is Woods and Duval, but the first step  
won't be Monday night. While Nicklaus admits they are the best two 
players in the game, he also unlocked another key component to the 
making of a rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got to be winning majors to compete for that  
rivalry,'' Nicklaus said. ``That's where you guys are going to get 
the excitement from it, and that's where the people are going to 
get the excitement from it.''

	Christian Coalition Charges Tossed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today threw out most of the  
charges in a government lawsuit accusing the Christian Coalition of 
illegally aiding Republican candidates. U.S. District Judge Joyce 
Green rejected arguments by the Federal Election Commission that 
the coalition's contact with campaigns and its distribution of 
voters guide to churches on the Sunday before Election Days should 
be counted as excessive campaign contributions. Green ruled that 
the group must pay a civil penalty to the FEC for advocating the 
election of Rep. Newt Gingrich during the Georgia Republican's 
successful 1994 bid to gain GOP control of the House.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cooler temperatures eased conditions in the  
Midwest and most of the East today, but the nationwide death toll 
from the mid-summer heat wave rose to 197. A cold front that pushed 
across the Midwest during the weekend brought relief to many 
people. Temperatures were in the 70s across most of the Ohio Valley 
into parts of the Northeast. The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office 
reported that the state's heat-related death toll had reached 
eight. Officials in Chicago said they were sure the number of

to mourn the youngest victims of Mark Barton's deadly rampage -- his 
two children. Matthew Barton, 11, and his sister, Mychelle, 7, were 
bludgeoned by their father on Wednesday, the day after Barton, 
apparently distraught over large losses in the stock market, killed 
his wife. Barton the next day killed nine people in a shooting 
spree at two Atlanta brokerages before killing himself. The 
children's mother and maternal grandmother were hacked to death in 
Alabama in 1993, and police said Barton was a suspect but never 
charged.

site fell to 71 percent in the second quarter, down from 74 percent 
in the first quarter, according to Greenfield Online, an Internet

<HEADLINE> House Finishing $12.6B Aid Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many House Democrats are supporting a $12.6  
billion foreign aid bill in hopes that spending can be increased 
and anti-abortion language deleted to avoid a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate already has approved a similar measure but without  
the one amendment sure to bring a veto: a ban on any U.S. funding 
for groups working to liberalize abortion laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The House scheduled final debate on its version of the bill  
Monday. Several Democrats on the Appropriations' foreign operations 
subcommittee said they would support it if can be modified before 
it goes to President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual move, lawmakers last week approved a parallel  
provision that is more palatable to family planning groups that 
view the abortion language as a prohibition on free speech and an 
effort to stop family planning, not just abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The second amendment, approved 221-208, reflects the contention  
that family planning prevents abortions. It would require that 
groups receiving aid certify only that they work to reduce the 
number of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	The original amendment, a version of which has doomed several  
foreign affairs bills in the past five years, passed 228-220. It 
would ban aid to any group lobbying for changes in abortion laws 
even if the group uses privately raised funds. Family planning 
groups hope that language can be removed during the House-Senate 
conference committee that will shape the final bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the legislation's cuts of $1.9 billion  
from Clinton's requests would harm a wide range of foreign policy 
efforts, hurting the poorest countries and diminishing the ability 
to respond to foreign crises, to prevent nuclear smuggling, to deal 
with the Asian crisis, to expand the Peace Corps and to help 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's funding is $715 million below that of last year's  
bill and $20.7 billion below this year's actual spending on foreign 
assistance, including emergency appropriations. 
</P>
<P>
	A Clinton administration statement said senior advisers would  
recommend a veto if foreign operations funding is not increased. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding at this level would seriously impair the president's  
ability to conduct an effective foreign policy,'' the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said the bill would cut funding to international lending  
institutions by $493 million from amounts needed to meet U.S. 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major provisions of the foreign operations bill include:  
</P>
<P>
	--$2.88 billion for Israel, representing a $120 million reduction  
in economic and a $60 million increase in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$2 billion for Egypt, a $40 million reduction in economic aid  
but no change in military aid. 
</P>
<P>
	--$725 million for former Soviet states, $307 million below  
Clinton's request. It would withhold 50 percent of aid to Russia 
unless it ends missile cooperation with Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	--$680 million for child survival programs.  
</P>
<P>
	Among hotly contested provisions, the bill includes the first  
cut in funding for a military school in Fort Benning, Ga., which 
has been criticized for human rights abuses committed in Latin 
American by some of its graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2606.

<HEADLINE> Montgomery Ward Attempts Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Venerable retailer Montgomery Ward emerged Monday  
from bankruptcy protection, hoping a new store format will help it 
succeed in a crowded retail marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The closely-held retailer, the nation's ninth-largest department  
store chain, is relying on a remodeled format for 43 of its 252 
full-line stores to bring in price-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives say sales have increased sharply at stores  
that have been converted to the new format, which includes more 
trendy clothes, home furnishings and electronics in easy-to-see 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the 127-year-old retailer has narrowed its losses, it  
continues to bleed red ink. The Chicago-based company lost $971 
million dollars in 1998 on sales of $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail analysts also remain skeptical about the company's  
chances for survival. They note powerhouses such as Sears, Roebuck 
and Co. and J.C. Penney presently are struggling to find their 
place with consumers who either shop at higher-end stores such as 
Bloomingdale's or discounters such as Wal-Mart and Target. 
</P>
<P>
	Wards in 1997 sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization  
protection and has since moved to slash costs by closing more than 
100 money-losing stores and selling off much of the real estate at 
its sprawling corporate campus here. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of its reorganization, the company sold its  
Signature Group direct marketing unit to GE Capital Inc. -- its 
largest creditor -- for more than $650 million. That subsidiary had 
been the company's only profitable enterprise. GE Capital also owns 
Wards' credit card operations.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Moves Ahead of Bush in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Former Sen. Bill Bradley is gaining on  
Democratic front-runner Al Gore in head-to-head polling in New York 
and actually outdoes the vice president when matched against 
Republican George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	In a potential Democratic primary matchup, Vice President Gore  
led Bradley, 47 percent to 38 percent, in the latest survey by the 
Quinnipiac College Polling Institute. That's just half the margin 
of the institute's poll released in early July, 52 percent to 34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	As for a possible November contest, Bradley led Bush, 46 percent  
to 39 percent, in the poll released Monday, up from a statistical 
dead heat in the earlier survey that had Bush at 44 percent and 
Bradley at 43 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll had Gore at 45 percent to Bush's 43 percent. In  
early July, Bush was favored by 45 percent of voters while Gore was 
the choice of 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has strong ties to New York. In addition to having  
represented neighboring New Jersey in the Senate, he was a star on 
the New York Knicks basketball team before entering politics. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore was stronger than Bradley among Democrats in the  
survey, Bradley pulled more support from Republican voters, 15 
percent vs. 9 percent, and independents, 50 percent vs. 40 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,241 registered voters was conducted July  
20-27 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get a good start in New York and we think  
we're doing that,'' Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said after the 
new poll came out. ``The shrinking gap (between Gore and Bradley) 
is a reflection of our ability to compete pretty hard in New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``The bottom line is  
the V.P. is leading among Democrats in New York. We have a long 
campaign ahead of us and we're going to have a lot of these 
snapshots where numbers will be up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College  
institute, noted that Gore remained basically in a tie with Bush 
among New York voters ``and that's not a good place for a 
Democratic presidential candidate to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, where Democrats outnumber Republicans by a 5-3 margin,  
is considered a must-win state for Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's approval rating among New York voters  
remains high, at 67 percent, and his wife is eyeing a run for the 
Senate seat from New York being vacated next year by fellow 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The Clintons are both backing 
Gore's candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	While Gore is also backed by most of the state's top elected  
Democratic officials, there have been signs of Bradley inroads. 
Gore advisers in the state have said they expect Moynihan to back 
Bradley, and David Alpert, the influential Democratic chairman in 
suburban Westchester County, recently called Gore a ``stuffed 
shirt'' and said Bradley was ``more electable.''

<HEADLINE> Virginia Shipyard Strike Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Workers began returning to their jobs  
Monday after a four-month strike at the shipyard that is the 
nation's only builder of aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first workers filed through the gates at Newport News  
Shipbuilding at 7 a.m. and others will follow over the next four 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be coming back in waves,'' said Arnold  
Outlaw, president of Steelworkers Local 8888, which conducted the 
strike that began April 5 and ended with a contract ratification 
vote Friday. The union represents 9,200 production and maintenance 
workers, about half the work force for the shipyard. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shipyard gave workers return dates based on their  
qualifications and seniority. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hatfield, a company spokesman, said some workers have to be  
retrained and others need updated physicals before they can resume 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contract provides a pay raise averaging $3.10 an hour  
over 58 months and improves the pension plan for workers who retire 
at 62 with at least 30 years experience.

<HEADLINE> Baseball's Trade Deadline Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Oakland Athletics and New York Mets were busy. Chuck Finley  
and Andy Pettitte stayed put. And the Cleveland Indians once again 
entered baseball's stretch run without an ace pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's baseball trade deadline, which passed Saturday at  
midnight EDT, was most notable for the trades that didn't happen. 
Without a true No. 1 pitcher on the trade market, many teams 
decided they were better off standing pat than paying a hefty price 
for an also-ran pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the right guy was out there for us, we would have done  
something, believe me,'' Cleveland GM John Hart said. ``We kept 
looking for that top line pitcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no Randy Johnson available this July 31, or even a  
Curt Schilling or David Wells. And the price for Chuck Finley, 
perhaps the top starter on the market despite a 5-10 record and 
5.76 ERA, was too high for Cleveland to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will say that in some of the deals we have made the last  
couple of years, other clubs have gotten some good talent, but we 
look for the best players to be coming back our way in any deal,'' 
Hart said. ``Quite frankly, Finley's high ERA and lack of success 
this season were a concern to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland ended up doing nothing to bolster a pitching staff  
that is seventh-best in the AL. Despite efforts by Indians GM John 
Hart, Cleveland enters the stretch run without a starter whose ERA 
is under 4.00. 
</P>
<P>
	That pitcher wasn't out there. Kansas City's Kevin Appier, who  
went to Oakland, and Baltimore's Juan Guzman, who went to 
Cincinnati, were the top starters to change teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's completed an overhaul of their pitching staff, getting  
Appier and sending closer Billy Taylor to the Mets for pitchers 
Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael. 
</P>
<P>
	Those two deals came after trades that sent ace Kenny Rogers to  
the Mets and brought in starter Omar Olivares and infielder Randy 
Velarde from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We weren't supposed to be here in July,'' A's general manager  
Billy Beane said. ``Now we're trying to make our mark in this 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets were the busiest team. Besides acquiring Taylor from  
Oakland, they got outfielder Darryl Hamilton and left-hander Chuck 
McElroy from Colorado and infielder Shawon Dunston from St. Louis 
for outfielder Brian McRae and three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for it,'' GM Steve Phillips said. ``Now's the  
time. You don't know how many times the opportunity will present 
itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees reacquired postseason hero Jim Leyritz from the San  
Diego Padres for a minor league pitcher. But they didn't deal 
Pettitte, who has struggled for most of the past year and drawn ire 
from owner George Steinbrenner for not being aggressive on the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies were hoping to add Pettitte to their pitching  
staff. But the Yankees apparently cooled at the idea late Saturday 
when they couldn't acquire Tampa Bay reliever Roberto Hernandez 
despite talks into the final hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays, who also couldn't deal Rolando Arrojo or Fred  
McGriff, insisted on top prospect Alfonso Soriano being included in 
any deal with New York. Tampa Bay has made only three deals in more 
than 20 months since the expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Trades still can be made, but players must first pass through  
waivers. That means any club can step in and block a potential 
deal. Teams might be a bit more wary to block a deal this year 
after watching San Diego get stuck with Randy Myers' hefty 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Three division leaders -- Cleveland, Texas and Houston -- made no  
moves heading into the deadline. That's not always a bad thing. 
Last year's pennant winners, the Yankees and Padres, both stood pat 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta Braves, beset by injuries, did make a last-minute  
deal, acquiring left-hander Terry Mulholland and infielder Jose 
Hernandez from the Cubs for three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, facing their first pennant race in six years,  
learned last week that they lost catcher Javy Lopez and starter 
Odalis Perez for the season. That comes on top of earlier injuries 
to first baseman Andres Galarraga and closer Kerry Ligtenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose offensive production like we have with Galarraga  
and Lopez, it's hurtful,'' GM John Schuerholz said. ``I don't mean 
to suggest that Hernandez will replace that. But it will give us 
another weapon offensively.''

<P>
	WESTPORT, Conn. (AP) -- The percentage of Internet users making a  
purchase online decreased slightly in the second quarter, the first 
drop in a year, according to a survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of people with online access who said they  
purchased something from a Web site fell to 71 percent in the 
second quarter, down from 74 percent in the first quarter, 
according to Greenfield Online, a Westport, Conn.-based Internet 
marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline followed four straight quarters of increases in  
online purchasing, according to Greenfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield said the decline could be attributed to there being  
no specific reason to shop. The 90-day period covered by the March 
tracking study included post-Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Online auctions, however, were an exception, rising from 40 to  
43 percent from March to May, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey found a growing percentage of online consumers are  
making multiple purchases and 95 percent said they plan to buy the 
same amount or even more online in the future. And for the first 
time, CDs outranked books as the top online purchase, followed by 
computer software, computer hardware and airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenfield findings were based on 2,598 respondents selected  
randomly from a pool of more than a million individuals who have 
agreed to participate in online research. Greenfield said the 
respondents are likely to be more experienced than typical Internet 
users, though all levels of users are represented in the survey. 
Greenfield says the findings were weighted to represent the total 
Internet population in terms of age, gender and region.

<HEADLINE> Botha Eschews 'White Hope' Label </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Francois Botha has shed the extra weight -- and  
the cockiness -- that cost him a victory over Mike Tyson. Now he's 
trying to rid himself of the same label shared by many white 
fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only real white heavyweight out there that can do it  
and win the title,'' Botha said Monday after a workout. ``I'm more 
than just a great white hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha is the latest of the recent white heavyweights, a group  
that has included Gerry Cooney, Tommy Morrison and most recently 
Peter McNeeley, hyped to take over the prized boxing division. He 
couldn't take advantage of a prime opportunity when he was knocked 
out by Tyson in January, but Botha has another chance to move into 
the upper echelon when he faces Shannon Briggs on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs and Botha (39-2, 24 knockouts) will fight in Trump Taj  
Mahal at Atlantic City, N.J. The winner may get a shot at Tyson, or 
a second chance in Botha's case. The loser probably won't be 
mentioned in the same sentence as the word heavyweight champion 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs (31-2, 25 knockouts) is a Brooklyn, N.Y. native who was  
hyped as the next great heavyweight before losing to unheralded 
Darroll Wilson in 1996. He rebounded to win a decision over George 
Foreman in 1997 before being stopped in the fifth round by WBC 
champion Lennox Lewis in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha is from South Africa and actually held the IBF heavyweight  
title for a month after defeating Axel Schulz. He had his title 
taken away after he tested positive for steroids. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's never faced a guy like me,'' Briggs said. ``I'm not Mike  
Tyson looking for one punch. I'm faster and my footwork is better. 
He'll be lucky if he makes the third round. He'll be really lucky 
if he sees the sixth round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Briggs did run into Botha a couple of times in Big Bear, Calif.,  
where they both trained last month, and Briggs couldn't believe the 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him fishing one day and then I was running another time  
and I heard someone yell, `Hey Shannon' and waving to me and I 
couldn't believe it. What's wrong with this guy? Doesn't he know 
I'm training to kill him?'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Briggs can trash talk with the best of the fighters, Botha  
has taken a new approach after squandering a possible victory over 
Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to stay focused, not like I did against Tyson,''  
Botha said. ``I was seeing the victory and I blew it. I'm in better 
shape than I was back then. I lost a lot of body fat and am all 
solid muscle now.''

<HEADLINE> Purdue's Tiffany Young Dies in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARY, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue women's basketball player Tiffany Young  
was killed when her car was hit by a drunken driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-year-old guard, a member of Purdue's 1999 NCAA national  
championship team, would have been a senior for the Boilermakers 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Young was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident Saturday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Purdue women's basketball family is shocked and deeply  
saddened by this tragedy,'' coach Kristy Curry said Sunday night. 
``Words cannot express how dearly we will miss Tiffany. She was 
more than special and she stood for everything that was right in 
this world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young was with her boyfriend, also a Purdue student, who was  
visiting his family in Gary, the university said. Young was 
apparently returning to West Lafayette with her boyfriend and an 
unidentified third passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's boyfriend and the third passenger remained hospitalized  
late Sunday, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of the vehicle that hit Young's car had a  
blood-alcohol content of .30 and was taken into custody by Gary 
Police, the school said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Police would not release any further information about the  
accident or any charges pending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiffany, from day one, was the epitome of a Purdue  
student-athlete,'' Purdue athletic director Morgan Burke said. 
``She was bright, articulate, compassionate and competitive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 Young averaged 3.3 points and 1.5 rebounds in her  
three-year career and started all 33 games during the 1997-98 
season. Her career highs were 16 points and seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	A physical therapy major, Young was named Academic All-Big Ten  
last season. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a native of Hillsboro, Ala., and was a standout at East  
Lawrence High School.

<HEADLINE> Drug Test Takes Away Canada Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Steve Vezina broke no laws, his agent  
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	But the professional hockey player has broken a few hearts and  
tarnished the host country at the 13th Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina, whose urine sample revealed two stimulants and an  
enormous quantity of anabolic steroid, cost Canada the gold medal 
in roller hockey. The United States, which fell to the Canadians 
7-6 in the final, was awarded the title Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He feels sorry for his teammates, his coach and his country,  
but he didn't take any illegal substance, law-wise,'' agent Paul 
Hamel told The Canadian Press. 
</P>
<P>
	A urine sample showed unacceptable levels of both  
pseudo-ephedrine and ephedrine, contained in over-the-counter 
decongestants such as Sudafed that professional hockey players 
often use as stimulants. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a massive amount of Nandrolone, a steroid that  
builds muscles and increases strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said at his drug test that he had taken Sudafed prior to  
competition. He will be subject to an automatic four-year ban, but 
that would not appear to affect his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the only mistake he did was not being aware Sudafed was  
not legal for the Pan Am Games,'' Hamel said. ``Keep in mind Steve 
is a professional hockey player and not used to competing with the 
amateurs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Broadcasting Company reported that Juana Rosario,  
the winner of the women's high jump, tested positive for illegal 
substances. The CBC said her A sample came out positive and now her 
B-sample must be tested. If it comes back positive as well, she 
would be stripped of her medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vazquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said professional athletes must adhere to the games' 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't say he did it because he was a professional,'' Rana  
said. ``He was foolish and he made a mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The level of steroids in the drug test stunned Canadian  
officials, erasing any thoughts of an appeal in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very large amount,'' said Andrew Pipe, chair of the  
Canadian Centre for Ethics and Sport. ``It is probably the largest 
level that I have ever seen reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Olympic Association officials now must reclaim the gold  
medals from the 10 members of the roller hockey team. Argentina 
gets the silver and Brazil the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina, 23, is a distant relative of Georges Vezina, the Hall of  
Fame goaltender after whom the Vezina Trophy is named. In the last 
six years he's been a hockey vagabond, playing for 12 teams in 
eight leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	He now plays ice hockey for the Utah Grizzlies of the  
International Hockey League and roller hockey for the Buffalo Wings 
of Roller Hockey International. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a big shock ... Steve is not an abuser of anabolic  
steroids,'' said Lou Franceschetti, his coach with the Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have a chance to gather all of the facts and speak to  
everyone involved, Steve Vezina is scheduled to be in goal Friday 
against Dallas,'' Wings vice president of operations Benny Gulakiw 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode is a body blow for in-line hockey, which hoped to  
use its Pan Am debut as a springboard to the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unfortunate that due to the actions and poor judgment on  
the part of one player the entire team must suffer the 
consequences,'' said Maxine McKenzie, Canada's team leader for 
roller sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Burfoot, a member of the Canadian team, was stunned by the  
news, which he got by telephone from his sobbing wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I've been kicked in the stomach,'' he said when  
reached in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he was conducting a hockey 
clinic. Burfoot said giving up the gold medal will be ``the hardest 
thing I'll probably ever have to do.''

<HEADLINE> Fittipaldi Knocked Out in Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Ill. (AP) -- Christian Fittipaldi, fourth in the CART  
season point standings, was knocked unconscious Monday during a 
test session at Gateway International Raceway and was to be 
hospitalized overnight for tests and observation. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Brazilian hit the wall in turn one on the  
1.27-mile oval and was unconscious for between five and 10 minutes, 
according to witnesses. He regained consciousness while being 
transported to a local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi, the nephew of former CART FedEx Series and Formula  
One star Emerson Fittipaldi, was then airlifted to St. Louis 
University Hospital and admitted to the neurological intensive care 
unit for testing and observation. He was to remain hospitalized at 
least overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	According to CART rules, a driver who is knocked unconscious  
cannot compete for a minimum of seven days, effectively keeping him 
out of Sunday's Tenneco Automotive Grand Prix of Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed seven races in 1997 after breaking his leg in a crash  
during a race in Australia, then missed the Milwaukee race in 1998 
after suffering a concussion in a crash during the opening 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing Sunday's race could prove more expensive, since  
Fittipaldi is in the midst of the best season of his five-year CART 
career. He won his first pole at Rio de Janeiro in May and earned 
his first CART victory on July 11 in Elkhart Lake, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	He is 28 points behind leader Juan Montoya and is six behind  
Newman-Haas Racing teammate Michael Andretti, who is third.

	``Here and Now'' (Tone-Cool) -- Rod Piazza and The Mighty Flyers  

</P>
<P>
	Harmonica ace Rod Piazza and his longtime Mighty Flyers band  
dish up a hearty serving of jump blues on ``Here and Now,'' second 
disc for Tone-Cool Records and follow-up to a very successful 1998. 
Piazza won a W.C. Handy Award and the Mighty Flyers won the BAM 
California Music Award for outstanding blues band. Piazza has been 
blowing the blues since 1965 and playing with wife/pianist Honey 
Piazza since the early 1970s. Piazza waxes as tender as a bluesman 
can toward his beloved on ``Brought Together by the Blues.'' The 
style throughout is California swing married with traditional 
electric blues. Guitarist Rick ``L.A. Holmes'' Holmstrom powers the 
quintet.

	``Lone-Star Shootout'' (Alligator Records) -- Lonnie Brooks, Long  
John Hunter and Phillip Walker 

</P>
<P>
	One can only imagine the recording session for ``Lone-Star  
Shootout,'' featuring Gulf Coast blues veterans Lonnie Brooks, Long 
John Hunter and Phillip Walker. They probably picked up their 
guitars and didn't quit playing until the tape ran out, if then. 
All hail from Louisiana or Texas and an era in the 1950s and 1960s 
when playing loud, long and with style were the only ways to get a 
gig in the refinery and shipyard bars. This is a good-time record 
with plenty of hot playing and soul.

	``Running With Scissors'' (Volcano) -- ``Weird Al'' Yankovic  

</P>
<P>
	Twenty years after spoofing ``My Sharona'' with ``My Bologna,''  
``Weird Al'' Yankovic is still getting laughs with novelty songs. 
Funny how they're sometimes more entertaining than the originals. 
</P>
<P>
	I'll take ``Pretty Fly for a Rabbi'' any day over The  
Offspring's ``Pretty Fly (For a White Guy).'' Sample refrain: ``How 
ya doin' Bernie? Oy vey, oy vey!'' Now that's chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
	And Yankovic continues to mine yucks at the expense of the  
overweight (remember ``Fat''?), this time remaking ``Zoot Suit 
Riot'' into ``Grapefruit Diet.'' Also inspired is ``Jerry 
Springer,'' a dead-on parody of ``One Week'' by the Barenaked 
Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, a little of this goes a long way and the original  
songs on ``Running With Scissors,'' Yankovic's 10th album, aren't 
nearly as clever. But his polka medley (sampling Marilyn Manson AND 
Hanson, among others) is first-rate kitsch.

<HEADLINE> Webb Sets Sight on Even Bigger Game  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRIDDIS, Alberta (AP) -- When she was 16, Karrie Webb won a  
junior tournament in Australia that earned her a trip to Florida. 
She spent a week there with Greg Norman learning what it takes to 
be a professional golfer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know I was going to be sitting here eight years  
later,'' Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, Webb was floating in  
the clouds Sunday after winning the du Maurier Classic for her 
first major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Already No. 1 in the women's rankings, Webb managed to reclaim  
some of the spotlight from double-major winner Juli Inkster. The du 
Maurier was Webb's sixth victory of the year and the 15th of an 
LPGA Tour career that began just 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in her victory count is the Women's British Open,  
which Webb won in 1995 and which could be the next LPGA major if 
anti-tobacco legislation forces du Maurier to drop its sponsorship. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a special talent, and we're lucky to have her on tour,''  
Dawn Coe-Jones said. ``This is her first major, and I think it is 
going to be the first of many.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few can argue that point.  
</P>
<P>
	Webb has emerged as the dominant force in women's golf, and  
Sunday was only a sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	Five strokes behind Laura Davies when the final round began at  
Priddis Greens Golf and Country Club, Webb got within three strokes 
of the lead with six holes to play, then treated the Canadian 
gallery to a breathless display of irons and clutch putting. 
</P>
<P>
	She saved par from 20 feet on No. 13 to stay in the hunt, only  
three strokes behind. She birdied the next three holes, no putt 
longer than 8 feet. And needing a birdie on the par-5 18th to have 
a chance, she stroked a 5-wood that landed 15 feet behind the hole 
in the rough, setting up a 5-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the best player on tour this year,'' said Davies, who  
three-putted the last two greens and finished two strokes back. 
``She proved it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Webb has been proving it from the minute she joined the tour.  
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, she won her second event and became the first  
player to surpass $1 million on the LPGA Tour. Webb has won at 
least twice in all four of her seasons, and her du Maurier victory 
enabled her to set the earnings record of $1,254,051 with three 
months left in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	And she's only 24.  
</P>
<P>
	Annika Sorenstam, who skipped the final major of the year to  
rest, has won 17 times -- including two U.S. Opens -- since joining 
the LPGA Tour in 1994. Webb figures to pass that mark, perhaps even 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	She still doesn't compare to Nancy Lopez, who won nine times as  
a rookie in 1978 and had 23 victories after her fourth full season. 
But given the depth in women's golf, it is tantalizing to imagine 
what the future holds. 
</P>
<P>
	Her swing hasn't changed, but her confidence has grown without  
any signs Webb is satisfied with her success. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorenstam and Se Ri Pak last year have always won their  
tournaments in batches. Webb had at least a share of the lead in 10 
of her first 11 rounds this year. She has finished out of the top 
eight only once this year, when she missed the cut in the LPGA 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow, I find something every week to put me into  
contention,'' Webb said. ``I don't really have an answer except 
that I work hard, and confidence is a big thing, too. I really 
believe in myself, and I know what my ability is. I'm not happy 
with anything less than the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That attitude is what has driven Norman to the most consistent,  
successful golf since the days of Jack Nicklaus -- a victory 
somewhere in the world every year but one since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman saw it coming. He remembers when Webb came to visit in  
1991, how she outworked the teen-aged boy who also spent a week in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karrie was right there the whole way,'' Norman once recalled.  
``It was obvious she had the game and the mental toughness to 
succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Miller, whose career was like a comet, once said he got  
to the top of the mountain and wondered what was next. Nicklaus 
reached the top and looked for the next mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Where does that leave Webb?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even halfway up the mountain yet,'' Webb said. ``I've  
got a long way to go. For things to have happened so quickly, 
obviously it's hard to set goals. But I love being in the position 
I'm in. I love playing good golf, and I love having a chance to 
win. That's all I need to drive me.''

<HEADLINE> Nani Rose Wins Saratoga Feature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Nani Rose, trained by Patrick  
Byrne, registered a half-length victory over Perfect Sting, owned 
by Frank Stronach, in Saratoga's Monday feature, the $112,800, 
Grade III Lake George Stakes for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Intrigued, finished third in the field of eight, three-quarters  
of a length further back. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrne and Stronach are waging a battle in court over $384,000  
which the trainer claims is owed him in back pay dating to their 
association in 1997. Stronach claims that Byrne misinterpreted 
their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Nani Rose's frontrunning victory was decisive as she drew away  
early in the final straight and held on gamely in the final yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Nani Rose remained undefeated on turf in three starts covering 1  
1/16 miles in 1:40 to earn $67,680 for Stonerside Stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner returned $5.10, $3.20 and $2.80 as the favorite.  
Perfect Sting paid $3.40 and $2.60 and Intrigued was $3.80 to show.

<HEADLINE>  Andre Reed, Bills Work Out Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Andre Reed, Buffalo's leading career  
receiver and one of its few remaining links to the Bills' four 
straight Super Bowl appearances, added another team record: 
shortest holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who threatened to quit if the Bills refused to renegotiate  
his contract, practiced for the first time Monday after working out 
a contract extension with team owner Ralph Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted to play football,'' said Reed, 35. ``That's  
what I was born to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who missed two minicamps as well as the first two days of  
training camp at Fredonia State, was uncharacteristically jovial 
after starting his 15th season in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a nice talk with Mr. Wilson about a week and a half ago,  
and we talked about a lot of things,'' Reed said. ``And he agreed 
with me about a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing they agreed upon was more money for Reed, who this  
season will make $2.2 million, or $900,000 more than his contract 
was due to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted was to be treated fairly,'' Reed said. ``I just  
wanted to be paid. That's all you deserve. Fortunately we got 
something accomplished, and I'm here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal sweetened the pot considerably for Reed, who got a  
$1.8 million signing bonus and a three-year pact that includes a 
one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born to wear a red, white and blue helmet, and when Mr.  
Wilson heard that he said `OK, OK,''' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed showed up for the morning practice, having joined the Bills  
for their team meeting on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The third leading receiver on the NFL's career list behind Jerry  
Rice and Art Monk, Reed is one of only three Buffalo players -- 
along with Bruce Smith and Thurman Thomas -- still around from the 
team's four straight Super Bowl losses of the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates cheered as Reed took the field. He hugged Smith,  
stretched and pulled on his pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit behind, which is funny,'' quarterback Doug  
Flutie said. ``He's got to catch up to some of the young guys, 
actually. But every time he runs a route he's open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After chatting with Eric Moulds, the team's leading receiver  
last year who credits Reed with helping him, Reed caught a pass in 
front of No. 1 draft pick Antoine Winfield and spun away from 
defensive back Donovan Greer. 
</P>
<P>
	One teammate sang a mock hymn in praise as Reed faced the press.  
</P>
<P>
	Reed joked with a television reporter: ``You said I was speeding  
down the highway and that's not right,'' Reed said. ``I was going 
the speed limit. No cops, man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Reed's agent had all of Buffalo wondering if his  
client would follow Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek, who announced 
last week that he would retire after next season. However, Reed 
wouldn't have waited a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but I was contemplating not coming back,''  
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 889 receptions, including 63 last year, Reed needs just 51  
catches to pass Monk as the second-leading receiver in NFL history. 
Rice is first with 1,139. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that was a milestone that was attainable this year,''  
Reed said. ``That would be a great thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, not always the most approachable of the Bills, relapsed  
into sarcasm when someone asked him if had a timetable for 
retirement. ``Do you? When are you going to retire, in about 20 
years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got serious. ``No, there's no such thing as a  
timetable,'' Reed said. ``I'm just going to see how it goes this 
year, how I feel at the end of the season. If I can stay healthy, 
I'll play again.''

<HEADLINE> Nate Newton Inches Closer to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Nate Newton's bid to extend his NFL  
career inched forward Monday when the Carolina Panthers decided he 
was fit enough to join his teammates for full-squad workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	While his teammates spent the first three days of training camp  
running plays and going through group drills, Newton was secluded 
in a different part of the complex for private workouts with 
strength and conditioning coach Jerry Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was to build up the 13-year NFL veteran's endurance and  
flexibility so he could compete for a spot on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he was cleared for team drills Monday, Newton still  
took it slow, participating in only selected drills for brief 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfitted in full pads for the first time, the 6-foot-3 Newton  
looked larger than his listed weight of 348 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went through a few drills. I didn't do much, but it  
still felt good,'' Newton said. ``I'm trying to get used to the 
pads and try to get back and do a little bit of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, 37, was signed to a one-year, $420,000 deal by the  
Panthers in June after he was deemed expendable by the Dallas 
Cowboys, for whom he played 13 seasons and made six Pro Bowl 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina coach George Seifert said there is no timetable for  
bringing along Newton, who will try to unseat Anthony Redmon as the 
Panthers' starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we're looking to move him into the starting  
spot. I think Redmon's doing a good job, and we'll just see how the 
competition does go there,'' Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	To challenge for a roster spot and then for a starting job,  
Newton first wants to get down to 335 pounds. He said he is pleased 
with his progress and is closing in on that figure, but would not 
divulge his exact weight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing fabulous. I'm the type of guy that once I hit it,  
I'm all about getting it going,'' he said. ``I'm close. That's all 
you need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton laughed when asked to compare the food at the Cowboys'  
camp to the Panthers' training table cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't stack up because I ain't been on it yet,'' he said.  
``I'm a fruit and potatoes guy, a fruit and salad guy.''

	Grain and soybean futures rocketed higher Monday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade in the absence of stress-relieving rainfall in major 
growing regions, with the dry spell threatening to reduce crop 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures moved sharply higher.  
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices continued their sharp gains made during  
last week's late rally even as temperatures in Midwest growing 
regions fell back to more-tolerable readings in the lower 80s from 
highs in the 90s and 100s late last week. 
</P>
<P>
	While the threat of heat stress no longer appears to be in the  
picture, vulnerable corn and soybean crops could suffer from a lack 
of rainfall. Forecasters currently say there is no chance for 
appreciable rainfall in the next week, which could affect crops 
that are seeing dangerously low moisture levels. 
</P>
<P>
	A lack of heavy rainfall in recent weeks has caused alarm bells  
to go off across farming regions. Parts of Maryland, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Virginia were declared drought 
disaster areas by U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, with 
some farmers reporting their expected average yields had been 
reduced by half. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields in Illinois and Iowa, the two largest corn and soybean  
growing states, were expected to fare better, but dryness also 
persisted in those regions after farmers saw less rainfall that had 
been forecast. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures investors were expected to closely examine the USDA's  
latest crop development update, which could provide a more reliable 
indication of final production numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency reported after trading had ended that soybeans  
nationwide in good to excellent condition tumbled to 57 percent 
from 65 percent a week earlier. In Illinois, conditions plunged to 
53 percent from 62 percent, while they fell to 43 percent from 58 
percent in Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn crops fared better nationwide, with the good-to-excellent  
condition falling to 63 percent from 70 percent. But corn crop 
conditions in Illinois and Indiana also fell sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the National Weather Service's latest 10-day forecast,  
released after trading ended, reported key growing areas will 
receive normal temperatures and above-normal rainfall. That could 
pressure prices when trading resumes Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery rose 19 cents to $2.98 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn rose the limit 12 cents to $2.26 1/2 a bushel; December 
oats jumped 6 1/2 cents to $1.18 1/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose the 
limit 30 cents to $4.63 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures jumped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid  
market talk the USDA was set to announce details of donated pork to 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The American donations to the economically challenged country  
could help reduce a persistent pork glut, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also rose on the rally in grain futures, which could lead  
to higher feed costs and force pork producers to eliminate more of 
their herds. 
</P>
<P>
	October lean hogs rose 2 cents to 45.35 cents a pound; August  
pork bellies rose the limit 3 cents to 55.12 cents a pound.

	Clinton Backs Wife's Candor  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today endorsed first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton's candor about his infidelities. In an 
interview with Talk magazine, she called her husband's adultery the 
product of emotional scars -- ``abuse,'' she termed it -- left by his 
mother and grandmother when he was 4 years old. Speaking of 
Clinton, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said: ``He told me from 
the reports he's gotten that it's a generally favorable article 
about the first lady, that he's comfortable with the views 
expressed in the article and the fact that she did the interview.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today threw out most of the  
charges in a government lawsuit accusing the Christian Coalition of 
illegally aiding GOP candidates. U.S. District Judge Joyce Green 
rejected arguments by the Federal Election Commission that the 
coalition's contact with campaigns and its distribution of voter 
guides to churches on the Sunday before Election Days were 
excessive campaign contributions.

	Heat Breaks, Deaths Rise  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Cooler temperatures prevailed in the Midwest and  
most of the East today, as the national death toll from the 
mid-summer heat wave rose to 197. A cold front pushed across the 
Midwest during the weekend bringing relief to many people. 
Temperatures were in the 70s across most of the Ohio Valley into 
parts of the Northeast. The Oklahoma Medical Examiner's Office 
reported that the state's heat-related death toll had reached 
eight.

	GAUHATI, India (AP) -- Two high-speed trains collided in a remote  
section of eastern India near the border with Bangladesh, killing 
190 people and injuring 310. Railway officials said the toll was 
likely to climb to 250, and news agencies said it could reach 400 
or more. The impact flipped coaches on top of each other and hurled 
sleeping passengers though flaming compartments. Rail officials 
blamed a signal failure.

	Good Cholesterol Gene Found  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Scientists have identified a gene that regulates  
the body's level of so-called good cholesterol, a breakthrough that 
could someday lead to a new way to treat one of the most common 
causes of heart disease. Flaws in the gene, known as ABC1, prevent 
the production of a protein that the body needs to rinse excess bad 
cholesterol and other fats out of cells and the bloodstream. ABC1 
was isolated in separate studies by scientists in Germany and in 
Canada. Their results appear in the August issue of Nature 
Genetics.

<HEADLINE> Feds Owed $49B in Unpaid Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Businesses owe the government almost $50  
billion in unpaid payroll taxes, and most of it may never be 
collected, a congressional audit found. 
</P>
<P>
	The overdue payments were blamed on long-standing technological  
and other deficiencies at the Internal Revenue Service. Its 
commissioner, meanwhile, said the IRS' modernization program would 
correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line of my testimony ... is that delinquent payroll  
taxes are substantial, are largely uncollectable and represent a 
significant challenge for the IRS,'' Gregory Kutz, who oversaw the 
General Accounting Office audit, told the House Government Reform 
Committee's government management panel. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1.8 million businesses owed $49 billion in cumulative  
unpaid payroll taxes as of Sept. 30, 1998, according to the audit, 
released Monday. The figure includes about $19 billion in unpaid 
taxes and $30 billion in penalties and interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The $49 billion figure represents just under one-fourth, or 22  
percent, of the $222 billion in taxes owed the IRS as of September 
1998, the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS also has levied $15 billion in additional penalties  
against 185,000 people for withholding but not forwarding payroll 
taxes -- which help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits -- 
to the federal Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, more than 18,000 people in this group received  
federal benefits worth $212 million, including Social Security and 
retirement payments, despite their $2 billion in payroll tax debt, 
the audit found. Others received vendor payments and loans. Federal 
law does not bar businesses or individuals from collecting federal 
payments or loans while they are behind on payroll tax payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutz said it was unlikely that all of the outstanding payroll  
tax payments will be recovered. Many of the businesses are defunct, 
do not have the money to pay, or the IRS cannot find them, 
according to IRS records reviewed for the audit. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the offenders were small businesses in labor-intensive  
industries with few assets, such as construction companies and 
restaurants, Kutz said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated no more than 9 cents on the dollar eventually would  
be collected. 
</P>
<P>
	Kutz said several factors contribute to the problem, including  
technological and other operational weaknesses at the IRS. Taxpayer 
education and programs to highlight problems before they become 
serious also have been ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
	State and federal law also can hinder the IRS' ability to  
collect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, who testified later, agreed  
with the audit and said his agency will use the report to ``make 
what near-term improvements we can.'' But he cautioned against 
looking for a quick fix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be misleading everyone to believe this problem can be  
solved by anything we could do short of revamping this process,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 102,000-employee agency currently is implementing changes  
required by a 1998 law. The agency plans to begin in July 2000, as 
authorized by separate legislation, to garnishee up to 15 percent 
of a delinquent taxpayer's federal benefits.

<HEADLINE> Janzen, McCarron Hit Holes-In-One  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARRINGTON, R.I. (AP) -- Lee Janzen and Scott McCarron defied  
astounding odds Monday by making consecutive holes-in-one on the 
first day of the CVS Charity Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Lee's shot, I had a feeling I was going to make it,''  
McCarron said. ``It was one of those wild feelings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team of Stuart Appleby and Jeff Sluman birdied the first  
five holes and held the lead with a 12-under-par 59. In last place 
at 67 was the main draw, Jack and Gary Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-day, 10-team tournament at the Rhode Island Country Club  
uses a best-ball format, which encourages low scoring because each 
two-man team uses its low score on each hole. 
</P>
<P>
	At 145 yards, the par-3 17th hole seemed ideal for a  
hole-in-one. In fact, a tournament sponsor promised a car to the 
first player who could do it. Janzen got the car when his tee shot 
bounced three times and then spun left to right into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm watching the crowd for their reaction and they went  
berserk,'' Janzen said. ``It's amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron then hit immediately after Janzen, sending his shot  
right at the flag. The ball bounced twice and plopped right into 
the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	After Janzen's hole-in-one, McCarron had yelled, ``You've got to  
get the ball out of the hole and make some room for mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, right,'' Janzen thought.  
</P>
<P>
	Fans screamed and high-fived one another. Another member of the  
foursome, Tim Herron, fell to the grass in amazement 
</P>
<P>
	Appleby and Sluman played a bogeyless round. Besides their  
initial burst, they birdied three additional holes and eagled the 
538th-yard, 11th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pretty aggressive players and we have aggressive  
games,'' Appleby said. ``And what's the point of playing safe in a 
two-day event?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pair, who had never played the course before, hit the  
fairways on just about every hole, repeatedly giving themselves a 
chance for birdie. Sluman birdied six holes and Appleby birdied 
four holes and made the eagle. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-place team, hometown favorites Dana Quigley and  
nephew Brett, didn't have that kind of balance but still shot a 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Dana, a senior PGA, has had a better year, it was Brett,  
a fringe player on the PGA Tour who carried the team, recording 
nine birdies before Dana finally birdied the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett said he knew he had to play well because his uncle was  
tired from a late flight from Utah, where he lost a senior tour 
event in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was probably the best I've seen him play and I've seen  
him play a lot of rounds,'' Dana Quigley said.

<HEADLINE> White House Touts Welfare Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The percentage of Americans on welfare has  
dropped to the lowest level since 1967, according to new figures 
made available as President Clinton prepares to prod the business 
community to hire more people off the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also will urge states on Tuesday to spend $4.2  
billion in unspent federal welfare money and warn Congress not to 
take it away as some Republicans have suggested, administration 
officials told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president will make clear that the job of welfare reform  
isn't done until we've got everybody working,'' said Bruce Reed, 
Clinton's top domestic policy adviser. ``This is not the time for 
Congress to call it quits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton will meet in Chicago with participants of a Welfare to  
Work Partnership conference that is part cheerleading and part 
training for businesses interested in hiring welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
	The president also will encourage businesses to invest in  
poverty-stricken parts of the nation left behind by the economic 
good times -- the theme of his tour of impoverished areas last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	New figures provided to AP on Monday show that welfare rolls had  
dropped 49 percent from their all-time high in 1994. And 29 states 
have cut their rolls by more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	As of March, just 2.7 percent of the population -- or 7.3 million  
Americans -- was on welfare, the least since Lyndon B. Johnson was 
president. In 1967, the figure was 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new figures also show the dramatic declines are  
beginning to slow in some states. After large drops, welfare 
caseloads remained relatively stable in Kansas, Louisiana, 
Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia. 
And they increased in New Mexico and Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures offer further evidence that the toughest work in  
welfare reform may be ahead, as states deal with people who face 
complex problems -- poor education, domestic violence and drug and 
alcohol addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	The event Tuesday is likely to include plenty of cheers for the  
gains already made, disturbing some who worry about studies that 
show many Americans who leave welfare aren't earning enough to 
escape poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``The data that is conveniently left out by the White House and  
by too many people in the Congress is this: What are the wage 
levels, what are people making?'' Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is always disturbed by Clinton's declarations that  
welfare reform has succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you dare hype this -- these are people's lives,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton will continue to emphasize that people are doing  
better now than they were before, Reed said. ``Nobody's going to 
escape poverty by staying on welfare,'' he said. ``Introducing them 
to the world of work gives them a much better chance over the long 
haul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed said Clinton also plans to issue a warning to Congress.  
</P>
<P>
	States get $16.5 billion in federal money each year to run their  
welfare programs, but they don't have to spend it immediately. With 
the five-year decline in welfare rolls, many states are saving 
their extra dollars to handle the toughest cases or as a safety 
measure if the economy turns sour. 
</P>
<P>
	But Congress has periodically eyed that money, and GOP budget  
writers are considering taking some of it back to use for other 
domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton plans to tell Congress on Tuesday that it would be wrong  
to renege on its promise to give the states a fixed amount of 
welfare money. But he'll also urge states to act before Congress 
reclaims the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message to states is 'Spend it,''' Reed said.  
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore also released new figures Monday showing  
the federal government had hired 14,028 people off welfare, 
surpassing the original goal, set in March 1997, of 10,000 by 2000. 
Most of them are working at the Commerce and Defense departments. 
</P>
<P>
	As of last September, nearly 70 percent of them were still on  
the job after a year -- compared with 37 percent of other, similar 
federal workers.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Create Flu Virus in Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have created a flu virus in the  
laboratory by combining the genetic pieces of an existing flu bug -- 
work they said could lead to a new type of vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin's School of  
Veterinary Medicine, said he and his colleagues were able to make a 
flu virus that precisely duplicated a virus that was isolated in 
1933 and is now used commonly in influenza research. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the research was being published Tuesday in the  
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawaoka said the importance of making a flu virus is the  
understanding gained about the inner workings of one of humankind's 
most troublesome pathogens. 
</P>
<P>
	``This technology should help us gain a greater biological  
understanding of influenza and improve our methods of disease 
control,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To make the virus, the researchers removed and separated the  
eight components in the genetic makeup of a flu virus called WSN. 
These components are called plasmids. 
</P>
<P>
	The flu plasmids were mixed with nine plasmids from other  
sources and then added to a laboratory dish containing about a 
million living cells. 
</P>
<P>
	The plasmids invaded the cells in random combinations. In about  
one cell out of every 1,000, the plasmids combined to form the WSN 
flu virus. 
</P>
<P>
	To prove that the virus was alive, said Kawaoka, the team  
allowed it to make a new generation of virus that then was used to 
infect a new batch of cells. 
</P>
<P>
	A genetic analysis of the new virus showed that it was an exact  
match of the WSN flu virus, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawaoka said the technique will allow researchers to manipulate  
the plasmids in order to create live viruses that could be used for 
flu vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can introduce mutations any way we want,'' he said. ``We  
can control the virulence by mutating here, there, anywhere. That 
could help us generate a live vaccine that is also stable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A live vaccine could be more effective than one made with  
inactivated flu components, he said, because it would prompt the 
body to develop a more powerful immune system response and thus 
provide more protection against infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Flu remains a major public health problem, infecting about 40  
million Americans annually, and killing about 20,000. Current 
vaccines are protective, but they have to be changed each year 
because the virus itself changes constantly. This means vaccine 
protection against the flu requires annual shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing more about the flu virus structure may make it possible  
to make a vaccine that provides more long-lasting protection, 
Kawaoka said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher cautioned, however, that the work is in its very  
early stages and that creating a new vaccine can take a decade or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Kawaoka said the new way of manipulating the genetic pattern of  
the flu virus also suggests that the virus could be used to deliver 
curative genes to cells in the body. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a system, researchers would put a gene into the flu  
virus and inject it into a patient. The virus would then infect 
cells with the genes that could correct a disease process. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique could be used, for instance, to fight cancer by  
delivering killing genes directly to cancer cells, Kawaoka said.

<HEADLINE> Salaam: Dope Nearly Ended My Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Running back Rashaan Salaam, attempting a  
comeback with the Oakland Raiders, says an addiction to marijuana 
made him withdrawn, caused him to fumble and nearly ended his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't the kind of person I was,'' he told ESPN. ``I wasn't  
outgoing like I was. I was just to myself. All I wanted to do was 
go home and do what I wanted to do. I wasn't a social person. I was 
just an outcast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, who refused to speak with reporters after the day's two  
practices, was the focus of attention after his comments. 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam, who won the Heisman Trophy at Colorado in 1994, was  
plagued by fumbles with the Chicago Bears, losing 14 in 31 games. 
He thinks the fumbles most likely were related to marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	``It probably had me out there lackadaisical instead of being  
out there 100 percent,'' he told the cable network in an interview 
first broadcast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody thinks getting high is cool, you can let it go when  
you want to let it go,'' he added. ``But it's just as potent as 
alcohol. It's just as potent as cocaine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam broke his leg in the third game of the 1997 season, a  
game in which he committed two costly fumbles. He said the injury 
increased his addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got hurt, I knew it was a problem because it pretty  
much consumed all my time,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to practice 
or anything like that so I pretty much spent my time sitting around 
getting high, and that's when I knew I had to let it go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam told ESPN that he informed the Bears of his problem in  
early 1998 and entered a rehabilitation program. The Bears later 
cut the former first-round draft choice. He was out of football 
last season.

	``It was hard,'' he said. ``It was embarrassing. My pride was  
shot. It was just a nightmare to be 23 years old and out of 
football. I couldn't believe what was going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders signed Salaam as a free agent.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think the upside is tremendous,'' coach Jon Gruden said.  
``He was a first-round draft choice an 1,100-yard back his rookie 
year, so we think there is a real upside there if he can regain the 
rhythm he had coming out of Colorado. I like him as a person and he 
has something to prove and is extremely hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raiders senior assistant Bruce Allen added, ``Before he signed  
here, he was very forthright in everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot about Rashaan Salaam. We studied him carefully,''  
Gruden said. ``We support Rashaan Salaam 100 percent. He's never 
tested positive in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salaam said the experience of being released changed him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't never want to go back to how I was in Chicago,'' he  
said. ``I don't want to never be without a team. I don't want to 
never go through that again. Just thinking about that keeps me away 
from it.''

<HEADLINE> Kid Crime Crusader Charged in Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A teen-ager who once spoke out against crime in  
his Boston neighborhood, asking the governor in a letter to ``put 
the bad people in jail,'' is behind bars after pleading innocent to 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Meeks, 18, is accused of killing another teen h in  
Boston's South End neighborhood last year. He was jailed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, 10-year-old Meeks wrote then-Gov. William Weld, asking  
him to do something about crime in the Roxbury neighborhood where 
he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to stop the violence,'' he wrote. ``Make the people  
that are selling drugs go to school and put the bad people in 
jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1993, Weld visited Meeks at his school and was  
photographed eating pepperoni pizza with him in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, Meeks and some friends allegedly were riding their  
bicycles and met up with Tari Thomas, 18, whom he apparently knew. 
The teens exchanged words before Meeks pulled a semiautomatic 
pistol and shot Thomas in the head, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dennis Collins would not comment on possible motives,  
and he also would not comment on why Meeks was arrested more than a 
year after Thomas was killed.

<HEADLINE> Mir Computer Accidentally Shut Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- A Mission Control officer monitoring the Mir  
accidentally shut down the space station's central computer, 
prompting the crew to speed up preparations to abandon the orbiter, 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The shutdown on Friday didn't threaten the crew, but did knock  
the Mir out of alignment with the sun, said Irina Manshilina, a 
spokeswoman for Mission Control. Mission Control quickly moved to 
speed up the installation of a new computer that is to control the 
station after its crew leaves this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its installation requires unplugging the central computer  
anyway, so a decision was made to take advantage of the breakdown 
and do the work earlier than scheduled,'' Manshilina said by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Afanasyev, Sergei Avdeyev and Frenchman Jean-Pierre  
Haignere are scheduled to return to Earth on Aug. 28, leaving the 
station unmanned until February or March. A final crew will go up 
briefly to lower the station's orbit, and mission controllers will 
then send it to burn up in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	Space officials have said that the new computer would allow them  
to control the station without the crew on board. However, some 
experts disagree, noting Mir's previous computer glitches and other 
breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	When the computer goes down, so does the gyroscope system that  
keeps the station in the right position to soak up energy from the 
sun. Computer failures have been frequent over the last few years, 
and each time it has taken crews several days to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Without a crew to help, ground controllers might not be able to  
restart the computer. In that case, Mir's batteries would drain, 
and the station would spin out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	That is what happened to the Mir's predecessor, the Salyut-7. It  
fell in pieces on a sparsely populated area in Argentina's Andes 
mountains near the Chilean border in 1991. No injuries or damage 
resulted. 
</P>
<P>
	Space officials have tried to play down the fears of a repeat,  
saying that a new crew would always be able to promptly blast off 
for the Mir to fix a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the cash-strapped Russian space agency is unlikely to  
be able to muster a quick rescue mission. Moreover, docking with 
the Mir would be extremely risky and difficult if the station is 
out of proper alignment with the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it doesn't have the money to keep up the  
Mir, and has promised to spend its scarce resources on the 
16-nation international space station, already behind schedule 
because of Russia's failure to build a key component on time.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- With the start of the new school year at  
Columbine High School just two weeks away, officials are still 
unsure how many students will opt not to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Columbine students fatally shot 12 classmates and a teacher  
on April 20 before killing themselves. Columbine principal Frank 
DeAngelis said some students have applied for transfers, but 
officials won't know until school begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect some students will walk in the building and won't be  
able to take it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Repair and remodeling work at the school is scheduled to be  
finished by Aug. 9, a week before classes resume. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine's library, where most of the killing took place, will  
be closed until parents and students can give their input on 
whether it should reopen. In the meantime, trailers outside the 
school will serve as its library. 
</P>
<P>
	Students also won't be assigned the lockers that gunmen Eric  
Harris and Dyland Klebold used last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Backs Wife's Candor on Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Her husband gave it a ``generally favorable''  
review. Her critics called it a lunge for the sympathy vote. All 
part of the plan, said her strategists. 
</P>
<P>
	While Hillary Rodham Clinton talked, from the pages of a new  
magazine, about Bill Clinton's famous infidelities, Washington 
buzzed: Why dredge all that up now? 
</P>
<P>
	In her month-old campaign for New York's Senate seat, not a  
single voter -- and only one reporter -- has confronted Mrs. Clinton 
with questions about her marriage. Protesters and posters scream 
``Carpetbagger, go home!'' but not much about cheating husbands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do I have to talk about things no one else in politics  
does?'' the first lady plaintively asked her Talk magazine 
interviewer before baring her most extensive thoughts yet on 
matters she refused to address when Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones 
and Monica Lewinsky made headlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of Mrs. Clinton's confidantes, one of whom spoke with her  
over the weekend as Talk hyped the interview in its debut edition, 
said the first lady made a political calculation to try and put 
personal questions to rest before they popped up in her campaign. 
She made the decision in May, one associate said on condition of 
anonymity, after being pressed in two TV interviews on CBS and CNN 
about her feelings toward her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	In statewide surveys by the Marist Institute for Public Opinion,  
New Yorkers who do not like Mrs. Clinton overwhelmingly cite 
distaste for her husband as the reason, said pollster Lee 
Miringoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some kind of sense that there's a pothole in the road  
and you don't know how deep it is, so she's trying to pave it 
over,'' said Miringoff. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's potential  
GOP rival for the Senate, said his campaign would not exploit her 
family troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe somebody's private life ... should be part of  
a political campaign,'' said Giuliani, who has faced questions 
about his own marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton used in her interview the language of psychobabble  
that she has long professed to despise. She called her husband's 
adultery ``a sin of weakness,'' and the product of emotional scars 
-- ``abuse,'' she termed it -- left by battles between his mother and 
grandmother when he was 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton was never physically abused, White House spokesman  
Joe Lockhart clarified. And, Clinton has ``stated openly, publicly, 
that he is responsible for all of his actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton insisted she stayed with her husband out of love,  
not ambition. 
</P>
<P>
	To Republican strategist Rich Galen, Mrs. Clinton came off  
sounding like an apologist for the president's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the vast right-wing conspiracy's fault anymore, it's  
the grandma's,'' Galen sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to maintain her status as America's 'wounded woman  
in chief.' That's the only reason she's been popular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took a months-long dance to get Mrs. Clinton's story told.  
Talk editor Tina Brown assigned a writer friendly with the first 
lady and plied her with the attentions of a Paris fashion 
photographer. While established news organizations such as Newsweek 
and Newsday were refused seats on Mrs. Clinton's plane during trips 
earlier this year to North Africa and Ireland, the White House gave 
Talk two coveted slots in her entourage. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Marsha Berry and chief of staff Melanne Verveer, who  
usually do not discuss the Clintons' personal problems, allowed 
themselves to be quoted in Talk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've slowly seen a physical passion come back into their  
lives,'' Verveer confided on the glossy pages. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday morning, the article appeared to have raised more  
questions than it answered, consuming the first half of Lockhart's 
daily briefing. 
</P>
<P>
	For the record, Clinton didn't mind his wife's candor.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me from the reports he's gotten that it's a generally  
favorable article about the first lady, that he's comfortable with 
the views expressed in the article and the fact that she did the 
interview,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two associates of the first lady, who spoke on condition  
of anonymity, said they were concerned that she appeared to be 
making excuses for her husband at a time when many voters are weary 
of the president and his personal scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, said her campaign  
never discusses its polling. On the Talk article specifically, 
Wolfson said, ``The only reaction I've asked for is from my mother 
and she thought it was great.''

<HEADLINE> AutoNation To Separate Rental Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- AutoNation Inc. plans to separate its lackluster  
rental-car business, including the big Alamo and National chains, 
from its growing auto sales operations in what could lead to its 
eventual spinoff or sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Separating the rental unit will allow investors ``to better  
recognize and evaluate the strengths and growth prospects of our 
automotive retail operations,'' Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga said in 
the company's second-quarter earnings report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its board was still looking at options for how  
the separation will take place. Analyst Efraim Levy of Standard and 
Poor's said a spinoff was the most likely option, either in whole 
or in parts. The company spun off its Republic Services trash 
hauling business earlier this year through a sale of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The separation of the rental business is the latest effort by  
publicly owned AutoNation to boost its lagging stock price. Wall 
Street has been wary of AutoNation, in part because of the 
industry's cyclical nature, but also because of missteps the 
company has had in trying to devise a winning long-term strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best of times for automotive retailing, yet they've  
repeatedly had disappointments,'' Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation was up 31 1/4 cents, or by 2 percent, at $15.25 a share  
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, well below its 52-week high 
of $24.37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced plans to buy back an additional $500  
million of its stock, for a total of $1 billion, under its ongoing 
repurchase program. Through June, $449 million worth of stock had 
been repurchased. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Jim Donahue said AutoNation hoped to complete  
the rental-unit separation as soon as possible. The unit includes 
National Car Rental System Inc. and Alamo Rent-A-Car Inc. -- which 
both operate internationally -- and CarTemps USA, formerly known as 
Spirit Rent-A-Car Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Huizenga bought National and Alamo in 1996, in part to provide a  
steady source of used cars to his AutoNation USA used-car lots. But 
the logistics proved impractical, and as Huizenga expanded into the 
new-car business, he turned to more traditional sources: auctions, 
trade-ins and formerly leased cars. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in late June, Huizenga's co-chief executive,  
Steven Berrard, acknowledged that the company was frustrated with 
its stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, there were early problems with AutoNation, which are  
behind us and solved,'' he said. ``We've had a few hiccups in the 
rental car business, and yet our auto retail business has performed 
above everyone's expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rental-unit separation comes as AutoNation's executive ranks  
are being shuffled. The company is searching for a new CEO to 
replace Berrard, who announced a month ago that he was leaving to 
manage his own investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Monday that John H. Costello,  
president and chief operating officer, had resigned and was being 
replaced by Michael Maroone, former president of AutoNation's 
automotive retail group. Costello, a veteran retailer who came from 
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. only eight months ago, resigned to pursue 
Internet business ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	Maroone joined AutoNation two years ago when the company, then  
called Republic Industries Inc., bought his dealer group in 
southern Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation reported that second-quarter earnings from continuing  
operations rose 79 percent to $97.1 million, or 21 cents a share, 
from $54.2 million, or 11 cents a share, in the same period a year 
ago. Revenue rose 60 percent to $5.1 billion from $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Same-store revenue, measuring performance at outlets open at  
least a year, grew 5 percent, including an 8 percent gain in new 
vehicle sales. 
</P>
<P>
	AutoNation has 412 automotive franchises and 42 AutoNation USA  
stores in 24 states.

<HEADLINE> Man Who Placed Ad for Heir Inundated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE CITY, Minn. (AP) -- Clayton Goward had a problem -- he was  
looking for someone who could inherit his $375,000 estate. Now he 
has a bigger problem -- he can't get any peace and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the 79-year-old retired lathe operator placed an ad in the  
Star Tribune last month asking for advice on how to find a suitable 
heir, he's been besieged with 22,000 letters, postcards and 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	He got so many phone calls -- some from as far away as Europe --  
that he had to change his number to an unpublished one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sought only ideas and a solution for making my will, nothing  
more,'' Goward said. ``What followed is not what I wanted. 
Worldwide coverage resulted, and I am now swamped. About anything 
that you can think of has been written.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some responses are religious. Others suggest that Goward donate  
his estate to charity -- which he says is what he might end up 
doing. One college student from Idaho told Goward he should start a 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd even be willing to apply'' for such a scholarship, the  
student volunteered. ``Believe me, I could use some help!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goward got divorced long ago, and his relationship with his  
three sons is strained. 
</P>
<P>
	He said most of the responses have come from women. He's heard  
romantic proposals and plenty of stories of hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want personal help, and I don't have the  
millions of dollars to help them,'' he said. ``You feel sorry about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now Goward has a new request -- he says he needs volunteers to  
help sort the mail and trinkets that have arrived at his door.

<HEADLINE> Owners To Sell Interest in Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The owners of the Minnesota Twins said  
Monday night they have agreed to sell their entire interest in the 
team to a St. Paul group by Oct. 1, and the team would move from 
Minneapolis if a sales tax referendum to build a stadium passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball has also agreed to the deal, and the  
league has approved a move from the Metrodome in Minneapolis if St. 
Paul can build a new stadium. Mayor Norm Coleman wants voters to 
approve a half-cent increase in the city's sales tax in the Nov. 2 
election. Legislative approval is also needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, St. Paul and the Twins would each  
contribute $8.5 million a year to build a $325 million outdoor 
stadium along the Mississippi River, Coleman said. The state would 
be asked to pay about one-third of the total cost of the project. 
</P>
<P>
	If taxes collected on players' salaries don't equal the state's  
share, the Twins have guaranteed the difference, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The net effect of this provision is that the team is committed  
to paying about one-third of the costs of construction, but is 
virtually guaranteeing two-thirds of the costs of construction,'' 
Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The player payroll tax would be similar to that now existing in  
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins also have agreed to pay any cost overruns for the  
construction of the ballpark. The Twins also would pay for 
operating costs of the team and cover maintenance of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally, I firmly believe that in addition to Twins  
ballplayers, major market teams and players like Chuck Knoblauch 
and the New York Yankees should help build a new ballpark for 
Minnesota,'' Coleman said. ``We have agreed that a player's tax 
incorporating these principals will be imposed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman thanked Twins owner Carl Pohlad and his family for the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today because of their agreement to sell 100 percent in the  
Minnesota Twins, they have given us the opportunity to save 
baseball in Minnesota for the new millennium,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Twins said the Pohlad family has agreed to  
a letter of intent with the city of St. Paul authorizing Coleman to 
seek buyers. The statement also said one condition is that the team 
must remain in Minnesota for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Twins and the city anticipate the completion of construction  
of a 38,000- to 40,000-seat ballpark in the spring of 2003.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Holdings Profits Up 10 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- HSBC Holdings Plc, which owns Hong Kong's  
largest bank, said Monday that strong growth in the United States 
and Britain and a modest recovery in Asia drove its profits up 10 
percent in the first half of the year to $4.07 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC, which was rocked last year by the Asian crisis and bad  
debts, was able to lower its provisions for bad debts to $1.08 
billion from $1.15 billion in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	An HSBC affiliate, Hang Seng Bank Ltd., said its pretax profits  
rose 13 percent to $646 million. The bank also was able to lower 
its bad debt provisions 13 percent to $101 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've benefited from the continuing strength in the United  
States and United Kingdom economies and a degree of recovery in 
some emerging markets,'' said John Bond, HSBC group chairman. But 
he cautioned that the Asian recovery would be ``uneven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Huge provisions for bad loans in Indonesia, Thailand and China  
contributed to a 21 percent plunge in the group's 1998 profit. 
</P>
<P>
	HSBC is based in London, but its presence is biggest in Hong  
Kong, which accounted for 34 percent of its profit in the first 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the rise in the group's profit and a drop in overall  
provisions for bad loans, HSBC's Hongkong and Shanghai Banking 
Corp. Ltd. still set aside $218 million as loss provisions for its 
China-related bad loans in Hong Kong, mainland China and Macau. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of HSBC rose $2.37 1/2 to $62.62 1/2 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Gore Bid Friend Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remembered Washington  
lobbyist Dan Dutko on Monday as an irreverent, funny man, a devoted 
Democrat and loyal friend who stuck by him during the toughest 
moments of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Vice President Al Gore and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, attended a packed memorial service at Washington's 
Temple Sinai for Dutko, 54, who died July 25 in a mountain bike 
accident. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Clinton, Gore Bid Friend Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remembered Washington  
lobbyist Dan Dutko on Monday as an irreverent, funny man, a devoted 
Democrat and loyal friend who stuck by him during the toughest 
moments of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, joined by Vice President Al Gore and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton, attended a packed memorial service at Washington's 
Temple Sinai for Dutko, 54, who died July 25 in a mountain bike 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutko, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a major  
Democratic fund-raiser, fell and struck his head while biking in 
Aspen, Colo., while participating in a weekend of fund-raising

<HEADLINE> Canadian Apologizes for Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-ADELE, Quebec (AP) -- Steve Vezina, Canada's roller hockey  
goaltender, apologized Monday for costing his country the Pan 
American Games gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	That didn't stop one of his teammates from lashing out at him.  
</P>
<P>
	Vezina admitted taking the over-the-counter cold remedy Sudafed  
during the games and capsules of the anabolic steroid Nandrolone, 
purchased at a pharmacy, in June. During a news conference with his 
agent, Paul Hamel, Vezina said he took Nandolone because he was 
losing weight during the busy roller hockey schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those actions were not up to a high standard of an athlete  
that represents Canada,'' Vezina said. ``I would like to apologize 
for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It apparently wasn't enough for Vezina's teammate Kevin Kerr.  
</P>
<P>
	``He ruined the chance of a lifetime for nine guys,'' Kerr said  
from Anaheim, Calif., where he plays professional roller hockey. 
``I know he's my teammate and I should be sticking up for him. I 
know I, along with nine other guys, we're clean. We did it the way 
we were supposed to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be guys on this team that will never have an  
opportunity to represent their country again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada won the Pan Ams roller hockey final 7-6 over the United  
States on July 27, with Kerr getting the game-winning goal. Roller 
hockey, played on in-line skates, has a professional summer league 
in the United States and is one of six non-Olympic sports being 
contested in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the gold medals were taken away when officials  
announced Vezina tested positive for two stimulants and an 
abnormally high amount of Nandrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said he could not explain why his doping test detected  
16,000 parts per million of Nandrolone, when one or two parts per 
million raises immediate suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. I'm not a doctor,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I'm a bad person because I did that. I don't  
think I'm a criminal because I did that. My prime object was to 
improve my performance on the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't commit any crimes. I maybe just misunderstood. I took  
something I should not take when you play at the Pan Am Games. I 
did nothing wrong for my ice hockey (career).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina played last season for the Utah Grizzlies of the  
International Hockey League. He also is a goalie for Roller Hockey 
International's Buffalo Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the future, Hamel said his client has signed a two-year  
deal with a professional ice hockey team, but would not identify 
that team. Hamel said Vezina orignally had three offers and that 
two teams he contacted Monday still were interested in his client 
should he become available. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to affect his ice hockey,'' Hamel said.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Pipe, chairman of the Canadian Centre for Ethics and  
Sport, said Monday that blanket testing of athletes before events 
such as the Pan Am Games won't guarantee a dope-free games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will it provide an absolute guarantee there are going to be no  
embarrassment? The answer is no,'' said Pipe, Canada's top 
anti-doping official. 
</P>
<P>
	Pipe said athletes could test clean in the days prior to a  
games, then inadvertently, or purposely, ingest a banned substance 
prior to their event.

<HEADLINE> Christian Coalition Charges Tossed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge today threw out most of the  
charges in a government lawsuit accusing the Christian Coalition of 
illegally aiding Republican candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joyce Green rejected arguments by the  
Federal Election Commission that the coalition's contact with 
campaigns and its distribution of voters guide to churches on the 
Sunday before Election Days should be counted as excessive campaign 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a complete victory for the beleaguered organization.  
</P>
<P>
	Green ruled that the group must pay a civil penalty to the  
Federal Election Commission for advocating the election of Rep. 
Newt Gingrich during the Georgia Republican's successful 1994 bid 
to gain GOP control of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	She also ruled that the Christian Coalition improperly shared  
its mailing list with the 1994 Senate campaign of former 
Iran-Contra figure Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
	However, she dismissed numerous other allegations in the FEC's  
1996 lawsuit alleging that the group improperly promoted the 
candidacies of President Bush, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and House 
Republicans J.D. Hayworth of Arizona and Bob Inglis of South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``A corporation's mere announcement to the campaign that it  
plans to distribute thousand of voter guides on the Sunday before 
Election Day, even if that information is not yet public, is not 
enough to be coordination,'' Green ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition had asked that the FEC's entire lawsuit be  
dismissed, but it was likely to cheer the ruling as a victory after 
years of battling the IRS and the FEC over how to treat its 
political activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC does not plan to comment on the ruling, a spokesman said  
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition, founded in the 1980s by religious  
broadcaster Pat Robertson, became a major force in Republican 
politics in the 1990s, mobilizing conservative voters through 
grass-roots activities. Its church guides, which rated candidates 
on the Sunday before Election Days, became a cherished weapons for 
many GOP candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	But the group has struggled financially and politically in  
recent years after Robertson handed over the reins to others and 
the groups became engaged in internal disputes and the ongoing 
battles with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS refused to grant the group tax-exempt status in 1998 in  
a ruling kept under wraps pending appeal. The Christian Coalition 
withdrew its appeal after being notified this spring it was likely 
to lose at the appeals court level, 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS concluded that certain Christian Coalition activities  
were too partisan for the group to enjoy tax-exempt status, a 
decision that denied the group the tax benefits enjoyed by other 
nonprofit religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The FEC pursued a separate lawsuit alleging the group's  
political activities should have fallen under federal campaign 
rules, which impose strict limits on the amount of aid federal 
candidates can receive from special interests. The coalition called 
the arguments ``groundless.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group reported indebtedness and internal strife following  
the 1998 elections, in which Republicans lost seats in the House in 
the midyear election. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to regain influence and contributors, Robertson recently  
agreed to play a larger role with the group and in June announced a 
major reorganization triggered by the denial of its request for 
tax-exempt status. Robertson declared then that the organization 
would ``continue to be a force in American politics.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed lower Monday on  
the back of another slump on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 36.16  
points, or 0.20 percent, to finish at 17,825.70. On Friday, the 
average closed down 8.06 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 114.04 yen,  
down 1.22 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and below its late New York 
level of 114.48 yen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's basic weakness remained unchanged amid  
concerns about inflation in the United States. Those fears had also 
driven the Dow Jones industrial average down for a second straight 
session Friday, losing 1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The stronger yen also weighed on sentiment in the stock market.  
A weak dollar makes Japanese exports costlier abroad while reducing 
the yen value of foreign revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia's key index plunged 4.4 percent on foreign selling amid  
caution ahead of a spate of corporate earnings releases in the next 
two weeks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark's Composite Index of 100 blue-chip stocks fell  
33.75 points to 734.94. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, where share  
prices rose on expectations that banking giant HSBC Holdings would 
post strong half-year earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 248.57 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 
13,435.43. On Friday, the index had gained 69.02 points, or 0.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said market sentiment improved on speculation that HSBC  
Holdings' half-year results could be better than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The optimists were proven right after the market closed, when  
HSBC Holdings announced that its half-year pretax profits rose 10 
percent to U.S. $4.068 billion, beating most analysts forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on worries over continuing  
tensions between China and Taiwan. The market's key Weighted Stock 
Price Index fell 130.81 points, or 1.8 percent, to 7,195.94. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower in line with  
weaker global stock markets. The NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 32.49 
points, or 1.5 percent, to 2,163.29. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed higher, boosted by speculation  
of a possible merger between two of the country's largest banks. 
The Philippine Stock Exchange Index rose 13.32 points, or 0.6 
percent, to 2,356.13. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian stocks closed lower on selling of financial  
stocks amid market talk that U.S. interest rates will rise later 
this month. The All Ordinaries Index fell 19.9 points, or 0.7 
percent, to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower as concerns about the Daewoo  
Group's financial trouble continued to weigh down the market. The 
Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 9.91 points, or 1.0 percent, 
to 959.82. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed lower. The Straits Times Index  
fell 17.12 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,128.65. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed slightly lower. The Composite Index  
fell 0.2 percent, or 1.361 points, to 596.513.

	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Shawon Dunston, the last of four players  
acquired by the New York Mets just before the trading deadline, 
joined the club Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Bobby Valentine plans to use Dunston, who started 29 of

</P>
<P>
	The Mets, 13-4 since the All-Star break, entered Monday's game  
at Milwaukee a half-game behind idle Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 9.19 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The continuing threat of higher interest rates  
demolished a rally on Wall Street Monday, sending stocks lower even 
after a new report suggested the economy might not be overheating 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed 9.19 lower at 10,645.96  
after rising as much as 136 points earlier in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators also gave up early gains and finished  
lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.67 to 1,328.05, and the 
Nasdaq composite index fell 14.86 to 2,623.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially rebounded from last week's steep losses after  
the National Association of Purchasing Management said the U.S. 
manufacturing sector grew in July for the sixth consecutive month 
but not as strongly as most analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The market had anticipated that the report, which gauges  
manufacturing activity, would show continued economic expansion and 
raise the likelihood of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates 
later this year. The report is the first reading on the U.S. 
economy's performance for July. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the excuse for some buying today,'' said William  
Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor Fitzgerald, who said 
investors were also lured by bargains after last week's steep 
market losses, when the Dow fell a total of 255.81 points, or 2.3 
percent, and the Nasdaq lost 53.91 points, or 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was little conviction behind Monday's early gains --  
even as the Dow was up more than 100 points, the S&AMP;P and Nasdaq 
managed only modest gains. And by midafternoon, the Dow also began 
slipping, turning lower in the final hour of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would appear that the worries about interest rates were not  
adequately assuaged by the NAPM report,'' said Richard A. Dickson, 
a technical analyst at Scott &AMP; Stringfellow Inc. in Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices followed a similar pattern, rebounding in morning  
trading before trailing off late in the day. The yield on the 
30-year Treasury bond touched 6.17 percent in early trading, sank 
to 6.10 percent and then edged up to 6.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The high yields on bonds have been contributing to a difficult  
environment for stocks, presenting an attractive and less volatile 
investment vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial stocks, battered last week as the threat of higher  
interest rates rattled the market, followed the broader market, 
rising before turning mixed late in the day. Chase Manhattan rose 1 
3/16 to 78 1/4 and American Express, a component of the Dow, fell 1 
11/16 to 130 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors seeking bargains boosted Daimler Chrysler 2 5/8 to 74 3/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. The automaker's shares slid last week 
after the company reported flat operating earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears rose 1 1/16 to 41 9/16 following reports the company will  
cut 10 percent of the work force at its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	On a dismal day for most stocks, bullish analyst Abby Joseph  
Cohen provided a note of optimism. Cohen, chief investment 
strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., told clients she does not 
foresee a bear market, and that share prices will continue to move 
higher along with strong corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 7-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 783.75 million 
shares, compared with 875.77 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan said the low volume suggests that many investors are  
staying out of the market for now and looking ahead to the Aug. 24 
meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Volume is sluggish and will remain so until Aug. 24 unless we  
get some really negative news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 0.73 to 625.34, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index lost 4.59 to 783.64. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.14 to 442.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets were mixed. Japan's Nikkei stock average fell  
0.2 percent, but most European markets thrived on the early Wall 
Street rally. Germany's DAX index rose 0.5 percent, Britain's FT-SE 
100 gained 0.9 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.1 percent 
lower.

<HEADLINE> Litton Acquires Avondale Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Litton Industries Inc. on Monday completed  
its acquisition of Avondale Industries Inc., creating a 
shipbuilding business with annual revenue of $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton, based in Woodland Hills, Calif., combined Avondale with  
Ingalls Shipbuilding Inc. in Pascagoula, Miss., to form Litton Ship 
Systems, which will have 17,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale designs, builds and overhauls ships for the Navy, Coast  
Guard and commercial customers. Litton builds military and 
commercial ships. The two companies have competed for some 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The merger with Avondale significantly broadens Litton's  
market coverage in both military surface combatants and commercial 
ships,'' said Litton chairman Michael R. Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal ended a long period of courting Avondale.  
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding had been the first to bid for  
Avondale, offering $470 million in stock. Litton then offered $529 
million in cash for Avondale, about $39.50 per share. Avondale gave 
Newport News more time to improve its bid, but the Virginia-based 
company declined to raise its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton also pursued Newport News Shipbuilding, but withdrew its  
bid last month in the face of opposition from the Pentagon. A 
Litton-Newport News combination would have reduced the number of 
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale officials said they expect no layoffs and believe the  
merger will open the way for more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still unresolved is Avondale's six-year fight with the Metal  
Trade Council of the AFL-CIO, which has been trying to organize 
Avondale's 6,000 workers. Last month, a federal appeals court ruled 
that a 1993 union representation election was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials have said they hope Litton will recognize the  
union since Litton already has an organized force of 11,000 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton Ship Systems will be headed by Gerald St. Pe, who until  
recently was chief at Ingalls. Avondale chairman Albert Bossier 
will continue to be in charge of the New Orleans yard, but will 
report to St. Pe.

<HEADLINE> Photographer's View of Nixon's Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In one Watergate image, John Ehrlichman simply  
glares with every inch of clenched and jutting jaw and out-thrust 
lower lip. 
</P>
<P>
	In another, Bob Haldeman, also in the witness chair at the  
Senate Watergate hearings, burns in a sort of dark yet incandescent 
glow. 
</P>
<P>
	They had been Richard Nixon's gatekeepers, the controllers of  
the president's political environment -- Haldeman as White House 
chief of staff, Ehrlichman his other top aide. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Maroon's photographs reflect the situation of all three in  
the summer of 1973: under siege but fiercely defiant. 
</P>
<P>
	In an earlier shot, taken in far more controlled circumstances,  
Nixon steps between two White House columns and begins to 
disappear. The photograph leaves just a trailing right leg, 
polished black shoe and right arm in view. 
</P>
<P>
	Maroon looked up from his camera lens and asked about Nixon's  
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deliberately avoids us,'' an aide replied, giving the  
photographer his caption. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago this month -- Aug. 8, 1974 -- Nixon  
submitted a one-sentence letter of resignation to Secretary of 
State Henry Kissinger and ended the 37th American presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American  
History is displaying an exhibit with 145 of Maroon's 
black-and-white images from the Nixon era -- many of them never 
published nor widely viewed, all stashed in a vault for the last 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	A large-format book, ``The Nixon Years,'' with photographs by  
Maroon and text by Tom Wicker, a retired New York Times Washington 
bureau chief, will be published by Abbeville Press in September. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 25 years I waited for the passions to cool in this  
American tragedy, but I ultimately realized I would not live long 
enough to see that happen,'' said Maroon, a freelance photographer 
who has recorded the people and monuments of official Washington 
for nearly 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	For Maroon, the story began early in the Nixon administration,  
when he was given the opportunity to photograph the presidential 
workday, first at the White House and then at the Committee to 
Re-elect the President. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued to work on his own after the Watergate scandal  
broke, covering the Senate Watergate hearings, the House 
impeachment hearings and finally, Nixon's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply had a sense I was witnessing a pivotal moment in  
American history, and that I should stay with it until the 
conclusion,'' Maroon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he shot 576 rolls of film.  
</P>
<P>
	When he began in 1970, Maroon witnessed ``a staff in control of  
everything that happened.'' In the week before Nixon resigned, 
control had been replaced by ``uncertainty and apprehension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maroon visited Nixon's re-election committee just days after the  
arrest inside Democratic National Committee headquarters of a team 
of burglars with ties to committee officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys will do anything to get a little publicity,'' Maroon  
cracked to Jeb Stuart Magruder, the deputy campaign director. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never occurred to me at the time that they had anything to  
do with it,'' Maroon said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the photographer gradually began to become aware of the  
committee's tight security, its general air of ``paranoia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I started taking notice of things differently,'' Maroon wrote.  
``Surveillance cameras and rooms with a lot of electronic devices 
took on a new meaning. I thought I should photograph them and the 
shredding machine ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Senate Watergate hearings opened, many of the people  
Maroon had met earlier at the White House and the re-election 
committee were summoned to testify and the photographer saw ``the 
anguish of the situation etched on their faces.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maroon said John Mitchell, Nixon's former campaign chairman,  
spotted him in the Senate Caucus Room and asked what he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I was continuing my photographic record of the  
Nixon era and asked whether he did not agree that what was 
happening was of some moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope it's a fleeting moment,'' Mitchell replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, it was August 1974. The Republican leaders of Congress  
had told Nixon he didn't have the votes to stave off impeachment. 
Maroon photographed the growing crowds at the White House fence; 
the prayer vigil for the president at the Northwest gate; the man 
with the hand-lettered sign reading, ``Don't resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Nixon did resign, and in a long, rambling speech said  
goodbye to the White House staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``The speech went on for quite a long time,'' Maroon wrote. ``It  
became heart-wrenching. You were glad for him when he finished 
because you felt such grief for the country and for what was going 
on inside of him.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> O's Johnson Not Slowed by Diabetes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Most pitchers put on a warmup jacket and sit in  
the dugout between innings. Jason Johnson of the Baltimore Orioles 
slips into a back room and pricks one of his fingers with a lancet. 
</P>
<P>
	He then places the blood sample on a strip and slides it into a  
pocket-sized machine that tells him how much sugar is in his blood. 
If the level is too low, he sips a sports drink before returning to 
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a right-hander, has Type 1 diabetes. That means his  
pancreas can't make insulin, a protein that helps control the 
body's conversion of sugar into energy. Without careful monitoring, 
diabetes can lead to heart and kidney problems and blindness. 
</P>
<P>
	But because Johnson carefully controls the disease, he insists  
it doesn't make him a novelty in the Baltimore clubhouse or hinder 
his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know about it and I know about it. I'm just like anybody  
else,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 25, was obtained in a March 29 trade with the Tampa Bay  
Devil Rays. He started the season in the minors, but was called up 
in May and has since become a fixture in the starting rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1.2 million people in the United States have Type 1  
diabetes, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
figures. Few of those people are major league baseball players, but 
Johnson is not alone in managing the disease as a professional 
athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Knicks center Chris Dudley has diabetes, as does Jay  
Leeuwenberg of the Indianapolis Colts, who appears on a promotional 
poster for the International Diabetic Athletes Association. The 
3,500-member group includes marathon runners, mountain climbers and 
cyclists training for the Olympics, according to director Linda 
McClure. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other athletes with diabetes, Johnson follows a strict  
regimen to keep his blood sugar steady. In addition to checking his 
blood sugar level between every inning when he is pitching, he must 
inject himself with insulin three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	When traveling for games in different time zones, Johnson  
adjusts his injection schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson learned he had diabetes at age 11, and in the years  
after several coaches and teachers unfamiliar with the disease were 
uncertain about his chances of excelling in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``My way of showing them, 'Listen, I'm not different from  
anybody else,' was by performing and doing what any other kid could 
do,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he wants to help doctors convince young children with  
diabetes that they can succeed in professional baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jason wants to prove to everybody that you can live normally  
with what he has to live with,'' Orioles manager Ray Miller said.

<HEADLINE> Politicians Fight Back With Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTCALM TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Hardy and sociable, township  
Supervisor Bob Lewis is a straight talker who prides himself on 
running township meetings efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
	And with long days of tending to his hay field and business, the  
former fire chief likes to relax with a drink. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I like a beer? Sure. I love hot dogs and beer. Popcorn and  
beer is great. But last time I checked, temperate drinking was not 
a crime,'' Lewis says. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not a crime, but Lewis' fondness for alcohol and his  
outspoken style have become a public issue. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, residents of this farming community 150 miles  
northwest of Detroit will vote in a special recall election, with 
the top complaints being that Lewis ``conducted regular township 
meetings while visibly under the influence of alcohol'' and 
denounced township officials at meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of dozens of recall elections that will take place  
around the state this year -- and state Rep. Charles LaSata says 
that's too many. While backers of the recalls say they have good 
reasons, LaSata says there is a culture of ``recall rage'' and is 
sponsoring legislation to limit them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to root out the bad apples, but not at the expense of  
driving good people out of elected office,'' he says. ``That's what 
is happening today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaSata, a Republican from St. Joseph, points to his home county  
as an example. From December 1996 to March 1999, 50 recall 
petitions were filed for approval in Berrien County, according to 
the clerk's records. That compares with 101 petitions filed during 
the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
	LaSata says elected officials shouldn't have to worry about  
whether they will face recall over a controversial decision or 
personality conflict. If they have that constant fear, ``everybody 
will run toward the middle,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	His bill would allow recalls only if the official had done  
something illegal or improper or did not fulfill the duties of the 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would call for significant judicial oversight of  
the recall process: The county election commissions would determine 
if there was sufficient reason for the recall, and the decision 
would be subject to review by a circuit court judge. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall option is not available for members of Congress. The  
U.S. Constitution allows removal only through resignation or 
expulsion by the U.S. House or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan is one of 20 states that have recall provisions for  
state or local officials, while the rest use an impeachment process 
for removal. Restrictions such as those in LaSata's bill are law in 
Alaska, Florida, Kansas, Montana, Washington and Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ballot in Georgia is heavily weighted to when you elect  
somebody, you keep them in office, unless there is some egregious 
violation,'' says Chris Riggall, spokesman for the Georgia 
Secretary of State. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current Michigan law, recalls can be held for just about  
any reason, as long as the petitioner gets enough signatures to 
place it on the ballot and the petition language is deemed clear 
enough for voters to understand. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those who have pushed for recalls say that gathering  
signatures, getting the language approved and encouraging people to 
vote against their leaders requires an organized and motivated 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Wiecek is a Warren City Council member who was involved in  
an 1989 effort to recall the mayor and six council members for 
presiding over a tax increase. 
</P>
<P>
	He says the mayor had political allies among the elections  
commissioners. It took 10 tries over 10 months to get the language 
approved and by that time, he says, many of the people behind the 
effort had become discouraged and never collected the signatures 
needed to put the issue to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ability to frustrate the citizens' right to recall is just  
unbelievable,'' Wiecek says. ``It's a powerful tool that the 
incumbents have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some officials who have faced a recall say they also have to  
spend significant effort to keep their job. Genesee Township 
Supervisor Fred Muhl beat a recall last November after spending 
more than $2,000 on legal bills to fight the petition language. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Michigan's House Republican leadership appears to agree  
with the intent of LaSata's legislation, its future is unclear 
because of concerns about whether it violates the state 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Montcalm Township residents are gearing up for Lewis'  
recall question. Neither side is willing to predict how it will 
turn out, saying it is going to be close. 
</P>
<P>
	Although nobody disputes that Lewis likes to drink -- including  
Lewis himself -- he denies that he is ``visibly under the 
influence'' at board meetings and claims the recall is a 
politically motivated attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Township Treasurer Diane Fountain supports Lewis but prefers not  
to speak out ``because I could be next on the list.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I do think in the future it will deter people from running,''  
she says. ``You don't want such negative things said about you all 
over the newspapers in front of your family.''

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Albanians Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Postal workers and university  
professors returned to their jobs in Kosovo's capital today, nine 
years after they were drummed out by a Serb purge of ethnic 
Albanian workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Kouchner, who heads the U.N. mission in Kosovo,  
accompanied hundreds of ethnic Albanian postal and 
telecommunications workers back to their jobs at the main 
headquarters building in downtown Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an important day in the rebuilding of Kosovo,''  
Kouchner told the workers. ``It is a very important day because the 
workers are going back to their work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of U.N. efforts to return to ethnic Albanians,  
who form the vast majority in the Serbian province, much of the 
power they lost in 1989-1990 when Belgrade revoked Kosovo's 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, some 600 ethnic Albanian postal workers lost their  
jobs. Today they took up their old jobs alongside the Serbs who 
remained in their positions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since September 1990, I dreamed about this day, because  
when I was expelled I never thought I would be back here again,'' 
said 50-year-old Emine Rexhepi. ``But hey, dreams do come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kouchner promised money and equipment to help rebuild the  
damaged and outdated telecommunications network in the province. 
The United Nations estimates improvements to the system will cost 
$1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Albanian professors and students also returned today to  
Pristina's main university campus, which they were forced to leave 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebel leader Hashim Thaci joined a ceremony marking the return  
of around 5,000 students, who will spend the month making up missed 
classes and exams to be ready for the official start of classes in 
September. All classes will be held in Albanian. 
</P>
<P>
	``A ghost once said that we will never step onto this university  
again,'' university rector Zenel Kelmendi said at the ceremony, 
referring to the Serbs who drove them out. ``But we are here now 
and we are here to stay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The employee returns were a step forward after a weekend plagued  
by more violence between ethnic Albanians and Kosovo's minority 
Serbs. A Serb Orthodox church was bombed Sunday in Pristina, 
causing no casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a British team detonated a hand grenade and a suspicious  
package found in the yard of a Serb house in Pristina. The blasts 
caused no damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, a U.S. soldier -- identified as Pfc. Benjamin A.  
McGill, 20 -- was electrocuted while on patrol in the eastern sector 
of Kosovo, when the antenna on his M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle 
struck a powerline, a statement from the U.S. military said. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement, out of the U.S. press office in Urosevac, Kosovo,  
did not specify McGill's hometown, but said his father and mother 
live in Florida.

<HEADLINE> What Went Wrong at Woodstock '99? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The promoters of Woodstock '99 should have  
anticipated problems when the festival's more aggressive lineup 
played before such a big crowd, according to a musician who 
headlined one all-night rave. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular musicians at the event -- Korn, Limp Bizkit, Kid  
Rock and Rage Against the Machine -- specialize in a particularly 
combative mixture of hard rock and rap, said the techno artist 
Moby. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have a rock festival based on peace and love and  
invite Kid Rock and Insane Clown Posse,'' he said. ``It's just 
foolishness. Look at the people who go to their shows regularly -- 
macho idiots. So, of course those same macho idiots are going to 
show up at your rock festival and cause trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99 ended in an ugly orgy of violence, with  
tractor-trailers set ablaze, vendor stands overrun and authorities 
pelted with bottles. At least six victims of rape and sexual 
assault have come forward, and more are anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say detractors shouldn't forget that many fans  
enjoyed themselves, and that the riot happened after most had left. 
But they're second-guessing everything from security arrangements 
to the music lineup to figure out what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't figure out a way to deal with the things that went  
wrong, then I don't think there could be another one,'' said John 
Scher, a promoter of last weekend's three-day music festival that 
drew 225,000 people to Rome, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock needed a wide cross-section of artists to draw such a  
large crowd, Scher said. In retrospect, however, he's 
second-guessing his decision to have Limp Bizkit, Rage Against the 
Machine and the heavy metal band Metallica play in succession 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't take into account what a frenzy the audience could  
have been in by putting these three acts together,'' he said. At 
one point, the crowd was so edgy that Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst 
needed to calm things down -- but a panicked engineer had cut off 
the public address system, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police Superintendent James McMahon said police did not  
move in faster because reinforcements were needed to replace the 
officers who were outside the festival directing traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't initially see that there was any physical danger to  
concertgoers inside,'' McMahon said. ``When you are going in to a 
violent situation, you want to go in with sufficient numbers to 
ensure everyone's safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scher would not comment on whether a quicker response could have  
prevented trouble. ``Certainly, it was nearing getting out of 
control while they were mobilizing, but I don't know what you could 
have done about it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock's internal, unarmed, security force of 1,250 people  
was not trained to deal with situations this serious, Scher said. 
Promoters were reluctant to have a large police presence on the 
grounds during the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``There unquestionably was an element of the audience, a very  
small element, that was impossible or nearly impossible to control 
... by traditional musical security means,'' he said. ``No one 
wants to be doing rock 'n' roll shows in an armed camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock promoters plan to look back to see what could have  
been done better, including providing for mosh pit safety. Scher 
said videotapes of the performance will be turned over to police 
investigating rape charges. Organizers also have the names and 
addresses of about 80 percent of the audience on file and will give 
them to police. 
</P>
<P>
	Scher noted that the original Woodstock in 1969 was considered  
chaotic in its immediate aftermath, but time has softened the 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes the good moments of Woodstock '99 aren't forgotten.  
</P>
<P>
	``In society right now there are some bad people, no question  
about it,'' he said. ``And some of them were at Woodstock. But 
there were some good kids there, too.'' 
</P>

	Stocks Close Lower; Dow Down 9.19  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The threat of higher interest rates demolished a  
rally on Wall Street today, sending stocks lower even after a new 
report suggested the economy may not be overheating. The Dow Jones 
industrial average closed down 9.19 at 10,645.96. The index had 
risen as much as 136 points earlier in the session. Broader stock 
indicators also gave up early gains and finished lower. The Nasdaq 
composite index fell 14.86 to 2,623.63. Stocks, which incurred 
steep losses last week, had rebounded in early trading today after 
the National Association of Purchasing Management said the U.S. 
manufacturing sector grew in July for the sixth consecutive month, 
but not as strongly as most analysts expected.

	Manufacturing Sector Grows in July  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The nation's manufacturers reported a slowing of  
growth in July with only modest increases in prices of raw 
materials. A survey released today by the National Association of 
Purchasing Management indicated that the U.S. manufacturing sector 
grew in July for the sixth straight month, but less than in the 
previous month and below analysts' predictions. Price increases 
also were below expectations. The figures suggest that a 
second-quarter slowing of the overall economy's growth is 
continuing into the third quarter. ``The report put a damper on any 
plan by the Fed to immediately raise interest rates,'' said 
economist Sung Won Sohn at Wells Fargo. Meanwhile, the Commerce 
Department reported construction spending rebounded slightly in 
June, rising 0.5 percent, after falling for two straight months.

much as 25 percent. United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, 
and No. 2 American Airlines were among those matching the sale, 
which includes most of the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Canada. 
Other airlines matching included U.S. Airways, America West, 
Continental, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines.

	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sun Microsystems is designing a new  
computer chip geared toward its Java programming language, setting 
up a possible faceoff with Intel. The new MAJC -- pronounced 
``magic'' -- semiconductor is ``intended for the rapidly emerging 
market of applications that blend communications, exciting visual 
images, sound and compute functionality,'' according to a draft 
press release from Sun. The new chips are expected to compete with 
the market-dominating Pentiums and other microprocessors made by 
Intel. Sun plans to present an overview of the MAJC architecture at

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators said today that 99 percent  
of the nation's banks, thrifts and credit unions have completed 
testing for the Year 2000 bug in their computer systems. They added 
without giving specific numbers that most financial institutionsare 
already using computer systems that are Year 2000 compliant every 
day without problems. Among the nation's 10,335 banks and thrifts, 
10,246 received the highest possible rating for readiness, 78 were 
told they needed to improve and 11 drew unsatisfactory ratings, 
according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A similar 
breakdown among the 10,807 credit unions included in the overall 
assessment wasn't immediately available.

	Celebrex Beats Viagra in Sales

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't create a national sensation like  
Viagra, but the new arthritis pill Celebrex has surpassed the 
impotence medicine as the nation's fastest-selling new drug ever. 
Celebrex promises pain relief with fewer stomach problems than 
other drugs. Unlike Viagra, patients take it every day and it's 
usually covered by insurance. Celebrex, which was introduced in 
January, sold 6.86 million prescriptions during its first six 
months on the market, compared with 6.05 million for Viagra during 
its first six months, according to IMS Health, a research company.

	CBS Earnings Rise Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. credited strong growth in its  
television and radio businesses for a large jump in second-quarter 
earnings. CBS reported today it earned $95 million, or 13 cents a 
share, compared with $4 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same 
period a year ago. The earnings matched Wall Street expectations. 
CBS president Mel Karmazin singled out a strong showing at the 
company's TV network business as an engine behind the profit surge. 
CBS was the top-rated network last season, taking the No. 1 spot 
for the first time in five years. Shares of CBS were at 44 7/8, up 
15/16.

	DETROIT (AP) -- AutoNation Inc. plans to separate its lackluster  
rental-car business, including the big Alamo and National chains, 
from its growing auto sales operations in what could lead to its 
eventual spinoff or sale. Separating the rental unit will allow 
investors ``to better recognize and evaluate the strengths and 
growth prospects of our automotive retail operations,'' Chairman H. 
Wayne Huizenga said in the company's second-quarter earnings report

how the separation will take place.

	PROBUS, England (AP) -- A government minister today slapped an  
official approval stamp on the first British beef carcass destined 
for foreign consumers since exports were banned three years ago. 
Yesterday, European regulators lifted the ban imposed after an 
outbreak of mad cow disease. The carcass was brought into a

France in mid-August as centerpiece of a marketing drive to 
persuade the French to buy British beef again.

<HEADLINE>  Mourners Bury Atlanta Killer's Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LIZELLA, Ga. (AP) -- The Rev. Doug Davis remembered ``I'll Fly  
Away'' as one of Leigh Ann Barton's favorite songs. It's soaring 
chorus often blared from her car. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the gospel tune reverberated through Davis' rural  
church as family and friends mourned the death of Mrs. Barton, the 
first of 12 victims in her husband's killing spree last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question lies before us, 'How do we go on from here?'''  
Davis said to about 400 mourners at Lizella Baptist Church, 11 
miles west of Macon where Mrs. Barton grew up. ``God's answer to 
how to go on is love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Barton, 44, killed his wife with a hammer Tuesday night in  
her suburban apartment south of Atlanta. On Wednesday, he 
bludgeoned his two children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, he marched into two brokerage firms in Atlanta's  
Buckhead commercial district and opened fire with two handguns, 
killing nine people and wounding 13 others. Hours later, Barton 
committed suicide when police cornered him at a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis urged the mourners not to allow Mrs. Barton's ``murder to  
cloud our memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm afraid there's a temptation to become focused on the  
horrible events of last week,'' Davis said. ``If we give into that 
temptation, we do a great disservice to Leigh Ann.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her white casket was flanked by pink roses, heart-shaped  
bouquets and spring arrangements of purple and lavender, Mrs. 
Barton's favorite colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said one of the greatest impressions that he had of Mrs.  
Barton was how she loved and cared for her husband's children. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was a soccer mom for Matthew and a Girl Scout leader for  
Mychelle,'' he said. Several Girl Scouts, wearing their blue 
uniforms and sashes, passed a package of tissues among themselves 
before the service started. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral for the children -- Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7 -- was  
scheduled today in Lithia Springs, just west of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis also read a letter from Mrs. Barton's sister, Dana Reeves,  
that addressed the 27-year-old by her nickname, ``Goldilocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I only wish I could have spared you all of this ... I know you  
are in a safe place now,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Barton's was one of two funerals held Sunday as Atlanta  
area churches tried to cope with the violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Services for shooting victim Vadewattee Muradlidhara, 44, were  
held Sunday afternoon in Peachtree City. She will be buried in her 
native Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was always vibrant. She never really was down,'' friend  
Doleford Payne said at the service. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was also held for Allen Charles Tenenbaum,  
who was buried Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many churches in the Atlanta area addressed the violence in  
Sunday's regular services. 
</P>
<P>
	At St. Pius X Roman Catholic Church in the Atlanta suburb of  
Conyers, several parishioners knew Joe Dessert, a retired real 
estate broker who was dabbling in day trading. He was one of those 
killed at the offices of All-Tech Investment Group. 
</P>
<P>
	One said he had tried to get Dessert to quit day trading at  
All-Tech, where Barton also traded. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just wasn't like him to gamble like that,'' said Tony  
Nicholson, who had lunch with 60-year-old Dessert an hour before 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton's lawyer said Sunday the gunman approved some changes to  
his will Thursday morning, a few hours before the shootings. He 
gave no indication he had already killed his wife and children, 
lawyer Joe Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked in all respects normal, just like any other time he  
came into my office,'' Fowler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fowler would not comment on Barton's changes.  
</P>
<P>
	In its Aug. 9 issue, Newsweek magazine reports that Barton  
recently changed his profile on his America Online account to 
include guns as a hobby and ``Make my day'' -- the line Clint 
Eastwood's character Dirty Harry uttered before gunning criminals -- 
as his personal motto. 
</P>
<P>
	The children's mother, Debra Barton, and maternal grandmother  
were hacked to death in Alabama in 1993. Police said Barton, who 
was having an affair with then-Leigh Ann Vandiver, was a suspect 
although he was never charged.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Floods Create Shortages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DONGDUCHON, South Korea (AP) -- Shortages of food, water and  
blankets slowed efforts Monday to help thousands of people left 
homeless by deadly flooding in South Korea. Victims accused the 
government of being poorly prepared for the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days of torrential rains have left at least 20 dead and 24  
missing. Another powerful storm approached the Korean peninsula 
from the South Pacific, raising fears of more flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	Many residents whose homes were flooded complained that the  
government had failed to raise embankments and take other 
preventive measures after similar flooding in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same thing happened last year and our entire house was  
under water for days. I don't understand why the authorities didn't 
do anything,'' said Kim Jum-ae, a 57-year-old housewife. 
</P>
<P>
	She had taken shelter with two dozen other people in the  
basement of a Roman Catholic church in Dongduchon, 26 miles north 
of the South Korean capital of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	They were among more than 19,000 people who fled their homes in  
an area between Seoul and the border with North Korea, 35 miles 
from the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsoon rains also wracked other Asian countries, causing deadly  
floods and landslides. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Philippines, two days of rain left at least 16 people  
dead, including a family of seven whose house was hit by landslide. 
Ten others were missing. In Vietnam, 16 people were dead and 11 
missing after flash floods. And four people died and in flooding in 
eastern Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Korea, aid workers were frustrated by limited  
resources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are short of everything here. Volunteers, foods, blankets,  
especially clean water,'' said Chung Moon-suk of South Korea's Red 
Cross. The water supply for Dongduchon had been cut off since 
Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Yonchon, another hard-hit town, a section of a reservoir  
collapsed and unleashed cascades of water. The same section caved 
in last year and some villagers complained of a sloppy repair job. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, President Kim Dae-jung said government measures  
since last year had prevented damage on a much greater scale, but 
he acknowledged shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have problems to solve,'' he said. ``The same  
disaster erupted in some towns that took precious lives. That calls 
for our grave reflection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition leaders wanted more.  
</P>
<P>
	``The government should apologize to the people of Korea for not  
having set up any lasting plan to prevent such disasters,'' said 
Ahn Taek-soo, a spokesman for the Grand National Party, the main 
opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
	Several bridges and many roads were blocked and police ordered  
drivers to make detours. Heavy machinery cleared roads littered 
with rocks that had slid off hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said 20 people were killed and 24 missing. Those  
missing included 10 vacationers from Seoul who were buried in a 
landslide in Hwachon near the North Korean border early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 23 inches of rain fell in some locations, and more than  
47,000 acres of rice paddies were washed out. Nearly 7,000 houses 
in dozens of towns and villages were swamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, three weeks of rain that began in August killed at  
least 271 South Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea also reported heavy damage to crops from storms that  
unleashed up to 16 inches of rain over the weekend. Buildings and 
roads were submerged and some railway and telephone lines were cut, 
North Korean radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge floods hit the reclusive communist country in 1995, forcing  
it to plead for outside food aid. Flooding and drought that ensued 
caused famine in the North, killing 220,000 people, by the 
Pyongyang government's own figures. U.S. congressional officials 
said more than 2 million North Koreans may have died. 
</P>
<P>
	The South's official Yonhap news agency said 25,000 soldiers  
near the border with North Korea were ordered to higher ground. 
U.S. soldiers built walls of sandbags to protect their bases. About 
37,000 American troops are stationed in South Korea.

Osuna's right elbow at Centinela Hospital Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament was discovered  
last month after Osuna reported stiffness in the elbow during a 
rehabilitation assignment with San Bernardino of the California 
League. The team announced Monday that Osuna needed the operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna, who was placed on the disabled list for the third time  
this season on May 18, pitched in just five games for the Dodgers 
in his fifth major league season. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old right-hander had surgery to remove bone spurs in  
the same elbow last September and again in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Osuna did not record a decision in any of his appearances this  
season and compiled a 7.71 ERA. He is 21-15 with a 3.15 ERA in 219 
career games.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo To Submit New Debt Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Under pressure from creditor banks,  
South Korea's troubled Daewoo group will submit new plans this week 
on how to pay off billions of dollars in debt, bank and Daewoo 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Korea First Bank, the principal domestic creditor of Daewoo,  
said the group is required to submit a revised restructuring plan 
by Thursday on how to speed up its repayment of bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Daewoo's revised plan, creditors will announce a final  
restructuring scenario for the conglomerate by Aug. 11, bank 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daewoo's restructuring plan announced last month lacks  
credibility, so the group is being asked to submit new plans that 
can accelerate the breakup of its bloated operations,'' Korea First 
Bank spokesman Min Young-shik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo, South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, narrowly  
escaped becoming South Korea's largest-ever bankruptcy when 
creditors agreed last week to delay repayment of $8.3 billion in 
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, Daewoo put up $8.42 billion of stock and real estate  
as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
	But doubts persisted over Daewoo's commitment -- or its ability --  
to sell off dozens of affiliates within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government then ordered creditor banks to intervene to  
accelerate the conglomerate's restructuring and breakup. Most of 
the banks are controlled either directly or indirectly by the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is suggesting that the creditor banks sell  
Daewoo's collateral and turn their loans into equity so that they 
can lower the group's debt and make its subsidiaries more 
attractive to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	It wants Daewoo to concentrate on its two main businesses -- the  
flagship trading arm Daewoo Corp. and Daewoo Motors, the nation's 
second-largest carmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo said it has $49 billion in debts, of which $9.94 billion  
is owed to foreign creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo officials said they were considering whether to ask  
foreign creditors to continue to roll over maturing loans.

<HEADLINE> EU Approves Takeover of Hillsdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union regulators on Monday  
approved the $1.3 billion takeover by U.S. corporation Hicks, Muse, 
Tate and Furst Inc. of Hillsdown Holdings PLC, a British maker of 
furniture, canned food and other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the companies' different lines of products and their  
limited market shares, the operation does not raise competition 
concerns,'' said a statement from the European Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU executive agency said there was some potential overlap  
between the two companies in the European canned food market but 
not enough to provoke fears of an anti-competitive position. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks, Muse confirmed in June it had beat British  
venture-capital group Candover Investments PLC in a bidding war for 
Hillsdown. The deal is the Dallas-based corporation's biggest in 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU Commission checks all mergers and takeovers with a major  
impact on markets within the 15-nation bloc and can bar those 
deemed to inhibit fair business competition.

<HEADLINE> Shroud of Turin Said Pre-8th Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A new analysis of pollen grains and plant  
images on the Shroud of Turin places its origin to Jerusalem before 
the 8th Century. 
</P>
<P>
	The study gives a boost to those who believe the shroud is the  
burial cloth of Jesus and refutes a 1988 examination by scientists 
that concluded the shroud was made between 1260 and 1390. 
</P>
<P>
	The earlier study also indicated the shroud came from Europe  
rather than the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have identified by images and by pollen grains species on  
the shroud restricted to the vicinity of Jerusalem,'' botany 
professor Avinoam Danin of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem said 
Monday during the International Botanical Congress here. ``The 
sayings that the shroud is from European origin can't hold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 4,000 scientists from 100 countries are taking part in  
the botanical conference, which focuses on a wide range of issues 
related to plants. 
</P>
<P>
	The shroud contains pollen grains and the image of a crucified  
man, as well as faint images of plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysis of the floral images, and a separate analysis of the  
pollen grains by another botanist, Uri Baruch, identified a 
combination of plant species that could be found only in March and 
April in the region of Jerusalem, Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danin identified a high density of pollen of the tumbleweed  
Gundelia tournefortii. The analysis also found the bean caper 
(Zygophyllum dumosum). The two species coexist in a limited area, 
Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This combination of flowers can be found in only one region of  
the world,'' he said. ``The evidence clearly points to a floral 
grouping from the area surrounding Jerusalem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An image of the Gundelia tournefortii can be seen near the image  
of the man's shoulder. Some experts have suggested that the plant 
was used for the ``crown of thorns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two pollen grains of the species were also found on the Sudarium  
of Oviedo, believed to be the burial face cloth of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	Danin, who has done extensive study on plants in Jerusalem, said  
the pollen grains are native to the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Sudarium of Oviedo has resided in the Cathedral of  
Oviedo in Spain since the 8th century, Danin said that the matchup 
of pollen grains pushes the shroud's date to a similar age. Both 
cloths also carry type AB blood stains in similar patterns, Danin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pollen association and the similarities in the blood  
stains in the two cloths provide clear evidence that the shroud 
originated before the 8th Century,'' Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The location of the Sudarium of Oviedo has been documented since  
the first century. If it is found that the two cloths are linked, 
then the shroud could date back even further, Danin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1988 study used carbon-14 dating tests. Danin noted that the  
earlier study looked at only a single sample, while he used the 
entire piece of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shroud of Turin is a linen about 13 feet long and 3 feet  
wide that has been kept in the city of Turin, Italy, since 1578. 
The shroud bears the image of a man with wounds similar to those 
suffered by Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is something that many Catholics and other Christians hold  
very dear,'' Steve Mamanella, spokesman for the Archdiocese of St. 
Louis, said of the shroud. ``Perhaps this helps solidify that 
particular belief.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Drought Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the current heat wave has caused great  
hardship, President Clinton today announced emergency drought 
assistance for farmers and money for providing air conditioners and 
fans for the elderly and poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the White House, Clinton announced emergency,  
low-interest loans would be made available to family farms in West 
Virginia and several counties in surrounding states, and said other 
efforts are being made to help farmers get water and hay for their 
livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's literally a problem for them to keep their livelihoods  
alive,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would work with Congress on a $10 billion emergency  
drought assistance request ``to provide the resources to help our 
farmers and ranchers to deal with the crisis today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also said $100 million was being allocated to provide  
air conditioners and fans for low-income families and senior 
citizens. ``I expect we will be doing more things in the days 
ahead,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 191 people have died nationwide as a result of  
oppressively hot temperatures since July 19. In Illinois alone, 80 
deaths have been attributed to the heat.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Judge: Electric Chair Not Cruel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The blood came from beneath the mask  
covering Allen Lee Davis' face, dribbling onto his chest and oozing 
through the strap securing him to Florida's electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the 344-pound convicted murderer argued that Davis  
was enduring cruel and unusual punishment. They said he likely died 
even before the electricity coursed through his body July 8. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Circuit Judge Clarence Johnson disagreed, ruling Monday  
that the chair worked as intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Allen Lee Davis did not suffer any conscious pain while being  
electrocuted in Florida's electric chair,'' Johnson wrote in his 
33-page decision. ``Rather, he suffered instantaneous and painless 
death once the current was applied to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Provenzano, 50, awaiting execution for a deadly 1984  
shooting spree in an Orlando courtroom that killed two bailiffs and 
left another paralyzed, doesn't want to die like Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys introduced into evidence photos taken by  
Department of Corrections workers after Davis' execution. The 
photos showed a bloodied Davis grimacing as a leather mouth strap 
covered his mouth and pushed up against his nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to rectify the photos with any state position  
that this is a humane or a dignified death,'' said lawyer Harry 
Brody, who represents Provenzano. 
</P>
<P>
	His attorneys said they are optimistic that the state's Supreme  
Court will reverse the judge's decision and declare electrocution 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson presided over a four-day hearing last week ordered by  
the Florida Supreme Court after Davis' execution. Davis, 54, 
nicknamed ``Tiny,'' was electrocuted for the 1982 murder of a 
pregnant woman and her two daughters in Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's ruling is not binding. The state Supreme Court is  
scheduled to hear arguments on the issue Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Jeb Bush said he was pleased with Johnson's ruling, calling  
it ``a victory for justice in Florida'' that was ``welcomed by 
victims of violent crimes throughout the state,'' said spokeswoman 
Lucia Ross. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the state argued there is no evidence that Davis  
suffocated. They said the mouth strap is necessary to keep an 
inmate's head in place during execution. The judge agreed, but 
suggested a smaller mouth strap might be preferable. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also concluded the electrical current did not cause  
Davis' nose to bleed, although he said he was not sure what did. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the electrocution of Pedro Medina in 1997, the state  
decided to photograph inmates if anything unusual occurred during 
an execution. When Medina was put to death, flames shot out from 
behind the leather mask covering his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the state's high court upheld use of the electric  
chair after Medina's execution. In November, voters approved a 
constitutional amendment that would allow executions to be carried 
out by any other legal method if electrocution is ruled 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Corrections spokesman C.J. Drake said there was no  
question that the electric chair was reliable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judge Johnson has affirmed everything we have been saying all  
along.'' Drake said. ``That is, that the electric chair functions 
properly and that we follow all execution procedures and protocols 
very carefully.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Ads Urge Tobacco Law Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration is launching  
a new $5 million advertising campaign to encourage retailers not to 
sell tobacco products to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, to be run in five states and 11 metropolitan  
advertising markets starting Tuesday, will use radio, print and 
outdoor advertising to put over the message that the law forbids 
tobacco sales to children ``for a reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One newspaper ad poses the question, ``What would make you  
madder? A retailer selling cigarettes to a kid who's: a)9; b)14; or 
c) yours?'' A radio segment makes the point that one in every three 
smokers is killed by tobacco-related diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the effort, retailers may win tickets to sporting  
events or concerts if they refuse to sell to minors who conduct 
compliance monitoring for the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The new campaign continues an effort started by the FDA in 1997  
to give retailers the tools to comply with FDA regulations that 
forbid tobacco sales to anyone under 18. The regulation also 
requires retailers to check photo identification of all tobacco 
buyers 27 or younger. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailer kits related to the anti-tobacco campaign can be  
ordered free by calling 1-888-FDA-4KIDS.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Baseball: Cuba 5, US 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Cuba shrugged off defections, human  
rights protests and a pair of stunning losses to beat the United 
States 5-1 Monday night for the gold medal in Pan American Games 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Orestes Kindelan, the leading home run hitter in Cuban league  
history, hit two as the Cubans won their eighth straight Pan Ams 
title. They did it the hard way, losing to the Americans and 
Canadians in the opening round, dropping them to third in their 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
	But, despite the defection of 19-year-old pitcher Danys Baez  
late Sunday night, Cuba had more than enough for the collection of 
U.S. minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kindelan, who had 430 homers entering the game, but was 3-for-25  
in the tournament, hit a two-out homer in the fourth off starter 
Brad Penny for a 1-0 lead. The next batter, Gabriel Pierre, 
followed with another homer. 
</P>
<P>
	That was enough for starter Jose Contreras, pitching superbly on  
one day of rest. Contreras, who went six innings on Saturday in the 
quarterfinals vs. the Dominican Republic, fanned eight straight in 
the first three innings and allowed four hits in eight. He struck 
out 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen him pitch before. He is their best pitcher,'' U.S.  
manager Buddy Bell said. ``The guy is a horse, too, but he can't do 
that all the time -- or he shouldn't be able to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which like the Cubans qualified for the 2000  
Olympics by making the final, got within 2-1 in the fifth on a 
double by Milton Bradley and an RBI single by Marcus Jensen. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the sixth against reliever Derek Wallace, Omar Linares  
reached on an error by shortstop Travis Dawkins and Kindelan hit 
another home run. He also doubled in the eighth, when Cuba scored 
on a bases-loaded wild pitch by Todd Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Maels Rodriguez pitched the ninth, which began with Cuban  
players at the top of their dugout unfurling flags. Two were 
unfurled as many of their fans moved to the third-base grandstand 
and began beating drums and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
	When it ended, the players ran to the mound to hug each other  
amid the flags and drums and cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed right now,'' Bell said. ``The Cuban team is  
a very good, but not an unbeatable team by any means. It's 
disappointing, but we accomplished a lot here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada, despite the best record in the tournament, 6-1, got only  
a bronze medal and no trip to the Olympics. The Canadians beat 
Mexico 9-2 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it was Canada's first baseball medal at any major games.  
</P>
<P>
	``We accomplished not exactly what we wanted, but we weren't  
going to go home without any hardware,'' Stubby Clapp said. 
</P>
<P>
	During Cuba's 3-2 semifinal victory over Canada, a man carrying  
a sign saying ``Human Right First,'' rushed onto the field. He 
eventually was decked by second baseman Juan Padilla and taken off 
by security. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans criticized games officials for failing to stop the  
demonstrator from disrupting the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' a statement from the Cuban 
delegation said. ``From now on we will react with full energy to 
provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They certainly were energized in handling the Americans, who  
finished 5-2.

<HEADLINE>  Barton's Children Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Boy and girls dressed in their scout  
uniforms escorted the caskets Monday of Matthew and Mychelle 
Barton, whose father killed them and tucked them into bed with 
their toys before going on a deadly shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of the victims in soccer and cheerleading outfits had  
been placed outside the White Columns Funeral Home chapel in this 
Atlanta suburb, where they were eulogized as lovable and active 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts acted as pallbearers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to remind you how your lives have been enriched just by  
knowing them,'' Hennesy said, recalling how Matthew loved baseball 
and the Boy Scouts, and Mychelle was an active Girl Scout. 
``Sometimes the answers are not there for the understanding of man, 
but there for us when we get to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Mark O. Barton, killed the children Wednesday, a  
day after he had killed their stepmother. He bashed in their skulls 
with a hammer and dunked them in a bathtub to make sure they were 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note left at the scene, Barton said he wanted to spare the  
children from ``a lifetime of pain.'' A day later, Barton opened 
fire in two Atlanta brokerage offices, killing nine more. 
</P>
<P>
	At the church, Teddy bears and inscriptions ``Gone to be with  
Momma'' decorated the pulpit, where the Rev. Kenneth Hennesy told 
about 300 mourners that they shouldn't question why Matthew, 11, 
and Mychelle, 7, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Barton's two youngest victims was one of three  
held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, services were held for Kevin Dial, 36, a manager at  
Momentum Securities and one of the first to die in the shootings. 
Momentum officials said last week that Barton had lost more than 
$100,000 while day trading with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	During his funeral, his family disclosed that Dial -- son of  
former National Football League player Buddy Dial -- suffered from 
inoperable brain cancer that had not responded to treatment. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Barton's Children Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Boy and girls dressed in their scout  
uniforms escorted the caskets Monday of Matthew and Mychelle 
Barton, whose father killed them and tucked them into bed with 
their toys before going on a deadly shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of the victims in soccer and cheerleading outfits had  
been placed outside the White Columns Funeral Home chapel in this 
Atlanta suburb, where they were eulogized as lovable and active 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts acted as pallbearers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to remind you how your lives have been enriched just by  
knowing them,'' Hennesy said, recalling how Matthew loved baseball 
and the Boy Scouts, and Mychelle was an active Girl Scout. 
``Sometimes the answers are not there for the understanding of man, 
but there for us when we get to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Mark O. Barton, killed the children Wednesday, a  
day after he had killed their stepmother. He bashed in their skulls 
with a hammer and dunked them in a bathtub to make sure they were 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note left at the scene, Barton said he wanted to spare the  
children from ``a lifetime of pain.'' A day later, Barton opened 
fire in two Atlanta brokerage offices, killing nine more. 
</P>
<P>
	At the church, Teddy bears and inscriptions ``Gone to be with  
Momma'' decorated the pulpit, where the Rev. Kenneth Hennesy told 
about 300 mourners that they shouldn't question why Matthew, 11, 
and Mychelle, 7, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Barton's two youngest victims was one of three  
held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, services were held for Kevin Dial, 36, a manager at  
Momentum Securities and one of the first to die in the shootings. 
Momentum officials said last week that Barton had lost more than 
$100,000 while day trading with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	During his funeral, his family disclosed that Dial -- son of  
former National Football League player Buddy Dial -- suffered from 
inoperable brain cancer that had not responded to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's worth seeing or hearing or doing, I want to see it or  
hear it or do it now,'' Dial wrote in a letter he faxed to his 
mother, Janice Marye of Austin, the day before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandy Springs north of Atlanta, a memorial service was held  
for Russell Brown, a 42-year-old man who had been day trading at

<HEADLINE> Feds Boast of Exposing Tax Cheats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Federal officials boasted Monday that they  
have finally breached Cayman Islands bank secrecy with the aid of a 
former bank owner who provided records that exposed hundreds of 
U.S. citizens as tax cheats. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-time banker, John M. Mathewson, 71, was sentenced Monday  
in federal court here on conspiracy and money laundering charges. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities claim the case demonstrates that the  
approximately 500 banks in the tiny British colony exist only to 
serve as illegal tax shelters for a mainly American clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Mathewson's help, the U.S. government has  
recouped $50 million in back taxes and penalties, and can expect to 
get a total of $300 million, said his lawyer. Authorities could not 
confirm those figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cayman Islands are no longer the safe haven they once  
were,'' said a ranking FBI agent, Robert J. Jordan. ``This case 
enabled us to get on the inside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI, working with the Internal Revenue Service, is pursuing  
1,500 potential cases around the nation, Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank had about 2,000 depositors, and Mathewson dealt  
personally with each and prepared fake documents for shell 
corporations, invoices and other items to help conceal the true 
account holder and the extent of their business, said Paul L. 
Machalek, chief criminal investigator for the IRS in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities stumbled on the case by accident while pursuing a  
nationwide investigation into a cable piracy operation, according 
to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	When FBI agents arrested Mathewson in 1996, they found over a  
year's worth of computer records from the now-defunct Guardian Bank 
&AMP; Trust Limited of Grand Cayman, the papers show. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson immediately offered the records, leading to a  
continuing investigation that has so far brought cases in about 20 
states, Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Carney said in court 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Carney urged U.S. District Judge Alfred J. Lechner to give  
Mathewson a lenient sentence to acknowledge his cooperation, which 
included testifying to grand juries and obtaining computer software 
to decode the bank's computer tapes, which were encrypted. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying his cooperation ``has been unparalleled,'' Lechner  
sentenced Mathewson to five years' probation, with six months to be 
served under house arrest, a $30,000 fine and 500 hours of 
community service. He could have faced nearly five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mathewson pleaded guilty in March 1997 to federal charges  
including conspiracy, money laundering and aiding income tax 
evasions as part of plea bargains with federal prosecutors in 
Florida, New Jersey and New York.

poverty and near-poverty in the poorest and most rural county in 
the state. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slip / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices slipped on Monday, as pessimism  
among bond investors overshadowed a fresh suggestion that inflation 
pressures remained in check last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1/4  
point, or $2.50 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, a key 
influence on borrowing costs, rose to 6.12 percent from late 
Friday's 6.10 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's manufacturers reported a slowing of growth in July,  
with only modest increases in prices of raw materials. The survey 
by the National Association of Purchasing Management indicated that 
the U.S. manufacturing sector grew but not as strongly as in the 
previous month and below analysts' predictions. Price increases 
also were below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures helped bond prices rebound somewhat off early lows.  
But prices stayed depressed as the day wore on, hurt by continued 
concern by investors that interest rates will rise, hurting the 
value of their existing fixed-rate securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Many investors are convinced that the Federal Reserve will push  
its key lending rates higher again to keep inflation in check, 
particularly after the Labor Department reported Friday that 
employment costs rose 1.1 percent from April through June. That was 
the biggest quarterly change since the second-quarter of 1991, when 
wages and benefits increased 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell by 1/32 point, while intermediate-term Treasurys fell by 1/32 
point to 3/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on newly auctioned three-month Treasury bills rose to  
4.83 percent while the discount rate rose to 4.70 percent. Yield on 
newly auctioned six-month yields rose to 4.97 percent and the 
discount increased to 4.78 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields rose to 5.13 percent as the discount increased  
to 4.87 percent, up 0.03 percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.19 percent from Friday's 5.13 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 9/32 point to 117 15/32. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged from 5.59 percent Friday.

<HEADLINE> Driver in New Orleans Bus Crash Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of the charter bus that crashed on  
Mother's Day, killing 22 people on their way to a Mississippi 
casino, died of heart failure over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Frank Bedell, who had a history of heart disease  
and kidney problems, means no criminal charges will be filed in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Bedell was never interviewed by investigators,  
authorities may never know whether his health problems or history 
of illegal drug use contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, 46, collapsed Sunday at his home in Algiers. He was  
taken by ambulance to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell never spoke to investigators about the crash but told his  
lawyer he was trying to avoid a car that cut in front of him when 
he lost control of the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell had a heart condition that should have prevented him from  
keeping his commercial driver's license, officials said. About 12 
hours before the crash, Bedell received treatment in a hospital 
emergency room for dehydration and extremely low blood pressure 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Bedell had congestive heart disease, had lost  
two bus-driving jobs because he used marijuana, had failed a test 
for cocaine and was undergoing dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, tests found traces of marijuana in Bedell's blood  
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Information about Bedell's medical history never made it to  
federal and state authorities who could have prevented him from 
driving.

<HEADLINE> Warner Bros. Exec Meyer Named CEO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Time Warner's choice of one of the company's  
top insiders, Barry Meyer, to head its studio operations will 
provide a stable successor after the departure of one of 
Hollywood's best management teams, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer was named Monday as chairman and chief executive officer  
of Warner Bros., replacing the duo of Terry Semel and Bob Daly. Now 
executive vice president and chief operating officer, Meyer has 
been at Warner since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner named Alan Horn, chairman and CEO of its Castle Rock  
division, as president and chief operating officer for Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
	Choosing in-house successors made sense to maintain continuity,  
said Jessica Reif Cohen, a Time Warner analyst for Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not surprising. They had a very deep bench,'' Reif Cohen  
said. ``Barry Meyer is a phenomenal executive, one of the best in 
the industry. He's been there almost 30 years. He applies 
stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer and Horn will take over Oct. 4, after Semel and Daly  
leave. Semel and Daly, who have worked together since 1980 running 
Warner's studio operations, announced their resignations last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer will not inherit Semel and Daly's duties overseeing Warner  
Music Group, which they took on in 1995. A new leader for music 
operations will be named soon, said Gerald Levin, chairman and 
chief executive officer of Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	Splitting the businesses was a good move, said David Davis, an  
entertainment industry analyst with investment banker Houlihan 
Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin. Semel and Daly had been stretched thin when 
the music division was added, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The music division was the one area that lagged under Semel and  
Daly, Davis said. Overall, Warner has been one of Hollywood's most 
successful studios, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it has to do with the stability in management. Not  
just Semel and Daly. It's tentacles throughout the company,'' Davis 
said. ``It makes sense logically to promote from within.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meyer, 56, has been executive vice president since 1984 and  
chief operating officer of the Burbank-based studio since 1994. He 
came to work for Warner television in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Horn co-founded Castle Rock in 1987. The production company's  
films include ``When Harry Met Sally,'' ``City Slickers'' and ``A 
Few Good Men.''

<HEADLINE> Andre Reed, Bills Work Out Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDONIA, N.Y. (AP) -- Andre Reed, Buffalo's leading career  
receiver and one of its few remaining links to the Bills' four 
straight Super Bowl appearances, added another team record: 
shortest holdout. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who threatened to quit if the Bills refused to renegotiate  
his contract, practiced for the first time Monday after working out 
a contract extension with team owner Ralph Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted to play football,'' said Reed, 35. ``That's  
what I was born to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, who missed two minicamps as well as the first two days of  
training camp at Fredonia State, was uncharacteristically jovial 
after starting his 15th season in Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a nice talk with Mr. Wilson about a week and a half ago,  
and we talked about a lot of things,'' Reed said. ``And he agreed 
with me about a lot of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One thing they agreed upon was more money for Reed, who this  
season will make $2.2 million, or $900,000 more than his contract 
was due to pay him. 
</P>
<P>
	``All I wanted was to be treated fairly,'' Reed said. ``I just  
wanted to be paid. That's all you deserve. Fortunately we got 
something accomplished, and I'm here to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new deal sweetened the pot considerably for Reed, who got a  
$1.8 million signing bonus and a three-year pact that includes a 
one-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was born to wear a red, white and blue helmet, and when Mr.  
Wilson heard that he said `OK, OK,''' Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed showed up for the morning practice, having joined the Bills  
for their team meeting on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The third leading receiver on the NFL's career list behind Jerry  
Rice and Art Monk, Reed is one of only three Buffalo players -- 
along with Bruce Smith and Thurman Thomas -- still around from the 
team's four straight Super Bowl losses of the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	His teammates cheered as Reed took the field. He hugged Smith,  
stretched and pulled on his pads. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a little bit behind, which is funny,'' quarterback Doug  
Flutie said. ``He's got to catch up to some of the young guys, 
actually. But every time he runs a route he's open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After chatting with Eric Moulds, the team's leading receiver  
last year who credits Reed with helping him, Reed caught a pass in 
front of No. 1 draft pick Antoine Winfield and spun away from 
defensive back Donovan Greer. 
</P>
<P>
	One teammate sang a mock hymn in praise as Reed faced the press.  
</P>
<P>
	Reed joked with a television reporter: ``You said I was speeding  
down the highway and that's not right,'' Reed said. ``I was going 
the speed limit. No cops, man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week Reed's agent had all of Buffalo wondering if his  
client would follow Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek, who announced 
last week that he would retire after next season. However, Reed 
wouldn't have waited a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but I was contemplating not coming back,''  
Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
	With 889 receptions, including 63 last year, Reed needs just 51  
catches to pass Monk as the second-leading receiver in NFL history. 
Rice is first with 1,139. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew that was a milestone that was attainable this year,''  
Reed said. ``That would be a great thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reed, not always the most approachable of the Bills, relapsed  
into sarcasm when someone asked him if had a timetable for 
retirement. ``Do you? When are you going to retire, in about 20 
years?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he got serious. ``No, there's no such thing as a  
timetable,'' Reed said. ``I'm just going to see how it goes this 
year, how I feel at the end of the season. If I can stay healthy, 
I'll play again.''

<HEADLINE> Boilermakers Mourn Tiffany Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Her ankle badly sprained and Purdue clinging to a narrow lead  
over Duke, Stephanie White-McCarty sat nervously on the bench and 
held hands with teammate Tiffany Young as the Boilermakers won the 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, White-McCarty was speechless at news of her former  
teammate's death in a traffic accident over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was overwhelmed when I heard the tragic news of Tiffany's  
death, and I am still at a loss for words to describe how I feel 
about her being gone,'' said White-McCarty, now with the WNBA's 
Charlotte Sting. ``She was such a good person with nothing but love 
in her heart for everybody, and she cannot be replaced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Purdue's national championship team were reeling  
Monday from Young's death over the weekend when the car she was in 
was struck by a drunk driver. The 5-foot-11 guard played a reserve 
role on Purdue's national championship team, and players and 
coaches remembered her as a special presence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a very tight Purdue family, and this is a devastating  
loss,'' said her former coach Carolyn Peck, now with the WNBA's 
Orlando Miracle. ``Tiffany's smile could brighten up a room and she 
will be physically missed, but she will always be a part of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young started all 33 of Purdue's games during her sophomore  
season but was relegated to reserve duty this past year with the

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton called her  
husband's infidelity ``a sin of weakness'' and insisted in a 
magazine interview that she has stayed with him out of love and not 
for her own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with Talk magazine, Mrs. Clinton emphasized that  
her husband's affair with Monica Lewinsky happened after the deaths 
of his mother and her father, and the 1993 suicide of their close 
friend Vincent Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know in Christian theology there are sins of weakness and  
sins of malice, and this was a sin of weakness,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was impeached by the House for lying about his  
affair with the former White House intern. The Senate acquitted him 
after a trial in February. 
</P>
<P>
	``He couldn't protect me, so he lied,'' Mrs. Clinton said, but  
added the reaction ``was harmful to the country. ... People are 
mean. I think it's a real disservice, the way we sort of strip away 
everybody's sense of dignity, of privacy. People need support, not 
disdain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The interview with Mrs. Clinton, who is considering a run for  
the Senate from New York state, appears in Talk's first issue, on 
newsstands Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Its author, Lucinda Franks, told CNN today she believes Mrs.  
Clinton chose to talk now about her marriage and its problems to 
fight her public image, which ranges from ``cold, calculating 
political wife'' to a ``kind of soft thinker of romance and 
fantasy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She has been stereotyped in a way that has been very painful  
to her. I think she feels that people don't understand her, don't 
get her,'' Franks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said today that Franks  
-- wife of Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, a 
prominent Democrat -- is ``someone she (Mrs. Clinton) knew and felt 
comfortable with. She had a friendship with this reporter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Mrs. Clinton said she thought her husband's  
infidelity ``was resolved 10 years ago. ... I thought he had 
conquered it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton blamed her husband's infidelity on a desire to  
please women that can be traced to his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse. There  
was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
Mrs. Clinton said. ``There is always a desire to please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franks said Clinton's mother, Virginia Kelley, wrote in her  
autobiography about a physical tussle with her son's grandmother 
over who would raise the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She describes the chaos. ... She describes an incident in  
which Bill's grandmother and she literally were pulling him 
apart,'' with one tugging on a shoe and the other on an arm, Franks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book ``Leading with My Heart,'' Kelley said her mother  
was outraged by her plan to marry Roger Clinton -- husband No. 2 -- 
and tried to get legal custody of young Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``To her mind, Roger Clinton wasn't fit to be under the same  
roof with Bill, and she said she was going to stop the possibility 
of it if she could,'' Kelley wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was actually announcing that she was willing to rip this  
family apart. ... I screamed that the only way she was going to get 
my child was over my dead body,'' Kelley said. ``I clutched Bill, 
who was four years old. I probably thought he was too young to be 
seriously affected by even such scenes as this, but I was dead 
wrong, of course. Forty-one years later, during the presidential 
campaign, I would be flabbergasted to hear some of what he 
remembered about his early life in Hope. I don't know whether or 
not he remembers this part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said he wasn't sure if  
Clinton knew prior to the interview that Mrs. Clinton would discuss 
the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knew some time ago that she'd done this interview and the  
story was coming out,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockhart said Clinton ``believes that like many young people, he  
had difficult times within his family, but he feels he has been 
blessed with love and a wonderful life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said Clinton has ``stated openly, publicly, that he is  
responsible for all of his actions, and he's working hard to make 
right some mistakes he's made within his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the story, Mrs. Clinton said her husband is a good man, but  
said: ``Yes, he has weaknesses, yes he needs to be more 
responsible, more disciplined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She told Franks that, since the Lewinsky scandal, her husband  
``has been working on himself very hard. ... He has become more 
aware of his past and what was causing this behavior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She denied sticking with the president for her own benefit,  
saying his infidelities caused her pain, but did not outweigh the 
relationship the two have built. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is he ashamed? Yes. Is he sorry? Yes. But does this negate  
everything he has done as a husband, a father, a president?'' Mrs. 
Clinton asked. ``There has been enormous pain, enormous anger, but 
I have been with him half my life and he is a very, very good man. 
We just have a deep connection that transcends whatever happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she and her husband remain close.  
</P>
<P>
	``We talk. We talk in the solarium, in the bedroom, in the  
kitchen -- it's just constant conversation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's potential  
GOP rival for the Senate, said today he had no intention of 
bringing up the Clintons' relationship during a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe somebody's private life ... should be part of  
a political campaign,'' he said. ``I have no desire to probe Mrs. 
Clinton's private life.''

<HEADLINE> Butler Chides Annan on Arms Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Former U.N. weapons chief Richard Butler  
has accused U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan of trying to destroy 
the weapons inspection operation he headed because it was ``too 
independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview in the debut issue of Talk magazine, Butler said  
Annan repeatedly confused Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's 
``superficial cooperation'' with U.N. weapons inspectors ``with 
substantive compliance'' on Baghdad's disarmament obligations. 
</P>
<P>
	The secretary-general and his staff reacted to systematic  
cheating by Iraq in destroying and accounting for its banned 
weapons by ``papering over'' problems with diplomacy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk magazine issued a press release with excerpts from the  
interview, to be published Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked Monday to comment on Butler's accusations, Annan said: ``I  
don't think I have to comment. Everybody knows what happened. ... 
It's not relevant in the scheme of things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After two stormy years, Butler left his job as executive  
director of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, when his 
contract expired on June 30. He is now a diplomat-in-residence at 
the Council on Foreign Relations and is writing a book. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Butler said he decided against seeking another  
term because ``the situation within the U.N. had become 
untenable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Butler, an Australian diplomat, pulled UNSCOM inspectors out of  
Iraq in mid-December on the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes, and 
Baghdad has banned them from returning. The Security Council is 
debating a new Iraq policy that will likely include a successor 
organization to UNSCOM. 
</P>
<P>
	``Iraq possesses the knowledge required to make a sophisticated  
atomic bomb, has long-range missiles and has been hard at work on 
extending their range, (and) possesses the means to make both 
chemical and biological weapons,'' Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	He described UNSCOM as a ``thorn in the side'' of both Saddam  
and Annan and said the secretary-general wanted the ``destruction'' 
of UNSCOM because it was ``too independent to work within the 
mainstream of the U.N.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNSCOM was created by the Security Council after the 1991  
Persian Gulf War to ensure the elimination of Iraq's nuclear, 
chemical and biological weapons and the long-range missiles to 
deliver them. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said its tough inspection provisions were weakened, and  
Annan at one point asked him to exclude American inspectors as Iraq 
demanded. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler denied allegations by former UNSCOM inspector Scott  
Ritter, an American, that the CIA was directing the organization's 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritter ``misrepresented facts and reconstructed events,  
conversations, and decisions in which he played no part'' and his 
assertions hurt UNSCOM's credibility, Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Butler also said former Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov  
told him Moscow was motivated to act as Iraq's ``most aggressive 
advocate'' because it hopes to recoup $7 billion in war debts if 
sanctions against Baghdad are lifted.

<HEADLINE> State Food Stamp Rules Found Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Poor families who are eligible for food stamps  
aren't getting them because of unfair rules imposed by states and 
local governments, congressional investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday by the General Accounting Office also  
faulted the Agriculture Department for failing to monitor the 
food-stamp program adequately and being too slow in writing new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Food stamp participation has dropped by 27 percent over the past  
3 1/2 years to 18.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop is largely due to the strong economy and changes in  
eligibility requirements, but the report said that demand for food 
assistance from other programs and nonprofit organizations has 
grown, indicating that families who need food stamps aren't getting 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of children who get federally subsidized free lunches  
increased 6 percent from 1994 through 1997, while the number of 
children on food stamps dropped by 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a major educational campaign, and the states  
have to actively inform people of available programs,'' said Rep. 
Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``Everyone has to understand the purpose of 
welfare is to help people move from welfare to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge this year barred New York City from requiring  
people to look for a job before applying for food stamps. Michigan 
was illegally denying food stamps to whole households when one 
member of the family violated welfare regulations, said the GAO, 
Congress' investigative and auditing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states and local governments have not been publicizing the  
difference in eligibility requirements for welfare and food stamps, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA, meanwhile, has not written regulations to implement  
changes in the food-stamp program that Congress enacted three years 
ago and has yet to review application procedures in 10 states, the 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials say they will finish the food-stamp regulations  
by the end of the year and are working on the state reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great deal of confusion among working families  
simply because they have gone to work and they don't know what 
their eligibility status is anymore,'' said Shirley Watkins, USDA's 
undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, President Clinton announced that the administration  
would streamline reporting rules for food stamp recipients and 
launch an educational campaign aimed at getting the working poor to 
sign up for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, two of five working families eligible for food  
stamps actually apply for the assistance, according to USDA.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Fans Cheer McNabb at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Now that contract negotiations are over,  
Donovan McNabb has some catching up to do. He wasted no time during 
his first day on the field at Eagles training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Andy Reid gave the team's top draft pick plenty of  
practice reps Sunday as McNabb begins the process of learning 
Philadelphia's new West Coast offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like it's going to take me long to catch up,''  
said McNabb, who worked primarily with the second unit. ``I think 
the timing is pretty low right now. The receivers I worked out with 
(when he was unsigned) didn't have the speed or the route running 
that these guys have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an adjustment period that you go through when you  
report to camp. I'm patient and I'm just going to continue working 
on my conditioning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, taken with the second overall pick in the April draft,  
completed a hectic first weekend with the team. McNabb and the 
Eagles agreed to terms Friday on a seven-year contract worth $54 
million, including an $11.3 million signing bonus, but it wasn't 
until late Saturday that the 32-page contract was approved by the 
league offices and signed by McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	With that behind him, McNabb stepped onto the field for the  
first time in training camp Sunday, intent on showing he was worth 
the high selection and big money. 
</P>
<P>
	He even heard his first cheers from Philadelphia fans after his  
selection was booed on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rewarding to hear the fans cheer and clap for every  
completion that I had,'' McNabb said. ``They seemed to get excited 
about it. That helps out all the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is just glad McNabb is finally in camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's working,'' Reid said. ``We're catching him up on  
this thing. We're just working him right into the rotation. There 
were a lot of throws he had a chance to complete and they were 
either off the receiver's body or in a position where that receiver 
couldn't catch the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that I liked was, he finished strong. He came out  
and he was tired and that arm was tired and he worked that last 
series there and finished with some completions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb goes into camp as the backup to Doug Pederson, already  
familiar with the Eagles offense after working with Reid in Green 
Bay.

<HEADLINE>  Nate Newton Inches Closer to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Nate Newton's bid to extend his NFL  
career inched forward Monday when the Carolina Panthers decided he 
was fit enough to join his teammates for full-squad workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	While his teammates spent the first three days of training camp  
running plays and going through group drills, Newton was secluded 
in a different part of the complex for private workouts with 
strength and conditioning coach Jerry Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was to build up the 13-year NFL veteran's endurance and  
flexibility so he could compete for a spot on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he was cleared for team drills Monday, Newton still  
took it slow, participating in only selected drills for brief 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfitted in full pads for the first time, the 6-foot-3 Newton  
looked larger than his listed weight of 348 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went through a few drills. I didn't do much, but it  
still felt good,'' Newton said. ``I'm trying to get used to the 
pads and try to get back and do a little bit of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, 37, was signed to a one-year, $420,000 deal by the  
Panthers in June after he was deemed expendable by the Dallas 
Cowboys, for whom he played 13 seasons and made six Pro Bowl 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina coach George Seifert said there is no timetable for  
bringing along Newton, who will try to unseat Anthony Redmon as the 
Panthers' starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like we're looking to move him into the starting  
spot. I think Redmon's doing a good job, and we'll just see how the 
competition does go there,'' Seifert said. 
</P>
<P>
	To challenge for a roster spot and then for a starting job,  
Newton first wants to get down to 335 pounds. He said he is pleased 
with his progress and is closing in on that figure, but would not 
divulge his exact weight.

<P>
	``I'm doing fabulous. I'm the type of guy that once I hit it,  
I'm all about getting it going,'' he said. ``I'm close. That's all 
you need to know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton laughed when asked to compare the food at the Cowboys'  
camp to the Panthers' training table cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't stack up because I ain't been on it yet,'' he said.  
``I'm a fruit and potatoes guy, a fruit and salad guy.''

<HEADLINE>  Nate Newton Inches Closer to Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- Nate Newton's bid to extend his NFL  
career inched forward Monday when the Carolina Panthers decided he 
was fit enough to join his teammates for full-squad workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	While his teammates spent the first three days of training camp  
running plays and going through group drills, Newton was secluded 
in a different part of the complex for private workouts with 
strength and conditioning coach Jerry Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was to build up the 13-year NFL veteran's endurance and  
flexibility so he could compete for a spot on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when he was cleared for team drills Monday, Newton still  
took it slow, participating in only selected drills for brief 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfitted in full pads for the first time, the 6-foot-3 Newton  
looked larger than his listed weight of 348 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went through a few drills. I didn't do much, but it  
still felt good,'' Newton said. ``I'm trying to get used to the 
pads and try to get back and do a little bit of work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newton, 37, was signed to a one-year, $420,000 deal by the  
Panthers in June after he was deemed expendable by the Dallas 
Cowboys, for whom he played 13 seasons and made six Pro Bowl

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats $4B Apart on Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate opened debate Monday over a bailout  
of the nation's farm economy with Democrats and Republicans 
offering rival proposals more than $4 billion apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Silently and quietly, American farmers and ranchers are losing  
their businesses. They are at the end of their rope,'' Sen. Tom 
Harkin, D-Iowa, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats proposed $10.8 billion in aid, while Republicans  
countered with a $6.7 billion plan. The money would be added to an 
annual spending bill for the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The first vote was expected Tuesday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	A worldwide glut of grain has kept commodity prices low for a  
second consecutive year, and USDA projects that net farm income 
will dip to $43.8 billion this year. That's about 4 percent off the 
decade's average. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic plan includes almost $6 billion in extra crop  
subsidies, $2.3 billion in disaster aid and $1.4 billion in 
emergency trade provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the GOP package would go toward doubling the annual  
``market transition'' payments that farmers receive from the 
government under the 1996 farm bill. That way the money will go 
directly to farmers instead of toward USDA programs, said Sen. Thad 
Cochran, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say their plan is a better way of helping farmers who  
need it most. 
</P>
<P>
	That the Republicans even offered a proposal of their own this  
week was a recognition of how potent a political issue the farm 
economy has become. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders had argued it was too early to know how much  
help farmers will need this fall. They had pressed the Clinton 
administration without success to offer its own proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	But several farm-state GOP senators have argued the importance  
of Senate action before lawmakers start their long summer recess 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Dick  
Lugar, R-Ind., suggested Monday that $2 billion to $3 billion in 
aid would be sufficient. Crop subsidies already give farmers a 
``pretty strong safety net,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate leaders put off until Wednesday a debate over the way the  
government regulates dairy prices. A proposal by New England 
lawmakers would bar USDA from going forward with an overhaul of the 
pricing system and allow their states to continue fixing milk 
prices for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators from the upper Midwest have threatened to filibuster  
the spending bill over milk prices.

<HEADLINE> Bears Sign QB Cade McNown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- After missing the first 10 days of  
training camp, Cade McNown didn't want to waste any more time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bears' quarterback of the future headed for training  
camp at at Platteville, Wis., on Monday after signing a contract 
that could be worth $22 million over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm fired up to get to Platteville and get started on trying  
to make an impact this year,'' he said at a news conference at the 
team's practice facility. ``Once I get up there, I'm just going to 
have to jump in wherever they are and just spend some time in the 
film room and with the coaches just kind of getting to where I need 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown, the 12th overall pick in the draft out of UCLA, signed a  
seven-year, $15 million deal that includes a $6.1 million signing 
bonus. But McNown can void the last two years of the deal if he 
meets performance-based incentives, such as taking 35 percent of 
the snaps as a rookie or 45 percent of the snaps in his second or 
third year. 
</P>
<P>
	He also can make an additional $7 million if he meets other  
performance-based incentives, agent Tom Condon said. Those 
``escalator clauses'' take the place of the ``buyback'' that's 
usually included in voidable year deals, Condon said. In most 
voidable year deals, teams ``buy back'' the remaining years of the 
long-term contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an exciting place for Cade,'' Condon said. ``There was  
never a time when we didn't think this thing would get done, or 
whether it was going to turn into any kind of an acrimonious 
situation. At the same time, it's complicated -- it was uncharted 
waters, and we're happy that it's over with and both sides got what 
they needed out of the contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have made it plain since drafting McNown that he's  
their quarterback of the future. But they appeared to give him 
additional leverage in the contract negotiations when they cut 
veteran Erik Kramer two days before camp started. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago does have four other quarterbacks in camp -- Shane  
Matthews, Jim Miller, Moses Moreno and Doug Nussmeier -- but they 
have four NFL starts among them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. That's a decision for the coaches to make, but  
my job is to be as ready as possible to allow them to make a good 
decision,'' McNown said when asked if he could start in the Bears' 
first game, Sept. 12 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are no expectations,'' he added. ``From all indications,  
they just want me to be able to step in and play, whatever that 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears are installing a new, more wide open offense this  
season, and McNown has gotten some exposure to it at the team's 
minicamps. He's also been studying his play book and working out 
with a trainer, but he said there's no comparison to being at camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether we started camp a month ago or we started it today, I  
need all the preparation I can possibly get,'' he said. ``It 
doesn't matter whether it's one week or two weeks away, so the more 
the better. With that, I just want to tell you how excited I am to 
finally get up to camp and get started.''

<HEADLINE> US Baseball Qualifies for Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The assignment for an assortment of  
American minor league baseball players was demanding: come together 
in two weeks, mesh as a team and qualify their country for the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the reservations for Sydney and the 2000 Games can be made.  
</P>
<P>
	Long-time minor leaguer Mike Neill had a pinch-hit single in the  
10th inning Sunday night and the Americans struggled before edging 
Mexico 2-1 in the semifinals of the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States will now play Cuba, which beat Canada in the  
other semifinal, for the Pan Ams gold Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the most important mission for this hastily formed team --  
qualifying for the Olympics -- has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an experience, I'll tell you,'' said U.S. manager Buddy  
Bell, his voice cracking with emotion. ``If anybody asks me if they 
should do this, I'd tell them they couldn't pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in top of 10th, Marcus Jensen, America's top hitter  
in the tournament, doubled off the first-base bag. After a 
strikeout, Neill, who got into six games with Oakland last season, 
hit a 3-2 pitch for a run-scoring single off former major league 
pitcher Vicente Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I had a major arm injury and made it to the big  
leagues. That was a long road back and finally getting there was an 
individual thing,'' Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far better as a team member, representing your  
country and trying to get USA baseball into the Olympics. I think 
we were a little tight. But it's awesome playing for your country 
and then getting the big hit to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wheeler, who pitched well in a 10-5 win over Cuba in the  
preliminary round, got the victory. The right-hander from Triple-A 
Durham pitched a perfect four innings in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow,'' he said after the Americans swarmed the mound in  
celebration after Wheeler got the final out. ``This is one of the 
things that we needed to do. But I want a gold medal and now we 
have that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans had a run cut down at the plate in the second when  
Craig Paquette tried to score from first on a double by Milton 
Bradley. Then Mexico took a 1-0 lead in the fourth on an RBI double 
by Ray Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, comprised of players not on the 40-man roster of  
major league clubs, struggled all night against former major 
leaguer Cesar Alvarez. But the Americans finally scored in the 
sixth. A walk, a bunt and a two-out single by Adam Kennedy got the 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez allowed only three hits in 7 2-3 innings and had 10  
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba, the two-time defending Olympic champion, overcame the  
distraction of a ninth-inning protester. It was sweet revenge for 
the Cubans, who were rocked by preliminary-round losses to Canada, 
8-1, and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Omar Linares, regarded as his nation's best player, hit a  
two-out, three-run homer in the third inning. Jose Ibar pitched 5 
1-3 innings of strong relief before he lost concentration after 
retiring the first batter in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when a man carrying a ``Human Right First'' sign came  
onto the field in front of the mound. Cuba's Yobal Duenas rushed 
out of the dugout with his country's flag and tried to wrap up the 
protester. 
</P>
<P>
	The man, wearing a shirt with ``Freedom'' written on the front,  
then ran behind home plate. Cuban catcher Ariel Pestano tried to 
stop the protester with his mask before the man ran in front of the 
Canadian dugout, where he was apparently knocked down by Cuban 
second baseman Juan Padilla. Authorities then took the man away. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday night, police said four members of the Cuban  
delegation were involved in a fight with the protester. The fight 
occurred at 10:30 p.m. in the center of the city outside the 
offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, acting duty 
inspector Paul Ingram of the Winnipeg City Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar gave up a single to Todd Betts, threw a wild pitch and  
walked Ryan Radmanovich before Luis Lazo came on to strike out the 
final two hitters. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year when the Cubans beat the Baltimore Orioles in  
an exhibition at Camden Yards, a protester ran onto the field 
before he was tackled by a Cuban umpire. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian left fielder Aaron Guiel, who struck out to end the  
game, was in front of the dugout when the protester was trying to 
get away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy made us all look bad,'' Guiel said. ``But what is  
great about the U.S. and Canada is that you have the freedom to do 
that. I don't agree with what he did and I also don't agree with 
Cuba's politics, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the opening round, Guiel twice ran over Pestano at the plate.  
On Sunday, he was nearly in the middle of another physical 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of their coaches tried to throw a punch and another player  
tried to throw his mask at him. I had my bat in my hand and another 
guy was beside me,'' Guiel said. ``We just stood in between. It's a 
good thing for them they didn't show any aggression toward us. Then 
there would have been some real trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way I understand it. But basically those guys are  
brainwashed into thinking the way their country runs is the way it 
should be run. ...Unfortunately it was a little blemish on the 
game, a great game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada had won all five of its games entering the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
	``Probably the toughest loss I've ever had to take,'' Guiel  
said. ``We were one run, one blooper, one error away from 
qualifying for the Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadians took a 2-0 lead on a run-scoring wild pitch in the  
second and a third-inning solo homer from Stubby Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian starter Mike Meyers retired the first two batters in  
the third before Luis Ulacia and Isacc Martinez singled. Linares 
then drove a long homer to left. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibar relieved in the fourth and allowed only one hit into the  
ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	After Lazo got the final two outs, the Cubans, winners of seven  
straight Pan Ams golds, swarmed their hefty relief pitcher. Several 
players ran out of the dugout with their flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans did not comment after the game, but their actions  
made it clear how relieved they were to qualify for the gold medal 
game -- and for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Angels Activate Edmonds From DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif.(AP) -- Anaheim centerfielder Jim Edmonds was  
activated from the 60-day disabled list Monday and was in the 
Angels lineup for the first time this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, who missed all of the team's first 103 games, underwent  
arthroscopic surgery on April 19 to repair a torn labrum in his 
right shoulder. That injury, in addition to a strained right groin, 
forced him onto the DL for the fourth time in seven major league 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old still hasn't been cleared by the Angels medical  
staff to play the field. He started against Kansas City as the 
designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds made five rehab appearances with Single-A Lake Elsinore  
prior to being activated and went 8-for-19 with three RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for him, Anaheim designated outfielder Reggie  
Williams for assignment. Williams, 33, batted .222 with a home run 
and 30 RBIs in 30 games this season.

<HEADLINE> Study Eases Hyperactivity Drug Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hyperactive boys treated with drugs such as  
Ritalin were much less likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs as 
teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, researchers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts not involved in the study said it was flawed and  
too small to reach meaningful conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75  
with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the 
findings should help allay concerns that giving children 
potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful 
habits later. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3 million school-age children have ADHD, and as  
many as half may be taking Ritalin or other stimulants, past 
research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a mythology that the use of these medications  
could `prime' children to become addicts in the future or could 
develop `a culture of drug taking,''' said Dr. Joseph Biederman of 
Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the study. It is 
published in the August issue of Pediatrics' ``electronic pages,'' 
an Internet extension of the journal published by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that children with ADHD who are medically treated  
will have fewer problems resulting from their disorder and more 
successful lives, probably giving them fewer reasons to experiment 
with substance abuse,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritalin acts on dopamine, a brain chemical that helps regulate  
thinking. It is believed to calm hyperactivity by helping 
children's brains disregard distracting stimuli, such as classroom 
noise, so they can focus on learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of  
families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children. The 
children and their mothers were interviewed on three occasions -- 
when they entered the study, one year later and four years after 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19  
ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	At the study's end, 75 percent of the unmedicated ADHD subjects  
had substance abuse disorders, compared with 25 percent of the 
medicated subjects. Abused substances included alcohol, marijuana, 
hallucinogens, cocaine and other stimulants. Eighteen percent of 
the non-ADHD subjects were substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the study, psychologist Nadine Lambert of the  
University of California at Berkeley, said it was too small to show 
significant differences in rates of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Her own research involving more than 200 ADHD subjects tracked  
for more than 20 years shows that those who took stimulant 
medication were more likely to be cocaine and tobacco abusers as 
adults than non-medicated subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert said she is not opposed to treating ADHD youngsters with  
stimulants because the benefits have been shown clearly, but she 
believes there are risks and they should be acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Mixed at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese bank traders bought the dollar Tuesday  
morning, pushing it higher against the yen. Tokyo share prices 
turned mixed after opening slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 114.73 yen, up 0.69 yen from late Monday in  
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 114.22 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 46.22 points,  
or 0.26 percent, to finish the morning session at 17,779.48. On 
Monday, the average closed down 36.16 points, or 0.20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar recouped some of the previous  
day's losses after Japanese interbank traders covered short, or 
oversold, dollar positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-covering set in after traders concluded that the dollar's  
slide to an intraday low of 113.95 yen was too sharp a drop. 
</P>
<P>
	That followed similar moves in New York, where some U.S. funds  
as well as interbank dealers bought the dollar on dips after the 
greenback fell to a near six-month low against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players were carefully watching whether Japanese and U.S.  
authorities would jointly intervene to buy dollars to stem the 
yen's recent strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Taichi Sakaiya, who heads Japan's Economic Planning Agency, told  
a regular news conference that Japanese financial authorities are 
in contact with their U.S. counterparts about the dollar's recent 
fall against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, generally speaking, the dollar is in a downtrend,''  
Sakaiya said. He refused to say whether the possibility of joint 
intervention was being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened in recent months to rein in the  
yen's rise against the dollar as authorities here fear a stronger 
yen could wreck the country's nascent economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad and  
thus less competitive, reducing dollar-denominated earnings of 
Japanese exporters when translated into yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 122.46 yen, up from  
121.78 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started slightly higher but later  
turned mixed as international blue chips fell on profit-taking. 
Trading was thin in the absence of major market-moving news. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 3.36 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,471.98. The 
TOPIX closed down 10.31 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose  
to 1.8550 percent from Monday's finish of 1.8400 percent, driving 
its price down to 99.53 yen from 99.65 yen.

<HEADLINE>  Hawks Trade Guards Smith, Gray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Hawks, who looked old and slow  
getting swept out of the playoffs by New York, will have a 
decidedly different look next season. 
</P>
<P>
	After trading point guard Mookie Blaylock the day before the  
draft, the Hawks completed a much-rumored purge of their backcourt 
Monday by dealing Steve Smith to Portland for guards Isaiah Rider 
and Jim Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks also sent little-used guard Ed Gray to the Trail  
Blazers, but the most dramatic decision was dealing an upstanding 
player like Smith for someone with a troubled history like Rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``People care about wins and losses,'' said Hawks general  
manager Pete Babcock, who has always made a point of going after 
players with solid character. ``Unfortunately, that's the way our 
society is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider has averaged 18 points a game for his career, but he was  
suspended for 12 games during three seasons in Portland for 
violations ranging from flagrant fouls to spitting on fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a concern,'' Babcock conceded. ``It's up to him. He's a  
tremendous talent. We're not going to predetermine anything until 
the end of the season. Then we'll make a decision about what's best 
for our franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider, 28, will make $5.4 million next season in the final year  
of a $25.5 million rookie contract. The 29-year-old Jackson, who 
averaged a career-low 8.4 points last season, will get $3 million 
over the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks were reported to be talking with the Los Angeles  
Clippers about trading either Rider or Jackson for center-forward 
Lorenzen Wright. The Hawks also have expressed interest in 
re-signing Grant Long or signing Charles Oakley to bolster depth in 
the frontcourt. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock didn't rule out further moves, but he denied that a deal  
for Wright was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not even close,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 30, requested to be sent to a winning team, and the Hawks  
complied by working out a deal with his No. 1 choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they have a great chance to win a championship in  
Portland,'' said Smith, who will make $36 million over the next 
four years. ``It's a great situation for me to go to a team that's 
loaded with talent. Maybe I'll be the one to get them over the edge 
and win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's just what the Trail Blazers have in mind.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a very deep roster and a very talented roster, and one  
of the things we wanted to try to accomplish was to thin it a 
little bit,'' team president Bob Whitsitt said. ``We also wanted to 
try to increase our leadership ability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers, who lost to NBA champion San Antonio in the Western  
Conference finals, decided they could part with both Rider and 
Jackson. Second-year guard Bonzi Wells, who will back up Smith, has 
shown dramatic improvement over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The one drawback with Smith is his creaky knees, which caused  
him to miss 14 games in the lockout-shortened season. He pointed 
out that he averaged more than 36 minutes per game in the previous 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing about my knees is a poor excuse,'' Smith said. ``I  
hope they didn't use my knees as the source of this trade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rider and Jackson were not immediately available for comment.  
The Hawks, in fact, were still trying to reach Rider on Monday 
evening to inform him of the deal, which had been reported for 
several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks, who finished second in the Central Division to  
Indiana, were routed by the Knicks in the second round of the 
playoffs. They have not made it beyond the second round since 
moving to Atlanta in 1968, forcing a dramatic overhaul of a team 
that rarely made more than one major move a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blaylock was traded to Golden State for the No. 10 pick in the  
draft, which was used to select Arizona point guard Jason Terry. He 
will get a chance to start alongside Rider or Jackson in a 
backcourt that will be doing a lot more running than the 
Smith-Blaylock combination. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was important for us to get more athletes and improve our  
speed,'' Babcock said. ``We want to be committed to the run. You 
need athletes for the running game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith led the Hawks in scoring during each of his four full  
years in Atlanta, including an 18.7 average last season. He played 
in the 1998 All-Star game and was a member of Dream Team II, which 
captured the 1994 world championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, a first-round pick in 1997, spent two troubled seasons  
with the Hawks, including an arrest on charges of drug possession 
and driving under the influence. He played in only 30 games last 
season, averaging 4.9 points.

<HEADLINE> European Automakers Thrive in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- European automakers continued their double-digit  
sales gains in the United States last month, with Volkswagen AG and 
Audi AG posting their best July performance in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen said Monday that strong sales of its redesigned Jetta  
compact sedan contributed to its best July sales in 19 years. VW's 
sales increased 19.5 percent over the same month of 1998, and Jetta 
had its best July sales since its original introduction in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	VW's Audi unit saw its best July in the United States since  
1985, with a 47 percent increase over year-ago sales. Audi has had 
monthly year-over-year sales increases in 54 of the past 56 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo Cars, the Swedish automaker bought by Ford Motor Co.  
earlier this year, reported its sales increased nearly 29 percent 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	European automakers have had the strongest percentage gains in  
the U.S. market during the past two years. The Europeans as a group 
have posted double-digit increases every month since October 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese automaker Subaru, a division of Fuji Heavy Industries  
Ltd., reported its sales increased 1 percent over July 1998 on a 23 
percent improvement in demand for the Forester sport utility 
vehicle. Subaru's car sales were off nearly 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford, General Motors Corp., DaimlerChrysler AG and most other  
major automakers planned to report their July sales results 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> `Good' Cholesterol Gene Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Researchers have identified a gene that regulates the level of  
so-called good cholesterol in the body, a key step in the drive to 
find new treatments for one of the most common causes of heart 
disease, the nation's No. 1 killer. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaws in the gene, known as ABC1, prevent the production of a  
protein that the body needs to rinse excess bad cholesterol and 
other fats out of cells and the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene was discovered by researchers looking for the cause of  
Tangier disease, an extremely rare inherited illness in which the 
body produces virtually none of the good cholesterol, HDL. Without 
it, the level of the bad cholesterol, LDL, and other fats that 
contribute to heart attacks and clogged arteries rise unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists not involved in the studies said the discovery was a  
significant advance in heart disease research because millions of 
people with cardiovascular problems have lower-than-normal HDL 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients can have a normal LDL level, but still have  
cardiovascular disease because their HDL is so low,'' said Sonia 
Skarlatos, genetics research leader at the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any drugs right now that raise HDL  
significantly. Now we know where to look for the gene and its 
mutations, and how we might enhance the gene's expression to make 
more HDL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heart disease is the country's No. 1 killer, and as many as 10  
labs were looking for ABC1. It was isolated in separate studies by 
two sets of scientists in Germany and one in Canada. Their results 
appear in the August issue of Nature Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	A group headed by Michael Hayden of the University of British  
Columbia, lead author of one of the studies, determined that ABC1 
is responsible for making a protein essential to both HDL formation 
and the process of unloading fats from cells and the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Young of the University of California, San Francisco,  
who reviewed the studies independently, said they did not determine 
where the gene works within cells, or the precise biochemical steps 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the ABC1 discovery does lead to new cholesterol drugs,  
they may work in opposite ways from statins, a class of cholesterol 
busters that have revolutionized heart care. About 8 million 
Americans take statins, though many experts say perhaps as many as 
30 million should be taking them. 
</P>
<P>
	Statins lower the level of LDLs in the bloodstream. For people  
at high risk, the drugs can reduce the risk of a heart attack by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs that would boost HDL might offer more protection, doctors  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is called the good cholesterol  
because LDL, low-density lipoproteins and other fats attach 
themselves to HDL particles and are eventually discarded together 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This genetic discovery allows us to ask the question of, `How  
would you impact vascular disease if you were to specifically 
change HDL?''' said Dr. Dennis Sprecher of the Cleveland Clinic. 
``It's a significant piece of the puzzle. But we're not at the 
point where we would start experimentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding ABC1 also may lead to treatments or gene therapies  
for Tangier disease -- which afflicts only about 40 people worldwide 
-- and less severe illnesses caused by other mutations of the gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangier disease is named after tiny Tangier Island in Chesapeake  
Bay. Discovered in 1608 by Capt. John Smith, today it's home to 
about 700 people. Most are descendants of the island's original 
English settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal scientists identified Tangier Disease in two island  
children -- a brother and sister -- in 1963. Their tonsils were 
orange, a sign their cells were overloaded with cholesterol. Tests 
showed they lacked HDL, and researchers launched the first of many 
hunts for the genetic culprit.

<HEADLINE> Internet Pornography Sites Thriving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When Internet pornographers allegedly tried to use  
Nancy Kerrigan's fame to sell pictures on their Web site, all they 
needed was the correct spelling of her name. 
</P>
<P>
	By inserting it 32 times in a block of text called a ``metatag''  
used by Internet search engines, they were able to fool the search 
engines into believing the site was about the medal-winning Olympic 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans curious about Kerrigan found themselves directed to  
pornographic pictures on the site -- although Kerrigan's name was 
never seen there, and there certainly were no nude pictures of the 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Kerrigan, 29, sued the site's operators and it has  
since disappeared from the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't the first court victory for Kerrigan -- she was awarded  
an undisclosed amount of money in 1998 by an Internet company that 
allegedly displayed images of her online that had been doctored to 
make them pornographic. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, her success has hardly had a chilling effect on the  
thriving Internet pornography industry, where even small sites can 
make up to $10,000 per month. 
</P>
<P>
	In an ever-expanding electronic terrain there are seemingly  
limitless avenues for pornographers to exploit famous women. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to have taken your clothes off,'' said  
Kerrigan's attorney, Victor Polk. ``If you're a famous woman in 
this country, your name is going to be used to sell pornography.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet's combination of cheap access and worldwide reach  
make it almost impossible to regulate tightly, experts say. The law 
gives celebrities some ammunition to fight for their names, but 
high costs and potentially low returns have discouraged many from 
using it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the wild, wild West with just a couple of marshals,''  
said Mitchell Kamarck, who represented TV star Alyssa Milano in a 
lawsuit against online firms. ``We have the tools. It's a matter of 
applying the tools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Legal issues involving the Internet are relatively new, but one  
Internet law specialist says protecting names and images likely 
will boil down to adjusting existing law to fit the new medium. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a case of adjusting fairly well-established  
principles to new facts,'' said Houston lawyer D.C. Toedt. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Kerrigan case, Polk says copyright law could apply  
because indiscriminate use of Kerrigan's name absent any context is 
not ``fair use'' of her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Other legal principles that have been effectively used include a  
``right of publicity,'' which gives a person the right to control 
and profit from the commercial use of their name, as well as 
trademark, privacy and defamation statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if the law evolves to favor celebrities, practical  
considerations make it virtually impossible to shut down every 
illegal site, according to Mitchell Zimmerman, a Palo Alto, Calif., 
attorney who works in Internet law. 
</P>
<P>
	First, simply finding the offenders is a major chore. At the  
first sign of trouble, site owners can shut down and begin again 
for relatively little money. Some smaller sites aren't worth 
pursuing because operators have no money. And because the Internet 
is worldwide, figuring out whose laws apply when material is 
produced in one country but seen in another is an unresolved issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest reason there will always be illegal celebrity porno  
sites, Zimmerman said, is the decentralized nature of the Internet, 
a major part of its appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet and World Wide Web are inherently  
uncontrollable,'' he said. ``There's nobody in charge, and there 
can't be anybody in charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While stopping the misuse of celebrities' images may or may not  
be a realistic hope, model Alley Baggett said she'll fight to shut 
down those sites she can. Baggett, 26, Playboy's 1998 lingerie 
model of the year, has seen her name and image on the hard-core 
Internet sites, and wants them gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the Internet. I love what its done for me,'' she said.  
``At the same time, you definitely have to try to have control or 
everyone's going to walk all over you.''

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Suspension Cut by Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After 10 months of waiting, Darryl Strawberry  
can finally focus on returning to the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's 120-day suspension for his arrest on solicitation  
and drug charges April 14 was cut short one week by commissioner 
Bud Selig on Monday, making the New York Yankees outfielder 
eligible to play Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting to get into the frame of mind of playing,''  
Strawberry said in Tampa, Fla. ``I'm looking forward to it. I'm 
ready to get going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's penalty was originally scheduled to run through  
Aug. 11. Selig decided to shorten the suspension after reviewing 
medical records and speaking to Strawberry twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good thing out of this for me was, it allowed the time off  
to really take care of myself physically and mentally,'' said 
Strawberry, who hasn't played since learning last Oct. 1 that he 
had colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry will report Wednesday to Triple-A Columbus of the  
International League and is expected to play that night against 
Norfolk. Manager Joe Torre said Strawberry will need at least one 
week, probably more, before he will be ready to return to the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem facing Strawberry now is an injured left  
knee, that has limited his running and makes it difficult to play 
outfield. With Chili Davis entrenched at designated hitter, 
Strawberry will have to be able to play left field to get into the 
lineup consistently. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he can't play every day, a week only means three or four  
games, which isn't very much for a guy who hasn't played since 
September,'' Torre said. ``We know what he brings to the table as a 
threat with the bat. We need to find out if he can play outfield.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has been working out at the Yankees' minor league  
complex in Tampa since July 9. His batting practice performances 
have shown that the majestic left-handed swing that has hit 332 
career homers hasn't deserted him. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he gets the chance to do it in the minors. After waiting for  
a ruling from Selig since July 22, Strawberry isn't concerned about 
how long it will take to return to the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's too far ahead,'' Strawberry said. ``I really haven't  
thought about that. I'm just taking it day by day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who was suspended 60 days for testing positive for  
cocaine in 1995, admitted last month that an alcohol relapse 
contributed to his arrest. He has been attending Alcoholics 
Anonymous meetings in Tampa, while working out. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't played in a game since the final week of the 1998  
season, before surgery for colon cancer forced him to miss the 
playoffs and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``With all of the negatives that he's been through, it's good to  
see something positive happen for him,'' Davis said. ``He can see 
the light at the end of the tunnel. He wants to come back to New 
York and that's what we want for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was one of the most popular Yankees in the clubhouse  
before the cancer and suspension. And his teammates aren't worried 
that his return could disrupt the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is a positive influence,'' Derek Jeter said. ``I don't see  
how Darryl could be a distraction. He's all about the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's availability has been a recurring theme around the  
Yankees for the past five seasons. He joined the Yankees on Aug. 4, 
1995, after spending four weeks in the minors following his first 
drug suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	He played sporadically and was not brought back at the start of  
1996. After a stint in the independent Northern League, Strawberry 
was brought back to New York in July 1996 and played a major role 
in helping the Yankees win the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	He played only 11 games in an injury-plagued 1997. He made his  
biggest contributions last season, hitting 24 homers in 295 at-bats 
before being diagnosed with colon cancer during last year's 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	His expected return this season was delayed by chemotherapy  
treatments and then the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a unique organization,'' Torre said. ``Billy Martin  
came back five times. ... Distractions are always there. It's how 
you handle them that matters.''

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Cos. May Face Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that calls for million-dollar  
fines for sweepstakes companies that entice consumers with 
misleading promises of riches was passed unanimously by the Senate 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said too many people are being deceived into thinking  
they can improve their chances of winning cash, luxury cars, 
overseas vacations and other prizes by buying products because of 
mailings that often breathlessly announce that the recipient ``may 
have already won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sweepstakes in this country for many Americans has become a  
cruel joke,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. ``One woman in Grand 
Rapids spent $12,500 in one year with Reader's Digest alone. A 
woman in the Upper Peninsula spent $30,000 in less than a month on 
sweepstakes-related promotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, introduced by Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, would  
require sponsors to include ``clear and conspicuous'' messages in 
their mailings telling consumers that no purchase is necessary to 
enter or win a sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 93-0 to pass the bill. The House has not yet  
acted on similar legislation, but its Government Reform Committee's 
postal services panel was scheduled to hold hearings this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Current lottery law prohibits sweepstakes sponsors from  
requiring purchases or giving people an edge in winning prizes if 
they do buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Collins' Senate Permanent Subcommittee on  
Investigations found that some people have spent hundreds of 
dollars on magazine subscriptions or items of little value because 
they had been misled into believing the purchases would bring them 
closer to winning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing could be further from the truth,'' Collins said during  
debate on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	During hearings in March, Collins' panel heard from senior  
citizens who spent their Social Security checks, squandered their 
life savings or borrowed money to buy unwanted magazines and other 
merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	``The four major sweepstakes companies alone flood Americans  
with more than 1 billion solicitations every year,'' Collins said. 
``The simple fact is that consumers regularly fall victim to 
increasingly deceptive and sophisticated marketing techniques used 
in these mailings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said deception was rampant in advertising put out by the  
four largest sweepstakes companies -- American Family Publishers, 
Publishers Clearing House, Time Inc. and Reader's Digest -- although 
those companies run legitimate sweepstakes that award prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem of deceptive advertising is even worse among  
smaller companies, which often seek to conceal their identities and 
may end up never awarding a prize. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Postal Service's power to investigate and punish  
violators would increase under the bill, giving postal inspectors 
the authority to impose civil fines of up to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Require that sweepstakes offers include assurances that  
purchases will not increase the chances of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require that all mailings include a clear statement of  
sweepstakes rules, procedures for entering, estimated retail values 
of all prizes and the estimated odds of winning each prize. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require sponsors to remove consumers' names and addresses from  
their mailing lists within 35 days of being requested to do so. 
Sponsors would be required to include information, including a 
telephone number or address, consumers can use to make the removal 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	--Prohibit mailings that imply a connection with or endorsement  
by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	--Require sponsors to include a message on mailings that look  
like checks telling recipients that they are not negotiable and 
have no cash value. 
</P>
<P>
	--Tighten laws governing skill contests -- puzzles, essay contests  
and other competitions that can require entry fees -- by requiring 
those mailings to disclose more details, including the identity of 
the judges and the method used in judging. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is S. 335.

<HEADLINE> Caddies Told Not To Wear Shorts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Before the showdown between Tiger  
Woods and David Duval came a standoff between their caddies and the 
PGA Tour over what has become a sticky issues: shorts. 
</P>
<P>
	Both arrived at Sherwood Country Club wearing shorts, and PGA  
Tour official Vaughn Moise told them to wear pants because the heat 
index was not 100 degrees. The high Monday was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Knox, the caddie for Duval, scrambled to find a nice pair  
of trousers -- so stylish that they came without a hem, and he had 
to roll them up four times so they wouldn't drag on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	When Moise approached Steve Williams, Woods stepped in and told  
his caddie not to change. During a telephone call from PGA Tour 
chief legal officer Ed Moorhouse, Moise suggested that Williams 
could face disciplinary action after the match. 
</P>
<P>
	Knox didn't want to talk about it, saying he was too mad.  
</P>
<P>
	Moise also declined comment other than to say, ``It's over,'' as  
the players headed to the first tee -- Williams in shorts, Knox in 
pants too long. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour is in the final week of a trial period in which  
caddies will be allowed to wear shorts when the heat index is 100 
degrees.

<HEADLINE> Japan Vehicle Sales Fall in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of cars, trucks and buses fell 13.9 percent  
in July from the same month last year, marking Japan's 28th 
straight month of declines of vehicle sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled 372,334 vehicles in July, the Japan Automobile  
Dealers' Association said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly figures also included sales of imported vehicles,  
which fell 5.9 percent to 23,656. 
</P>
<P>
	A feeble economy and weak consumer spending have curbed  
automobile sales in Japan for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy emerged from a 1 1/2-year recession in the first  
quarter of 1999 but economists worry it could slip back. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of passenger cars in July tumbled 16.8 percent to 269,414,  
as standard-size vehicle sales fell 15.7 percent to 66,591 and 
sales of small vehicles declined 17.2 percent to 202,823. 
</P>
<P>
	Truck sales sank 5.1 percent to 101,782, but bus sales rose 0.7  
percent to 1,138. 
</P>
<P>
	Among major carmakers, Honda Motor Co. suffered the biggest  
decline in sales -- a 25.6 percent drop from last month to 32,874 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's leading carmaker, posted a decline  
of 12.8 percent to 151,277 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. sold 82,603 vehicles over the month, 13.0  
percent fewer than last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Mitsubishi Motors Corp. sank 13.1 percent to 27,466,  
while sales for Mazda Motor Corp. declined 7.4 percent to 24,999. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at Hino Motors Ltd. and Nissan Diesel Motor Co. increased  
14.2 percent and 4.9 percent, respectively. The truckmakers were 
the only companies among 11 major Japanese automakers to post sales 
gains for July.

<HEADLINE> PBS To Halt Donor List Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Public broadcasting stations, under fire  
for sharing donor lists with partisan political groups, will halt 
the practice immediately but the fallout may linger, PBS President 
Ervin S. Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has delayed the (federal budget) authorization process and  
I don't know what the outcome will be,'' Duggan said Sunday. ``I 
hope we can put it behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether stations violated federal tax law by  
swapping, selling, renting or otherwise providing their donor lists 
to political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Of its 349 member stations nationwide, the Public Broadcasting  
Service has said as many as 30 appear to have made such sales or 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax experts have said that would not be a violation as long as  
all political parties received equal access to the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	However, ``no station should do anything that would call into  
question its independence or impartiality,'' Duggan told a meeting 
of the Television Critics Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the end of this week, no station in America will be engaged  
in these practices,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS, which distributes national programs to member stations, and  
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a clearinghouse for 
federal funding, could try to force compliance by withholding money 
from the stations. However, that would be an overreaction because 
they seem eager to cooperate, Duggan added. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue came to light in May when Boston station WGBH-TV  
admitted giving a list of donors' names to the Democratic National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	While condemning the practice, Duggan said outside list brokers  
working for PBS stations swapped names with both Republican and 
Democratic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nonpolitical and nonpartisan behavior,'' Duggan said,  
noting that Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, the conservative 
think tank Heritage Foundation and a group called Country Club 
Republicans were among those who received the lists. 
</P>
<P>
	The list-swapping reflects the ``sometime frenetic and desperate  
search'' for potential donors, not political bias by the PBS 
stations involved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if the issue was being used by PBS critics as a weapon  
against public broadcasting, Duggan replied carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to deal with the motives of people on Capitol  
Hill or what might seem to some an effort to expand this issue 
beyond its proper limits,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, D.C., the House Commerce Committee was scheduled  
to consider funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on 
July 14 but postponed the meeting after the mailing list 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lawmakers -- Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the  
committee's telecommunications subcommittee, and Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif. -- have asked for investigations into the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin, who was sponsoring the funding authorization bill for  
PBS, said he will reduce his funding proposal.

<HEADLINE> Home &AMP; Garden TV Plants Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Inspired to start a garden or remodel  
your kitchen? Home &AMP; Garden Television's latest venture promises to 
tell you how -- on the air and on the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a new digital network called Do It Yourself, or DIY, that  
will go ``on-air, on-line'' simultaneously with an integrated Web 
site on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	DIY aims to give the country's estimated 128 million  
do-it-yourselfers more than just the basics for home projects. It 
offers both how-to cable programming and an Internet guide to 
everything from building plans to supply sources. 
</P>
<P>
	That TV-Web convergence is reflected in DIY's motto: ``Watch.  
Click. Print. Do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is one of the first networks where the Web and the network  
are really co-developed,'' said Ed Spray, executive vice president 
for HGTV and DIY. ``One is driving the other and they are equal in 
the development process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new network will rely heavily on a library of HGTV-owned  
programming, from which it has culled, condensed and created its 
first 13 weeks of shows. By the second season, DIY will be 
producing its own programs from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	HGTV, launched by E.W. Scripps in late 1994, reaches some 55  
million viewers and ranks in the middle of the top 38 cable 
networks. It began turning a profit late last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot of things (from HGTV),'' Spray said. Most  
important, ``we learned how passionate viewers can be about things 
that really interest them. 
</P>
<P>
	``That may sound like a really simple statement,'' he said.  
``But if they see a blue sofa on Kitty Bartholomew (a decorating 
show) and they want it, they will pursue any ends, including 
calling us, to get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scripps did some research and found ``home enthusiasts'' will  
consult more than four sources on average before starting a 
project, and that more than half of them said television was one of 
those sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sampling of home and lifestyle viewers found  
three-quarters rated step-by-step instruction as very important in 
home programming. 
</P>
<P>
	But Spray said television typically is better suited to  
inspiration than perspiration -- it's easier to get viewers excited 
about wanting a ceiling fan than showing them how to install it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then add step-by-steps to the Web site,'' said Channing  
Dawson, senior vice president for new media, ``and that is a pretty 
good package.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DIY will launch with four one-hour blocks of programming  
following HGTV's traditional themes of remodeling, decorating, 
gardening and crafts. Some 1,700 projects will be covered in those 
first 260 hours, most with step-by-step plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike HGTV, which used personalities like TV weathermen Willard  
Scott or Spencer Christian to serve as host of some of its early 
shows, DIY will be using experts in their fields who also are at 
ease in front of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Kim Haworth, a professional gardener for 25 years  
and resident expert at CBS affiliate KPIX in San Francisco, will be 
host of the gardening programs; Brad Staggs, a former radio host in 
Los Angeles who has been demonstrating how to install roof vents 
and retile kitchen counters for HGTV programs since the beginning, 
will do the DIY home repair show. 
</P>
<P>
	There also will be programs on tool tips and ``no power tools''  
building projects for children, and specials on model railroads, 
furniture refinishing and beginner woodworking. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to link DIY just to Home and Garden topics,''  
Spray said. ``DIY defines itself. Anything you can do yourself, 
including any kind of hobby you can think of -- from antique cars to 
stamp collecting -- is fair game for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spray concedes it will be tough to grow DIY as fast as HGTV  
because cable providers have little room for another analog channel 
and only 2 million homes now are equipped to receive digital 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate to say it, but more people will probably use the Web  
site than will be able to see us on their TV,'' he said. 
</P>

	Manufacturing Sector Grows in July  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- `A survey of purchasing managers said today that  
the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the sixth 
consecutive month, but not as strongly as most analysts expected. 
The National Association of Purchasing Management said its monthly 
index of manufacturing activity registered 53.4 percent in July, 
compared with 57 percent in June. Figures above 50 percent indicate 
growth. The purchasing managers group also reported a slightly 
stronger rise in July raw-material prices than in June. The 
managers' report eased fears on Financial markets that there might 
be another hike in interest rates soon. 

</P>
<P>
	Construction Spending Rebounds  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending rose 0.5 percent in June  
after falling in two straight months. The Commerce Department said 
today that spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$699.4 billion, following drops of 1.4 percent in both May and 
April. The increases were fairly widespread with gains reported in 
office buildings, industrial buildings, hotels and motels and big 
government projects. However, spending on all residential 
construction fell 0.3 percent. The overall increase in construction 
spending was in line with many analysts' expectations.

</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators reported today that 99  
percent of the nation's banks, thrifts and credit unions have 
completed testing for the Year 2000 bug in their computer systems. 
Among the nation's 10,335 banks and thrifts, 10,246 received the 
highest possible rating for readiness, 78 were told they needed to 
improve and 11 drew unsatisfactory ratings, according to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. A similar breakdown among the 
10,807 credit unions included in the overall assessment wasn't 
immediately available. The regulators said most financial 
institutions, a number they did not specify, already are using 
computer systems that are Year 2000 compliant every day without 
problems.

drop in a year, according to a survey. The percentage of people 
with online access who said they purchased something from a Web 
site fell to 71 percent in the second quarter, down from 74 percent 
in the first quarter, according to Greenfield Online, a Westport, 
Conn.-based Internet marketing research firm. The decline followed 
four straight quarters of increases in online purchasing, according 
to Greenfield.

	CBS Earnings Rise Sharply  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. credited strong growth in its  
television and radio businesses for a large jump in second-quarter 
earnings. CBS reported today it earned $95 million, or 13 cents a 
share, compared with $4 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same 
period a year ago. The earnings matched Wall Street expectations. 
CBS president Mel Karmazin singled out a strong showing at the 
company's TV network business as an engine behind the profit surge. 
CBS was the top-rated network last season, taking the No. 1 spot 
for the first time in five years. CBS stock was up 13/16 at 44 3/4 in 
afternoon trading.

	AutoNation Separating Rental Units

<P>
	FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- AutoNation Inc. announced plans  
today to separate its rental-car business, including the Alamo and 
National chains, so the rest of the company can focus on auto 
sales. The Fort Lauderdale-based company disclosed the plans in 
issuing its quarterly earnings report. The rental division includes 
National Car Rental, Alamo Rent-A-Car and CarTemps USA. The board, 
which voted to separate the unit last week, has yet to decide how 
the rental companies will be separated, said AutoNation spokesman 
Jim Donahue. AutoNation reported earnings from its continuing 
operations rose to $97.1 million, or 21 cents a share, in the 
second quarter from $54.2 million, or 11 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. AutoNation shares were up 3/16 at 15 1/8.

straight month of declines of vehicle sales. Sales totaled 372,334 
vehicles in July, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said 
today. The monthly figures also included sales of imported 
vehicles, which fell 5.9 percent to 23,656.

	Russian Grain Harvest Doing Better  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian farms will harvest 66 million tons of  
grain this year, according to Ministry of Agriculture estimates 
released today, the Interfax news agency reported. The figure is 
higher than previous estimates. It suggests that a drought and 
locusts in the south, where most of the country's grain grows, have 
not cut into output as severely as originally feared. Estimates for 
1999 have fluctuated nearly every week, dipping as low as 55 
million tons. But Minister of Agriculture and Food Vladimir 
Shcherbak said yields per acre were up about 20 percent compared 
with last year.

	Brazilians Turn To Informal Economy  
</P>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Recession and rising unemployment  
have swelled the ranks of the underground economy, a huge but 
shadowy sector that dodges taxes and defies measuring. With the 
government predicting zero growth at best for this year, more and 
more Brazilians are JOINING IT. ``You wouldn't believe what goes on 
behind people's doors,'' says the cheerfully indiscreet doorman in 
one apartment house. ``We've got a hairdresser, a takeout meal 
service, two clothes makers, a manicurist, a natural products 
saleswoman and a coconut vendor.'' The government-run Brazilian 
Institute for Geography and Statistics, reporting recently on a 
1997 study of the informal economy, said that at that time one in 
four of Brazil's 52 million economically active people were in the 
informal economy. Of those, 55 percent worked at home or at their 
clients' homes.

<HEADLINE> Keller Set With Spanish Soccer Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- United States goalkeeper Kasey Keller has  
finalized the details of a two-year contract with Spanish soccer 
club Rayo Vallecano and is expected to arrive at the team's Madrid 
base this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very excited about playing in Spain after eight years in  
England,'' Keller said Monday in a U.S. Soccer Federation press 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	Keller played for the English first division club Leicester for  
the last three seasons. He is expected to be ready for Rayo 
Vallecano's opening match of the season on Aug. 22 against

<HEADLINE> Jury Selection in Tony Martin Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tony Martin has left Miami Dolphins training camp  
for court, where his trial on charges of laundering drug money 
began today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old receiver watched as prosecutors and his defense  
lawyers questioned a pool of 75 jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers anticipate a three-week trial, meaning a verdict would  
come three weeks before the Dolphins' first game Sept. 13 at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was charged eight days after starring in the Super Bowl  
for the Atlanta Falcons. After Atlanta released him, he signed a 
four-year, $14.2 million contract with the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges stem from Martin's longtime hometown friendship with  
codefendant Ricky Brownlee, who served seven years in prison for 
drug convictions during the 1980s. Martin's lawyers were denied a 
request for separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
	The case against Martin centers on accusations that he helped  
Brownlee spend drug profits. Prosecutors say the money was used for 
three car leases, and Martin tried to pay $175,000 in Brownlee's 
attorney fees with money from Brownlee. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin contends he didn't know the money was from drug sales and  
he never profited from the transactions and was motivated by 
friendship rather than criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins signed Martin because they believe he provides the  
deep threat quarterback Dan Marino has long lacked. Plus, Miami 
took little risk in signing him -- all but $100,000 of his contract 
is contingent on him being available to play. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin reported to training camp Friday with other Dolphins  
veterans. During the trial, he plans to work out on his own in the 
evening and practice with the team on weekends. The Dolphins took 
today off.

<HEADLINE> Study Eases Hyperactivity Drug Worry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Hyperactive boys who were treated with stimulants  
such as Ritalin were one-third as likely to abuse alcohol and other 
drugs as teen-agers than similar boys who had not been treated, a 
new study found. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts not involved in the study said it was flawed and  
too small to reach meaningful conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	But authors of the study -- which involved 212 boys, including 75  
with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD -- said the 
findings should help allay concerns that giving children 
potentially addictive drugs such as Ritalin may promote harmful 
habits later. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3 million school-age children have ADHD, and as  
many as half may be taking Ritalin or other stimulants, past 
research indicates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a mythology that the use of these medications  
could `prime' children to become addicts in the future or could 
develop `a culture of drug taking,''' said Dr. Joseph Biederman of 
Massachusetts General Hospital, lead author of the study. It is 
published in the August issue of Pediatrics' ``electronic pages,'' 
an Internet extension of the journal published by the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that children with ADHD who are medically treated  
will have fewer problems resulting from their disorder and more 
successful lives, probably giving them fewer reasons to experiment 
with substance abuse,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ritalin acts on dopamine, a brain chemical that helps regulate  
thinking. Ritalin is believed to calm hyperactivity by helping 
children's brains disregard distracting stimuli, such as classroom 
noise, so they can focus on learning. 
</P>
<P>
	The subjects for the research were part of a previous study of  
families with an ADHD child and families with no ADHD children. The 
children and their mothers were interviewed on three occasions -- 
when they entered the study, one year later and four years after 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors studied 56 ADHD patients who were on medication, 19  
ADHD patients not on medication and 137 patients without the 
disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	At the study's end, 75 percent of the unmedicated ADHD subjects  
had substance abuse disorders, compared with 25 percent of the 
medicated subjects. Abused substances included alcohol, marijuana, 
hallucinogens, cocaine and other stimulants. Eighteen percent of 
the non-ADHD subjects were substance abusers. 
</P>
<P>
	A critic of the study, psychologist Nadine M. Lambert of the  
University of California at Berkeley, said it was too small to show 
significant differences in rates of drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Her own research involving more than 200 ADHD subjects tracked  
for more than 20 years shows that those who took stimulant 
medication were more likely to be cocaine and tobacco abusers as 
adults than non-medicated subjects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lambert said she is not opposed to treating ADHD youngsters with  
stimulants because the benefits have been shown clearly, but she 
believes there are risks and they should be acknowledged.

<HEADLINE>  Gwynn Enjoys Chase to 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As Mark McGwire and Tony Gwynn close in on  
milestones, it's easy to see which player appears to be enjoying 
the chase more. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who entered Monday night's game against McGwire's St.  
Louis Cardinals six hits shy of 3,000, affably dealt with wave 
after wave of media in the hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pursuit has been fun,'' Gwynn said. ``The end of the  
pursuit has been a little bit more than even I thought it would be, 
but still, it's been fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said McGwire told him that holding mass news conferences  
during his 70-homer season allowed him to stay focused on the Roger 
Maris chase and the Sammy Sosa duel. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not Gwynn's way. The eight-time batting champion doesn't  
mind answering the same questions over and over to every individual 
reporter, always with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather sit down and talk to guys individually or in  
smaller groups because, to me, you get more out of it and both guys 
get more out of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has another reason for instant availability: He tried it  
McGwire's way and it was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire told me in San Diego he thought it saved him last year  
because he only had to discuss it one time,'' Gwynn said. ``So I 
took that advice to heart and went to Los Angeles and decided, I'll 
call a 3:30 press conference, and like, two guys showed up. If I 
get to first base, I'll have to let him know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was McGwire's locker neighbor at the All-Star Game at  
Boston, and he can sympathize if McGwire isn't Mr. Sunshine after 
seeing the demands placed upon him just from within. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about major league baseball leaning on somebody,''  
Gwynn said. ``The demands they make on guys like him and Griffey 
and Bonds, the icons of the game, the guys that carry the major 
league logo, is amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who entered the game three homers shy of 500 and with  
13 homers in 17 games, has steadfastly avoided the topic. After he 
hit No. 497 and drove in four runs in a 5-4 loss to Colorado on 
Sunday, he was particularly surly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys always ask me about numbers and I keep saying winning  
is what I care about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said St. Louis is the next-best place to reach 3,000 if he  
can't do it at home. He's flown in a rather large entourage of 
family members, and they'll all head to Montreal if it doesn't 
happen in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn had been 9-for-43 before getting three hits and homering  
Sunday against Houston. He entered the night tied with Wade Boggs 
of Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can get six hits and have it all work out,''  
Gwynn said. ``But the way I've been going, we may have to pack up 
and move on to the next stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hoping he, McGwire and Boggs wouldn't steal each  
other's thunder by reaching their milestone on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wouldn't surprise me at all if we all did it within 15  
minutes of each other.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Cut Fares for Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Airlines are offering steep discounts  
for late summer and fall travel, a welcome respite in a year during 
which the base ticket price has gone up 11 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines, the nation's fourth-largest airline, kicked  
off the fare sale during the weekend, with its computer system 
posting some off-peak prices discounted by as much as 25 percent. 
The fare changes were formally announced on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, and No. 2  
American Airlines were among those matching the sale, which 
includes most of the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much systemwide,'' said American spokesman Tim  
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines offering the discounts include U.S. Airways,  
America West, Continental, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air 
Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest said the discounts would remain in effect for travel  
to most destinations through Dec. 17. Advance purchase is required, 
a 14-day maximum stay applies to most destinations and tickets must 
be purchased by Aug. 13. A Saturday night stay is required and 
tickets are nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	Many international flights were announced as part of the sale as  
well, but those discounts have actually been available for more 
than a week, according to Tom Parsons, editor of www.bestfares.com, 
an Internet site that tracks travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only place I've seen any difference is to Asia,'' said  
Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the Asian discounts differ slightly from the domestic  
fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Parsons cautioned consumers that they could get better fares  
through some spot sales rather than through the new systemwide 
offer. He suggested travelers contact a travel agent to search for 
the best price. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Southwest Airlines' occasional coast-to-coast fare  
sales can result in better prices for travelers. Southwest has had 
three of those sales so far this year. Also, America West last week 
reduced prices for flights in and out of Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one of those fare sales to write home to mom  
about,'' he said. ``But with this sale more people can participate. 
I think the cities that are probably enjoying this air sale are 
where there's no competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fare examples include an off-peak fare of $354 roundtrip  
from New York to Dallas-Fort Worth with a 14-day advance purchase. 
That's compared to an everyday rate of $472, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago to San Francisco roundtrip, advance purchase, off-peak  
price would be $446, compared to an everyday price of $594, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounts of up to 25 percent mean some tickets are at the  
lowest level of this year. Airlines have been under pricing 
pressure in 1999 as they add planes to their fleets and additional 
seats become available. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Holly Hegeman with PlaneBusiness, an Internet  
site that focuses on the airline industry, attributes this sale to 
the additional space made available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much capacity is the culprit. Airlines are obviously  
looking ahead at bookings, seeing weak books in many cases, and so 
they are lowering the fares in an attempt to at least fill seats at 
some fare level,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the fare cut announcement, Northwest shares fell 37 1/2 cents to  
$31.75 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	But many airline stocks rose, in part because American Airlines  
reported strong travel numbers for July. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're usually the bellwether,'' said Susan Donofrio at BT  
Alex. Brown Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	AMR, the parent of American, was up $1.18 3/4 at $66.06 1/4 a share on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where UAL, the parent of United, was 
up 43 3/4 cents at $63.87 1/2. U.S. Airways rose $2.87 1/2 to $38.50 on news 
that a major shareholder was pushing to improve the value of the 
company's shares, including exploring a possible sale or merger.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Softball Is Rolling Along </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Unbeaten, virtually unscored upon and  
nearly unhittable. Nobody can touch the U.S. women's softball team. 
</P>
<P>
	In 37 games in the Pan American Games since 1987, the Americans  
never have lost. When they give up a run, it's a shock for this 
dream squad that has dominated the world. 
</P>
<P>
	This Pan Am squad, however, appears to be extra special.  
</P>
<P>
	``This team is probably the most powerful ever assembled,'' Dot  
Richardson, the peppery second baseman, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson's evaluation has to be taken seriously. She played on  
the team that won the gold medal in the 1979 Pan Am Games. Except 
for a two-year break after the 1996 Olympics to work on her 
residency -- she now is an orthopedic surgeon -- has been a member of 
almost every major U.S. team in the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In the previous three Pan Ams, when the United States won the  
gold medal, the Americans outscored their opposition 194-5. In 
those 30 games, U.S. pitchers threw 26 shutouts. The only team to 
score more than one run against them was Canada, a 4-2 loser in 
1991. Nine times they won by at least 10 runs. Canada also was the 
last team to beat the Americans, 5-4 in the 1983 title game. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's team, bolstered by the addition of former pro Crystl  
Bustos, the shortstop and cleanup hitter, and other outstanding 
young talent, already is 7-0, all shutouts until Monday's 8-1 
victory over Colombia. The Americans have scored 56 runs. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitchers have allowed only 10 hits, with Danielle Henderson  
throwing a perfect game against Colombia and a one-hitter against 
the Bahamas. Lisa Fernandez tossed a no-hitter against Cuba, and 
Michele Smith, the most valuable player in the Japan League each of 
the past two years and three times overall, hurled a one-hitter 
against the Netherlands Antilles. They have struck out 97 in 47 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. has dominated the sport because of our experience and  
the drive for each player to reach her full potential,'' said 
Richardson, 37. ``When you have athletes with that talent, you will 
see success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Sheila Douty, also 37, with three children and a  
granddaughter on the way, has been around as long as Richardson. 
Like her teammate, she played on the first Olympic gold medalists 
in softball in 1996 and on three Pan Am winning teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a huge player base to choose from,'' Douty said.  
``Some kids start playing T-ball at 4 or 5. They get into 
competitive ball between 8 and 10. Then they play in national 
tournaments against teams across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing that long, having good coaching and developing their  
techniques makes them good players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Ralph Raymond, who will guide the Americans in the 2000  
Olympics, agrees with Douty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had the opportunity to have a greater pick of the  
players,'' Raymond said, ``because about 200,000 are playing the 
(fast-pitch) game in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. teams also have won five golds and one silver in six Pan Am  
Games, and won six golds, including the last four, and two silvers 
in the world championships. Their 89-11 record in the worlds is the 
best ever. 
</P>
<P>
	This 15-member team includes nine players from the Olympic team  
that lost only once to Australia, before beating China three 
straight times to win the gold. 
</P>
<P>
	By winning the world title last year in Fujinomiya, Japan, the  
Americans qualified for the Sydney Games and will be the top seed. 
The team trials for the Olympics will be Sept. 2-4 at Midland, 
Mich. Forty-eight players have been invited, with 15 to be selected 
by a seven-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the players invited who are not in Winnipeg are Michele  
Granger, the starting pitcher in the opener game and the gold medal 
game at the Olympics. She hasn't played since then because she had 
two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Christa Williams, the youngest member of the Olympic  
team at 18, and second baseman Dani Tyler, another '96 Olympian, 
also were invited. 
</P>
<P>
	While Pan Ams opponents aren't as strong as those in the Canada  
Cup, which the United States recently won, the Americans aren't 
treating their opposition lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're representing yourself and your country,'' Fernandez,  
who got the save in the Olympic gold medal game against China, 
said. ``There's a lot of pride on the line. Even though we've been 
traveling a lot lately, you can't walk out on the field and say 
you're tired. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be terrible for someone to come out here and beat us.  
We couldn't live with a loss. Deep in our hearts, we feel if we 
play our game, we should come out on top.''

<HEADLINE> Arthritis Pill Outsells Viagra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't create a national sensation like  
Viagra, but the new arthritis pill Celebrex has surpassed the 
impotence medicine as the nation's fastest-selling new drug ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex promises pain relief with fewer stomach problems than  
other drugs. Unlike Viagra, patients take it every day and it's 
usually covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, which was introduced in January, sold 6.86 million  
prescriptions during its first six months on the market, compared 
with about 5.30 million for Viagra during its first six months, 
according to IMS Health, a research company. Celebrex began to 
outpace Viagra in weekly prescriptions after just nine weeks, IMS 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of Celebrex in the first six months added up to about $600  
million, said Monsanto, which co-markets the drug with Pfizer. In 
comparison, Viagra had $552 million in sales its first six months 
beginning in April 1998. Viagra is also made by Pfizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra serve huge markets. Arthritis effects  
about 37 million Americans; impotence affects 30 million men. 
</P>
<P>
	But Celebrex has some key advantages.  
</P>
<P>
	Many arthritis sufferers need pain relief every day. Men only  
need to take Viagra when they plan to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Further, Celebrex users also have largely stayed with the drug.  
Industry experts said thousands of men were inspired by the hype 
surrounding Viagra, and tried it only as an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``A significant amount of usage of Viagra was recreational and  
after a while those users got over the novelty of it,'' said Jack 
Lamberton, an analyst with HSBC Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Another big factor is insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Most insurance programs consider Viagra a lifestyle medication,  
and as a result either don't cover it or severely restrict coverage 
to a few pills per month. As a treatment for a serious, chronic 
disease, Celebrex enjoys greater insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Without coverage, patients may balk at paying the $2.42 a day  
for Celebrex or $8 per Viagra pill, industry analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex was the first in a class of new arthritis drugs called  
cox-2 inhibitors, which target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase-2 
that causes inflammation. Unlike earlier drugs, cox-2 inhibitors 
don't act against a second enzyme, cyclo-oxegenase-1, which 
protects the stomach lining. 
</P>
<P>
	Ulcers, stomach bleeding and other gastrointestinal side effects  
are a major problem with many painkillers, such as ibuprofen or 
aspirin, causing an estimated 16,500 deaths a year. 
</P>
<P>
	While tests show that cox-2 inhibitors may cause fewer ulcers  
than other drugs, the Food and Drug Administration still required 
Monsanto to put the same warning about side effects on Celebrex's 
label as the older drugs. Monsanto is conducting further tests to 
confirm that Celebrex is safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed Sudol, of Sleepy Hollow, N.Y,. has taken medications for his  
rheumatoid arthritis for 30 years. When he heard about Celebrex, he 
immediately asked his doctor for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Sudol has suffered no stomach problems from the other  
drugs, he also takes an ulcer medication just in case. Sudol said 
he can stop taking that medication because he feels more confident 
he is not hurting his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about quality of life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Both Celebrex and Viagra are expected to surpass $1 billion in  
worldwide sales in 1999 as they are introduced in new countries. 
But analysts then expect Celebrex sales to continue climbing to 
nearly $4 billion in 2002, while Viagra grows more slowly to about 
$1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketers note that despite its rapid launch, Celebrex still has  
just 20 percent of the market for arthritis drugs. Many people 
still rely on generic or over-the-counter medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	Does carrying the mantle of the hottest selling new drug really  
matter in the long run? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for publicity's sake and the company that  
introduced it,'' Lamberton said. ``It helps keep the drug in the 
public eye.''

<HEADLINE> Alaska Airlines Reaches Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A tentative agreement on a new four-year contract  
was announced Monday by Alaska Airlines and the union representing 
its flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which now must be approved by union members, would  
cover the nearly 2,000 attendants at the regional carrier who are 
represented by the Association of Flight Attendants, AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said they would not announce details of the proposed  
agreement until union members have had a chance to review the 
offer, but it contains wage and benefit increases and an improved 
401(k) retirement savings plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked hard to address the concerns of all flight  
attendants in this contract,'' said Thomas Lent, AFA Master 
Executive Council president at Alaska. ``I think the members will 
be pleased with the improvement we made in compensation, benefits, 
work rules and scheduling flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we have a tentative agreement that will help keep the  
airline in a strong competitive position, while offering our flight 
attendants an attractive package of pay and benefits,'' said John 
F. Kelly, Alaska's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Airlines, part of Alaska Air Group, serves more than 40  
cities in Alaska, Canada, Mexico and five Western states.

<HEADLINE> Congress Negotiates Final Tax Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Republicans, working with  
unusual urgency, labored Monday toward a compromise on tax cuts, 
intent on passing the measure through the House and Senate by 
week's end as part of a veto showdown with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairmen of the two tax-writing committees, Texas Rep. Bill  
Archer of the House Ways and Means Committee and Delaware Sen. 
William Roth of the Finance Committee, met privately in a room in 
the Capitol as aides shuttled in and out. 
</P>
<P>
	The senior GOP leadership of both houses convened later in the  
day, and it appeared that Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., were exercising firm 
control over the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the House and Senate passed $792 billion tax cut measures  
in the past two weeks, but the two bills differ significantly in 
detail. The House bill calls for a 10 percent across-the-board tax 
cut, phased in over a decade, to achieve broad-based tax relief. 
The Senate measure, by contrast, would drop the current 15 percent 
tax bracket to 14 percent, and allow income that is currently taxed 
at 28 percent to be subject to the lower tax instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Both houses provide relief from the so-called marriage penalty  
and estate taxes and reduce taxes on capital gains, but with 
different provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the Senate measure includes numerous provisions to  
assist taxpayers who save for their retirement. There also are 
differences over tax breaks for health care and education, as well 
as special interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue spilled briefly into public when Democrats forced a  
roll call vote in the House on their demand that Republicans scale 
back the tax cut to extend the solvency of Social Security and 
Medicare and provide for a prescription drug benefit for recipients 
of the health care program for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., said that by their vote, Republicans  
were indicating whether they supported a cut in Social Security 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Republicans were ``begging  
for a veto'' and would get one. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said Democrats made the same charges about spending cuts  
the last time Republicans pushed for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can save Social Security. We can save Medicare. We can give  
a prescription drug benefit and we can pay down the debt and we can 
give a small amount of tax relief,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the rhetoric on the House floor, the real decisions  
were being made in private, in meetings involving Lott, Hastert and 
other GOP leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Customarily, both houses name numerous senior lawmakers to  
thrash out differences in legislation. In this case, though, the 
group was limited to two Republicans and one Democrat from the 
Senate and four Republicans and two Democrats from the House. To 
keep the closest possible control over the proceedings, Republicans 
tapped Lott and Roth from the Senate and Majority Leader Dick Armey 
and Archer from the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans labored under a schedule that called for House  
passage on Thursday and Senate passage on Friday. Rank-and-file GOP 
lawmakers intend to trumpet the benefits of their measure during 
Congress' long August recess, then send the bill to Clinton for his 
expected veto after Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive for tax cuts stems from enormous surpluses projected  
to materialize over the next decade. Republicans say they will set 
aside more than $2 trillion to help ensure Social Security's 
solvency before turning to tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats caution that the surpluses may never materialize and  
that in the decade beginning in 2009, the GOP tax cut will explode 
by an additional $3 trillion. As a result, they said, it would 
jeopardize the economy.

<HEADLINE> Nearly All Banks Said OK for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ninety-nine percent of the nation's federally  
insured banks, thrifts and credit unions have successfully 
completed preparations for the Year 2000 computer bug, federal 
regulators reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the nation's 10,335 banks and thrifts, 10,246 received the  
highest possible rating for readiness, 78 were told they needed to 
improve and 11 drew unsatisfactory ratings, according to the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, only 56 of the nation's 10,807 credit unions had not  
completed Year 2000 testing as of July 28, the National Credit 
Union Administration said in a report to Congress last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Most financial institutions already are using computer systems  
that are Year 2000 compliant, the regulators said, without offering 
specific numbers. The institutions had to meet a June 30 deadline 
for testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agencies are confident that, based on their reviews,  
financial institution customers will be able to conduct business as 
usual both before and after Jan. 1, 2000,'' the Federal Financial 
Institutions Examination Council, which issued Monday's report, 
said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulators are ``closely supervising'' the few institutions  
lagging in their readiness, said the council, which consists of the 
FDIC, the Federal Reserve, the Treasury Department's office of the 
comptroller of the currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and 
the National Credit Union Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve recently approved a plan to make special  
loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that might need emergency 
money because of consumer fears about system breakdowns caused by 
computers that can't handle the Year 2000 date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in congressional  
testimony that banks will be the safest place for people to keep 
their cash at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many Americans are expected to withdraw extra cash on  
or before the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Monday approved legislation that would expand the  
types of collateral a bank can offer when seeking credit from the 
Federal Reserve. The aim of the bill, passed by voice vote, is to 
help banks deal with an unusual demand for cash. The Senate has yet 
to consider it.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expands Anti-Drug Ad Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration has expanded its  
anti-drug advertising campaign into 11 languages beyond English -- 
including Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Navajo, Cherokee and 
Aleutian dialect. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a teen-ager or parent,'' President Clinton said  
Monday, ``it is nearly impossible to avoid seeing or hearing our 
anti-drug messages on television or radio several times a week.'' 
He spoke at a ceremony previewing new ads urging young people to 
reject drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	Begun in 1997, the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign has  
grown from a 12-city pilot program to a national effort that claims 
to reach 90 percent of young people four to seven times a week. It 
uses television, radio, the Internet, newspapers, magazines and bus 
and movie ads to target young people, parents, teachers, mentors, 
coaches and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to be where the young people are,'' said Barry  
McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected the ads would greatly increase awareness,''  
Clinton said. ``What we didn't expect was that the ads would 
already have a measurable effect on attitudes. This is a very good 
sign. What it proves is, I suppose, what we should have known all 
along, that if advertising works in commerce and advertising works 
in politics, advertising ought to work on this issue as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to English, ads are produced in Spanish, Mandarin,  
Cantonese, Korean, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Lakota, Navajo, 
Cherokee and Aleutian dialect. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the  
campaign was ``well-intentioned but incomplete. How can an ad 
campaign succeed when it ignores underage drinking, the number one 
drug problem among teens? Alcohol kills six times more young people 
in this country than all illegal drugs combined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey, at a White House briefing, said there is not enough  
money in the $195 million allocated each year for anti-drug ads to 
finance anti-alcohol ads as well. ``If we want to go after underage 
alcohol abuse with a paid campaign, then we need to pay for it. ... 
We're right on the margin right now with the amount of money we're 
using.''

<HEADLINE> Antimissile Missile Hits Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- An experimental  
antimissile missile hit a simulated warhead over New Mexico today, 
the second success for a controversial $3.8 billion defense system 
that failed in its first six attempts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system is designed to use  
ground-launched missiles to destroy high-altitude enemy missiles 
from 800 miles away or more, a distance that current U.S. weapons 
cannot reach. 
</P>
<P>
	The target missile was launched at 3:37 a.m. EST, just north of  
the Army's restricted White Sands Missile Range in southern New 
Mexico, said Pam Rogers, a spokeswoman for the THAAD program 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	A THAAD missile was launched minutes later from the southern end  
of the missile range, she said. When the simulated warhead 
separated from the target missile booster, THAAD picked out the 
fake warhead and hit it. 
</P>
<P>
	``So that's two in a row,'' said Jim Eckles, a range spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
	The system has been criticized as too expensive and unreliable.  
The weapon's prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, was fined $15 
million after its sixth test failed in May. THAAD scored its first 
hit June 10 over White Sands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has since said that it will cancel the fine if the  
defense contractor improves THAAD performance and that it is 
confident Lockheed Martin can successfully develop the system. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent report by the General Accounting Office found that the  
flight-test failures were caused primarily by manufacturing 
defects, and that the program had been pushed ahead too quickly to 
allow adequate testing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has since lengthened the test schedule, removed  
deployment requirements and increased emphasis on quality, the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> INS Officer Says He Didn't Smuggle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- An immigration inspector has pleaded innocent  
to accepting $350,000 to allow thousands of pounds of marijuana and 
20 illegal immigrants to enter the United States over the course of 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Pineda, 41, was arraigned Monday in federal court on  
charges of racketeering, drug and immigrant smuggling. He faces 
life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities have also charged two Mexican nationals, one of whom  
is a Tijuana police officer, with participating in the smuggling 
ring, but neither man is in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Pineda was arrested Friday as he left his job at San Ysidro,  
where he has worked as an inspector for the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is very upset because one of our officers has  
violated the public trust,'' said INS spokesman Bill Strassberger. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the third arrest in less than two months for corruption  
at San Ysidro, 15 miles south of San Diego just over the border 
from Tijuana, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, authorities accused Keith Johnson, a former INS  
inspector, with smuggling three illegal immigrants through a 
pedestrian checkpoint at the port, the world's busiest border 
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	In early June, another former immigration inspector, Daniel  
Goodrum, was charged with stealing and selling green cards -- two of 
which were later used by drug smugglers to enter the United States, 
authorities said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Trade Pace Picks Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Portland Trail Blazers and Atlanta Hawks completed the  
long-rumored Steve Smith-Isaiah Rider trade, and a handful of free 
agent signings also took place Monday as the pace of player 
movement picked up. 
</P>
<P>
	On the second day after the NBA's moratorium on trades and  
veteran signings elapsed, the Blazers signed Detlef Schrempf and 
re-signed Jermaine O'Neal, while Rodney Rogers agreed to terms with 
the Phoenix Suns, Michael Curry moved from Milwaukee to the 
Pistons, Jud Buechler opted to stay in Detroit and Jelani McCoy 
re-signed with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, after an acrimonious split with the SuperSonics, chose  
the Trail Blazers over the Jazz and Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Oakley was in Los Angeles to speak to the Lakers, even  
as the Toronto Raptors had an offer worth about $6 million annually 
on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no movement on the Penny Hardaway or Mitch  
Richmond trade fronts, while the other two big-ticket free agents -- 
Terrell Brandon and Vin Baker -- appeared almost certain to remain 
with their old teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trail Blazers and Hawks finally pulled off their four-player  
deal, with Rider and Jim Jackson sent to Atlanta for Smith and Ed 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	A subsequent trade sending Jackson from Atlanta to the Los  
Angeles Clippers for free agent Lorenzen Wright, first reported by 
the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, was being discussed. But Hawks 
general manager Pete Babcock said the teams ``were not even 
close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice to add depth to our frontcourt, depending on  
how heavy a price it would be on the rest of our roster,'' Babcock 
said. ``We didn't make this trade with a plan to move one of these 
players on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a particularly busy day for the Blazers, who increased  
their offer to the 20-year-old O'Neal and kept him from leaving for 
a more lucrative deal elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal got a four-year contract. Terms were not disclosed, but  
O'Neal said he turned down a one-year offer of $9 million-$10 
million from another team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to be here for the next 10-15 years,'' said O'Neal, who  
felt the Blazers lowballed him with their initial $3 million per 
year offer. ``So hopefully I'll play to my potential the next two 
to three years, and then we can talk about some extensions, but 
overall I really want to be here. I want them to retire my jersey 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers agreed to take the $2 million mid-level exception from  
the Suns, who have already re-signed Clifford Robinson and remain 
in the hunt for Hardaway. The contract is for three years, with the 
final season at the player's option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to work out a sign-and-trade deal, but it  
didn't look like the Clippers were going to get anything done,'' 
said Bill Strickland, the agent for Rogers, ``so we made this 
decision in a fluid market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry took the Pistons' five-year, $12 million offer over a  
four-year, $10 million offer from Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bucks' offer was very, very good, but the main factor at  
this stage of his career after so many years of moving his family 
around was getting the longest and most stable situation,'' said 
Curry's agent, Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Curry spent 1 1/2 seasons with the Pistons before  
going to the Bucks. As a reserve last season, he averaged 4.9 
points and made $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler signed a one-year deal with a player option for a  
second year using the team's $1.1 million exception, said his 
agent, Mark Bartelstein. Buechler was 10th in the league last 
season in 3-point shooting proficiency -- 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf, who was insulted by Seattle's $1.1 million offer,  
decided to move down the road to Portland for two years at $4.2 
million. His final choices were Portland and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's saved all his money, he just wants to win a  
championship,'' said his agent, Tony Dutt. 
</P>
<P>
	Schrempf also drew interest from the San Antonio Spurs, but told  
them he preferred to remain closer to his family in Seattle. The 
36-year-old spent the past five season with the Sonics, who are 
courting Shandon Anderson and Cedric Ceballos as his replacement. 
Seattle also expressed interest in Rick Fox, who is expected to 
return to the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley, meanwhile, was in Los Angeles to attend Magic Johnson's  
charity game and meet with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to have to see what happens. Money ain't the big  
thing right now,'' Oakley told the Los Angeles Daily News. ``I 
think the foundation is here'' to win a title, he said. ``A lot 
more little parts need to be added. I got to know everybody wants 
to be on the same track. If I come here, there ain't going to be no 
bull. I'm all about business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raptors have offered Oakley a three-year contract believed  
to be worth about $18 million, and the Hawks could still make a 
slightly smaller offer if they are unable to work out a deal with 
the Clippers for Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's future remained uncertain, with the Orlando Magic  
hoping to get a better offer from Phoenix in a sign-and-trade deal 
and the Lakers also trying to put together a package that would 
satisfy the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Suns or Lakers can't pull off a trade and Hardaway does  
not return to Orlando, his best option would be to sign with the 
Raptors or Clippers -- the only teams with enough salary cap room to 
give him a lucrative contract starting at $9.5 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The strangely silent Chicago Bulls also have loads of cap room,  
but Hardaway apparently does not want to play there. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics re-signed McCoy to a two-year contract. McCoy, a 6-10  
center who was drafted 33rd overall in 1998, averaged 5.1 points 
and 3.0 rebounds in 26 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics also were waiting to hear from the Wizards regarding  
a possible trade for Richmond, who has reportedly been offered $30 
million for three years to stay in Washington. Seattle would like 
to acquire him in a sign-and-trade deal involving Hersey Hawkins 
and another player. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker's agent was expected to meet with the Sonics on Monday  
night, and Brandon's agent was working with the Timberwolves to 
finalize a deal that would keep the point guard in Minnesota. The 
Timberwolves and Brandon were not quite in agreement on the amount 
of money in his deal, a situation similar to the one in Denver that 
was temporarily keeping Nick Van Exel from re-upping with the 
Nuggets.

<HEADLINE> Judges Discuss Trie, Hubbell Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson  
summoned her colleagues to an unusual meeting Monday and told them 
that heavy workloads were a factor in her assignment of criminal 
cases against two presidential friends to judges appointed by 
President Clinton, according to attendees. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, the chief judge of the federal court in Washington,  
called the meeting in response to an Associated Press report this 
weekend that she bypassed the normal random assignment system for 
cases involving Webster Hubbell and Charlie Trie. 
</P>
<P>
	The story noted some of her colleagues were concerned by the  
special assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	According to several judges who attended the late-afternoon  
meeting, the chief judge called the meeting to discuss a letter she 
plans to write in response to the AP article. She declined repeated 
requests to comment before the story was released. 
</P>
<P>
	One judge said the draft letter contained no explanation of why  
she assigned the Hubbell case to Judge James Robertson and the Trie 
case to Judge Paul Friedman, two Clinton appointees, according to 
the attendees. 
</P>
<P>
	``She responded with a general statement containing several  
factors, including what she viewed as the heavy calendars of 
several other judges at the time of the Hubbell and Trie cases,'' 
one judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	All the judges spoke on condition of anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson told the judges that she will point out in the letter  
that her predecessors had assigned cases outside the random draw in 
scandals such as Watergate and Iran-Contra. Those assignments, 
however, were to some of the most experienced judges in the 
courthouse at the time and not to recent appointees, AP reported 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The Trie case in January 1998 was the first major case in the  
Justice Department's probe of Democratic fund-raising abuses and 
the Hubbell tax evasion case three months later was the first 
prosecution brought by Kenneth Starr.

<HEADLINE> Son of Ex-NFL Star Slain in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Though slain seemingly in his prime during last  
week's massacre in an Atlanta office building, Kevin Dial already 
had made his peace with death. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial, the 36-year-old son of former NFL star Buddy Dial, had an  
inoperable brain tumor. His family made the disclosure at his 
funeral Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's worth seeing or hearing or doing, I want to see it or  
hear it or do it now,'' Dial wrote in a letter he faxed to his 
mother, Janice Marye, the day before Thursday's shooting rampage. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial's sister, Sherri, read the letter to some 500 mourners who  
filled the sanctuary at Second Baptist Church in Houston. She 
sobbed throughout the eulogy about her ``best friend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She continued reading the letter: ``Every day, every breath,  
every thing in life really is a gift from God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Dial starred at Rice University before going on to  
standout career as a receiver with the Pittsburgh Steelers and 
Dallas Cowboys. He attended the service despite a recent stroke and 
chronic injuries from his football days. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Dial visited his father in nearby Tomball during the July  
4 holiday weekend and told him he was prepared to die, relatives 
said. However, in his letter last week, Dial spoke of his 
frustration at being unable to grow old: 
</P>
<P>
	``It's those little things left undone that make me angry that  
my days are limited,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial was helping to establish a Momentum Securities day-trading  
office in Atlanta. Trader Mark Barton killed Dial and three others 
at the office Thursday, then killed five more at another firm. Nine 
shooting victims remained hospitalized Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barton also fatally bludgeoned his wife and two children in the  
two days preceding the rampage. He committed suicide after the 
shootings as police closed in. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened that day was not God's will,'' the Rev. Richard  
O'Brien said. ``It was the evil act of one man, no matter the 
provocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dial's sister and other speakers recalled a natural leader with  
a magnetic personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty sure you're with Elvis, having cocktails, trying to  
convince God to let (John) Belushi visit,'' she said, speaking to 
her brother and drawing laughter. ``And I think he'll probably do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dial was buried at Forest Park Lawndale Cemetery in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans, Grains Continue Climb / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices soared in early  
dealings today on the Chicago Board of Trade after a dry weekend in 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, soybeans jumped as much as a quarter a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Though temperatures dropped to the low 90s and 80s in much of  
the growing region, analysts say soybean and corn traders are 
particularly concerned about forecasts calling for little or no 
rain this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say wheat prices also caught a ride upward on the fast  
market. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading, wheat for December delivery rose 13 1/4 cents to  
$2.93 a bushel; December corn climbed 11 3/4 cents to $2.26 1/4 a bushel; 
December oats rose 5 1/4 cents to $1.17 a bushel; and November 
soybeans jumped 24 3/4 cents to $4.58 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the  
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .45 cent to 64.82 cents a pound;  
September feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 76.75 cents a pound; 
September lean hogs rose 2 cents to 45.35 cents a pound; and August 
pork bellies rose the limit 3 cents to 55.12 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> GM Brake Problem Halts Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- An unresolved problem with brakes on some General  
Motors Corp. pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles forced the 
automaker to shut down assembly plants in Linden, N.J., and 
Shreveport, La., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plants produce the Chevrolet S-10, GMC Sonoma and Isuzu  
Hombre pickups. The New Jersey plant also makes the two-door 
Chevrolet Blazer and GMC Jimmy SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers assembling the light trucks discovered brake fluid was  
leaking, and the source of the problem could not be immediately 
determined, according to a GM source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem was found only on two-wheel-drive models and no  
defective trucks left the plant, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Production was slowed on Friday and halted Monday. GM said it  
could not estimate when production might resume. Production of the 
four-door Blazer and Jimmy at GM's plant in Moraine, Ohio, was 
unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
	Shreveport has about 2,200 hourly workers, while Linden employs  
about 2,400. Skilled trade and salaried workers remained on the 
job.

<HEADLINE> Sega Says Dreamcast Orders Are Brisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sega Enterprises Ltd.'s future in the home  
video-game business may come down to one thing: Will its new 
Dreamcast video gaming system be a best seller? 
</P>
<P>
	Already, there are signs that consumer demand is there. The  
company was expected to announce today that it has taken more than 
200,000 pre-orders for the $199 new system, which will hit store 
shelves Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	While the orders are coming in well ahead of expectations,  
analysts still warn that the initial hype over the new console 
doesn't guarantee a long-term hit for the company that once led the 
video game business. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they will have a strong year and a very strong  
Christmas,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst at the investment firm 
Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``But the question is: `Will they be able 
to continue the momentum after that?''' 
</P>
<P>
	For Tokyo-based Sega, which had a hit with its Genesis system in  
the early 1990s, much rests on Dreamcast's success. Its Saturn 
gaming console bombed five years ago, and the company now lags a 
distant third behind Sony and Nintendo. Saturn had fewer games than 
its rivals and was less powerful than Nintendo 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Sony currently accounts for about 60 percent of the U.S. market  
for video game machines with its PlayStation system, while Nintendo 
holds more than 30 percent; Sega has less than 5 percent, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A big hit with Dreamcast could again make Sega a serious player  
in the video-game business. But a flop could wipe it out of the 
home gaming market for good. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Sega has to prove with Dreamcast is that we can have  
success in the U.S. market,'' said Charles Bellfield, director of 
marketing at Sega of America, based in Redwood City, Calif. ``The 
Saturn launch here was a failure, and now we need to show that 
we've learned from our past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With so much riding on the Dreamcast, Sega is spending more than  
$100 million on marketing and advertising. Starting in mid-July, it 
took the unusual step of offering the public the opportunity to 
rent out the new system at 1,000 Hollywood Video stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sega hopes to convince consumers that its next-generation  
128-bit system is far more advanced than anything currently on the 
market and will provide a more exciting gaming experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreamcast is the first to include Internet capabilities. With a  
modem in its base, consumers will be able to play games online, as 
well as e-mail, chat and browse the Web. It also features advanced 
3-D graphics and sophisticated sound. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, demand has been surprisingly strong. Retailers are  
shocked by the number of pre-orders they have received. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in this business for 14 years and this is the  
biggest product that I have ever been involved in,'' said Peter 
Roithmayr, vice president of merchandise for video games at 
Electronics Boutique, which has more than 500 stores in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the largest pre-sell ever and we think that the day it  
launches will be the biggest day in sales in the history of the 
company,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doreen McKenzie, who heads video games merchandising at the  
480-store Babbage's Etc. chain, said consumers are not only 
attracted to Dreamcast's technology but also by the 16 games that 
Sega will make available at the launch -- something serious gamers 
look for when buying a new system. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is more than I've ever seen before when a new system has  
been launched,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sega is eager to tout its hefty pre-orders, analysts still  
question whether Dreamcast's sales momentum will can continue into 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, where Dreamcast hit stores almost a year ago, sales  
are well below expectations. That led Moody's Investors Service to 
downgrade Sega's debt rating last week, saying that ``Sega's 
earnings and cash flow remain under pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many analysts say Dreamcast's sales will come under  
pressure as new systems from Sony and Nintendo come to market. 
Sony's PlayStation II will be in U.S. stores by the fall of 2000, 
while Nintendo's next platform should be available in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastly, Sony and Nintendo are expected to drop the price of  
their existing systems -- Playstation and N64 -- from $129 to $99 at 
the end of August in an attempt to steal some sales from the 
Dreamcast launch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The buzz around Dreamcast is good and they've already locked  
in a good Christmas,'' said McGowan, the toy industry analyst. 
``They have a number of games that look much better than anything 
that is out there now. But new competition isn't far away.''

<HEADLINE> John Huang's Hearing Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A hearing for John Huang was postponed when a  
Republican congressman demanded that the former Democratic Party 
fund-raiser testify before Congress before making a courtroom plea 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, the Democrats' chief fund-raiser for the Asian-American  
community in 1996, brought in $1.6 million in questionable 
donations that later were returned. He has been cooperating with 
Justice Department investigators in their campaign finance probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The former executive of Jakarta-based Lippo Group, accused of  
making illegal campaign contributions, was scheduled to appear in 
federal court Monday to resolve his case. Government prosecutors 
had recommended he be fined $10,000 and sentenced to 500 hours of 
community service. He could have been sentenced to jail for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, wrote to U.S. District Judge Richard Paez asking 
for an indefinite delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said Paez delayed the hearing until Aug. 12 and ordered 
attorneys in the case to begin submitting legal briefs on whether 
Huang's case should be postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's press secretary, Mark Corallo, said Burton's concerns  
were covered in a July 28 letter he wrote to U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno. In that letter, Burton said he would seek postponing of 
sentences for both Huang and Democratic fund-raiser Charlie Trie 
because they had not yet testified before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the federal government asked that Trie's sentencing  
be postponed at least six weeks so that Trie's cooperation with the 
government can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie has pleaded guilty to two counts involving campaign finance  
violations, one a felony and the other a misdemeanor, and pledged 
to cooperate in an investigation of campaign fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have recommended that Trie be given three years'  
probation.

                           *Leo V. Berger    	
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Leo V. Berger, one of the country's  
biggest shipping magnates, who helped revitalize the U.S. merchant 
marine fleet, died of a heart attack July 24. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger began working to rebuild America's dying international  
shipping business in 1967 with the federally subsidized purchase of 
an oil tanker for $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Berger built up his Apex Marine Corp. of Lake  
Success, N.Y., which had an estimated $100 million annual revenue 
and a fleet of 24 ships at its high point in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	As the market soured in recent years, Berger began selling  
ships. He sold two to the U.S. Navy and helped transform them into 
1,100-bed hospitals serving American troops. The ships are still in 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hungarian immigrant came to the United States with his  
family in 1928 and settled in New York City. He was inducted into 
the U.S. Merchant Marine's Hall of Distinguished Graduates last 
year.

<P>
	OXFORD, England (AP) -- Nirad C. Chaudhuri, the Indian-born  
author and scholar who was acclaimed abroad but scorned in the 
Subcontinent, died Sunday. He was 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Chaudhuri made his entry into the scene of scholarly literature  
in 1951 with the publication of ``The Autobiography of an Unknown 
Indian,'' a memoir of his childhood in colonial India, in what is 
now Bangladesh. The thick memoir included lively, insightful 
descriptions of Indian customs, castes and relations with the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
	As a barefoot boy, he read Shakespeare alongside Sanskrit  
classics, and the memoirs were somewhat sympathetic to the 
unpopular 200 years of British rule. Critics called him the last 
British imperialist. 
</P>
<P>
	At the age of 90 he wrote a second 1,000-page tome of  
autobiography, ``Thy Hand, Great Anarch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His last book of essays, ``Three Horsemen of the New  
Apocalypse,'' was written when he was 99. It was an indictment of 
what he called India's failed leadership and a lament for the 
decline of the country. He also concluded after 30 years in Oxford 
that England did not deserve itself.

</P>

court reporter for The Home News, died Saturday of a pulmonary 
embolism. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavanaugh was a reporter at the newspaper for 43 years, 35 of  
which were spent covering the Middlesex County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in New Hampshire, Kavanaugh lived in several places as a  
child. He served in the Army during World War II. After the war, he 
returned to East Orange and graduated from Rutgers University in 
1951. While at Rutgers, Kavanaugh began working at what was then 
The Daily Home News of New Brunswick. 
</P>
<P>
	Kavanaugh won a National Headliner award in 1965 for writing a  
series of articles on drug use among young people, and also 
received awards from the New Jersey Press Association and Sigma 
Delta Chi. 
</P>

botany at the University of Washington who researched a 
particularly malodorous type of lily for more than 50 years, died 
Tuesday of pneumonia. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeuse wrote more than 200 articles on the voodoo lily, a  
relative of the ``corpse flower'' that came into rare bloom last 
month at the university, and other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	He discovered a moss enzyme that oxidizes oxalic acid. Now the  
enzyme helps monitor blood in people who produce excess oxalic 
acid, which can cause deadly crystals in their kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
	But his passion remained researching the heat-and-stench

<P>
	TELLURIDE, Colo. (AP) -- Gregory Charles Minor, an engineer who  
quit General Electric's reactor division in the 1970s to protest 
nuclear power, died July 20 of leukemia. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor and two other middle-management engineers, Richard Hubbard  
and Dale Bridenbough, quit General Electric in 1976, saying they 
believed nuclear power presented a profound threat to mankind. 
</P>
<P>
	``My reason for leaving is a deep conviction that nuclear  
reactors and nuclear weapons now present a serious danger to the 
future of all life on this planet,'' Minor said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The three engineers, who spent most of their careers building  
reactors, testified before Congress that because they had become so 
specialized they could no longer see the big picture. As a result, 
no one was in control. 
</P>
<P>
	The three engineers, championed by the anti-nuclear movement,  
founded MHB Technical Associates in San Jose, Calif., where they 
spent the next two decades conducting studies and testifying on the 
safety, reliability, construction and economics of power plants.

</P>
<P>
	BRYN MAWR, Pa. (AP) -- Gilbert Barclay Mustin, the president of  
Fleer Corp., one of the largest baseball trading card companies in 
the country and creator of Dubble Bubble chewing gum, died July 28 
of pneumonia. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin was the grandson of Frank Fleer, who founded Fleer in  
Philadelphia in the 1880s. The company made confections including 
Chiclets gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleer is believed to have invented bubble gum in 1928. Company  
accountant Walter Diemer is often credited with accidentally 
inventing the product, which Fleer sold under the name Dubble 
Bubble. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin started at Fleer in 1949 and became its president in  
1959. By then, the company was in stiff competition with Topps, 
makers of Bazooka bubble gum. Topps dominated the baseball trading 
card business because the Federal Trade Commission had upheld 
Topps' exclusive contracts with pro baseball players for the use of 
their pictures on cards packaged with the gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleer, which had long sold trading cards of movie stars and  
other personalities with its gum, began a long antitrust suit 
against Topps in 1975. In 1983, the companies reached an out of 
court settlement that allowed Fleer to sell baseball cards but not 
with gum. 
</P>
<P>
	Mustin retired in 1989, the year Fleer was sold to Marvel  
Entertainment. Fleer was sold again this year to a group of private 
investors and renamed Fleer Skybox of Mount Laurel, N.J.

<P>
	Posuvalyuk, a deputy foreign minister, died after a long  
illness, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert in Middle Eastern affairs, Posuvalyuk joined the  
Russian diplomatic corps in 1964. He served in embassies in Yemen, 
Iraq and Syria before becoming Russia's ambassador to Oman in 1988 
and Iraq in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	After returning to Moscow in 1992 to head the Foreign Ministry's  
Department of Africa and the Near East, he shuttled between Baghdad 
and Moscow in efforts to defuse several crises around Iraq, and 
took part in negotiations to advance the Mideast peace process.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Clint Youle, one of the first men to present the  
weather on television and a former Illinois legislator, died July 
23. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle's television career began in 1948 when producers at NBC in  
Chicago decided to produce daily weather reports. He volunteered to 
use meteorology expertise he had gained during World War II and was 
first to present the weather on a national news program when he 
appeared on ``The Camel News Caravan'' with John Cameron Swayze in 
1949. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle, who became known as Mr. Weatherman, used a Rand McNally  
map covered with Plexiglas and marked weather systems using a black 
marker as he gave the forecast. He retired from television in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle was elected to the Illinois Legislature in 1964. He  
received the second largest number of votes on the Republican 
ticket because of his name recognition, said his son, John. 
</P>
<P>
	Youle also owned several newspapers and worked as an investment  
banker.

<HEADLINE> Texas Governor To Fight Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush denies he played a role in the  
firing of a state worker who was investigating allegations of 
misconduct at funeral homes owned by a company whose chairman is a 
longtime Bush family supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican presidential candidate was subpoenaed to testify  
in a whistle-blower lawsuit filed by Eliza May, former executive 
director of the Funeral Service Commission, against Houston-based 
Service Corporation International. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush will file court documents by Friday asking a judge to  
reject demands that he testify, press secretary Linda Edwards said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's testimony is not needed because he knows nothing about  
the investigation or Ms. May's dismissal, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor has no personal knowledge of this situation,''  
Edwards said. ``The governor's office did not attempt to influence 
this investigation in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May, who until last summer was treasurer of the Texas  
Democratic Party, was fired in February after leading her agency's 
investigation into embalming practices at 20 SCI funeral homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May's lawsuit alleges that SCI, whose political action  
committee gave Bush $35,000 in 1996 and 1997, worked with Bush's 
staff to interfere with the investigation. The inquiry led to a 
recommended fine of $445,000 against the company, which owns 3,700 
funeral homes worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. May contends that Bush had her fired at the urging of Robert  
Waltrip, SCI chairman and longtime Bush family supporter. 
</P>
<P>
	A governor is granted broad immunity from such actions. But the  
lawsuit lists Bush as a conspirator while Waltrip, SCI and the 
Texas Funeral Service Commission are defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal experts said Bush could lose his battle to kill the  
subpoena because of precedents set in President Clinton's dispute 
with Paula Corbin Jones, The Dallas Morning News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge handling the case will determine whether Bush  
``actually knows something or if the plaintiff's lawyers are simply 
trying to embarrass a presidential candidate,'' said Emory 
University law professor Frank Vandall, an expert on whistle-blower 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if he testifies, he better make sure everything --  
absolutely everything -- he says is truthful, because people are 
going to examine every word and its meaning,'' said Vandall.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Sign Curry, Buechler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons on Monday  
announced the signing of free agent small forward Michael Curry and 
the re-signing of guard Jud Buechler. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, who spent the past two seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks,  
will get $12 million over five years from the Pistons. The Bucks 
had the next best offer, $10 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bucks' offer was very, very good, but the main factor at  
this stage of his career after so many years of moving his family 
around was getting the longest and most stable situation,'' said 
Curry's agent, Guy Zucker. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5 Curry spent 1 1/2 seasons with the Pistons before  
going to the Bucks. As a reserve last season, he averaged 4.9 
points and made $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very happy to have Michael back in the fold here in  
Detroit,'' Pistons general manager Rick Sund said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to lose him (to Milwaukee) when he left here,  
but at the time, he made a decision in the best interest of his 
family,'' Sund said. ``Now, at a time when he could have played for 
a number of teams, we are thrilled that Michael has decided to come 
back to Detroit. His leadership, toughness and intangibles are key 
ingredients that can certainly help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 30, said the time was right for him to return to Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I value the coaching staff and playing here next to a  
superstar player like Grant Hill enables us to compete with the 
best teams in the NBA,'' Curry said. ``If you can add the right 
role players around a guy like Grant, you can win a lot of games 
and contend for a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill lobbied for Curry's return immediately after last season.  
</P>
<P>
	Buechler signed a one-year deal with a player option for a  
second year using the team's $1.1 million exception, said his 
agent, Mark Bartelstein. Buechler was 10th in the league last 
season in 3-point shooting proficiency -- 41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in Detroit for the first time last year, averaging 21  
minutes, 5.4 points and 2.7 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jud was a fit on and off the court for us a year ago and I am  
really excited he has decided to come back,'' Sund said. ``Jud's 
size and athletic ability enable him to play multiple positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler reportedly had other offers -- one from San Antonio, the  
other from the Los Angeles Lakers and their new coach Phil Jackson, 
for whom Buechler played in Chicago for four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler said he is ``ecstatic'' to return to the Pistons.  
</P>
<P>
	``It meant a lot to me and my family,'' he said. ``I had a  
number of options, but ultimately, I came to the decision that 
playing for the Pistons was the best situation for me.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Sets Deadline for Tax Cut Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are laboring under a tight  
self-imposed deadline to sculpt a $792 billion tax cut compromise 
that can clear the House and Senate by week's end and set the stage 
for a fall veto showdown with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., gave fellow Republicans only until Tuesday to 
resolve differences between bills passed by the House and the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	With the hurry-up compromise effort scarcely under way, Lott  
criticized President Clinton for opposing the measure. ``We should 
reduce taxes, with the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald 
Reagan was president,'' Lott said in Saturday's weekly GOP radio 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we should trust the American people to wisely spend, or  
save, their earnings. And of course, we aren't going to imperil 
Medicare, or Social Security, or any other essential federal 
program in the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican aides, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the  
hope of the leadership is that rank-and-file lawmakers will use a 
month-long August break to trumpet the virtues of tax cuts to their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation will not go to the White House until after Labor  
Day, though, to deny Clinton the opportunity for a widely 
publicized veto ceremony when Congress is not in session. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the compressed timetable that Republicans have set for  
themselves, it will fall to Hastert and Lott to prod key lawmakers 
to close the deal. The major decision will be to reconcile the 
bills' provisions for broad-based tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill provides for a 10-percent across-the-board cut,  
phased in gradually. The Senate bill cuts the current 15 percent 
tax bracket to 14 percent in 2001. Beginning in 2006, it gradually 
shifts some income currently taxed at 28 percent into the lower 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
	Most conservatives favor the across-the-board approach, and Lott  
was supportive when other Republicans sought unsuccessfully to 
insert it into the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of support for that,'' he told reporters Friday.  
``That is the fairest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the across-the-board approach made it through the House only  
after Hastert and the leadership agreed to condition the tax-rate 
decline on annual reductions in interest due on the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	There are numerous other differences between the two bills,  
including, for example, competing proposals for reducing capital 
gains taxes and varying lists of provisions inserted at the behest 
of individual lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	With narrow voting margins in both the House and Senate,  
Republican leaders will have little margin for error as they 
produce a compromise. But the price of failure will be high. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Republicans, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  
the GOP hopes to build public support for the measure during the 
planned August break to fortify the party for the veto struggle 
that lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats opposed the Senate bill, as was the case in the  
House, and Clinton sharply attacked the measure shortly after the 
Senate approved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican tax cut is so large it would undo our fiscal  
discipline and imperil our prosperity,'' he said in a written 
statement. ``It would crowd out our commitments to pay down the 
debt, to save Social Security and to strengthen and modernize 
Medicare with a long-overdue prescription drug benefit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said it would ``demand drastic cuts in defense,  
education, law enforcement, agriculture and the environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lott disputed the claims in his radio address, as did  
Republicans in three days of debate on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Those competing positions are expected to produce a veto  
confrontation that lasts into the fall, possibly expanding to 
include spending measures that are making their way slowly through 
Congress.

<HEADLINE> Computers Translate as People Speak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Sloppy speakers rejoice.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists in an international consortium are developing  
computer technology that translates conversations into six 
languages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the new machines don't merely translate, they also clean up  
grammar and omit those awkward ``ums'' and ``urs'' that bog down 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can even recognize noises like lip smacks,'' said Alex  
Waibel, director of the Interactive Systems Laboratories at the 
Carnegie Mellon University School ofComputer Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech translation technology was demonstrated recently  
during a video conference with people in Japan, Italy, Korea and 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``What time is it in Japan?'' CMU graduate student Chad Langley  
asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds, Langley's sentence was translated into Japanese  
and heard by a scientist posing as a travel agent in Kyoto. The 
agent responded in Japanese and the computer translated his 
response to English: ``It's 1 a.m. in Japan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Langley -- who doesn't speak a word of Japanese -- went on to  
inquire about weather conditions, book a flight and reserve a 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	The international Consortium for Speech Translation Advanced  
Research -- C-STAR -- has a system with more than 10,000 words that 
can allow spontaneous speech through a Web-based system. 
</P>
<P>
	If a mistake in translation is made, it can be easily corrected  
before it is transmitted, because a screen shows the translation as 
it is made but before it is heard at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the user can even choose the degree of speech  
formality, and scientists surprised their Japanese counterpart by 
using the local Kyoto dialect. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sort of like a Japanese imitating a southern drawl,''  
Waibel said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the program is limited to information related to travel  
such as flight schedules and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to go from a narrow domain to a broad domain to no  
restrictions whatsoever,'' said Jaime Carbonell, who directs the 
Language Technologies Institute at CMU. 
</P>
<P>
	Even better, scientists hope to improve voice synthesis, so the  
computer will translate not only words but also the expression and 
inflection that comes with them -- ``so it's not just the content, 
but also the emotion,'' Carbonell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The translating device consists of a headset, a backpack with a  
laptop computer and a forearm computer the size of a paperback 
book. Waibel said the consortium's next goal is to develop smaller 
versions of the translators to mass produce and sell commercially. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these things that we are showing you will be coming to  
a credit card near you soon'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Man Convicted of 4 Murders Escapes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A man serving a life sentence for killing four  
teen-agers opened the window in his cell, sneaked across a grassy 
yard and wriggled through a fence to escape from a maximum-security 
prison Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police started searching for Norman Johnston on Monday morning  
after workers at the state prison in Huntingdon noticed the fence 
was loose and guards discovered sections of his cell's window had 
been taken apart, said prison spokeswoman Diana G. Baney. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston, 48, was convicted in 1980 of committing the killings  
to cover up a multimillion-dollar burglary ring he ran with his two 
brothers. The film ``At Close Range,'' starring Sean Penn, was 
based on the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The prison, which holds more than 1,800 inmates, is next to a  
residential neighborhood in Huntingdon, about 100 miles east of 
Pittsburgh. A car was stolen Monday morning from a house across 
from the prison, but police didn't find any fingerprints at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't clear when Johnston escaped, although guards last saw  
him at 1 a.m., Ms. Baney said. Officials wouldn't give details on 
the window's construction or how it was dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnston's brothers, Bruce and David, were also convicted of  
killing the teen-agers and were also sentenced to life. Joe 
Carroll, a prosecutor who worked on the case, said the victims 
belonged to a group that gave the brothers stolen car parts to 
resell. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Johnston was also convicted of killing two potential  
witnesses.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks Reward Gonzalez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez was rewarded for his career season  
with the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday by signing a three-year, 
$12.5 million contract extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes a fourth year at $4 million at the club's  
option. The contract includes a $1 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, this is like a dream come true to be somewhere where  
I'm really happy,'' Gonzalez said before the Diamondbacks opened an 
important three-game series with the San Francisco Giants on Monday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old left-fielder, obtained in a trade from Detroit  
in the off-season for Karim Garcia, earned $2 million this season, 
$500,000 of which was paid by the Tigers as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	He got off to a hot start and has stayed hot all season.  
Gonzalez, a career .268 hitter before this season, is hitting .346, 
third-best in the NL behind Larry Walker (.367) and Sean Casey 
(.354). 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez leads the league in hits with 140. He has 17 home runs,  
38 doubles and 71 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez had a 30-game hitting streak, the longest in the majors  
this season, and was named to the All-Star Game for the first time 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez, who has played for four big-league teams in his nine  
major league seasons, said he had no desire to test the free agent 
market after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt like too good of a fit to even test the waters  
out there. Regardless of whether I could have made more money or 
less money or whatever, I'm happy here. My wife's happy here,'' 
Gonzalez said. ``Everything's first class here. I didn't want to go 
anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo, the Diamondacks' managing general partner, is  
known for his generosity to players both with the baseball team and 
his Phoenix Suns of the NBA. He said that Gonzalez's outgoing 
personality added to his value. Bilingual because his parents were 
born in Cuba, his friendly attitude in two languages has meant a 
lot to the chemistry of the Diamondbacks, who are in first place in 
the NL West in just their second season. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that he's taken advantage of this opportunity is an  
understatement,'' Colangelo said. ``He's had an unbelievable year 
for us, and making the all-star team was a tremendous 
accomplishment. But I'll tell you, above and beyond all of his 
fetes on the field, what he is as an individual means more than 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzalez said the new contract is good news to the triplets who  
were born in June of last year and whose pictures adorn his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	``The triples, they don't know it yet, but they're pretty  
happy,'' he said. ``When their mom and dad are happy, I'm sure 
they're happy, too.''

<HEADLINE> State Food Stamp Rules Found Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some state and local governments have unfairly  
discouraged poor families from applying for food stamps, which 
contributed to a steep drop in the number of people getting the 
help, congressional investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday by the General Accounting Office also  
faulted the Agriculture Department for failing to monitor the 
food-stamp program adequately and being too slow to write new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has to be a major educational campaign, and the states  
have to actively inform people of available programs,'' said Rep. 
Sander Levin, D-Mich., who requested the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Food stamp participation has dropped by 27 percent over the past  
3 1/2 years to 18.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drop is due largely to the strong economy and changes  
in eligibility requirements, demand has grown for food aid from 
other programs and nonprofit organizations. The report said that 
indicates families who need food stamps aren't getting them. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of children who get federally subsidized free lunches  
increased 6 percent from 1994 through 1997, while the number of 
children on food stamps dropped by 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge barred New York City this year from requiring a  
person to look for a job before applying for food stamps. Michigan 
was denying food stamps illegally to whole households when only one 
family member violated welfare regulations, said the GAO, Congress' 
investigative and auditing arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states and local governments have not publicized  
differences in eligibility requirements for welfare and food 
stamps, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA, meanwhile, has not written regulations to implement  
changes in the food-stamp program that Congress enacted three years 
ago and has yet to review application procedures in 10 states, the 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA officials say they will finish the regulations by the end  
of the year and are working on the state reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a great deal of confusion among working families,  
simply because they have gone to work and they don't know what 
their eligibility status is anymore,'' said Shirley Watkins, USDA's 
undersecretary for food, nutrition and consumer services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, President Clinton announced the administration would  
streamline reporting rules for food stamp recipients and launch an 
educational campaign aimed at getting the working poor to sign up. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, two of five working families eligible for food  
stamps actually apply for the assistance, according to USDA.

<HEADLINE> 'Runaway Bride' Tops 'Blair Witch' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Julia Roberts and Richard Gere came down the  
aisle strongly in their romantic reunion as ``Runaway Bride'' 
opened in first place at the weekend box office. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Blair Witch Project'' also cast a spell on audiences as it  
hit wide release after two weeks of packed houses in only a handful 
of theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' took in $34.5 million followed by ``Blair  
Witch'' with $28.5 million, according to industry estimates Sunday. 
Final figures were to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Renny Harlin's high-tech shark fest ``Deep Blue Sea''  
debuted in third place with $18.6 million, while the gothic ghost 
story ``The Haunting'' slipped from first to fourth, taking in 
$15.1 million in its second weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The horror genre in itself is on fire,'' said Robert  
Bucksbaum, a movie analyst with Reel Source Inc. ``That's 
definitely what moviegoers want to see these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the top dozen movies grossed $136.8 million, up a third  
from the same weekend a year ago, according to Exhibitor Relations 
Co. Inc., which tracks box office figures. 
</P>
<P>
	A mock documentary told through footage supposedly left behind  
by three vanished witch hunters, ``Blair Witch'' averaged $25,886 a 
screen in 1,101 theaters. By comparison ``Runaway Bride,'' playing 
in nearly three times as many theaters, averaged $10,925 a screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their numbers were phenomenal,'' said Wayne Lewellen,  
president of Paramount, which released ``Runaway Bride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' has a shot at taking the No. 1 spot at the box  
office next weekend when it expands to about 2,000 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lewellen expects ``Bride'' to hold up well because it  
plays to a different audience. The comedy, which reunites Roberts 
and Gere for the first time since 1990's ``Pretty Woman,'' is 
drawing mostly women 25 and older while ``Blair Witch's'' audience 
largely consists of young males. 
</P>
<P>
	``Runaway Bride'' was Roberts' top opening ever, easily beating  
her most recent two releases ``Notting Hill'' ($27.7 million) and 
``Stepmom'' ($19.1 million). ``Pretty Woman'' opened in first place 
with $11.3 million and went on to gross $178.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch,'' shot for $60,000, was bought for $1 million by  
Artisan Entertainment, which pumped an additional $300,000 into the 
movie to prepare it for release, Artisan President Amir Malin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Artisan expects the movie to take in more than $100 million, but  
when it was purchased, ``I don't think a discussion of a 
$100-million box office ever rolled out of anybody's mouth,'' Malin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a testament to the film and the marketing that you don't  
need to make films for $100 million to generate a huge gross,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafty marketing of the film as a pseudo-documentary has had  
audiences debating whether the movie was fact or fiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blair Witch'' has earned $35.4 million in its first three  
weeks. The previous top hit for Artisan was Wes Craven's 
``Wishmaster,'' which took in $18.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Runaway Bride,'' $34.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``The Blair Witch Project,'' $28.5 million.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Davis Stands Tall in New Orleans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA CROSSE, Wis. (AP) -- Troy Davis isn't surprised to see Ricky  
Williams slip into the spot he covets in the New Orleans Saints 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis and Williams both had record-setting college careers, but  
while Williams attracted believers, Davis, because he is smaller 
than most backs, drew doubters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never got credit for what I did in college,'' Davis said  
without bitterness. ``People found all kinds of reasons to not take 
what I did seriously. Now they still don't think I can make it in 
the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams set 20 records, including the career rushing mark held  
by Tony Dorsett for 22 years, and won the Heisman Trophy and Doak 
Walker awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis has found recognition hard to come by, although he has had  
some pretty impressive statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	As a 5-foot-8, 180 pound back for Iowa State, Davis rushed for  
4,382 yards, had 5,177 all-purpose yards, and in 20 games gained 
100 yards or more. All in just three years. 
</P>
<P>
	His yardage figure at Iowa State his last season was 2,185, the  
third highest in NCAA history, and his 402 carries were just one 
less than Marcus Allen's NCAA record. Davis is the only player in 
NCAA history to have rushed for more than 2,000 yards twice in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, he finished second in the voting for the Heisman and  
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'd stayed in college another year, I think Ricky would  
have been chasing some of my records,'' Davis said. ``That would 
have been interesting, because he's a really good running back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 5-10 and 236 pounds, is certainly a more standard size  
for an NFL back. Even after three years in the league and countless 
hours in the weight room, Davis only weighs 192 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky and Troy are a lot alike,'' Saints offensive coordinator  
Danny Abramowicz said. ``They're both hard workers, quiet guys who 
do everything you ask. I'd take both of them for sons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say the advantage Ricky has is his size. That's the big  
difference in them. But Troy is strong as heck. You know that when 
he played ever game and almost every down for two years in 
college.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So once again Davis is trying to prove himself.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the Saints only draft pick this year, is the starter.  
Davis, a third-round pick in 1997, is penciled in as No. 3 behind 
Lamar Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Troy is a good runner inside,'' Abramowicz said. ``He's got  
great quickness, great vision. And he's got really good hands, so 
he can catch the ball. But he's probably not an every down player 
in the NFL. He's probably going to have to come up big on special 
teams to really help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or even stay on the team since the Saints have eight other backs  
on the roster and will want some of them to fit the fullback mold 
to help open holes for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Mike Ditka, a consistent fan of Davis, admits he's  
not sure what Davis' role will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, but I just know he's one solid football  
player,'' Ditka said. ``You look at the guys that make the least 
mistakes and he makes the least mistakes. He's steady out there. 
Maybe this year a lot of things will happen out there for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis certainly believes they will.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad Ricky is here. Now we'll just see what happens,''  
Davis said. ``If I do my job every time I get the opportunity, who 
knows how the year will turn out. Hey, look at Doug Flutie last 
year.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Jackin Announces Retirement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VIRGINIA WATER, England (AP) -- Tony Jacklin, the former U.S.  
Open and British Open champion and Europe's most successful Ryder 
Cup captain, has announced his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Englishman, who has always struggled to control  
the stress of tournament golf, finished with a 1-under par 71 on 
Sunday for a fourth place tie at 7-under 209 in the Energis 
European Senior Masters at the Wentworth Club's Edinburgh course. 
</P>
<P>
	His final shot was a two-inch tap-in for a bogey.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad it's all over,'' Jacklin said. ``I think the word is  
relief. I have no regrets about giving up tournament golf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have to sweat over any more short putts and will not  
miss a thing, especially the tension of tournament golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacklin, who won the British Open in 1969 and the U.S. Open a  
year later, played seven times on the European Ryder Cup team 
(1967, '69, '71, '73, '75, '77 and '79). 
</P>
<P>
	But his fame came as the four-time non-playing Ryder Cup captain  
(1983, '85, '87 and '89) when he showed the Europeans they could 
beat the favored Americans. In that stretch, Europe won twice, drew 
once and lost once. 
</P>
<P>
	``He inspired all of us,'' said Neil Coles, who won Sunday's  
tournament. ``He was the first to take on the Americans in America 
and he showed the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacklin won twice on the U.S. Seniors Tour, although he never  
won as a senior in Europe. He said his putter eventually caused him 
to retire. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is in the putting,'' he said. ``The message from  
the brain doesn't get past the elbows, you lose your sense of 
distance and feel goes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't win at this game if you can't hole putts, and I find  
I'm nervous all the time on the greens.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Williams Back After 2 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Brian Williams doesn't talk about his right  
eye unless asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of the past and the veteran New York Giants' center  
would like to keep it there. He would rather focus on the present, 
the 1999 season, his first since a freak training camp injury to 
the eye almost ended his career two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 33, still has trouble seeing when he glances down.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the only outward sign of the injury is the tinted visor  
on the front of Williams' facemask that protects his eyes, both 
from fingers and the glare that bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle,'' said guard Ron Stone, Williams' roommate.  
``He was pretty much done, but he wasn't ready to leave the game. 
He fought hard and he came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams missed the start of last season, few gave him a  
chance of returning. The double vision that resulted from being 
poked in the eye by teammate Bernard Holsey in the opening days of 
training camp in 1997 just wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Giants' 1989 first-round draft pick wasn't willing  
to give up. He underwent a second surgery in October and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, there was just nothing in my future that I saw that  
was very bright,'' Williams said. ``Being a football player was not 
even in my mind. I'm here (now) and it's time to get beat up again 
and get sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants really want Williams to succeed. Before he was hurt,  
he was viewed by the coaching staff as one of the NFL's top centers 
and the glue of the offensive line. Not only did he make all the 
line calls, he was the veteran influence who made five players work 
as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Fassel was reminded of that on the opening day of camp  
Friday. The offensive coaches told him that Williams reminded the 
line ``no offsides'' on the first day of workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't any.  
</P>
<P>
	When free-agent center Emmett Zitelli seemed confused walking to  
a drill, there was Williams ready to explain things to him. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the centers of attention in the camp, Williams is doing  
his best to downplay his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I am thinking about is just improving,''  
Williams said. ``I'm here and I'm glad and I guess I forget about 
everything that happened in the past. I just want to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams isn't taking anything for granted. Even though he has  
been penciled in as the starting center, he feels he has to prove 
himself again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Scott, who started the last two years, has been moved to  
left guard to take over the spot that opened when Greg Bishop 
signed with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring another injury somewhere, I think he is the guy,'' new  
line coach Jim McNally said. ``I don't think he is going to 
disappoint us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a few new techniques McNally installed for linemen, the  
most difficult thing for Williams to deal with has been the face 
shield. It keeps in the heat, fogs up and it makes it hard to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also never coming off, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the preseason will show a lot to me,'' Williams said.  
``You can only do so much in preseason. You have to play games and 
go against different people to see how your skills come back.''

<HEADLINE> Gwynn Enjoys Chase to 3,000 Hits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- As Mark McGwire and Tony Gwynn close in on  
milestones, it's easy to see which player appears to be enjoying 
the chase more. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn, who entered Monday night's game against McGwire's St.  
Louis Cardinals six hits shy of 3,000, affably dealt with wave 
after wave of media in the hours before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pursuit has been fun,'' Gwynn said. ``The end of the  
pursuit has been a little bit more than even I thought it would be, 
but still, it's been fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said McGwire told him that holding mass news conferences  
during his 70-homer season allowed him to stay focused on the Roger 
Maris chase and the Sammy Sosa duel. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not Gwynn's way. The eight-time batting champion doesn't  
mind answering the same questions over and over to every individual 
reporter, always with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather sit down and talk to guys individually or in  
smaller groups because, to me, you get more out of it and both guys 
get more out of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn has another reason for instant availability: He tried it  
McGwire's way and it was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire told me in San Diego he thought it saved him last year  
because he only had to discuss it one time,'' Gwynn said. ``So I 
took that advice to heart and went to Los Angeles and decided, I'll 
call a 3:30 press conference, and like, two guys showed up. If I 
get to first base, I'll have to let him know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was McGwire's locker neighbor at the All-Star Game at  
Boston, and he can sympathize if McGwire isn't Mr. Sunshine after 
seeing the demands placed upon him just from within. 
</P>
<P>
	``You talk about major league baseball leaning on somebody,''  
Gwynn said. ``The demands they make on guys like him and Griffey 
and Bonds, the icons of the game, the guys that carry the major 
league logo, is amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who entered the game three homers shy of 500 and with  
13 homers in 17 games, has steadfastly avoided the topic. After he 
hit No. 497 and drove in four runs in a 5-4 loss to Colorado on 
Sunday, he was particularly surly. 
</P>
<P>
	``You guys always ask me about numbers and I keep saying winning  
is what I care about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn said St. Louis is the next-best place to reach 3,000 if he  
can't do it at home. He's flown in a rather large entourage of 
family members, and they'll all head to Montreal if it doesn't 
happen in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn had been 9-for-43 before getting three hits and homering  
Sunday against Houston. He entered the night tied with Wade Boggs 
of Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, I can get six hits and have it all work out,''  
Gwynn said. ``But the way I've been going, we may have to pack up 
and move on to the next stop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gwynn was hoping he, McGwire and Boggs wouldn't steal each  
other's thunder by reaching their milestone on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it wouldn't surprise me at all if we all did it within 15  
minutes of each other.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Lament Lack of Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A refugee family from Kosovo whose baby Amerikan  
was the first to be born among the many families that came here 
from their war-torn land says they have been left to fend for 
themselves despite promises of help. 
</P>
<P>
	Naim and Lebibe Karaliju live in a furnished Dallas apartment  
with a television, VCR and a refrigerator full of Coca-Cola. But 
they claim Refugee Services of North Texas also promised them $200 
per person in addition to helping them find work and paying for two 
months' rent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying we've been treated badly,'' Karaliju said  
through a translator. ``But the refugee service has not kept its 
promises. They did not fulfill the commitments they made to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency rented the 24 Karaliju family members a two-bedroom  
apartment and two three-bedroom apartments for two months, but the 
Karalijus say they have received no money. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, 11 Karaliju women are working as housekeepers at a  
local hotel, but none of the four men is employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Karaliju, who named his son Amerikan following the Albanian  
spelling, said he is worried he won't be able to support his famous 
baby much longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be hard, because even if I work, I would be making  
less than $200 a month,'' Karliju said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chip Corcoran, the executive director of Refugee Services of  
North Texas, paints a much different picture of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran said his agency has surpassed all federal requirements  
in the Karaliju case and has worked with local groups to ensure 
that the family has housing, employment and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Department allocates $740 per refugee to 10 national  
organizations, which process and organize cases before passing 
along $580 per refugee to local affiliates. Those affiliates, which 
use that federal money to operate, are then required to use at 
least $200 on ``direct expenses'' for each refugee. 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran said his agency has already spent more than that amount  
on the Karalijus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I simply don't understand where the claims are coming from,''  
Corcoran said. ``Some of our people visited them last week, and 
their only complaint was that they did not have enough money for 
cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baby Amerikan grabbed national attention when he was born at  
Fort Dix, N.J., on May 6. His picture was splashed across the front 
of newspapers across the country, and President Clinton was among 
those who wished him well.

<HEADLINE> Jury Seated in Tony Martin Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins receiver Tony Martin knew money he  
received from a hometown friend ``was dirty,'' a prosecutor said 
Monday at the start of Martin's money laundering trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is charged with helping co-defendant Ricky Brownlee spend  
drug profits on three car leases and trying to pay $175,000 in 
Brownlee's attorney fees with money from the convicted drug dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	``They knew exactly what they were doing,'' Assistant U.S.  
Attorney Ron DeWaard said. ``Tony Martin knew the money was 
dirty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys say Martin didn't know the money was from drug  
sales. They say Martin never profited from the transactions and was 
motivated by friendship rather than criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Hy Shapiro brought Martin in front of the jury  
box to introduce him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Regardless of what the government says, he'd never risk a  
stellar career by doing the things the government says he had,'' 
Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, was charged eight days after playing in the Super  
Bowl for the Atlanta Falcons. The Falcons later released him, and 
he signed a four-year, $14.2 million contract with Miami, his 
hometown team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dolphins acquired Martin because they believe he provides  
the deep threat quarterback Dan Marino has long lacked. Plus, Miami 
took little risk in signing him -- all but $100,000 of his contract 
is contingent on him being available to play and not in a federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin reported to training camp Friday with other veterans.  
During the trial, he plans to work out on his own in the evening, 
and he'll practice with the team on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jimmy Johnson and about a dozen players came to the  
federal courthouse just before opening statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was joined by wide receivers O.J. McDuffie, Lamar Thomas  
and Yatil Green, as well as defensive back Terrell Buckley and 
defensive end Jason Taylor. None would comment on the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just here to support Tony,'' team spokesman Harvey  
Greene said. ``It was an individual decision by the players to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, eight women and four men were selected from a  
pool of 93 potential jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys anticipate a three-week trial, meaning a verdict could  
be reached three weeks before the Dolphins' opening game, Sept. 13 
at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's attorneys had sought separate trials for the two, but  
U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore denied the motion Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's charges stem from his longtime friendship with  
Brownlee, who served seven years in prison for drug convictions 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Martin was driven by greed when he helped  
Brownlee hide drug money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tony Martin was part of the need ... the need to conceal,''  
DeWaard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The drug business creates substantial wealth and ... greed is  
going to show the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two witnesses testified Monday against Brownlee -- his parole  
officer and a Drug Enforcement Administration agent who arrested 
him in 1982 on a drug charge.

<HEADLINE> McGwire Ties Sosa With 41 Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire tied Sammy Sosa for the major  
league lead with his 41st home run -- and 498th of his career -- in 
the fifth inning of Monday night's game against the San Diego 
Padres. 
</P>
<P>
	With runners on first and third, McGwire hit his 14th homer in  
18 games on the first pitch from Woody Williams to give St. Louis a 
4-0 lead. The towering drive landed in the first few rows beyond 
the left-field wall and was measured at 368 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who has seven RBIs in the last two games, struck out in  
the first and fouled out to the catcher in the third. He's 2-for-6 
for his career against Williams, with two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the night, Sosa briefly took the home run lead by  
himself when he hit his 41st in a game against the Montreal Expos.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PINE CITY, Minn. (AP) -- All Clayton Goward wanted was someone  
who could inherit his $375,000 estate. 
</P>
<P>
	But since the 79-year-old retiree placed an ad in the Star  
Tribune last month asking for advice on how to find a suitable 
heir, he's been besieged with 22,000 letters, postcards and 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
	He got so many phone calls -- some from as far away as Europe --  
that he had to change his number to an unpublished one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sought only ideas and a solution for making my will, nothing  
more,'' Goward said. ``What followed is not what I wanted. 
Worldwide coverage resulted, and I am now swamped. About anything 
that you can think of has been written.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some responses are religious. Others suggest that Goward donate  
his estate to charity -- which he says is what he might end up 
doing. One college student from Idaho told Goward he should start a 
scholarship fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd even be willing to apply'' for such a scholarship, the  
student volunteered. ``Believe me, I could use some help!!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goward got divorced long ago, and his relationship with his  
three sons is strained. 
</P>
<P>
	He said most of the responses have come from women. He's heard  
romantic proposals and plenty of stories of hardship. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people want personal help, and I don't have the  
millions of dollars to help them,'' he said. ``You feel sorry about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goward has a new request -- he says he needs volunteers to help  
sort the mail and trinkets that have arrived at his door.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Pitcher May Be Defecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The reservations for Sydney can be  
made. The United States will be sending a baseball team to the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	So will Cuba, but, according to sports agent Joe Cubas, it will  
be without pitcher Danys Baez. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas, who has been involved in the defections of many Cuban  
ballplayers, said in a press release today that Baez left the team 
Sunday night after it beat Canada 3-2 in the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's defection would bring to eight the number of Cubans to  
leave that nation's delegation to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	What a trip it has already been for a hastily formed team of  
minor leaguers not on major league 40-man rosters. On Sunday, they 
qualified their country for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	International baseball, as they have found, has a different  
flavor. And when the game is played in a single-elimination format, 
the pressure is intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an experience!'' U.S. manager Buddy Bell said, near tears  
after a 2-1, 10-inning win over Mexico on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Americans have one more goal before leaving the games,  
and that one is gold. They can get that by beating world champion 
Cuba tonight for the second time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	But, realistically, their major mission, winning an Olympic  
berth -- even though many of the same players may not be on the team 
that goes to Australia -- has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	The hero of the victory over Mexico was 29-year-old Mike Neill,  
who has spent most of his career in the minors, save six games with 
Oakland last year. The Pan Am Games mark the first time the United 
States has used professional players -- all minor leaguers -- in an 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I had a major arm injury and made it to the big  
leagues. That was a long road back and finally getting there was an 
individual thing,'' said Neill, who drove in the go-ahead run with 
a pinch-hit single. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far better as a team member, representing your  
country and trying to get USA baseball into the Olympics. I think 
we were a little tight. But it's awesome playing for your country 
and then getting the big hit to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in top of the 10th, Marcus Jensen, America's top  
hitter in the tournament, doubled off the first-base bag. After a 
strikeout, Neill hit a 3-2 pitch for a run-scoring single off 
former major league pitcher Vicente Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wheeler, who pitched well in a 10-5 win over Cuba in the  
preliminary round, got the victory. The right-hander from Triple-A 
Durham pitched a perfect four innings in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow,'' he said after the Americans swarmed the mound in  
celebration when Wheeler got the final out. ``This is one of the 
things that we needed to do. But I want a gold medal and now we 
have that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba edged host, using a three-run homer from star Omar Linares  
and strong relief pitching by Jose Ibar, who lost his edge in the 
ninth after a protester ran on the field with a sign ``Human Right 
First.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cuban players, including two carrying their country's  
flag, chased the protester before he was finally knocked down by 
second baseman Juan Padilla and taken away by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday night, police said four members of the Cuban  
delegation were involved in a fight with the protester. The fight 
occurred at 10:30 p.m. in the center of the city outside the 
offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, acting duty 
inspector Paul Ingram of the Winnipeg City Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A shaken Ibar then gave up a single, threw a wild pitch and  
walked a batter before reliever Luis Lazo struck out the final two 
hitters, setting off an on-field celebration. Canada had routed 
Cuba 8-1 in the preliminries, but all a 5-1 record gets the 
Canadians is a shot at the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian roller hockey goalie Steve Vezina failed a doping test  
and his team was stripped of its gold medal. Vezina, who plays ice 
hockey for the Utah Grizzlies of the IHL and also is a professional 
roller hockey player, tested positive for two stimulants and ``an 
enormously high level'' of an anabolic steroid. It was the first 
doping incident at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which lost 7-6 to Canada in the gold medal  
game, was awarded the championship, with Argentina moving up to 
second and Brazil to third. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was foolish and he made a mistake,'' Pan American Sports  
Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' teammate Jeff Leiter said. ``What he did  
hurts all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug test showed three banned substances: ephedrine,  
pseudo-ephedrine and Nandrolone. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are 
stimulants used to avoid fatigue. Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid 
that increases muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said at his drug test that he had taken Sudafed prior to  
competition. Many hockey players use Sudafed as an energy boost, 
and it is not banned in professional ice hockey leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a big shock ... Steve is not an abuser of anabolic  
steroids,'' said his coach with the Buffalo Wings of Roller Hockey 
International, which does not have a substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have a chance to gather all of the facts and speak to  
everyone involved, Steve Vezina is scheduled to be in goal Friday 
against Dallas,'' Wings vice president of operations Benny Gulakiw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Juana  
Rosario, the winner of the women's high jump, tested positive for 
illegal substances. The CBC said her A sample came out postive and 
now her B-sample must be tested. If it comes back positive as well, 
she would be stripped of her medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Three more Cuban athletes defected this weekend before Baez's  
reported departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials confirmed  
that an athlete had sought asylum and was turned over to 
immigration authorities. Sources close to the Cuban team, on the 
condition they not be identified, said the athlete was from Cuba's 
4 x 100 track relay squad, but would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were a soccer goalkeeper -- the goalies were Rene  
Castro, who played every minute in the games, and Rodney Valdes -- 
and a female artistic gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. basketball teams won Sunday, but the women then fell  
77-72 to Brazil this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after their worst loss ever at the Pan Ams, the U.S. women  
awoke early Sunday and beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to clinch 
a berth in the medals round. The women had lost to Cuba 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men edged Brazil 73-71. Travis Williams made a  
layup with 22 seconds left for the go-ahead basket and Doug Smith 
followed with a key block. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat the Dominican Republic in three sets for  
the women's bronze medal in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. swimming team got off to a rousing start today, led by  
Ed Moses. He set a Pan Ams record of 1:01.06 in the preliminaries 
of the men's 100-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses, a freshman at Virginia, shattered the record of 1:02.28  
by Steve Lundquist in 1983. Moses' time was the second-fastest ever 
by an American. 
</P>
<P>
	All other U.S. swimmers in the prelims also qualified for  
tonight's finals.

<HEADLINE> Sosa Critical of Hernandez Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa met with Chicago general manager Ed  
Lynch on Monday after the outfielder was critical of the Cubs trade 
of Jose Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs offered Hernandez a three-year contract late Saturday  
before the trading deadline but the infielder, who will be a free 
agent following this season, rejected it and was dealt to Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should have taken care of him before,'' Sosa said after  
Sunday's game. ``They shouldn't have waited until the last minute. 
I'm really, really disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez and pitcher Terry Mulholland were traded to the Braves  
for pitcher Micah Bowie, who will start for Chicago on Tuesday, a 
minor league pitcher and a player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch called Sosa into manager Jim Riggleman's office prior to  
batting practice Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Sammy speaks, I listen,'' Lynch said later.  
</P>
<P>
	``(Lynch) explained everything to me,'' Sosa said. ``It's  
something I have to agree with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lynch told Sosa the Cubs had helped themselves for the future by  
acquiring the young players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him I want to be here for life and that I want to  
win,'' Sosa said. ``I don't want to play just for the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, who entered Monday night's game against Montreal tied with  
Mark McGwire for the major league lead with 40 home runs, made a 
promise to Cubs fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee that next year we won't be in last place,'' Sosa  
said.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves Sign Szczerbiak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Timberwolves signed first-round  
draft pick Wally Szczerbiak on Monday to a three-year deal worth 
$6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 forward from Miami of Ohio was the sixth player  
taken in the draft. He was to make his debut with the Timberwolves 
on Monday night against the Phoenix Suns in the Rocky Mountain 
Revue in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement includes a team option for a fourth year at $2.9  
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased to have Wally on board,'' said Flip Saunders,  
Timberwolves general manager and head coach. ``He's a smart player 
and a solid shooter. We feel he can contribute immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak recently played for Team USA, which won the gold  
medal at the Tournament of the Americas to qualify for the 2000 
Olympics. He averaged 3.4 points per game on 50 percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old forward led Miami to the NCAA's round of 16 as a  
senior, scoring a career-high 43 points in a first-round win over 
Washington. He was named a second team All-America by The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., native was a unanimous choice as  
the Mid-American Conference's player of the year this season after 
averaging 24.2 points per game, third in the country. He finished 
as Miami's second all-time leading scorer with 1,847 points, behind 
Ron Harber.

<HEADLINE> Bus Driver in Louisiana Crash Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of a charter bus that crashed on  
Mother's Day, killing 22 people en route to a Gulf Coast casino, 
has died of heart failure, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Bedell, who had a history of heart disease and kidney  
problems, was suffering from cardiopulmonary arrest when he was 
brought to Charity Hospital on Sunday, hospital spokesman Jerry 
Romig said. He died at 9:11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell, 46, had been hospitalized for about a month after the  
May 5 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Police last week sent results of their investigation into the  
crash to prosecutors, but Bedell's death means no criminal charges 
will be filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our case was based on him as a driver and whether he was  
responsible or not,'' said Zully Jimenez, a spokeswoman for Orleans 
Parish District Attorney Harry Connick. ``It couldn't have been 
anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal investigators have said there is no evidence to indicate  
the bus had mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the crash, authorities said they had found evidence  
that Bedell had lost two bus-driving jobs because of marijuana use, 
had failed a test for cocaine and was undergoing kidney dialysis. A 
personnel file contained a doctor's note saying Bedell had 
congestive heart disease, a condition that should have disqualified 
him from a commercial license, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell had refused to be interviewed by investigators.

<HEADLINE> John Huang's Hearing Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A hearing for former Democratic Party  
fund-raiser John Huang was postponed Monday when a Republican 
congressman demanded that Huang testify before Congress prior to 
making a court plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	Huang, the Democrats' chief fund-raiser for the Asian-American  
community in 1996, brought in $1.6 million in questionable 
donations that later were returned. He has been cooperating with 
Justice Department investigators in their campaign finance probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The former executive of Jakarta-based Lippo Group, accused of  
making illegal campaign contributions, was scheduled to appear in 
federal court Monday to resolve his case. 
</P>
<P>
	Government prosecutors had recommended he be fined $10,000 and  
sentenced to 500 hours of community service. He could have been 
sentenced to jail for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on  
Government Reform, wrote to U.S. District Judge Richard Paez asking 
for an indefinite delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Thom Mrozek, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Los  
Angeles, said Paez delayed the hearing until Aug. 12 and ordered 
attorneys in the case to begin submitting legal briefs on whether 
Huang's case should be postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Burton's press secretary, Mark Corallo, said Burton's concerns  
were covered in a July 28 letter he wrote to U.S. Attorney General 
Janet Reno. In that letter, Burton said he would seek postponing of 
sentences for both Huang and Democratic fund-raiser Charlie Trie 
because they had not yet testified before Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the federal government asked that Trie's sentencing  
be postponed at least six weeks so that Trie's cooperation with the 
government can be assessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Trie has pleaded guilty to two counts involving campaign finance  
violations, one a felony and the other a misdemeanor, and pledged 
to cooperate in an investigation of campaign fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have recommended that Trie be given three years'  
probation.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Shrug Off Defections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban baseball fans seemed to care little that  
some of their athletes, even a baseball player, defected during the 
Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowded around televisions in living rooms to watch Cuba beat  
the United States 5-1 Monday night for the gold medal in baseball, 
the only important thing was who stayed -- and played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orestes Kindelan, home run!'' Teresa Menendez shouted at the  
small color television set in her modest living room as the slugger 
hit one of two during the game. ``That's the way to do it. Go, 
Cuba!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menendez and her family shrugged off news that 19-year-old  
pitcher Danys Baez left the team on Sunday; some said they were not 
convinced it was true. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ballplayers never stay behind,'' said Menendez as she sat  
on the linoleum floor of the front room, scrunched between 
relatives and neighbors while a skeletal floor fan built from scrap 
metal and a washing machine motor hummed nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even if it is true, we would have no way of knowing,'' added  
her 34-year-old son, Alejandro Duarte, an unemployed tourism worker 
who watched the win from a carved wooden rocking chair in his 
Adidas swim trunks. ``These things never come out on television or 
in the press here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because all national media is controlled by the communist  
government, Cubans generally learn of such things through calls 
from relatives in the United States, unconfirmed rumors passed 
among co-workers and neighbors, or reports on the U.S. government's 
Radio Marti. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until a few days ago that the Menendez-Duarte family  
heard about the defection of a group of Cuban basketball players in 
Puerto Rico last month. ``Oh, I thought that was in Winnipeg,'' 
commented a young neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Because baseball is Cuba's national sport, and because the  
players are considered especially loyal to President Fidel Castro, 
the defection of Baez was sure to sting more than the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's departure brought to eight the number of Cubans to leave  
that nation's delegation during the games. Runner Michal Ortiz and 
shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes were among the others. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the gold medal win was likely to overshadow the  
defections in a country where baseball is so important that Castro 
postponed by one day a major speech originally scheduled for Monday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Jose Contreras pitched on one day's rest, fanning eight  
straight in the first three innings and allowing four hits in 
eight. He struck out 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The win, and Cuba's complaints that both Canada and the United  
States have been provoking the defections, were sure to come up 
during Castro's major speech Tuesday night in the central province 
of Matanzas. 
</P>
<P>
	During another speech on July 26, Castro complained at length  
how the Cuban delegation has been treated during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never seen so many tricks, so much filth in the Pan  
American Games,'' he said. ``We are competing in enemy territory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Cuban sports officials in Winnipeg have protested  
the ``provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Cuba's 3-2 baseball semifinal victory over Canada, a man  
carrying a sign saying ``Human Right First,'' rushed onto the 
field. He eventually was decked by second baseman Juan Padilla and 
taken off by security. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cuban athletes will not permit anyone or anything to humiliate  
them ... if their dignity is at stake,'' said a statement from the 
Cuban delegation.

<HEADLINE> Construction Spending Rebounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Construction spending rebounded slightly in  
June, rising 0.5 percent, after falling in two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that spending rose to a  
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $699.4 billion, following drops 
of 1.4 percent in both May and in April. 
</P>
<P>
	The increases were fairly widespread with gains reported in  
office buildings, industrial buildings, hotels and motels and big 
government projects. However, spending on all residential 
construction fell 0.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in overall construction spending was in line with  
many analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in a separate report today, a survey of purchasing managers  
said the U.S. manufacturing sector grew in July for the sixth 
consecutive month, but not as strongly as most analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Purchasing Management said its  
monthly index of manufacturing activity registered 53.4 percent in 
July, compared with 57 percent in June. Figures above 50 percent 
indicate growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers group, which represents executives who  
buy raw materials and supplies for industry, also reported a 
slightly stronger rise in July raw-material prices than in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets, which had lost some ground last week over  
worries that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again, 
possibly as early as this month, rebounded today. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets were reacting positively to the purchasing managers'  
report, which suggested the economy has not expanded quite as fast 
as market watchers had feared, analysts said. The Dow Jones 
industrial average was up 125 points at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report put a damper on any plan by the Fed to immediately  
raise interest rates,'' said Wells Fargo economist Sung Won Sohn, 
adding that the report is closely watched by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan. But a report on the nation's employment, 
out this week, is likely to figure prominently into the Fed's 
decision making, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The purchasing managers' report shows that the manufacturing  
sector, hard hit by a global financial crisis, ``is taking a little 
bit longer to get up to speed and indicates that Asia and Latin 
America are not back to their full health,'' Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Home building and other construction activity, driven by low  
mortgage rates, were a key contributing factor to the strong 
economic growth in the early part of the year. But the pace of 
construction spending has cooled. Construction of new homes and 
apartments, for instance, plunged in June to the lowest level in 
just over a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders and analysts largely blame this on shortages of skilled  
workers and some building materials, such as gypsum wallboard, 
insulation and, in some markets, bricks, which can delay 
construction schedules. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales of existing homes hit a record high in June and  
new-home sales also went up as buyers scrambled to lock in the best 
deals to beat slowly advancing mortgage rates. The average interest 
rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage last week was 7.70 percent, 
up from 7.52 percent the week before. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve nudged up interest rates June 30 in a  
pre-emptive strike against inflation. However, Greenspan has said 
the central bank is prepared to act again at the first glimpse of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The construction report showed that spending on all private  
construction projects rose 0.6 percent in June, after having 
reported declines in May and April, and was the main factor in the 
overall gain in June's construction spending. Private construction 
spending totaled $550 billion, on a seasonally adjusted annualized 
basis, in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending on government construction projects also rebounded in  
June, rising 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
$149.4 billion, after having fallen three straight months in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains were reported on spending on schools and other educational  
buildings, conservation and development projects and water supply 
facilities. But spending on highways and streets and public housing 
projects was down. 
</P>
<P>
	However, spending on all residential projects fell 0.3 percent  
in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $322 billion. 
Spending on single-family homes reported a decline, but spending on 
apartments rose just a little.

<HEADLINE> CBS Earnings Rise Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS Corp. credited strong growth in its  
television and radio businesses for a large jump in second-quarter 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS reported Monday it earned $95 million, or 13 cents a share,  
compared with $4 million, or 1 cent a share, in the same period a 
year ago. The earnings matched Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The results included a one-time gain of $18 million or 2 cents a  
share on the sale of businesses associated with Westinghouse 
Electric Corp. to Bechtel National Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues grew 13 percent to $1.68 billion from $1.48 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors were impressed by the results. CBS stock rose 93 3/4  
cents or 2.13 percent to $44.87 1/2 in trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS president Mel Karmazin singled out a strong showing at the  
company's TV network business as an engine behind the profit surge. 
CBS was the top-rated network last season, taking the No. 1 spot 
for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The gains made in our television segment were dramatic,''  
Karmazin said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, CBS earned $482 million,  
or 68 cents per share, compared to $23 million, or 3 cents per 
share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose to $3.45 billion from $3.43 billion.

<HEADLINE> Cards, Boston Agree on Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX, Ariz. (AP) -- Wide receiver David Boston, Arizona's top  
pick in the draft, reached a contract agreement with the team late 
Monday, the team announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston will get $7 million over four years, including a $3.8  
million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, who figures to team with Rob Moore and Frank Sanders to  
give quarterback Jake Plummer one of the top receiving trios in the 
league, has missed the first four days of training camp as 
negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals wanted a five-year deal, Boston wanted four years  
with incentive clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization compromised on years. We compromised on the  
`bells and whistles,' Boston's sister, Alicia, said late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the contract papers would be prepared on Tuesday and  
likely signed later in the day. Boston was to appear at a news 
conference at the team's training camp in Flagstaff on Wednesday, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston, who broke 11 school records in three seasons at Ohio  
State, was to enter training camp immediately, assuming he passes 
his physical on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team expects him to be fully recovered from a fractured left  
shoulder, an injury that occurred when he caught a long pass from 
Plummer against Corey Chaveous and tumbled hard to the ground 
during a Cardinals' minicamp on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-2, 208-pound Boston was the eighth pick overall in  
the draft. He averaged 120.9 yards per game in receptions last 
season, fifth best in NCAA Division I. He set an Ohio State single 
season record with 85 catches for 1,435 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals see him as a much-needed big-play receiver as well  
as a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals have yet to sign their other first-round pick,  
offensive tackle L.J. Shelton from Eastern Michigan. Shelton was 
the 21st pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	The pick used to select Boston came to Arizona from San Diego as  
part of the trade that allowed the Chargers to draft Ryan Leaf with 
the No. 2 pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also must reach a contract agreement with Moore,  
who wants a multi-year pact after being declared the team's 
franchise player. Another holdout, defensive tackle Mark Smith, is 
far apart from the Cardinals in his demand for $1.2 million to $1.3 
million.

<HEADLINE> NBA Reopens Quietly on First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The only shocker on the first day of NBA free agent signings was  
the New Jersey Nets giving Jamie Feick a six-year, $15 million 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The only trade finalized was one that had been known about for a  
month -- Antonio Davis to Toronto for 18-year-old Jonathan Bender. 
</P>
<P>
	An expected flurry of deals never materialized Sunday on the  
first day after the NBA's one-month moratorium on trades and free 
agent signings expired. 
</P>
<P>
	The pace could pick up Monday, though, with the long-rumored  
Steve Smith-Isaiah Rider deal between Atlanta and Portland expected 
to be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been slow, an eerily quiet day,'' said agent Keith Glass,  
whose client, Feick, chose New Jersey's offer over Utah's. The Nets 
made one other deal, signing Keith Van Horn to a six-year, $73 
million extension. 
</P>
<P>
	In other moves:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Utah signed Karl Malone to a four-year, $66.5 million  
extension -- the maximum allowable under the NBA's collective 
bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Philadelphia re-signed free agents Eric Snow and George Lynch.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Boston signed summer league standout Adrian Griffin.  
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, though, it was quiet as July's moratorium on  
dealmaking gave way to an August that will eventually feature 
numerous moves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought things would be busier today, but I guess I was  
wrong,'' Toronto general manager Glen Grunwald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many GMs, Grunwald was waiting to see what Orlando would do  
with Penny Hardaway. Many people around the league felt a 
resolution of the Hardaway situation would open the floodgates to 
further free agent signings and trades. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway spent the weekend in Phoenix meeting with Suns  
officials, who would like to acquire him in a sign-and-trade deal. 
The Lakers, Raptors and Trail Blazers were believed to be the other 
teams with the best chances of acquiring the three-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``Penny continues to visit teams and we continue to field phone  
calls,'' Magic general manager John Gabriel said. ``Penny has to 
make a decision, and one team has to step up. I doubt it will be 
resolved within 48 hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone signed his new four-year, $66.5 million contract just one  
minute after the moratorium expired. He appeared with teary-eyed 
Jazz owner Larry Miller at a news conference Sunday to announce the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means in a sense that what your mom told you was right,''  
said Malone, who turned 36 on July 24. ``If you work hard and 
dedicate yourself to something, you'll be rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have one goal now, and that one goal is to win the NBA  
championship,'' Malone said. ``It started 14 years ago. I'm not 
saying it's going to happen, but I'm going back to training right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah still must re-sign free agents John Stockton, Jeff Hornacek  
and Shandon Anderson. Stockton and Hornacek are virtual certainties 
to return to the Jazz, while Anderson is listening to offers from 
Seattle, San Antonio and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was traded from Indiana to Toronto in a deal that was  
agreed to over a month ago. The Pacers get 18-year-old Jonathan 
Bender, the fifth overall pick in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-9, 230-pound Davis averaged 8.9 points, 6.6 rebounds  
and 25.5 minutes per game coming off the bench for Indiana last 
season. Davis could be particularly valuable to the Raptors if they 
are unable to re-sign power forward Charles Oakley, who is a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect to come to Toronto and have a starting position  
handed to me,'' Davis said. ``I have no problem with Charles Oakley 
coming back. I think a team needs three big, strong guys up 
front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oakley is expected to meet with the Los Angeles Lakers later  
this week, although the most they could offer him is the $2 million 
middle-class exception. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really nothing to report other than the fact we're  
still talking to Toronto,'' said Charles Grantham, one of Oakley's 
representatives. ``Once the gates open, depending on some of the 
interested teams, a sign-and-trade deal could take place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 76ers didn't want to risk losing Lynch, their starting small  
forward, or Snow, who took over the point guard duties from Allen 
Iverson in the lockout-shortened 1999 season and was voted the 
league's most improved player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our priority has been to keep our family intact,'' 76ers  
general manager Billy King said. ``Keeping Eric and George is a big 
part of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad now it is official and I'm happy we were able to  
keep George and Eric part of our group. We're happy with what we've 
done, but our job's not finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Vin Baker planned to speak with Seattle SuperSonics officials  
Sunday night. His agent, Aaron Goodwin, said it remains a 
likelihood that Baker will return to Seattle for seven years and 
$83 million. ``I think we'll know by tomorrow what's going to 
happen,'' Goodwin said. The sides disagree on how much of Baker's 
salary should be tied to a weight clause. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jermaine O'Neal was miffed at the Portland Trail Blazers'  
first offer, which was believed to be less than $30 million over 
seven years. He has drawn interest from several teams, including 
the suddenly youthful Pacers. ``Every team understands I'm a year 
or two away from being an All-Star,'' he told The Oregonian. ``I 
want my contract to reflect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terrell Brandon was approached by the Raptors, who remain in  
need of a point guard and have enough salary cap room to offer $55 
million over six years. The Timberwolves have already offered 
Brandon a larger sum, and his agent, Bill Duffy, said the chances 
of his client remaining in Minnesota are ``very, very strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reports out of Detroit had the Pistons listening to offers for  
Bison Dele and Jerry Stackhouse, perhaps considering a deal with 
Boston that would include Ron Mercer and Dana Barros.

<HEADLINE> SEC Accuses UnitedHealth Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  
has accused an executive of UnitedHealth Group of making more than 
$274,000 through illegal insider trading while United was 
negotiating to acquire MetraHealth Cos. in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The government alleges that Michael Mooney, now the company's  
senior vice president-health care and economics, had nonpublic 
information about the merger plan when he purchased options to buy 
company stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC alleges that Mooney was United's vice president of  
underwriting and part of the due diligence team that was reviewing 
the potential acquisition when he traded in United stock options 
several times during May and June of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC says Mooney paid a total of $258,283 for options he  
later sold for $532,482, more than twice the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to violating the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,  
the SEC complaint alleged the trades violated the insider trading 
policy of the Minnetonka-based operator of managed health care 
plans, which then was called United HealthCare Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint says Mooney told United officials that he had not  
engaged in any prohibited trading during the MetraHealth 
acquisition talks and did not report the transactions to United's 
legal department. 
</P>
<P>
	Mooney, of Prior Lake, denies the allegations, said his  
attorney, John Hopeman. The attorney said he would not file a 
formal answer and would ask U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum to 
dismiss the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopeman said the complaint is part of an ongoing legal dispute  
regarding what standard the SEC should use to define insider 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``The SEC wants very badly for this to be this rule which says  
if you possess information you can't trade, period. They're 
fighting this battle around the country,'' Hopeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopeman believes the SEC must prove that insider information  
prompted Mooney's decision to trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't know that there was going to be a merger, but it  
didn't matter to him. He wasn't trading on that basis. He was 
trading on the basis of a separate investment strategy,'' Hopeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd been trading in company stock for nine years and they  
have never questioned his trades before and this one's like many of 
the others. We're kind of at a loss,'' Hopeman said.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Fans Cheer McNabb at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHLEHEM, Pa. (AP) -- Now that contract negotiations are over,  
Donovan McNabb has some catching up to do. He wasted no time during 
his first day on the field at Eagles training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Andy Reid gave the team's top draft pick plenty of  
practice reps Sunday as McNabb begins the process of learning 
Philadelphia's new West Coast offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel like it's going to take me long to catch up,''  
said McNabb, who worked primarily with the second unit. ``I think 
the timing is pretty low right now. The receivers I worked out with 
(when he was unsigned) didn't have the speed or the route running 
that these guys have. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just an adjustment period that you go through when you  
report to camp. I'm patient and I'm just going to continue working 
on my conditioning,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb, taken with the second overall pick in the April draft,  
completed a hectic first weekend with the team. McNabb and the 
Eagles agreed to terms Friday on a seven-year contract worth $54 
million, including an $11.3 million signing bonus, but it wasn't 
until late Saturday that the 32-page contract was approved by the 
league offices and signed by McNabb. 
</P>
<P>
	With that behind him, McNabb stepped onto the field for the  
first time in training camp Sunday, intent on showing he was worth 
the high selection and big money. 
</P>
<P>
	He even heard his first cheers from Philadelphia fans after his  
selection was booed on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was rewarding to hear the fans cheer and clap for every  
completion that I had,'' McNabb said. ``They seemed to get excited 
about it. That helps out all the players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid is just glad McNabb is finally in camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad he's working,'' Reid said. ``We're catching him up on  
this thing. We're just working him right into the rotation. There 
were a lot of throws he had a chance to complete and they were 
either off the receiver's body or in a position where that receiver 
couldn't catch the football. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that I liked was, he finished strong. He came out  
and he was tired and that arm was tired and he worked that last 
series there and finished with some completions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNabb goes into camp as the backup to Doug Pederson, already  
familiar with the Eagles offense after working with Reid in Green 
Bay.

<HEADLINE> Suns Agree to Terms With Rogers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Phoenix Suns have agreed to contract terms  
with free agent forward Rodney Rogers, the team announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract has not been signed, but Rogers will receive the  
new $2 million exception allowed to teams this year under the NBA's 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is for three years, with the final season at the  
player's option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to work out a sign and trade deal but it didn't  
look like the Clippers were going to get anything done,'' agent 
Bill Strickland said, ``so we made this decision in a fluid 
market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suns' general manager Bryan Colangelo declined to comment on the  
deal because the contract had not been signed. The team said Rogers 
is expected to be in town to meet with reporters on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-7, 255-pound Rogers adds some much-needed inside  
strength to the Suns' roster, as well as another 3-point shooter. 
Team officials have said since the end of last season that inside 
toughness was a major deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who played collegiately at Wake Forest, was chosen by  
Denver as the ninth pick overall in 1993. He played two seasons the 
Nuggets before he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he 
played the last four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers has averaged 11.5 points per game in six NBA seasons. His  
high was 15.1 with the Clippers in 1997-98. His low was 7.4 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement with Rogers was the latest in a busy four days for  
the Suns. They signed Cliff Robinson to a four-year, $29 million 
contract Sunday night. A few hours earlier, they signed free agent 
Oliver Miller to a one-year, $700,000 deal. 
</P>
<P>
	For Robinson, it was his long-awaited reward after signing  
consecutive one-year contracts the past two seasons. Miller, who 
has shed more than 50 pounds in the off-season but still weighs in 
at over 300, returns to the team that drafted him in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns also are in the thick of the competition for Penny  
Hardaway. Hardaway was in Phoenix over the weekend, where he met 
with Suns' officials and played golf with coach Danny Ainge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns have little money to offer Hardaway as a free agent.  
Their only hope is to persuade Orlando to agree to a sign-and-trade 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, Phoenix signed first-round draft pick Shawn Marion  
to a four-year deal worth just under $5 million.

<HEADLINE> APME Announces Top Writing Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The killings at Columbine High School in  
Littleton, Colo., the dramatic rescue attempt of a fishing vessel 
crew in the Gulf of Alaska and an in-depth look at the tobacco 
industry's creation of a more addictive tobacco won top prizes for 
AP staffers in the Associated Press Managing Editors association's 
writing competition. 
</P>
<P>
	A package of photos on Kosovo by nine AP photographers was cited  
for the best news photography award, and the feature photography 
award went to famine coverage in the Sudan. 
</P>

<P>
	AP's Denver bureau was cited for excellence in deadline coverage  
for the Columbine story. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex Huppke of AP's Indianapolis bureau won the John L. Dougherty  
Award, which recognizes an outstanding reporter with less than 
three years' service with the AP. Dougherty was the longtime 
managing editor of the Rochester (N.Y.) Times-Union and Democrat &AMP; 
Chronicle who died in 1981 while serving as APME treasurer. He was 
known for his emphasis on good writing and nurturing young 
journalists.

Peter Dejong, Jerome Delay, Eric Draper, John Gaps III, David 
Guttenfelder, Srdjan Ilic, Santiago Lyon, Enric Marti and Dimitri 
Messinis.

in Nairobi, Kenya, for a photo of the U.S. Embassy bombing in 
Nairobi, and Roberto Borea, of AP's Baltimore bureau, for his photo 
of the Clinton family as they departed the White House for a 
vacation in Martha's Vineyard during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The feature photo award was given to Brennan Linsley for a  
series of photos on famine in the Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention was given to Guttenfelder for photographs of a  
fashion show in Niger, and to Lebanon photographer Saleh Rifai for 
a photo showing spectators in a building looking through openings 
of a large portrait of the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeni. 
</P>
<P>
	In the writing awards, honorable mention in deadline coverage  
was awarded to Niko Price and Ken Guggenheim for stories out of 
Honduras and Nicaragua on the destruction done by Hurricane Mitch, 
which killed more than 9,000 people when it hit Central America in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	Karin Davies was awarded honorable mention in the deadline  
category for coverage of the August bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 
Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
	Honorable mention in feature writing went to national writer  
Helen O'Neill for her account of the first tourist dive in a small 
submarine to the wreck of the Titanic, and Marta Aldrich of AP's 
Nashville, Tenn., bureau for ``Roy's Walk,'' an account of how a 
3-year-old boy's wandering away from home stirred an unusual ``good 
Samaritan'' response. 
</P>
<P>
	In enterprise reporting, honorable mention was given to national  
writer John Hendren for his look at the fire danger in upholstery. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Gore's Chief of Staff Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore's chief of staff  
resigned on Monday, effective in October, for a more lucrative 
private-sector career. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest personnel change under campaign chairman Tony  
Coelho, chief of staff Ron Klain will be replaced by Gore's chief 
White House counsel and fellow Tennessean, Charles Burson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have always valued and will continue to value Ron's  
intelligence, loyalty and acumen,'' Gore said in a statement. ``I'm 
not letting him go completely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burson is a former Tennessee attorney general. Klain has  
accepted a partnership in the Washington office of the Los 
Angeles-based law firm O'Melveny &AMP; Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	Klain allies said Monday that the friction between him and  
Coelho when the former congressman first took over Gore's 
presidential campaign in May had been smoothed over. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got several offers. He can't afford to turn it down,''  
Coelho said. ``He and I, over the last eight weeks, developed a 
close relationship. I asked him to stay but I understand'' his

<HEADLINE> Packers' Robert Brooks Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Wide receiver Robert Brooks, a fan  
favorite who used to jump into the Lambeau Field stands to 
celebrate touchdown catches from quarterback Brett Favre, announced 
his retirement today, hampered by a painful back injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks said he was hampered by injuries the last two seasons.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thank God for the opportunity He has given me,'' Brooks said  
at a news conference today. ``It was a dream come true to play in 
the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a day in training camp, Brooks, 29, skipped workouts for  
two days, creating speculation that he would retire because of 
injuries. Then, this morning, the Packers in conjunction with 
Brooks scheduled a news conference for today. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks underwent surgery during training camp last year to  
repair a herniated disc. He did not practice again until Oct. 11 
and played in the first five regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury bothered him throughout the season. He finished with  
just 31 catches for 420 yards and three touchdowns, having been 
inactive for four games late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He had surgery again in January. He agreed to a $1.1 million pay  
cut in June, which the Packers said eased their salary-cap 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks' best season was 1995, when he caught 102 passes after  
the retirement of star receiver Sterling Sharpe. Brooks averaged 
14.7 yards for a team-record 1,497 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He electrified fans that year by leaping into the outstretched  
arms of fans behind the Lambeau Field end zones to celebrate 
touchdowns, establishing a tradition known as the ``Lambeau leap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers gave him with a five-year, $15 million contract in  
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his right knee against San Francisco in October 1996.  
He returned in 1997 and was named the NFL's ``comeback player of 
the year'' by the Pro Football Writers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	However, by the end of the 1997 season, he developed lower-back  
pain. He participated in every practice during the Packers' 10-day 
minicamp in June this year, raising hopes that he had recovered.

<HEADLINE> Lewinsky Injured in Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky was slightly injured when she  
became distracted while driving and her sport utility vehicle 
rolled over into oncoming traffic in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	The dark blue Explorer toppled on its side at 1 p.m. Sunday on  
Highway 101 about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles, said Bob 
Inman, a CHP dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was awake and alert when paramedics arrived,'' Inman said.  
</P>
<P>
	Motorists who stopped to help didn't recognize the former White  
House intern, according to Will Wood, who said he witnessed the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``She had a lot of cuts on her left arm and some of her blood  
got onto my hands,'' Wood said in a telephone interview. ``But she 
never passed out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, 26, was treated for scrapes and bruises at  
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura and released, said a nursing 
supervisor who declined to give her name. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky's father and another person, who was not  
identified, came to the hospital to pick her up, the supervisor 
said. ``She's fine,'' Dr. Bernard Lewinsky told Los Angeles 
television station KABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Inman said Ms. Lewinsky, who lives in Los Angeles, was not cited  
for the accident and alcohol or drugs weren't involved in the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who was alone, was driving in the left northbound  
lane when she reached over to the passenger seat to take something 
out of her purse, Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When she looked up, she realized she was very close to a motor  
home which was traveling in the lane next to her,'' Inman said, 
quoting a report taken by officers investigating the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky veered left to avoid a collision and lost control.  
She swerved back and forth but was unable to regain control and the 
Explorer crossed a dusty median strip and toppled on its side, 
coming to rest in the left southbound lane, Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear how fast Ms. Lewinsky was driving, where she was  
going or what she was trying to get out of the purse, Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The southbound lane was closed for about 30 minutes while the  
vehicle was towed away. The Explorer, which had about 5000 miles on 
the odometer, was scratched and dented and its driver's side mirror 
was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``She missed our car by about 10 feet,'' said Wood, 45, a  
retired police officer from Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood said he had to swerve to miss the Explorer. He and other  
motorists stopped to aid the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw there was a girl in the front seat, and she was trying  
to get out of her safety belt. I didn't know who she was,'' he 
said. ``You don't think about that sort of thing in that kind of 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She said her name was Monica and we were using her name to  
calm her down, like 'It's okay, Monica,''' Wood added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Moore, a Ventura County Fire Department rescue worker, told  
Los Angeles TV station KTLA he didn't realize who Lewinsky was 
until a CHP officer tipped him off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a surprise. You never know who's going to come cruising  
down the 101,'' Moore said.

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Designs Java Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Hoping to capitalize on the popularity  
of its free Java programming language, Sun Microsystems is creating 
a computer chip designed to run software written with that code. 
</P>
<P>
	The microprocessor -- named MAJC and pronounced ``magic'' -- is  
intended to run both computers and consumer electronic devices, the 
company said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The move would bring Sun into competition with Intel and its  
market-dominating computer chips, especially the Pentium line. In 
recent years, numerous attempts to compete with Intel on price and 
design have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, however, is familiar with such challenges, having chipped  
away at Microsoft's dominance in software by creating Java and 
giving programmers open access to the code, which can be used to 
write applications for a variety of systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chips would improve a machine's ability to run  
Java-based programs for applications such as voice recognition, 
networking, three-dimensional graphics and other complex computing, 
said Marc Tremblay, chief architect on the project. 
</P>
<P>
	But the chips will also work with several other programming  
languages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun plans to present an overview of the MAJC architecture at a  
technical conference in mid-August and unveil the chip in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``This addresses where the industry is headed,'' said Jay  
Stevens, a senior vice president of Buckingham Research Group. 
``The movement of data, video and voice, very quickly, efficiently 
and cheaply, is the leading edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun would not disclose what company will be fabricating the new  
chips, nor what companies they are working with to build computers 
and devices with the chips.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Count Diana Rigg, Tom Selleck and Farrah Fawcett  
among TV's 10 hottest stars of all time. 
</P>
<P>
	So says TV Guide, which teamed with ``Entertainment Tonight'' to  
compile the list. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rigg played Emma Peel on ``The Avengers'' in the 1960s.  
Selleck was the title character in ``Magnum, P.I.'' in the '80s, 
and Ms. Fawcett was Jill Munroe on ``Charlie's Angels'' from 1976 
to '77. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Chamberlain also made the list in TV Guide's upcoming  
issue. The others are Loni Anderson, Pierce Brosnan, Angie 
Dickinson, David Cassidy, Peggy Lipton of ``The Mod Squad,'' and 
Grant Goodeve from ``Eight is Enough.''

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Rookie Skips Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings rookie defensive end  
Dimitrius Underwood, the 29th overall draft pick, skipped Monday 
afternoon's practice and team officials did not know why. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dimitrius Underwood has left training camp without  
permission,'' coach Dennis Green said in a prepared statement. 
``The fair thing to do is to concentrate on the players that are 
here and give them all our energy. When there is something further 
to report on Dimitrius, we will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said the absence was unexcused,  
but that nobody knew why Underwood left after lunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood, drafted out of Michigan State with the Vikings'  
second pick in the first round, worked out in the morning. But he 
was nowhere to be found at the dorm on campus after lunch. A team 
official said Underwood was neither ill nor injured. 
</P>
<P>
	His position coach, Andre Patterson, said the team was trying to  
track down the 6-foot-6, 276-pound rookie who signed a five-year 
contract on Sunday for more than $5 million with a signing bonus of 
$1,750,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Teammates heading to and from dinner declined to discuss  
Underwood's unexplained absence. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood's agent, Craig Domann of Bolingbrook, Ill., didn't  
return phone calls from The Associated Press seeking comment, and 
Rob Brzezinski, the Vikings' chief negotiator, said he didn't know 
Underwood's whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Underwood went AWOL, the Vikings were feeling good about  
having all their players in camp and under contract, including 
their nine draft picks and left guard Randall McDaniel, who 
reported to camp despite the team's unwillingness to renegotiate 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's big is that everyone's in camp. Because if you've got  
even one person out of camp, then that becomes an issue and it's as 
big an issue to everyone as it is the other 80 guys that you've got 
in camp,'' owner Red McCombs said. ``So, it's really big to have 
everybody in camp. But to have a guy like Randall is super big 
because that would be the story of the camp if Randall were not in 
camp.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers' Bettis Undergoes Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LATROBE, Pa. (AP) -- Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome  
Bettis had surgery on his left knee Monday, but is expected back 
for the team's season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis, who re-injured his left knee during private preseason  
workouts nearly two weeks ago in St. Louis, felt some discomfort in 
the knee Monday morning after a hard workout the previous day. He 
had been running on his own since training camp started Friday at 
St. Vincent College. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI test performed in Pittsburgh on Monday revealed a tear in  
the lateral meniscus cartilage. Bettis later had arthroscopic 
surgery at UPMC-Shadyside in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The surgery went very well,'' coach Bill Cowher said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bettis should be back within three to four weeks -- plenty of  
time for the Sept. 12 opener at Cleveland, Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we're getting all these things out of the way early,  
and we're hoping for a complete recovery,'' Cowher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher said it was unclear whether the new injury was related to  
the knee injury Bettis suffered last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's old or new, the most important thing was that the  
prognosis is good for a complete recovery,'' he said. Cowher said 
he was reassured by the fact that Bettis came back in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't anticipate this setting him back a whole lot,'' Cowher  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bettis was put on the active non-football injury list Friday  
night. That prohibited him from participating in team drills during 
training camp, but he remained in good shape by running on his own 
and lifting weights.

<HEADLINE> Hatch Questions Judge Appointments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  
doesn't like the look of how a judge appointed by President Clinton 
was assigned to try Democratic fund-raising cases against a Clinton 
friend and others that resulted in ``soft plea bargains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reported over the weekend that U.S.  
District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson bypassed a traditional random 
assignment system and sent a criminal case against presidential 
friend Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie to U.S. District Judge Paul L. 
Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the committee chairman and a  
Republican presidential hopeful, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that 
he likes Johnson ``and I have nothing to indicate that she's done 
anything wrong. But this doesn't look right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trie's case was the first major prosecution from the Justice  
Department investigation of Democratic fund raising in the 1996 
election. Friedman, appointed to the bench by Clinton two years 
earlier, also was assigned by Johnson to two related cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson used the same out-of-the-ordinary method to assign  
Clinton appointee James Robertson to a tax case involving another 
presidential friend, former Associate Attorney General Webster 
Hubbell. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, interviewed from Des Moines, Iowa, where he was  
campaigning, said people involved in the fund-raising allegations 
``undermined our political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then all of a sudden you find, even in the local district  
courts, that there's been apparently selective assignment to two 
Clinton judges of some of these things,'' he said. ``That really 
just kind of smells.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a conservative group, Judicial Watch, asked Johnson in a  
letter to address the issue so that ``public confidence in the fine 
reputation of the U.S. District Court ... can be preserved and 
strengthened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman dismissed various charges against Trie and the other  
two, assigned to Friedman under normal court rules because of their 
cases' relevance to Trie's. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Friedman's rulings was reversed on appeal, and Trie is to  
be sentenced in two weeks, probably to probation, on a 
plea-bargained guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, Friedman and Robertson have declined repeated requests  
by the AP to discuss the court assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has frequently criticized Attorney General Janet Reno and  
the Justice Department for decisions on whether to prosecute 
fund-raising matters or, when prosecution has proceeded, the 
quality of the cases developed. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of those implicated and charged have negotiated plea  
bargains and received light sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Reno's decisions were colored by politics, Hatch said:  
``They were certainly made either for political reasons or through 
incompetence or through advice from people ... who were 
political.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks as though they're covering these things up,'' he  
said. ``Certainly it looks like these plea bargains have been 
deals, and we even worry about whether the judges were preselected 
so that they would give these soft plea bargains credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Carole Florman declined to  
comment Sunday on Hatch's statements.

<HEADLINE> Officials Declare Drought Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLES TOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- With a yearlong drought showing no  
signs of letting up, federal officials on Monday declared West 
Virginia and parts of five neighboring states disaster areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The damage was apparent here as Agriculture Secretary Dan  
Glickman stood at the edge of a stunted cornfield producing sickly, 
3-inch ears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Drought is like an insidious cancer,'' he said. ``It's slow,  
it infects and it's harder to deal with as a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal declaration, which could be expanded this week,  
makes farmers in West Virginia eligible for low-interest loans, 
along with their counterparts in drought-stricken parts of 
Kentucky, Ohio, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he would work with Congress to provide  
$10 billion in drought relief, and he said efforts are being made 
to help farmers get water and hay for their livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	While the heat wave blamed for nearly 200 deaths in 20 Eastern  
states let up in many places Monday, officials said there's no 
substantial rainfall in sight in the places that need it most. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said rainfall levels in West  
Virginia range from 5 inches to 13 inches below normal. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would need about 15 inches of rain to make up for the loss,  
but the damage is already done,'' said West Virginia Agriculture 
Secretary Guy Douglass. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's farm losses have surpassed $100 million, and this  
year may be the last that up to 10 percent of West Virginia's 
21,000 farmers can remain in business, Douglass said. 
</P>
<P>
	From tree nurseries to fruit orchards, the arid weather has  
sucked the life out of crops, causing limbs to wilt and fruit to 
fall off branches. 
</P>
<P>
	In Galway, N.Y., Christmas tree farmer Dave Eaton has lost about  
70 percent of this season's plantings, 15,000 trees at a cost of $1 
apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	Earl MacIntosh, owner of the Weathered Willow Tree in Altamont,  
N.Y., tells the same tale: ``They are just drying up and shriveling 
away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And in New Jersey, Gov. Christie Whitman issued a drought  
warning Monday, clearing the way for state officials to assert 
control over the state's water supply. She said that if dry 
conditions and heavy usage continue, she'll impose mandatory 
water-use restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Elliot's Transplant Weeks Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- It will be at least two weeks before San  
Antonio Spurs forward Sean Elliott can undergo a kidney transplant, 
according to a report. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's brother has a kidney that appears compatible for a  
match, but commitments prevent him from traveling to San Antonio 
for another week or so, the San Antonio Express-News said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's brother then will undergo several days of tests  
himself to determine if he can be a donor. It hasn't been revealed 
which of Elliott's two brothers is the potential donor. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old Elliott has been working out to remain in good  
shape before surgery, according to the Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona graduate has said he wants to play for the Spurs  
after the transplant. He fought back from knee injuries last season 
to help San Antonio win its first NBA championship.

<HEADLINE> Duval, Woods Set for TV Match  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	One of these years, David Duval and Tiger Woods just might find  
themselves paired together in the final round with a tournament on 
the line. For now, they'll have to settle for a made-for-television 
event with only bragging rights at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first golf event broadcast live by a network in prime  
time, ABC Sports will televise the ``Showdown at Sherwood'' 
tonight, an 18-hole match between the top two players in the world 
with a difference of $700,000 riding on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't confuse this for the Masters, where Woods has won and  
Duval has come close. Don't expect another 59 from Duval, because 
the format is match play. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't expect either Woods or Duval to consider a rivalry born.  
At least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our event at Sherwood isn't even a tournament, so I don't  
think it can really be considered fuel for a rivalry,'' Duval said. 
``But it will be great for television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The match, at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, Calif.,  
will start at 7:30 p.m. EDT, although ABC will not begin its live 
coverage until 8 p.m. Lights have been installed on the last two 
holes in case it gets too dark. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us an opportunity to kind of expose the game in a  
little different light, in a different time frame, on a different 
day and probably to a different crowd than would usually see the 
game,'' Duval said. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't count on Justin Leonard as part of that crowd. He was  
asked last week what he thought of the match, in which $1.1 million 
from the $1.5 million purse will go to the winner -- each donate 
$200,000 to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like it a lot more if I was in it,'' said Leonard, the  
1997 British Open champion who lost in a playoff at Carnoustie last 
month. ``Since I'm not, I don't much care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports is banking on the fact a lot of others will at least  
be curious enough to watch. It certainly has two of the biggest 
names in golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods is one of the most dynamic personalities in sports. He  
took golf to the front pages by winning the Masters in record 
fashion, becoming the youngest champion and the first one of color. 
His arrival is a big reason the PGA Tour landed a $136 million 
television contract, which made everyone around him richer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be a golf star, but I think Tiger is a star,'' Duval  
said. ``He transcends the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval is everything Woods is not -- collected, methodical,  
emotionless. Behind those wraparound sunglasses are eyes that look 
lifeless, just like a shark before it tears into its prey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very calm, very levelheaded, and it comes out when he  
plays,'' Woods said. ``He is very methodical, very cool. He doesn't 
get excited, doesn't get frustrated. He just goes about his 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Never mind that the event is essentially no different from  
Shell's Wonderful World of Golf matches, except for the live 
television. Never mind that the two richest players in golf are 
about to get even richer. Or that both players are represented by 
IMG, the sprawling sports agency that proposed the match. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes the match compelling is the fact they have clearly  
raised their game a notch above everyone else. They are the only 
players to be No. 1 in the world ranking this year, a position 
currently held by Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that they're arguably the two best players in the game  
today,'' Jack Nicklaus said. ``I don't think there's any question 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval stormed to top of the rankings by becoming the first  
player in 25 years to win four times before the Masters. That 
included the Bob Hope Classic, where he became the first player to 
shoot a 59 on a Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods came back strong. In six tournaments after his  
post-Masters break, he has won three times and not finished worse 
than seventh -- and that includes two majors, a third in the U.S. 
Open and a tie for seventh in the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	So, who should be No. 1? Don't look for an answer tonight.  
</P>
<P>
	``People who think this will decide who is No. 1 or No. 2 are  
blowing it out of proportion,'' Duval said. ``It's a one-day match, 
18 holes, and that does not make it a rivalry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, this is as close as it will get.  
</P>
<P>
	In 47 tournaments they have both played in their professional  
careers, Woods has finished ahead of Duval 27 times, with one tie. 
But they have never played together in a final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come close, but it hasn't happened,'' Woods said.  
``Either he has played great and I haven't, or it's been the other 
way around. But it's going to happen. It's going to happen for sure 
at Sherwood.''

<HEADLINE> `Good' Cholesterol Gene Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	After a four-decade search, scientists have identified a gene  
that regulates the body's level of so-called good cholesterol, a 
breakthrough that could someday lead to a new way to treat one of 
the most common causes of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaws in the gene, known as ABC1, prevent the production of a  
protein that the body needs to rinse excess bad cholesterol and 
other fats out of cells and the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene was discovered by researchers looking for the cause of  
Tangier disease, an extremely rare inherited illness in which the 
body produces virtually none of the good cholesterol, HDL. Without 
it, the level of the bad cholesterol, LDL, and other fats that 
contribute to heart attacks and clogged arteries rise unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists not involved in the studies said the discovery was a  
significant advance in heart disease research because millions of 
people with cardiovascular problems have lower-than-normal HDL 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients can have a normal LDL level, but still have  
cardiovascular disease because their HDL is so low,'' said Sonia 
Skarlatos, genetics research leader at the National Heart, Lung and 
Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have any drugs right now that raise HDL  
significantly. Now we know where to look for the gene and its 
mutations, and how we might enhance the gene's expression to make 
more HDL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10 labs were looking for ABC1. It was isolated in  
separate studies by two sets of scientists in Germany and one in 
Canada. Their results appear in the August issue of Nature 
Genetics. 
</P>
<P>
	A group headed by Michael Hayden of the University of British  
Columbia, lead author of one of the studies, determined that ABC1 
is responsible for making a protein essential to both HDL formation 
and the process of unloading fats from cells and the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen G. Young of the University of California, San Francisco,  
who reviewed the studies independently, noted that the studies did 
not determine where the gene works within cells, or the precise 
biochemical steps involved. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the ABC1 discovery does lead to new cholesterol drugs,  
they may work in opposite ways from a class of cholesterol busters 
that have revolutionized heart care -- the statins. 
</P>
<P>
	Statins lower the level of LDLs in the bloodstream. For people  
at high risk, the drugs can reduce the risk of a heart attack by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs that would boost HDL might offer more protection, doctors  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is called the good cholesterol  
because LDL, low-density lipoproteins and other fats attach 
themselves to HDL particles and are eventually discarded together 
by the liver. 
</P>
<P>
	``This genetic discovery allows us to ask the question of, `How  
would you impact vascular disease if you were to specifically 
change HDL?''' said Dr. Dennis Sprecher of the Cleveland Clinic. 
``It's a significant piece of the puzzle. But we're not at the 
point where we would start experimentation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding ABC1 also may lead to treatments or gene therapies  
for Tangier disease -- which afflicts only about 40 people worldwide 
-- and less severe illnesses caused by other mutations of the gene. 
</P>
<P>
	Tangier disease is named after tiny Tangier Island in Chesapeake  
Bay. Discovered in 1608 by Capt. John Smith, today it's home to 
about 700 people. Most are descendants of the island's original 
English settlers. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal scientists identified Tangier Disease in two island  
children -- a brother and sister -- in 1963. Their tonsils were 
orange, a sign their cells were overloaded with cholesterol. Tests 
showed they lacked HDL, and researchers launched the first of many 
hunts for the genetic culprit.

<HEADLINE> NASA Reports on X-Ray Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's new X-ray telescope is in a  
slightly lower orbit than planned, but it's still acceptable for 
astronomical observations, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	An engine firing over the weekend raised the high point of the  
Chandra X-ray Observatory's orbit to 86,433 miles, about one-third 
of the way to the moon. That's 559 miles lower than intended, but 
still well within the specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Program manager Fred Wojtalik said one of two engines used to  
boost the telescope performed slightly below expectations. As a 
result, a backup pair of engines will be used to raise the low end 
of Chandra's orbit on Wednesday and again on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts released the $1.5 billion Chandra Observatory -- the  
world's most powerful X-ray telescope -- from space shuttle Columbia 
on July 23. The observatory will spend the next five years looking 
for black holes and studying stars, galaxies and quasars.

<HEADLINE> Suns Re-Sign Clifford Robinson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Clifford Robinson has decided to stay in Phoenix  
for $29 million, and the ``Big O'' is back, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Oliver Miller, who began his NBA career with the Suns in 1992,  
returned to the team Sunday when Phoenix signed him to a one-year 
contract. Hours later, the Suns announced they re-signed Robinson 
to a multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press confirmed today that Robinson got a  
four-year, $29 million deal that will pay him about $6 million next 
season, while Miller got the veteran minimum salary of about 
$700,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson had one-year deals with the Suns in 1997-98 and last  
season after playing the first eight seasons of his NBA career with 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Robinson ranked in the top 30 in five different  
statistical categories. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished eighth in 3-point goal percentage with a career-high  
42 percent and also had a career-high 1.50 steals per game, which 
ranked 28th in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson also had 1.18 blocks per game (25th in the league) and  
his highest since 1993-94 and ranked 29th in scoring at 16.4 points 
per game and 29th in field-goal percentage at 47 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cliff has given us two great years and has earned this new  
deal,'' Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson, 32, signed a $1 million contract with Phoenix in 1997  
and another one-year deal for $3.5 million last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad to get it done,'' Robinson told The Arizona Republic.  
``Another summer of waiting to see what is going to happen wouldn't 
have worked for me. It's too stressful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a free-agent forward and center, played only four games  
with Sacramento last season and spent most of the year on the 
injured list with back spasms. He was hampered by his weight, which 
was a reported 365 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Miller has since lost some 50 pounds and has  
looked impressive for the Suns' entry in the Rocky Mountain Review 
games in Salt Lake City for rookies and free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller averaged 10 points, 8.3 rebounds, 3.3 blocked shots and  
1.3 steals in the first three games including five blocks and 13 
rebounds last Thursday against Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last two weeks, Oliver has shown great improvement in  
his physical conditioning and continues to display a desire for a 
fresh start both on and off the basketball floor,'' said Suns 
general manager Bryan Colangelo. ``This signing is the next step in 
Oliver's development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, who has also played for Detroit, Toronto and Dallas,  
said he wants to be down to 290 pounds by the time training camp 
starts Oct. 4. 
</P>
<P>
	He'd like to stay in the 295-300 range through the season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've grown up. I've gone through a lot in these past five  
years,'' Miller told reporters last week. ``I'm just going to go 
out and show people that Oliver Miller means business. He still 
loves the game, and he's willing to do whatever is possible to 
win.''

<HEADLINE> Phillips, Minor League Umps Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Richie Phillips parted ways with minor league  
umpires on Monday, although they disagreed on whether he was fired 
or quit. 
</P>
<P>
	While Phillips said he resigned because more than two dozen  
minor leaguers agreed to become permanent replacements in the 
majors on Sept. 1, two minor league umps, speaking on the condition 
they not be identified, said he was fired following a vote last 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said from the beginning that if a significant number of  
minor league umpires decided or indicated they would work as 
replacement umpires, we could no longer represent them,'' Phillips 
said. ``We're very happy to have helped them to form the union. We 
wished them great luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, the head of the major league umpires since 1978, said  
the big league umps will file unfair labor practice charges against 
the American and National leagues on Tuesday in New York. He will 
ask the National Labor Relations Board to seek an injunction in 
federal court to prevent baseball from forcing out 22 umpires on 
Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``They engaged in a pattern of acts purposefully designed to  
break the umpires,'' Phillips said. ``It's part of a cynical 
strategy to undermine the unions that keep the game of baseball 
alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NLRB usually takes 4-to-6 weeks to investigate, meaning a  
decision is likely to come near the end of the regular season. If 
the New York regional director finds the case has merit and the 
agency's general counsel in Washington issues a complaint, the NLRB 
board could grant permission for its staff to seek a court order 
forcing baseball to take back the umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	In a similar process five years ago, baseball players filed  
charges and the NLRB won an injunction against owners that caused 
the union to end its 7 1/2-month strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires are battling for a new labor contract to  
replace the one that expires Dec. 31, and their mass resignation 
tactic, aimed at forcing the start of negotiations, backfired when 
27 of the 68 either didn't resign or withdrew their resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball then hired 25 new umpires from the minor leagues,  
including many who had been vacation fill-ins, and told 22 major 
league umps their resignations had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips had been trying to organize the minor league umpires  
since last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The minor leaguers still intend to unionize and will seek  
another lawyer, according to the two umpires. While Phillips said 
two weeks ago he would ask the NLRB to hold an election to certify 
the minor league union, he has not done so. Some of the minor 
leaguers have said they thought he was using them as leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major league umps want to fire Phillips as their  
negotiator. Fourteen of the 66 unionized umpires issued a statement 
last week criticizing their leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the American League confirmed it had accepted the  
resignations of umpires Drew Coble and Greg Kosc, effective Sept. 
2. According to management officials, the pair resigned last month, 
withdrew their resignations, then resigned again. Coble and Kosc 
maintain they didn't resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was indeed some confusion about their status,'' Phyllis  
Merhige, the AL's senior vice president, said Monday. ``Each of 
them were called by league officials and each of them confirmed 
their resignations. Now it's with the lawyers.''

<HEADLINE> Fall Crop May Create Storage Crunch / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONDURANT, Iowa (AP) -- Jeff Nelson's brown brick office at the  
Farmers Elevator Cooperative in this small central Iowa town is 
shadowed by 160-foot grain silos still holding a fair amount of 
last year's corn and soybean crop. 
</P>
<P>
	And with a strong harvest expected this fall, he and other  
elevator operators wonder how much room will be left for this 
year's crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's real difficult to know what the farmer stocks are like at  
this point,'' Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state won't release it's harvest forecasts until mid-August,  
but reports indicate an excellent crop, despite flooding in 
northern Iowa, Agriculture Secretary Patty Judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, state records show the amount of corn in storage in  
Iowa has risen 20 percent to 800 million bushels and the amount of 
stored soybeans has soared 39 percent to more than 200 million 
bushels since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are inclined to leave their crops in storage when prices  
are low. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a normal year this would be the time to get empty and clear  
out (the elevators),'' said David Holm of the Iowa Institute for 
Cooperatives. ``With the current prices there's very little 
movement. There's a great deal of concern about how full the 
elevators are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge said the size of the new crop can only depress prices  
further. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do have a huge surplus of grain in the country both in the  
elevators and the storage. It's going to create a real glut,'' 
Judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 15 percent more corn in the silos than last year and  
an equal amount of soybeans on hand, Nelson thinks he should have 
enough room for this year's crops. But he can't be certain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like assembling a car in a factory,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rick Peterson, general manager of Mid-Iowa Cooperative in  
Beaman, said the space crunch was a hot topic of conversation at a 
recent board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the company's nine elevators, scattered throughout  
central Iowa, use only 10 percent to 25 percent of its capacity 
this time of year. But with more corn and soybeans in storage than 
last year, the silos -- which have enough room to hold a 45 
mile-long train filled with grain -- are already half full. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Peterson says the co-op will probably ration  
available space. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts predict the tight storage capacity will likely increase  
ground storage this year. Other co-ops have built additional 
storage. Some farmers have refurbished older ground storage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't begin to hold all the grain,'' said Holm, who placed  
the state's total storage capacity at about 2.6 billion bushels. 
``It's going to get piled on the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state's total storage capacity has been dropping since 1990,  
said Bob Wisner, an economist at Iowa State University. A similar 
glut in the fall of 1994 led farmers to store grain outside, which 
can lead to spoilage if it's a wet fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``That looks like a definite possibility this fall,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Judge and other state officials have asked Congress for  
emergency assistance for farmers, including aid to cover storage 
payments and the extension of loans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyway we look at it, we are going to have a serious problem  
in handling the grain and there's not going to be much value in the 
grain,'' Judge said. ``I wish I could say differently.''

<HEADLINE> Braves Try To Stump Mets With Trades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta Braves couldn't stand pat. Not after  
all the injuries. Not after watching their closest rival pull off a 
flurry of trades. 
</P>
<P>
	So, will Jose Hernandez and Terry Mulholland help the Braves  
survive their first pennant race in six years? 
</P>
<P>
	``I sure hope so,'' said Atlanta general manager John  
Schuerholz, who dealt left-hander Micah Bowie and two 
minor-leaguers to the Chicago Cubs late Saturday. ``We were able to 
get two guys who've been productive and are very experienced. They 
will help make up for the loss of the guys we're missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves, only a half-game ahead of the New York Mets after  
both teams won Sunday, already have lost Andres Galarraga, Kerry 
Ligtenberg, Javy Lopez and Odalis Perez to injuries. The shaky 
health of pitcher John Smoltz and shortstop Walt Weiss forced 
Schuerholz to make a move of some sort. 
</P>
<P>
	After picking up catcher Greg Myers earlier in the week, the  
Braves GM finalized a deal with the Cubs less than a minute before 
the midnight Saturday EDT deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every year I've been here, the front office has made a point  
of doing what's necessary to give our club a boost down the 
stretch,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Now it's up to us to get the job 
done on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York, having already acquired pitcher Kenny Rogers from  
Oakland, was the busiest team on the final day before the trading 
deadline, making three of the nine deals. 
</P>
<P>
	New York acquired reliever Billy Taylor from the Athletics,  
outfielder Darryl Hamilton and left-hander Chuck McElroy from 
Colorado, and infielder Shawon Dunston from St. Louis. They gave up 
pitchers Jason Isringhausen and Greg McMichael, outfielder Brian 
McRae and three minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going for it,'' New York GM Steve Phillips said. ``You  
don't know how many times the opportunity will present itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Hernandez, hitting .272 with 15 homers and 43  
RBIs, can play short if Weiss' chronic leg problems surface again, 
as well as second, third and the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs had tried to keep Hernandez, offering a three-year  
contract, but his agent wanted more money and four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into an argument with my wife when I got home after  
(Saturday's) game,'' said Hernandez, who is making $2.4 million in 
the final year of the deal. ``I didn't know what to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And now?  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to move along,'' he said sadly.  
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland, 6-6 with a 5.15 ERA, adds depth to a Braves pitching  
staff that has struggled to find a fifth starter while managing to 
get by with a nondescript bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old, who can start or relieve, is used to moving  
around. Mulholland has played for five teams in seven years, and 
bought moving boxes a few days before the trading deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, it was a surprise,'' said Mulholland, who has  
another year on the contract that pays him $2.925 million this 
season. ``I still believe these guys (in Chicago) are capable of 
playing well. It kind of twists in my gut that I'm not a part of 
it. On the plus side, I'll be with Atlanta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland and Hernandez are scheduled to join the Braves on  
Tuesday in Pittsburgh. The Braves will have to drop a position 
player from their 25-man roster; 40-year-old Otis Nixon, hitting 
only .188 but leading the team with 18 steals, is a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowie, a 24-year-old left-hander, was 0-1 with a 13.50 ERA for  
the Braves after being called up recently from Triple-A Richmond. 
He will start Tuesday against Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves also gave up right-hander Ruben Quevedo, who is not  
on Atlanta's 40-man roster, a minor-leaguer to be named. Quevedo, 
20, was 6-5 with a 5.37 ERA in 21 games at Richmond, ranking second 
in the International League with 26 homers allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a chance to acquire two young starting pitchers,  
you do it,'' Cubs GM Ed Lynch said.

<HEADLINE>  Barton's Children Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITHIA SPRINGS, Ga. (AP) -- Boy and girls dressed in their scout  
uniforms escorted the caskets Monday of Matthew and Mychelle 
Barton, whose father killed them and tucked them into bed with 
their toys before going on a deadly shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Pictures of the victims in soccer and cheerleading outfits had  
been placed in a hallway outside the White Columns Chapel in this 
Atlanta suburb, where they were eulogized as lovable and active 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts acted as pallbearers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to remind you how your lives have been enriched just by  
knowing them,'' the Rev. Kenneth Hennesy said, recalling how 
Matthew loved baseball and the Boy Scouts, and how Mychelle was an 
active Girl Scout. ``Sometimes the answers are not there for the 
understanding of man, but there for us when we get to heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their father, Mark O. Barton, killed the children Wednesday, a  
day after he had killed their stepmother. He bashed in their skulls 
with a hammer and dunked them in a bathtub to make sure they were 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
	In a note left at the scene, Barton said he wanted to spare the  
children from ``a lifetime of pain.'' A day later, Barton opened 
fire in two Atlanta brokerage offices, killing nine more. 
</P>
<P>
	At the church, Teddy bears and inscriptions ``Gone to be with  
Momma'' decorated the pulpit, where Hennesy told about 300 mourners 
that they shouldn't question why Matthew, 11, and Mychelle, 7, were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The funeral for Barton's two youngest victims was one of three  
held Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In Houston, services were held for Kevin Dial, 36, a manager at  
Momentum Securities and one of the first to die in the shootings. 
Momentum officials said last week that Barton had lost more than 
$100,000 while day trading with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	During his funeral, his family disclosed that Dial -- son of  
former National Football League player Buddy Dial -- suffered from 
inoperable brain cancer that had not responded to treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's worth seeing or hearing or doing, I want to see it or  
hear it or do it now,'' Dial wrote in a letter he faxed to his 
mother, Janice Marye of Austin, the day before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sandy Springs north of Atlanta, a memorial service was held  
for Russell Brown, a 42-year-old man who had been day trading at 
Momentum Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in his life, he finally found something he  
loved in day trading -- he would have done it 24 hours a day if 
possible,'' Brown's fiancee Patti Balon told about 65 people 
attending the service before asking for personal anecdotes from 
co-workers.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf  
offered assurances that the Packers have replacements if they lose 
wide receiver Robert Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	After a day in training camp, Brooks skipped workouts Saturday  
and Sunday, creating speculation that he would retire because of 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the utmost confidence in our ability to develop  
receivers,'' Wolf said. ``It's something we've always done here and 
I think we'll continue to do that and we have some very talented 
people who are involved in that, so I'm not concerned with that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolf and coach Ray Rhodes declined to say Sunday whether Brooks,  
29, planned to quit because of knee, back and hamstring injuries 
that have sidelined him over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's certainly earned the opportunity to make up his own mind  
and let's not speculate as to what it is he's going to do,'' Wolf 
said. ``When he does, then we'll know what we're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without Brooks and without contract-holdout Antonio Freeman,  
quarterback Brett Favre lacked two of his favorite receivers when 
he joined training camp Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It leaves a void,'' Favre said. ``We have a good corps of  
receivers, young receivers. I don't know if anyone can step up and 
fill those shoes right away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Derrick Mayes, a fourth-year pro, could get the first  
opportunity at the starting job opposite Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayes and Bill Schroeder worked with the first team during the  
weekend while Corey Bradford and Jahine Arnold caught for the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks underwent surgery during training camp last year to  
repair a herniated disc. He did not practice again until Oct. 11 
and played in the first five regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury bothered him throughout the season. He finished with  
just 31 catches for 420 yards and three touchdowns, and was 
inactive for four games late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
	He had surgery again in January. He agreed to a $1.1 million pay  
cut in June, which the Packers said eased their salary-cap 
restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooks caught 102 passes in 1995 after Sterling Sharpe's  
retirement, averaging 14.7 yards for a team-record 1,497 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He enchanted fans that year by leaping into the outstretched  
arms of fans behind the Lambeau Field end zones to celebrate 
touchdowns, establishing a tradition known as the ``Lambeau Leap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Packers gave him with a five-year, $15 million contract in  
February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	He injured his right knee against San Francisco in October 1996.  
He returned in 1997 and was named the NFL's ``comeback player of 
the year'' by the Pro Football Writers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the 1997 season, he developed lower-back pain.  
</P>
<P>
	He participated in every practice during the Packers' 10-day  
minicamp in June this year, raising hopes that he had recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always thought he was going to play,'' Wolf said. ``But if  
he can't play, we have to go on.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             *Steelers    	
</P>
<P>
	Dermontti Dawson suffered a mild sprain in his left knee and is  
expected to miss the next three to four weeks of the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson was injured during a nine-on-seven inside drill less than  
one hour into the second practice session Saturday afternoon at St. 
Vincent College. The severity of the injury was revealed during an 
MRI performed Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson has started 164 straight games for the Steelers since  
late in his rookie year. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Titans    	
</P>
<P>
	If nothing else, Tennessee will know how to get a play off  
without being called for delay of game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans were flagged for that penalty more often than any  
other NFL team last season. Coach Jeff Fisher has made fixing that 
tendency a priority in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	A play clock was installed on the field, and the team worked on  
its timing during two drills in the first full practice of camp. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Patriots    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie running back Kevin Faulk, hoping to replace the injured  
Robert Edwards in New England's backfield, got his first taste of 
NFL-style discipline during morning practice. 
</P>
<P>
	After fumbling two punt returns, Faulk received an earful of  
instruction and got some hands-on attention from head coach Pete 
Carroll. The pair spent the next several minutes running through an 
intensive fumble-recovery drill. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, after Faulk dropped a screen pass from backup quarterback  
John Friesz, Carroll ordered the second-round draft choice from LSU 
to the sidelines, where he caught 50 screen passes from rookie 
quarterback Scott Mutryn. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Dolphins    	
</P>
<P>
	In a spirited intrasquad scrimmage that featured a melee, rookie  
running back Cecil Collins vaulted to the forefront of Miami's 
overcrowded backfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, the Dolphins' fifth-round pick whose draft value  
dropped because of several off-field transgressions, rushed for 63 
yards on 13 carries, including a 40-yard touchdown off-tackle 
burst. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Buccaneers    	
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay will open camp without first-round draft pick Anthony  
McFarland after talks failed to produce a contract agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Rich McKay said he was ``perplexed and a little  
disappointed,'' that the team had not been able to finalize a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	McKay said talks would continue, but that he was not optimistic  
about having an agreement that would enable McFarland to join the 
team in time for its first practice today. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Seattle got a quick introduction to Mike Holmgren's practice  
philosophy at the opening of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than allow the team to ease into camp the first day,  
Holmgren interrupted proceedings midway through a morning session 
and explained to the entire team what he expects to see in 
first-and-10 situations. 
</P>
<P>
	The chat session illustrated the new Seahawks' coach's emphasis  
on detail and his willingness to take time out from practice to 
discuss his philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to explain to them what the drill was. I want to  
explain to them what I expect of them,'' said Holmgren, whose 
predecessor, Dennis Erickson, typically took a more hands-off 
approach in practice.

<HEADLINE> Ripken Scratched With Back Pain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Cal Ripken Jr., bothered by back  
stiffness, left the Orioles on Monday and returned to Baltimore, 
where he will be examined by the team's orthopedic specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was scratched from the Orioles' lineup Sunday in Seattle  
because of lower back pain. The third baseman told manager Ray 
Miller on Monday morning that his back was still bothering him and 
it was decided to send him home for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who will turn 39 on Aug. 24, was scheduled to see Dr.  
Michael Jacobs on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said Ripken, who is listed as day-to-day, is  
unlikely to return to play in the Orioles' three-game series in 
Oakland, which ends Wednesday. He could rejoin the Orioles on 
Thursday, when they play host to Detroit at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who as baseball's iron man played in 2,632 consecutive  
games before ending the streak last Sept. 20, went on the disabled 
list for the first time in his career in April with a nerve 
irritation in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned May 13 and is batting .335 in 69 games this season.  
He has 15 home runs, leaving him one shy of 400 for his career. 
With 90 hits this year, he is 32 shy of 3,000.

<HEADLINE> Victims in Mich Plane Crash Mourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COTTRELLVILLE TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- Russ Turner, a skydiver who  
has jumped out of airplanes more than a thousand times, fought back 
tears as he remembered his childhood friend who loved roaming the 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner praised pilot Paul Myks, a DC-9 captain who was at the  
controls of the twin-engine Beech King Air that plummeted into a 
hayfield moments after takeoff Saturday, killing all 10 aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've known him since he was 12,'' Turner said Sunday. ``He was  
a great father, a great husband, a great pilot, a great friend and 
a great jumper. He was professional about everything he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred people in this close-knit group attended a  
memorial service led by a Michigan State Police chaplain and held 
in full view of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatal flight was the first of what was to be several flights  
for skydivers to take to the air. More than 100 members of the 
Parahawks had gathered Saturday for their annual pig roast. 
</P>
<P>
	Myks, 40, who owned the plane, had logged more than 9,000 hours  
of flight time, making him ``very experienced,'' said George Black, 
a spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash does not appear to have occurred as a result of engine  
failure, Black said. But he could not rule it out pending further 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a very initial examination of the engines, there is no  
evidence of any sort of turbine failure,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1967 Beech King Air 65A-90 took off about 8:20 a.m. Saturday  
from Marine City Airport. It cleared a 90-foot-high power line, 
then veered left and plummeted into a hayfield, exploding into a 
ball of fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said the wreckage, which lies about 1,200 feet from the  
edge of the runway, will be taken by the engine manufacturer, Pratt 
&AMP; Whitney, for analysis. Some will be shipped to Washington, D.C., 
for analysis, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heat and humidity can be factors in a plane's performance, but  
there were no indications that they were the cause of the crash, 
Black said. It was 82 degrees with 69 percent humidity Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Black said that the lack of a flight data recorder will make the  
investigation more difficult. ``We're not going to be able to say 
as much as we could about an airliner,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, friends, relatives and fellow skydivers grieved for  
the victims.

<P>
	Among them were Bob and Caroline Johnson, both members of the  
Parahawks. They were supposed to be on Saturday morning's flight 
but arrived at the airport late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very sad day,'' Johnson, of Rochester Hills, told The  
Detroit News. ``It's the weekend when we all take off from 
everything else and come out and enjoy each other's company and be 
thankful for all the times we've had. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the risk, and it's something we expect. It's  
better than sitting home on the couch, scared of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Cooper, regional director of the U.S. Parachute  
Association, said other members of his club also were ``hard hit by 
the deaths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a real close community,'' he said. ``Everybody knows  
everybody. It's kind of like a motorcycle club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash wasn't the first tragedy for the Parahawks club, the  
Times Herald of Port Huron reported. Since 1980, two members have 
died because their parachutes failed to open.

<HEADLINE> Kid Crime Crusader Charged in Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Eight years ago, 10-year-old Jason Meeks spoke out  
against crime in his Boston neighborhood, asking the governor in a 
letter to ``put the bad people in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Meeks, now 18, was the one going to jail, charged  
with shooting another teen to death in Boston's South End 
neighborhood last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeks pleaded innocent to murder and was ordered held without  
bail. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, Meeks wrote then-Gov. William Weld, asking him to do  
something about crime in the Roxbury neighborhood where he lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want you to stop the violence,'' he wrote. ``Make the people  
that are selling drugs go to school and put the bad people in 
jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1993, Weld visited Meeks at his school and was  
photographed eating pepperoni pizza with him in the cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1998, Meeks and some friends allegedly were riding their  
bicycles and met up with Tari Thomas, 18, whom he apparently knew. 
The teens exchanged words before Meeks pulled a semiautomatic 
pistol and shot Thomas in the head, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dennis Collins would not comment on possible motives,  
and he also would not comment on why Meeks was arrested more than a 
year after Thomas was killed.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Cut Fares for Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- The nation's largest air carriers have  
kicked off a fare sale with some prices discounted by as much as 25 
percent for late summer and fall travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, even better prices are sometimes available so consumers  
should check with their travel agent for comparisons, said Tom 
Parsons, editor of www.bestfares.com, an Internet site that tracks 
travel costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not one of those fare sales to write home to mom  
about,'' Parsons said. ``But with this sale more people can 
participate. I think the cities that are probably enjoying this air 
sale are where there's no competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spot sales this summer that have posted better prices for some  
routes have included Southwest Airlines' coast-to-coast special. 
Also, America West last week reduced prices for flights in and out 
of Orange County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's country-wide sale was started by Northwest Airlines,  
the nation's fourth-largest air carrier. Northwest formally 
announced the fare changes on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, the nation's largest carrier, and No. 2  
American Airlines were among those matching the sale, which 
includes most of the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty much systemwide,'' said American spokesman Tim  
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Other airlines offering the discounts include U.S. Airways,  
America West, Continental, Trans World Airlines and Delta Air 
Lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest said the discounts would remain in effect for travel  
to most destinations through Dec. 17. Advance purchase is required, 
a 14-day maximum stay applies to most destinations and tickets must 
be purchased by Aug. 13. A Saturday night stay is required and 
tickets are nonrefundable. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fare examples include an off-peak fare of $354 roundtrip  
from New York to Dallas-Fort Worth with a 14-day advance purchase. 
That's compared to an everyday rate of $472, according to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago to San Francisco roundtrip, advance purchase, off-peak  
price would be $446, compared to an everyday price of $594, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many international flights were announced as part of the sale as  
well, but those discounts have actually been available for more 
than a week, according Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only place I've seen any difference is to Asia,'' said  
Parsons. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the Asian discounts differ slightly from the domestic  
fare cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Discounts of up to 25 percent mean some tickets are at the  
lowest level this year even though the base price has risen by 11 
percent in 1999. Airlines have been under pricing pressure as they 
add planes to their fleets and additional seats become available. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analyst Holly Hegeman with PlaneBusiness, an Internet  
site that focuses on the airline industry, attributes this sale to 
the additional space made available. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much capacity is the culprit. Airlines are obviously  
looking ahead at bookings, seeing weak books in many cases, and so 
they are lowering the fares in an attempt to at least fill seats at 
some fare level,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Banned Priest Forges Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Although he has agreed to stop ministering to  
gays and lesbians, the Rev. Robert Nugent disagrees with the 
Vatican's portrayal of his ministry as harmful to the Catholic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to bring the experience of gays and lesbians to  
the rest of the church,'' Nugent said in a recent interview with 
The Associated Press. ``We've been trying to build a positive 
understanding of homosexual orientation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent and Sister Jeannine Gramick -- the founders of New Ways  
Ministry -- last month were barred from ministering to homosexuals 
by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation said Nugent and Gramick ``have caused confusion  
among the Roman Catholic people and have harmed the community of 
the church.'' It called their teachings ``erroneous and 
dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gay rights groups said the two repeatedly refused to condemn  
homosexual acts as evil and instead strove for reconciliation for 
gays with the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent at first refused to talk about the decision, saying in a  
statement he accepted it with heavy heart. Last week, he agreed to 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Gramick has refused to talk about the decision, saying in a  
statement that she is ``anguished and deeply troubled'' at being 
barred from her ministry. She is taking a month's leave from her 
ministerial commitments to decide whether she will obey the 
Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent met Gramick in 1971, after reading about her work with  
gays and lesbians in Philadelphia. After receiving a letter of 
encouragement from Nugent, Gramick asked him to meet with some men 
who wanted to speak with a priest. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I found was people who loved the church very much. It was  
their family, their home,'' he said. ``But they felt like the 
church didn't want them. There was a great love-hate 
relationship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They founded the New Ways Ministry in 1977 to ``promote justice  
and reconciliation of gays and lesbians.'' Their efforts led to 
seminars as well as books and pamphlets on homosexuality and the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
	Their work also attracted scrutiny from the church hierarchy.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, Nugent and Gramick were told their case was being  
investigated by a commission which forwarded its recommendations in 
1994 to the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith. The panel sent 
several inquiries to Nugent and Gramick, probing their beliefs on 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to ban their ministry was not made lightly, said  
Cardinal James A. Hickey, archbishop of Washington, D.C., the 
diocese where the independent New Ways Ministry is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Hickey said earlier this month that Nugent and Gramick were  
``given numerous opportunities over the past 20 years to clarify 
their beliefs and to assent to the church's full teaching on 
homosexuality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the church teaches that homosexual acts are evil, it also  
says that homosexuals should be treated with ``respect, compassion 
and sensitivity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said he doesn't dissent from the core teachings on  
homosexuality, but with the church's language. 
</P>
<P>
	``I spent 25 years telling homosexuals that the church cares for  
you, that it wants you to have a part in it,'' Nugent said. ``How 
can I talk to them and convince them of that if I use language like 
evil, depravity and disorder?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent said the church focuses too much on homosexuals' acts,  
rather than their spirituality. With the New Ways Ministry, Nugent 
and Gramick focused on gays and lesbians as Catholics first, and 
homosexuals second. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to obey the Vatican order was excruciating, but  
Nugent said the stakes were too high -- disobedience would have led 
to dismissal from the Catholic community. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been a priest for almost 35 years,'' he said. ``I've been  
happy as a priest and I don't think I could give that up, it's such 
a part of me. It's who I am.''

<HEADLINE> Mind-Gym Exercises the Gray Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The struggles of late-middle age can be summarized simply: ``A  
waist is a terrible thing to mind, and a mind is a terrible thing 
to waste.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the only jeans that fit carry the Wide Load label, maybe it's  
time for the gym. But if you write notes as memory aids and find 
yourself forgetting where you put the notes, maybe it's time for 
Mind-Gym, a program from Simon &AMP; Schuster Interactive that might 
help strengthen that muscle between your ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Mind-Gym is a series of mental exercises delivered by a  
``personal trainer'' with an amusing, sarcastic attitude and a 
British accent. (The program won the British Academy of Film and 
Television Arts award for best comedy CD.) 
</P>
<P>
	First stop is the Changing Room, where a series of challenges  
are posed to assess your mental strengths and weaknesses. I need to 
be more open-minded, the software decided (apparently on its own, 
since there was no evidence of contact between my wife and Simon &AMP; 
Schuster Interactive). It also rates you on accepting or 
challenging information, experimental inclinations, and being 
pro-active and empowered. 
</P>
<P>
	That assessment in hand, the software offers three areas for  
mental exercise: the Pool of Ideas, Think Tank and Game Room. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pool of Ideas has five areas that encourage creative  
thinking, the Think Tank focuses on implementing ideas, and the 
Game Room hones memory, word and number skills, and visual and 
spatial skills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Personal Trainer comments -- and not always favorably -- about  
your performance, in the approximate tone of a teen-ager explaining 
life to a parent. The temptation is to dismiss the exercises as 
mindlessly easy, a temptation that promptly disappears after you 
see your first performance review. 
</P>
<P>
	The program prompts you to log in, and each subsequent session  
is different from the first, with more difficult challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The graphics in Mind-Gym are nicely done and the user interface  
is clean and intuitive. Installation was easy enough, although the 
developers chose not to have the CD auto-install, a mental lapse 
that surely would draw acid comment from that ``personal trainer.'' 
The developers did include an uninstall program module, so they get 
points for that. (Yes, Windows has add-remove software, and 
sometimes it even works, but having the program uninstall itself 
usually works better.) 
</P>
<P>
	System requirements for Mind-Gym are very modest: a 486 chip,  
doublespeed CD-ROM drive, eight megabytes of RAM, 16-bit sound 
card, 256-color SVGA display and Windows 3.1.1, 95 or 98. (Anything 
new that runs on Windows 3.x is pretty rare these days.) 
</P>
<P>
	The software is rated for teens and older by the Entertainment  
System Review Board, but the raciest thing about it is the cover 
art, which features a balding nerd type, eyeglass frames taped 
together, who is sitting in a locker room in his briefs. So don't 
worry. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated street price of Mind-Gym is $29.95. Simon &AMP;  
Schuster Interactive products are widely available at retail.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Williams Back After 2 Seasons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Brian Williams doesn't talk about his right  
eye unless asked. 
</P>
<P>
	It's part of the past and the veteran New York Giants' center  
would like to keep it there. He would rather focus on the present, 
the 1999 season, his first since a freak training camp injury to 
the eye almost ended his career two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 33, still has trouble seeing when he glances down.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the only outward sign of the injury is the tinted visor  
on the front of Williams' facemask that protects his eyes, both 
from fingers and the glare that bothers him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a miracle,'' said guard Ron Stone, Williams' roommate.  
``He was pretty much done, but he wasn't ready to leave the game. 
He fought hard and he came back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Williams missed the start of last season, few gave him a  
chance of returning. The double vision that resulted from being 
poked in the eye by teammate Bernard Holsey in the opening days of 
training camp in 1997 just wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Giants' 1989 first-round draft pick wasn't willing  
to give up. He underwent a second surgery in October and it worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, there was just nothing in my future that I saw that  
was very bright,'' Williams said. ``Being a football player was not 
even in my mind. I'm here (now) and it's time to get beat up again 
and get sore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Giants really want Williams to succeed. Before he was hurt,  
he was viewed by the coaching staff as one of the NFL's top centers 
and the glue of the offensive line. Not only did he make all the 
line calls, he was the veteran influence who made five players work 
as a unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jim Fassel was reminded of that on the opening day of camp  
Friday. The offensive coaches told him that Williams reminded the 
line ``no offsides'' on the first day of workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	There weren't any.  
</P>
<P>
	When free-agent center Emmett Zitelli seemed confused walking to  
a drill, there was Williams ready to explain things to him. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the centers of attention in the camp, Williams is doing  
his best to downplay his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I am thinking about is just improving,''  
Williams said. ``I'm here and I'm glad and I guess I forget about 
everything that happened in the past. I just want to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams isn't taking anything for granted. Even though he has  
been penciled in as the starting center, he feels he has to prove 
himself again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Scott, who started the last two years, has been moved to  
left guard to take over the spot that opened when Greg Bishop 
signed with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barring another injury somewhere, I think he is the guy,'' new  
line coach Jim McNally said. ``I don't think he is going to 
disappoint us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides a few new techniques McNally installed for linemen, the  
most difficult thing for Williams to deal with has been the face 
shield. It keeps in the heat, fogs up and it makes it hard to 
breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also never coming off, Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the preseason will show a lot to me,'' Williams said.  
``You can only do so much in preseason. You have to play games and 
go against different people to see how your skills come back.''

<HEADLINE> Hillary: Clinton Scarred by Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton says her husband was  
``scarred by abuse'' as a four-year-old boy. It was not physical 
abuse, a White House spokesman said Monday, but ``difficulties 
within his family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither President Clinton nor Mrs. Clinton elaborated on the  
first lady's remarks in an interview with Talk magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton blamed her husband's infidelity on a desire to  
please women that can be traced to his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so young, barely 4, when he was scarred by abuse. There  
was a terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother,'' Mrs. 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A psychologist once told me that for a boy being in the middle  
of a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation,'' 
she said. ``There is always a desire to please each one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Explaining the remark about abuse, presidential spokesman Joe  
Lockhart said: ``Take that for what it should mean, which is there 
were difficulties in his family, he faced issues that were hard on 
him, they were hard on his family. These are all well documented. 
There is nothing new here. ... It is simply a reflection on his 
life, which is not unique. There are many people who face issues 
like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's mother, Virginia Kelley, who died in 1994,  
described tensions in the president's family. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book, ``Leading with My Heart,'' Kelley said her mother,  
Edith Valeria Grisham Cassidy, was outraged when Kelley said she 
planned to marry Roger Clinton -- husband No. 2 -- and tried to get 
legal custody of young Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``To her mind, Roger Clinton wasn't fit to be under the same  
roof with Bill, and she said she was going to stop the possibility 
of it if she could,'' Kelley wrote. ``I had seen my mother do some 
crazy things but this went beyond anything she had ever even 
approached before. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was actually announcing that she was willing to rip this  
family apart. ... I screamed that the only way she was going to get 
my child was over my dead body,'' Kelley said. ``I clutched Bill, 
who was four years old. I probably thought he was too young to be 
seriously affected by even such scenes as this, but I was dead 
wrong, of course. Forty-one years later, during the presidential 
campaign, I would be flabbergasted to hear some of what he 
remembered about his early life in Hope. I don't know whether or 
not he remembers this part.''

<HEADLINE> Nelson Closer To Rejoining Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Nelson moved a step closer to rejoining  
the New York Yankees' bullpen Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The right-hander threw one perfect inning in a Gulf Coast League  
game during his first rehab appearance following elbow surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was surprised,'' said Nelson, who struck out one and  
recorded two groundball outs against the Lakeland Tigers. ``I felt 
good. I never judge myself in the bullpen. I judge myself with a 
hitter in there. You get more locked in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All six pitches Nelson threw were strikes. His fastball reached  
92 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson is scheduled to make three more rehab starts in Florida  
this week.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Torn About Mariners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. says he hasn't made up his mind  
if he's going or staying with the Seattle Mariners, refuting a 
statement apparently made by his father in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got full control of my future,'' the Mariners' slugger  
said before Monday night's game with Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I want to sign, I'll sign. If I don't want to sign, I won't  
sign. My father and I are not joined at the hip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey responded to a story in Sunday's editions of the Dayton  
Daily News. The story said the Mariners were in a mood to fire 
manager Lou Piniella and replace him with Ken Griffey Sr., 
Griffey's father who is the bench coach for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper quoted Griffey's father as saying: ``That might be  
the only way to keep Junior. He said he's gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey said he talked to his father on the telephone Monday and  
his dad denied making those comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you think my dad would say anything like that?'' Griffey  
said. ``My dad's been in baseball how many years? He knows what to 
say and what not to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It not only puts me in an awkward situation, it puts Lou and  
my dad in awkward situations,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey Sr. was the batting coach for the Mariners in 1993,  
Piniella's first season in Seattle as its manager. He also played 
with his son in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dayton Daily News said Griffey, 29, had been offered three  
contract extensions by the Mariners, including the latest one for 
eight years and $135 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey tried to defuse the controversy that the Dayton story  
had created in Seattle. But he also displayed a little bit of 
attitude before dressing for the opener of the Tampa Bay series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why are you worried about me?'' Griffey asked a group of  
reporters. ``It's my future and my decision. When it's time to make 
it, I'll make it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll make my decision when it's time. Is there a timetable?  
No. Whenever I feel like I'm comfortable with my decision. When I 
make my decision, I'll make my decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey helped the Mariners win AL West titles in 1995 and 1997,  
but the Mariners finished third in their division last season and 
are third in the West again this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was important that the Mariners field a winning team  
and that he get to a World Series before his career was finished. 
He also said it was important that the Mariners keep three-time 
All-Star shortstop Alex Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the contracts of Rodriguez, 24, and Griffey run through the  
2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would factor into my decision,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He has steadfastly refused to comment on the Mariners' new home,  
Safeco Field. He apparently is unhappy with the new ballpark 
because he thinks it will cut down on his home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm supposed to make a decision on 11 games,'' Griffey said,  
referring to the number of games he had played at Safeco before 
Monday night's contest.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Pitcher May Be Defecting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The reservations for Sydney can be  
made. The United States will be sending a baseball team to the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	So will Cuba, but, according to sports agent Joe Cubas, it will  
be without pitcher Danys Baez. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubas, who has been involved in the defections of many Cuban  
ballplayers, said in a press release today that Baez left the team 
Sunday night after it beat Canada 3-2 in the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Baez's defection would bring to eight the number of Cubans to  
leave that nation's delegation to the games. 
</P>
<P>
	What a trip it has already been for a hastily formed team of  
minor leaguers not on major league 40-man rosters. On Sunday, they 
qualified their country for the 2000 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	International baseball, as they have found, has a different  
flavor. And when the game is played in a single-elimination format, 
the pressure is intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``What an experience!'' U.S. manager Buddy Bell said, near tears  
after a 2-1, 10-inning win over Mexico on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Americans have one more goal before leaving the games,  
and that one is gold. They can get that by beating world champion 
Cuba tonight for the second time in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	But, realistically, their major mission, winning an Olympic  
berth -- even though many of the same players may not be on the team 
that goes to Australia -- has been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	The hero of the victory over Mexico was 29-year-old Mike Neill,  
who has spent most of his career in the minors, save six games with 
Oakland last year. The Pan Am Games mark the first time the United 
States has used professional players -- all minor leaguers -- in an 
international competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, I had a major arm injury and made it to the big  
leagues. That was a long road back and finally getting there was an 
individual thing,'' said Neill, who drove in the go-ahead run with 
a pinch-hit single. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far better as a team member, representing your  
country and trying to get USA baseball into the Olympics. I think 
we were a little tight. But it's awesome playing for your country 
and then getting the big hit to help the team win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With one out in top of the 10th, Marcus Jensen, America's top  
hitter in the tournament, doubled off the first-base bag. After a 
strikeout, Neill hit a 3-2 pitch for a run-scoring single off 
former major league pitcher Vicente Palacios. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wheeler, who pitched well in a 10-5 win over Cuba in the  
preliminary round, got the victory. The right-hander from Triple-A 
Durham pitched a perfect four innings in relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wow,'' he said after the Americans swarmed the mound in  
celebration when Wheeler got the final out. ``This is one of the 
things that we needed to do. But I want a gold medal and now we 
have that chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba edged host, using a three-run homer from star Omar Linares  
and strong relief pitching by Jose Ibar, who lost his edge in the 
ninth after a protester ran on the field with a sign ``Human Right 
First.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Cuban players, including two carrying their country's  
flag, chased the protester before he was finally knocked down by 
second baseman Juan Padilla and taken away by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Sunday night, police said four members of the Cuban  
delegation were involved in a fight with the protester. The fight 
occurred at 10:30 p.m. in the center of the city outside the 
offices of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, acting duty 
inspector Paul Ingram of the Winnipeg City Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A shaken Ibar then gave up a single, threw a wild pitch and  
walked a batter before reliever Luis Lazo struck out the final two 
hitters, setting off an on-field celebration. Canada had routed 
Cuba 8-1 in the preliminries, but all a 5-1 record gets the 
Canadians is a shot at the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian roller hockey goalie Steve Vezina failed a doping test  
and his team was stripped of its gold medal. Vezina, who plays ice 
hockey for the Utah Grizzlies of the IHL and also is a professional 
roller hockey player, tested positive for two stimulants and ``an 
enormously high level'' of an anabolic steroid. It was the first 
doping incident at these games. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, which lost 7-6 to Canada in the gold medal  
game, was awarded the championship, with Argentina moving up to 
second and Brazil to third. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was foolish and he made a mistake,'' Pan American Sports  
Organization president Mario Vazquez Rana said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unfortunate,'' teammate Jeff Leiter said. ``What he did  
hurts all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The drug test showed three banned substances: ephedrine,  
pseudo-ephedrine and Nandrolone. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are 
stimulants used to avoid fatigue. Nandrolone is an anabolic steroid 
that increases muscle mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Vezina said at his drug test that he had taken Sudafed prior to  
competition. Many hockey players use Sudafed as an energy boost, 
and it is not banned in professional ice hockey leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It comes as a big shock ... Steve is not an abuser of anabolic  
steroids,'' said his coach with the Buffalo Wings of Roller Hockey 
International, which does not have a substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until we have a chance to gather all of the facts and speak to  
everyone involved, Steve Vezina is scheduled to be in goal Friday 
against Dallas,'' Wings vice president of operations Benny Gulakiw 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Juana  
Rosario, the winner of the women's high jump, tested positive for 
illegal substances. The CBC said her A sample came out postive and 
now her B-sample must be tested. If it comes back positive as well, 
she would be stripped of her medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Games officials would not comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Three more Cuban athletes defected this weekend before Baez's  
reported departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Sunday, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officials confirmed  
that an athlete had sought asylum and was turned over to 
immigration authorities. Sources close to the Cuban team, on the 
condition they not be identified, said the athlete was from Cuba's 
4 x 100 track relay squad, but would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	The others were a soccer goalkeeper -- the goalies were Rene  
Castro, who played every minute in the games, and Rodney Valdes -- 
and a female artistic gymnast. 
</P>
<P>
	Both U.S. basketball teams won Sunday, but the women then fell  
77-72 to Brazil this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after their worst loss ever at the Pan Ams, the U.S. women  
awoke early Sunday and beat the Dominican Republic 92-80 to clinch 
a berth in the medals round. The women had lost to Cuba 95-64. 
</P>
<P>
	The American men edged Brazil 73-71. Travis Williams made a  
layup with 22 seconds left for the go-ahead basket and Doug Smith 
followed with a key block. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States beat the Dominican Republic in three sets for  
the women's bronze medal in volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. swimming team got off to a rousing start today, led by  
Ed Moses. He set a Pan Ams record of 1:01.06 in the preliminaries 
of the men's 100-meter breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
	Moses, a freshman at Virginia, shattered the record of 1:02.28  
by Steve Lundquist in 1983. Moses' time was the second-fastest ever 
by an American. 
</P>
<P>
	All other U.S. swimmers in the prelims also qualified for  
tonight's finals.
