FAVORITES RUSH THROUGH TO THE FOURTH ROUND  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The favorites at the U.S. Open, hustled through their
paces by some tricky wind currents, took care of business with such
dispatch Saturday that eighth-seeded Andre Agassi was not ready
when he received the call for his third-round match with Davide
Sanguinetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both matches combined were like an hour and 15 minutes _
phenomenal,'' said Agassi, whose match was the third and last of
the day session in Arthur Ashe Stadium. ``I felt rather rushed; I
didn't enjoy that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At the grizzled tennis age of 28, Agassi no longer finds it fun
to operate in fifth gear on command, which he had to do Saturday in
part because of fifth-seeded Venus Williams' 13-minute, 5-0 defeat
of an injured Larisa Neiland of Latvia.
</P>
<P>
   But Agassi suited and sneakered up in a flurry and disposed of
the 50th-ranked Italian Sanguinetti in such a hurry himself, 6-2,
6-3, 6-0, that the main stadium was left without a feature match by
midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In response, 15th-seeded Anna Kournikova was rerouted from the
subsidiary stage at Louis Armstrong Stadium. The change suited the
teen-age diva so well that she pranced through her third-round
encounter with another Italian, the 26-year-old Silvia Farina, 6-4,
6-1, to secure a Round of 16 berth against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Kournikova's childhood sparring partner, the 18-year-old Russian
Marat Safin, had to settle for an assignment at the old stadium,
but he too disposed of an elder, vanquishing Thomas Muster by 6-4,
6-4, 1-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Muster, a former No. 1 player, is now 30 years old and ranked
23rd. The 60th-ranked Safin, whose powerful game has inspired
predictions that he could hit No. 1, was more attuned to the madcap
pace that defined Saturday's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely playing on a very good level already, and I
think he can still improve a lot of things,'' Muster said. ``If he
keeps improving the bad things he has in his game, he will be even
more dangerous than now.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day that put a premium on fast play, last year's runner-up,
sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski, did himself no favors by venturing into
an interminable five-setter for the third consecutive round.
Rusedski's confrontation with another big-serving lefty,
21st-ranked Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, began before sunset
but ended 3 hours 22 minutes later under the spotlights with a 4-6,
6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 decision in Siemerink's favor. Rusedski, who had
saved three match points in the two previous rounds and saved three
more last night, hit just 10 aces, the same as his challenger, and
converted only 3 of 15 break chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, looking at his body language, that he was getting a
little tired,'' said Siemerink, who won with an ace on his fourth
match point. ``Once the sun was going down and the lights were on,
it was more in my favor than his.''.
</P>
<P>
   If Agassi was cranky before his match, he snapped out of it
after zipping toward a fourth-round encounter with ninth-seeded
Karol Kucera of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   If Agassi defeats Kucera, it could set up a quarterfinal with
Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to get down to what for him has often been the risky
business of surviving the Open's first week, Goran Ivanisevic
clocked in early for the main stadium's first match.
</P>
<P>
   He was there long enough before his 7-6 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4
dismissal of Paul Haarhuis to check his mailbox, and there he found
some unusual hardware _ a shiny, suggestive early birthday present
from a female fan that drew a locker room crowd. Among the
onlookers was Ivanisevic's opponent for the Round of 16, the Open's
defending champion, Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic turns 27 next Sunday, the date the Open will crown a
men's champion. Given a choice of birthday gifts, Ivanisevic, who
is not quite resigned to being the best player never to win a Grand
Slam event, would choose the men's title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of the question I've been hearing for the last six
or seven years, always the same question, and always the same
stupid answer,'' the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic said after firing 21
aces against Haarhuis. ``I know I'm maybe the best player never to
win a Grand Slam, but I'm trying. There's a chance I can win this
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic's first task is to stop fighting the man in the
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when I have to play against both me and the other
guy,'' said Ivanisevic of his history of self-destructive behavior
at the Grand Slams, particularly here at the Open, where he lost in
the first round in three of his last four appearances. ``But,
lately, I'm playing most of the time against the other guy, not
against myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After putting an end to a five-match losing streak against the
32-year-old Haarhuis, Ivanisevic claimed to be playing so well at
the Open that he intends to use serves, volleys and passing shots
to handcuff his pal Rafter. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's maybe the best I've ever played at the U.S. Open,''
Ivanisevic said of his form through three rounds, ``but it doesn't
mean anything. He's confident, I'm confident, but somebody has to
win, so it's going to be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic defeated Rafter at Wimbledon in their only prior
meeting. ``I'm pretty confident in my head, but sometimes I get a
little bit messed up there, I have to bang it, then everything
comes together,'' Ivanisevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter prides himself on being a clear-headed competitor. Since
receiving a scare when he opened his title defense by scrambling
out of a five-set trap laid for him by Hicham Arazi, the Rafter has
cruised through the subsequent rounds in straight sets. His
66-minute demolition of the South African David Nainkin Saturday
was representative of Rafter's Open game plan. ``You want to get on
and get off the court as quick as you possibly can, conserve your
energy,'' Rafter said after doing just that in a 6-1, 6-1, 6-1
victory, his quickest ever at a Grand Slam.

DONOR OFFERS $1 MILLION TO FAN WHO CATCHES HOME RUN BALL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A donor who asked to remain anonymous has offered to arrange
payments totaling $1 million to the fan who catches the 62nd home
run ball by Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa to help in the continuing
search for justice in the 1980 murders of three American nuns and a
lay worker in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to raise awareness,'' the donor, a longtime baseball
fan, said on Saturday in a telephone interview, ``and what better
way to publicize the cause than to tie it to the home run derby? I
hope when sportscasters talk about the money, they'll also talk
about the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The donor, who says he wants to protect his identity because he
fears for his safety, will buy a $650,000 annuity that will pay the
fan $50,000 annually for 20 years. His plans are to resell the
ball, and any profits above $650,000 will go to the Lawyers
Committee for Human Rights, a New York-based organization that
represents the victims' families and promotes human rights around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no profit, the donor has guaranteed to make a
$75,000 donation. He said he would make the same donation even if
the fan declined to sell the ball and gave it to McGwire or Sosa or
donated it to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The donor said he had followed the case and was particularly
outraged that two Salvadoran officers implicated by a U.N. Truth
Commission report for covering up the murders were never
prosecuted, and live in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, four Salvadoran National Guard members and their
immediate superior were convicted of the murders and sentenced to
30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, three of the five were released. The Truth Commission
found that Gen. Jose Guillermo Garcia and Col. Carlos Eugenio Vides
Casanova, the two officers now living in Florida, organized and
directed the cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, the four former national guardsmen said they acted
only after receiving ``orders from above.'' They made their
admissions during interviews with R. Scott Greathead and Robert
Weiner, members of the Lawyers Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``These officers _ you can't prove they ordered the murders, but
they covered it up, and now they're living comfortably,'' the donor
said. ``Everybody I talk to is outraged by all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The donor approached the Lawyers Committee on Thursday, and the
committee spent Saturday investigating him and his ability to pay
for the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's what he says he is,'' Great-head said. The donor's lawyer
is Elaine Wood of Kroll Associates, a private investigation and
security firm. She said the donor's background and finances checked
out ``affirmatively.''

RED SOX AREN'T SPARED BY CLEMENS'S STRIKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ You tell yourself it's just a three-game losing
streak, something the Red Sox haven't had since they dropped four
straight to the Orioles coming out of the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   But you look at the schedule _ winless Pete Schourek Sunday,
followed by three games with the Yankees in the Fens _ and you feel
all the signs coming on.
</P>
<P>
   The dry throat. The night sweats. The nervous cough. And you
notice all your neighbors have the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Even your doctor knows better than to call it the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Not in September. Not when the Red Sox are kicking away their
comfort zone in a playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   Not when Rocket Roger Clemens allowed three hits and struck out
11 as the surging Blue Jays won their ninth in a row Saturday, 4-3,
to climb within six games of the Red Sox in the wild-card race, and
the best the Sox can offer as a comeback Sunday is a Kramer
lookalike who has been in five games since he joined the team, all
losses.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has now won 13 decisions in a row and is 18-6 after
overtaking Pedro Martinez for the league lead in strikeouts and
lowering his league-best ERA to 2.62. Given his firsthand knowledge
as a former citizen of Red Sox Nation, he was asked if the Blue
Jays have stirred some anxiety in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask each player that,'' he said. ``Depends how
thick their skin is.''
</P>
<P>
   How about his skittish old fans? ``I don't worry about them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official line in the Red Sox clubhouse, not surprisingly, is
not to worry. They have 22 games left, and while they have lost
seven of their last 10, Texas lost to Minnesota Saturday night and
remains 6 1/2 games behind Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, so we gave them a little hope,'' said losing
pitcher Bret Saberhagen, who gave up three tape-measure home runs
in the first three innings, each one achieving a higher altitude
than its predecessor until Jose Canseco pushed the top button on
the elevator and got off on the fifth deck of the SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not concerned with (the Blue Jays),'' said
Saberhagen, who gave up hits in all six innings he pitched but no
more runs. ``I'm concerned with Texas. They have an easier
schedule. The Blue Jays have won nine in a row, or whatever it is.
They still need a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got to play New York, Cleveland, Baltimore. They've
got their work cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   By any measure _ throwing a fastball into Nomar Garciaparra's
ribs, buzzing another past Mike Stanley's head, striking out John
Valentin three times _ Clemens showed the Red Sox no quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was the last batter Clemens faced before coming out
after eight innings. On that last at-bat, his first three pitches
to the Sox shortstop were measured at 99, 98, and 97 miles per hour
on the radar gun. Garciaparra tapped out to third to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the gun had,'' said Blue Jays catcher Darrin
Fletcher, ``but I think he pumped in a few at 100, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox did end the Rocket's scoreless streak at 33 innings
when they scored twice in the fifth inning on two walks, Darren
Lewis's soft single, and a wild pitch. But no other Sox player
advanced as far as third against Clemens, who allowed only Mike
Benjamin's opposite-field double in the third and Mo Vaughn's
leadoff single in the sixth in addition to Lewis's hit.
</P>
<P>
   Both Saberhagen and Clemens were gone when the Blue Jays scored
the deciding run in the eighth, Tony Fernandez (4 for 4) hitting a
two-out double off lefthanded reliever Greg Swindell and scoring on
Fletcher's bloop single. That run loomed larger when Troy O'Leary
led off the ninth against Blue Jays reliever Dan Plesac with his
23d home run.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's home runs were dwarfed by the three the Jays hit off
Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green hit an 0-and-2 fastball that Saberhagen misdirected
over the heart of the plate 405 feet over the center-field fence.
Blue Jays, 1-0, two Toronto batters into the game. Four batters in,
it was 2-0, Jays, as Carlos Delgado golfed one 413 feet into the
second deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve batters in, Canseco turned on a fastball down and in and
hit it 451 feet into the fifth deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dug the team a hole early, and with Roger in such a groove
lately, I made it tough on the team,'' Saberhagen said. ``But we
played well all day. We battled back.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days earlier, Canseco was interviewed by a crew from
the Discovery Channel, seeking some insights about McGwire, his
former teammate. What scientific explanation would he have offered
for his home run Saturday? ``I hit the ball real good,'' he said
with a smile, then elaborated. ``It ran in on me, but I told myself
just be quick with my hands. My first motion was with the bat down
toward the ball instead of my body drifting forward.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it's the Red Sox who are drifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We competed good, that's all you can ask,'' said
steady-as-she-goes Jimy Williams. ``We're fine, we really are.''
</P>
<P>
   The next episode is up to Kramer.

CLEMENS'S CY MISSION TAKING FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It didn't match what he did in Boston last July.
There's no way it could.
</P>
<P>
   There can only be one first time for Roger Clemens pitching
against his former team in the ballpark he once ruled, striking out
16, transforming boos to cheers, and pointing at John Harrington in
the owner's box as he came off the mound, defiant and triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   But that should not diminish what Clemens accomplished here
Saturday in the SkyDome, where the Cy Young Award took an
unmistakable tilt to the north.
</P>
<P>
   By winning his 13th straight decision Saturday in a 4-3 win over
the Red Sox, Clemens now has as many wins as Pedro Martinez, 18.
His earned run average is lower (2.62 to 2.71), his strikeout total
is higher (227 to 219), and though he has more losses than Martinez
(6 to 4), he hasn't lost since May 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox ended Clemens's streak of consecutive scoreless
innings at a club-record 33, but he dismissed that with a shrug. In
the big picture, that won't keep him from adding an unprecedented
fifth Cy Young Award to his mantle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about the shutout situation,'' said Clemens,
who had spun three shutouts in a row until the Red Sox broke
through with two runs in the fifth on two walks, Darren Lewis's
single, and a wild pitch. ``You expect those things to come to an
end when you throw the ball over the plate to good hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Clemens struck out the first two batters he faced,
Lewis and John Valentin. He struck out Mo Vaughn and Nomar
Garciaparra back-to-back in the fourth, struck out Scott Hatteberg
and Valentin again in the fifth, struck out the side in the seventh
(Hatteberg, Mike Benjamin and Lewis), and made old friend Vaughn
the last of his 11 strikeout victims.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, who also whiffed in the third, struck out three times
against Clemens before flying out in his final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you something,'' he said. ``It's really exciting to
be able to face him. We're friends, he played with us so long, but
all that goes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be honest with you. I came out and felt really good. I
was really determined to do well against him, but he's just too
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin said he decided to be aggressive against Clemens, even
with two strikes. ``I went after him,'' he said. ``I didn't care
how many strikes I got. But he saw that, and he threw me some
(split-fingered) fastballs. He got me all three times on splits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy's throwing 95 miles an hour, then he throws you
some 90-mile-an-hour splits that are falling off the table, that's
hard to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens hit Nomar Garciaparra with an 0-and-2 fastball in the
ribs in the second inning. Two batters later, he buzzed Mike
Stanley's head with a fastball. Purpose pitches?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' he said. ``I was strong early, and I overthrew a
couple of pitches. The one to Stan-o, I'm glad it missed him.
Nomar, I was trying to get a fastball in. You don't want to miss
inside with Nomar.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he doubted there was malice aforethought. ``He
had me 0-and-2,'' he said. ``I don't think he's looking to hit me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a smart pitcher who understands when you try to move
your feet (in the batters' box),'' Valentin said. ``He's not
wanting to hit Nomar or Stanley. But he is telling us, I think I
can come inside, and I have the right to come inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a bully. He doesn't go out to bully people.''

SOSA SLAMS 58TH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ His name is Sean Lawrence and he pitches for the
Pirates. Make sure you spell the name correctly. Very soon, it will
be scrawled into a record book. But Lawrence can take solace in
this: His name will not be there in isolation; there have been
dozens of pitchers who have done what he did Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, already behind in the count, 3 and 1,
Lawrence decided to challenge Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa with
what most people would call a pitch. It wasn't. It was more like a
juicy cantaloupe traveling toward home plate. A few seconds later,
Sosa was strolling around the bases after watching the attempted
fastball travel 417 feet over the right-field fence. It wasn't long
before Lawrence was in the clubhouse, the losing pitcher in an 8-4
Cubs win at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame in this. The home run was Sosa's 58th of the
season. At least Lawrence tried to pitch to the slugger. Sosa said
he and Mark McGwire appreciate the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, what difference does it make?'' he said of the
pitch-around philosophy. ``We're almost there. There's been no more
pitching around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's homer once again satisfied a crowd that was interested in
seeing two things: the Pirates' Fireworks Night promotion and a
Sosa home run. The 37,711 people here got both, watching the home
team lose its eighth game in a row. (One Pirate fan had the right
idea, waving a white towel in the seventh inning when Abraham Nunez
made two errors on one play and three in the inning.)
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is two home runs behind leader McGwire and three away from
touching Roger Maris's magical 61. But you get the feeling that the
new untouchable number will be somewhere in the 70s by the time
Sosa and McGwire finish assaulting National League skies with home
runs. They meet  &UR; tomorrow &LR;  in St. Louis. When that series is
finished, we may be long beyond discussion of No. 62 and on to
``How High Can They Go?'' Saturday night, Sosa excited the crowd in
the ninth inning by blasting a shot into the upper deck in left
field. It was foul.
</P>
<P>
   After the cheering, homering and weddings were over _ a couple
exchanged vows at the stadium _ Sosa had a prediction. He said
McGwire will break Maris's record &UR;  &LR; Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said. ``I hit one (Saturday night), so ...''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a reference to the point-counterpoint homer
game the two seem to be playing. Sosa hits one. McGwire hits one.
Or two. And the questions keep coming, in a couple languages.
Saturday night there were interview requests in Spanish as well as
English.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has no problem with any of this. A few hours before
receiving his nightly standing ovation, he told everyone how he has
maintained his sanity during what has become an obsessive home run
watch. His secret? He's smooth. That's what he says. Someone asked
him how he is able to sit down before the game and giggle for 15 or
20 minutes. How is he able to do that when McGwire seems to brood
at times?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit more easy guy,'' Sosa said. ``I'm a little
bit more Rico Suave.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused for a second and then broke into laughter after that
one. Many will remember Suave as the quirky, one-hit wonder of
1980s pop music. He was also known for his exaggerated hipness. So
maybe Sosa doesn't want to be associated with him, since his cool
seems to come more naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is me,'' he said. ``When people are waiting to talk to
me, I try to go out there and take care of everybody. I cannot
stand in Mark McGwire's shoes. I have a lot of respect for the man.
Whatever he decides to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Sosa decided to talk about the Cubs'
playoff chances. He may trail McGwire by two homers, but his team
leads the Mets by one game in the wild-card race. He was asked if
this was his best Cubs team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``I never played when Hack Wilson was here.''
</P>
<P>
   He talked all day and night, really. Earlier in the evening, he
went to the field and saw hundreds of fans lining a rail on the
visitors' side of the batting cage. Each of them had a different
technique, trying to persuade Sosa to sign a pennant, a hat, a
ball. Some spoke to him in Spanish. Some waved Dominican flags. One
man put his young son over his head and had him lean over the
shoulder of someone in the front row.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa approached the group and signed for a few minutes. He gave
the crowd what it wanted then and did it again in the sixth inning.

BC'S OPENING ACT GOES OVER WELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the withering heat of Dixie, they soared to
wuthering heights.
</P>
<P>
   On a sultry, 94-degree afternoon, the Boston College Eagles
never once lost their cool and won a hotly contested 41-31 victory
over Georgia Tech in the season opener before 38,229 Saturday at
Bobby Dodd Stadium/-Grant Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles proved hotter than Georgia asphalt, withstanding the
heat the Yellow Jackets put on them with comebacks from BC leads of
17-7, 24-17, and 31-24. Thrice in the second half Georgia Tech
rallied to tie the game, but the Eagles responded with a cool and
calm offensive and defensive dissection of the Yellow Jackets. It
enabled BC to outscore its Atlantic Coast Conference hosts, 17-7,
in the decisive fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired,'' said BC coach Tom O'Brien, a weary smile creasing
his flushed face. ``It was hot out there. Was the press box
air-conditioned?''
</P>
<P>
   Told that Georgia Tech's open-air facility offered no such
amenity, O'Brien perked up. ``Oh, good,'' he said, laughing. ``I
feel better then. I feel much better.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's chipper mood was a vast improvement over a year ago,
when BC suffered a season-opening pratfall in a 28-21 loss at
Temple that was riddled with missed assignments, missed tackles,
and an overall offensive malaise. But the Eagles suffered from none
of the above Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   BC's offense rolled up 25 first downs and 491 yards of total
offense and had nary a turnover. After surrendering a season-high
303 yards rushing to Georgia Tech a year ago, BC's defense
submitted a sterling effort, holding the Yellow Jackets to 392
yards of offense, 165 rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year senior quarterback Scott Mutryn was near-perfect,
completing 16 of 26 passes for a career-high 220 yards with no
interceptions. He threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Rob
Tardio (six catches, 52 yards) that gave BC a 17-7 lead with 21
seconds to go before halftime and scored a pair of TDs on runs of 2
and 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing how, as the game progresses, you see things a lot
clearer,'' said Mutryn, who was spelled for one series in the
second quarter by sophomore Tim Hasselbeck. ``But, like I said
before, this is the most comfortable I've felt going into a season.
I just felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Brien, ``I think he did a great job. Obviously, I'm going
to argue with him on a couple of decisions here and there, but he
made no bad decisions. We had some guys open that he missed, but
for the most part he was 16 for 26 for 220 yards and that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutryn's efficient passing was complemented by the impressive
rushing effort of senior Mike Cloud, who carried 34 times for 200
yards, the second-most of his career after a 211-yard effort in a
31-24 victory over West Virginia last year. Cloud scored on a
1-yard plunge that gave BC a 10-0 lead in the second quarter, and
capped a 14-play, 80-yard drive _ BC's longest _ with a 7-yard TD
burst that gave the Eagles a 24-17 lead with 5:20 left in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably the most sound game of my career so far,''
said Cloud, who rushed for 154 of his 200 in the second half. ``I
started off the first half with some jitters and I wasn't running
like I usually run, but with the 34 carries I had I think the
coaches are going to have a lot of confidence in me the rest of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to execute a power squib kickoff with 21 seconds
left before halftime _ which put Georgia Tech in position to
strike, Joe Hamilton hitting David Powell with a 23-yard TD pass
with 8 seconds left that cut BC's lead to 17-14 _ junior kicker
John Matich atoned by tacking on field goals of 27 yards and 25
yards, the last of which broke a 31-31 tie and put the Eagles ahead
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, O'Brien had intoned that his team was going
to need more than 14 points to beat Georgia Tech after getting
thrashed, 42-14, by the Yellow Jackets last year at Chestnut Hill.
But did he ever imagine his offense was capable of putting up 41?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I always think I can score points,'' said O'Brien. ``I
didn't have 41 as a number in mind that I needed, but I'll take 41.
Whatever we needed, we needed 1 more. I think we have the weapons
to score this year, and we're going to put as much pressure on the
defense as we can.''

MOURNING A FALLEN BROTHER  
 SIBLING'S DEATH HARD ON COWBOYS SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ten months later, Dallas Cowboys safety Kenny
Wheaton's pain hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton, a Tempe McClintock High School product, still can't get
his younger brother, Derrek, off his mind. It has consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about him 24 hours a day,'' Wheaton said. ``It will be
that way as long as I'm alive. Not a day will pass by when I'm not
thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   He still gets chills thinking about the phone call he received
in Dallas on Nov. 20. It was 3 a.m., and his older brother, Robert,
called to tell him that Derrek, 19, had been murdered outside a
Phoenix convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only get three hours of sleep every night, maximum,
because of the incident,'' Wheaton said. ``I have nightmares. It's
hard for me to do anything at night except sit there and think
about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton still can't understand why his brother was gunned down.
Family members told him it was a case of mistaken identity, but
that hasn't made it any easier for Wheaton, who will be with the
Cowboys today when they open their season against the Cardinals at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a happy person,'' Wheaton said of Derrek. ``He
always had a smile on his face. His friends called him `Sunshine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my coaches at McClintock. Derrek was the best athlete of
the three. All three of us brothers were very close, as close as
any three you'd ever find.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrek, a freshman cornerback at Phoenix Community College, had
stopped for gas at a convenience store as he returned home from the
school's football banquet. He had won two defensive honors that
night and hoped to transfer to Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a page from his girlfriend, Derrek went to a pay
phone and was on the line when a car pulled through the parking
lot. Gunshots were fired, and Derrek died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a chance to run,'' Wheaton told the ``Dallas''
``Morning News.'' ``He didn't know what hit him because he had his
back turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Wheaton's frustration is that the case is unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Phoenix) police, they're so full of it. They give us the
runaround,'' Wheaton said. ``They haven't told us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police spokesman Mike McCullough said he understands the
family's frustration but said the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leads we learn of are still being worked by homicide
investigators,'' McCullough said. ``At this point, it's too early
to explain to the family as far as who, what, when and where.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members claim the police have been slow to follow up on
tips because they consider the shooting to be gang-related and
difficult to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was not the type of person to hurt a soul,''
Wheaton said. ``Anyone who knew him could vouch that he's not in
any gang.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his family isn't doing well. ``I try to help
financially,'' he said. ``I try to be there for them. As hard as it
is on the entire family, they still are supportive. They come to
the games. They'll always still be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton wears D.K.W (his brother's initials) RIP on his practice
uniform. It's written with a felt-tipped marker, but it might as
well be etched indelibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear it every practice,'' Wheaton said. ``When I need
strength, when I'm tired or when I'm down, I put my right hand on
my chest and get that strength from touching his initials.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton also has taped his brother's obituary to his locker and
carries his picture with him at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wonder how you can always be thinking about him
and focus on what you do. It's possible. I think about him every
time I'm on the field, lifting weights. I think about him in
between plays. I think about him every day, all day.'' &QL;

DOVE HUNT BRIGHTENS NEAR TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of dove season is sort of like comparing Mexican
restaurants. Some are more adventurous than others.
</P>
<P>
   The dove season opened Tuesday. My singing-chicken alarm clock
woke me at 2 a.m. At first, I thought I'd shoot it before I started
on doves. But, no, the chicken asks me to get up and dance.
Anything that asks me to dance can't be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning of the adventure. About 2:45 a.m. I
stopped at a filling station, dressed in camouflage clothing. The
attendant gave me the rooster look, so to speak, wondering if I was
some kind of nut. I obliged by acting like one.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., I was on Loop 101 heading for Interstate 10. That's
when the two cars, one chasing the other, headed toward me, pulled
onto the shoulder and pulled in front of me. That's also when I saw
the flashes. The people in the cars were shooting at each another.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned around and came back toward me. I had a shotgun
in my truck but never thought about it. All I could think about was
ramming the gas pedal and getting out of there, which I did.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on toward the Harquahala Valley, an agricultural
area west of Phoenix where doves have flourished this year.
</P>
<P>
   The host was philanthropist rancher Bill O'Brien, who was having
a charity shoot for his favorite organization _ the Wendy Paine
O'Brien Foundation, a haven for troubled youths. It's named after
his late daughter.
</P>
<P>
   We met at Tonopah Joe's Truck Stop for breakfast, then we headed
for the fields.
</P>
<P>
   The area had been scouted for doves. But this morning, the rain
was falling. The flight would be late. O'Brien had three fields in
mind. The one he picked had desert terrain on one side of the road
and a fallow crop field on the other.
</P>
<P>
   By about 5:30 a.m. we were standing in the fields. I can't
remember seeing more doves. I had my limit of 10 before 7 a.m.
Others shot their due number of shells but didn't do the same. But
by 9 a.m. we had enough for a sumptuous meal.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Michael De Maria and his staff had agreed to cook a dove
feast. He is the chief chef for Michael's Restaurant at Pinnacle
Peak Road and Pima Road. He slept in while others hunted but was
well prepared by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   All the doves we shot were small. Bruce Taubert, a deputy
director of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said that was a
good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we've had good dove reproduction,'' he said. ``These
are birds that have been bred here. It bodes well for another good
dove population next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at O'Brien's Eagle Tail Ranch _ more than 500,000 acres of
it _ chef De Maria was getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   The adobe ranch house with a Persian cooling system (a tower
that naturally evaporates water into cool air) was awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   De Maria served a fabulous salad, barley, asparagus, glazed
carrots and dove breasts cooked in juniper. It was unbelievable.
The crusty bread served with the meal was the best I've ever eaten.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he raised at least $450 for the Wendy Paine O'Brien
Foundation and perhaps a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfight aside, it was among the best experiences I've ever
had. &QL;

FORCED OVERTIME PUSHING THEM TO THE LIMIT, WORKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time his 15-year career with Albertson's stores ended,
Richard Sorrells knew the extra hours at work were taking their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come home grumping and griping _ I was stressed'' after
routinely putting in at least 10 hours of extra work a week, said
Sorrells, now a Glendale business owner. ``I've got a 4-year-old
daughter. She doesn't need to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sorrells, Americans are feeling as overworked as ever this
Labor Day. Frustrated by working too many hours _ both paid and
unpaid _ they are sometimes grabbing headlines by battling the
corporations whose profits depend on their extra work.
</P>
<P>
   From a national lawsuit filed against Albertson's grocery stores
to the recent US West strike, the number of hours spent on the job
is a flash point for employee discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with America today _ all these companies do
is look at the bottom line,'' Sorrells said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 34,000 US West employees in 13 states returned to
work after a 15-day strike protesting salaries, benefits and the
telephone giant's policy of forcing long hours of overtime work.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement hammered out over the weekend would cap
the amount of weekly overtime that phone company employees are
required to work at 16 hours next year and 8 hours in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few national statistics documenting use of
overtime or legal challenges of employer overtime policies, one of
the few measures devised by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
suggests that we are, in fact, working more overtime than we used
to.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1988, U.S. factory employees worked an average of 3.9
hours of overtime a week. By July 1998, Bureau of Labor figures
show, it was 4.8 hours a week, an increase of more than 25 percent
and near the all-time high of 4.9 set five times in 1997 and once
this year.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona survey of local communications and public utilities
industries found employees working an average of 42 hours a week in
1997. So far this year, it's 43.7 hours, while 10 years ago, it was
42.3 hours. &QL; 
OVERTIME LOSES APPEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Americans are feeling overworked, chances are it's because
they often are. But it isn't necessarily new. As early as 1992,
Harvard University economist Juliet Schor warned in her bestseller,
``The Overworked American,'' that heavier workloads were making
Americans surly and wishful for simpler lives.
</P>
<P>
   Where once overtime was viewed as a good way to earn extra
bucks, it is now often seen as a stressful drain on leisure or
family time. And it may not be as good a financial deal as it once
seemed: The Cato Institute, a national think-tank, concluded last
year that the average employee loses much of their gains from
overtime pay to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And workers who build a lifestyle around overtime pay may have
trouble scaling back when overtime evaporates. Some companies ask
managers to warn employees about the dangers of basing their
standard of living on overtime pay. &QL; 
MARKET FORCES OVERTIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the use of overtime by employers continues unabated, the
longer hours coming as a logical economic consequence of today's
labor market, said Peter Hom, professor of management at Arizona
State University and an expert on compensation administration.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is low. The economy is strong. To keep up with
demand for their products, employers must either pay more to hire
and train new workers, or ask current workers to work longer.
</P>
<P>
   It's cheaper to pay employees overtime than it is to hire new
workers in a tight market, then provide benefits.
</P>
<P>
   International forces have spurred changes in the domestic labor
market as well. With offshore competition and what Hom calls
``variable pay practices'' becoming more common _ special benefits,
flexible shifts and such _ competition is stiff for new, reasonably
priced employees.
</P>
<P>
   If overtime seems painful to workers, Hom says, there is a
benefit: When the economy shrinks, companies are less likely to lay
off employees if they relied on overtime instead of hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side, he adds, is a decline in employee
satisfaction. A 500-employee survey Hom conducted for a national
retail chain found that heavy overtime led to employee discontent
and disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are feeling greater work-family conflicts,'' Hom
said. And it isn't simply among women, who traditionally felt
sharper conflicts between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   Hom said men and women also complain about conflicts with other
off-time activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conflict seems to be of great concern to employees _ the
infringement of personal time,'' Hom said. ``It's going to lead
employees to quit employment (and look) for other employers with a
more friendly environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflict often exists for managers, most of whom are
not covered by the overtime regulations but have to work long hours
as well. Their stress often is compounded by having to continually
ask more of overworked subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have family lives, too,'' said Bill Ankrom, vice
president of the Western region for Methods West, a Phoenix
machine-tool company. If managers' morale slips, so too will that
of other workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ankrom said the manufacturing industry is rife these days with
examples of companies whose cadre of managers are unhappy, and the
unhappiness spreads to workers at large. Methods West has avoided
problems, he said, by offering bonuses to managers working long
hours without overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The situation appears no different among government workers.
Angel Rodriguez, field representative for Council 97 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
his union often hears complaints about overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles, for example,
Rodriguez said the department responded to complaints about long
customer lines and poor service by calling on employees to work
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The agency budget is limited, so overtime workers are offered
``flex time'' _ coming to work an hour or two later the day after
overtime is worked _ rather than overtime pay or compensatory time
off that is accrued and taken later.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said many state employees don't like flex time because
it does not allow them to schedule compensatory time off to mesh
with their personal schedules.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially vexing for employees with children. Overtime
work upsets child-care routines, and flex time is usually offered
at times when employees cannot make up for time lost with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees suffer, because they don't find family life
satisfying, they have to adjust their child care and it creates
some problems,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the practice is legal. Federal laws allow employers to use
flex time to ensure workers do not work more than 40 hours a week.
Unlike private-sector workers, government employees can be forced
to take time off in lieu of overtime pay. &QL; 
FEWER WORKER COMPLAINTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Albertson's case aside, it is unclear whether the longer
hours have led to in an upswing in legal challenges. Some experts
believe lawsuits are on the rise because workers no longer fear
reprisals _ they know they can find new jobs in the booming job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the U.S. Department of Labor saw a steady decrease in
worker complaints filed during this decade. From 1989 to 1997, for
example, the number of wage-and-hour complaints filed with the
department declined about 45 percent to 34,649 from 63,965.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Nutini, a labor lawyer at the Phoenix law firm of Lewis &AMP;
Roca, suspects workers who feel they are being mistreated simply
walk away from their jobs, knowing they can be easily re-employed
in the current economy.
</P>
<P>
   But John Fraser, acting administrator of the Labor Department's
wage and hour division, thinks employees are worrying about job
security and as a result, are less likely to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a good labor market, Fraser argued, workers increasingly
find themselves in ``contingent work relationships'' _ holding jobs
under contract or under limitations imposed by employers. Simply
put, they don't think challenging their employer is a safe option.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases now litigated by the Labor Department are identified
by the department itself by aiming enforcement at specific
industries. The department's hot list these days includes the
agriculture, garment and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   With one month left in the federal fiscal year, the Arizona
district office has brought 699 overtime or minimum wage cases,
recovering $3.9 million in back wages for employees. The number of
cases is fewer than in past years, mirroring a national decline
blamed on long slide in the size of the Labor Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime violations typically result from employees being paid
regular wages for overtime, or being told to take time off in lieu
of legally required payment, said Cynthia Watson, the Labor
Department's Arizona District director.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not limit the overtime work employers may
demand, provided that non-salaried workers are paid at least 1{
times their normal wage for more 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Routine violations often make the job of labor organizers easier
because employees have common complaints against what they see as
an unfair employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the major issues in organizing workplaces,''
said Jim McLaughlin, Phoenix market-share coordinator for the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. ``They're trying to
squeeze every dime out of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFCW has helped current and former Albertson's employees _
both union and non-union _ sue the company, claiming they were
routinely expected to put in extra time on the job, but off the
clock. A federal judge has been asked to certify it as a national
class-action lawsuit, expanding it to include nearly 7,000 employee
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Read, Albertson's executive vice president for public
affairs, called the claims ``absolutely false'' and said company
policy ``is very clear and unequivocal. Off-the-clock work is
clearly not policy. It is not expected, and frankly, not
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells _ one of the lawsuit's original plaintiffs and one of
five from Arizona _ was liquor department manager for a Glendale
Albertson's when he was fired last year. Albertson's accused him of
not performing certain duties, duties he says were impossible to
fulfill during regular working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sorrells runs his own cleaning business and he calls his
firing a blessing. He sets his own hours. When he works longer, he
takes home more money. His income is slightly higher than before.
His family life is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the fourth or fifth day (after being fired), my wife said,
`Man, you're so much nicer,' '' he said. &QL;

ASTRONAUTS (Undated) _ John, Scott, Wally, Gordo.Just four of them
now. Alan died of leukemia in July. Gus died in the fire aboard
Apollo I, back in the glory days. Deke died of cancer in 1993. They
used to be seven _ America's original astronauts, men who strapped
themselves into test planes over California's deserts and then into
Corvettes and rocket ships in Florida, always competing to be the
fastest, go the highest, be the best. They're in their 70s now and
they haven't lost their famous drive to compete. ``I'm afraid John
has made us all famous again,'' said Scott Carpenter, talking about
himself and the other survivors, Gordon ``Gordo'' Cooper and Walter
``Wally'' Schirra. The Arizona Republic recently talked to all of
them about Sen. John Glenn's upcoming return to space as well as
their lives. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
OVERTIME (Undated) _ By the time his 15-year career with
Albertson's stores ended, Richard Sorrells knew the extra hours at
work were taking their toll. ``I'd come home grumping and griping _
I was stressed'' after routinely putting in at least 10 hours of
extra work a week, said Sorrells, now a Glendale business owner.
``I've got a 4-year-old daughter. She doesn't need to hear that.''
Like Sorrells, Americans are feeling as overworked as ever this
Labor Day. Frustrated by working too many hours _ both paid and
unpaid _ they are sometimes grabbing headlines by battling the
corporations whose profits depend on their extra work. From a
national lawsuit filed against Albertson's grocery stores to the
recently concluded US West strike, the number of hours spent on the
job is a flashpoint for employee discontent. By PAT FLANNERY. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOPHONES (Phoenix) _ When 64-year-old Sheila Brown moved from one
apartment to another within her complex last month, she expected to
be without a telephone for about a day. But the US West strike has
left the Phoenix woman, who lives alone and suffers from chronic
asthma attacks and other health problems, fighting to get her new
installation done on an emergency basis. She's been without phone
service for 16 days. And she's not alone. By BECKY RAMSDELL. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AZDEMS (Phoenix) _ When Arizona Democrats go to the polls Tuesday,
they're in for a severe case of ballot shock. ``There are no
Democratic candidates for a number of statewide offices, nobody for
legislative races. There's nothing,'' said Phoenix attorney Tim
Hogan, who was stunned recently when he opened his sample
Democratic primary ballot and found no reason to participate. There
really isn't anything to vote for in my district, so I guess I've
got to wonder what the point is,'' Hogan said. His dismay reflects
a growing concern over the fate of Arizona's second-largest
political party. The harsh reality is that the Democratic Party is
in its weakest position in years, and if it suffers
across-the-board losses in statewide races in November, it could
emerge powerless for a generation. By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will
move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COL (Undated) _ After four years on the Queens College
baseball team, Albert Kapikian had to face the fact that he'd never
make it to the big leagues. Never stand in the batter's box at
Yankee Stadium in his hometown, the Bronx. Never break the records
of Ruth or Maris or anybody else. It happens to a lot of guys. You
come to terms with your abilities _ or lack of them _ and move on.
Kapikian wasn't going to hit more than 60 home runs in a year, so
he had to settle for saving 600,000 lives. A year. By E.J. MONTINI.
Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

FAMILY, FRIENDS RECALL SWISSAIR CRASH VICTIM'S ZEST FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ernest Thompson was eagerly bound for another leg
of his lifetime odyssey to absorb his family heritage in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the resident of suburban Chatsworth wound up among
the 229 killed aboard Swissair's ill-fated Flight 111 off the Nova
Scotia coast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Rocketdyne engineer's death seems unfair, his
grieving family and friends said Saturday as they sifted through
photographs and meaningful passages by Thompson, an avid reader and
passionate writer.
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 70, he still had a passion to learn more about his
wife of 45 years and four grown children, whose hands he would
proudly clasp while walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved life and everything that went with it. He was
gregarious, is another word that comes to mind,'' said Guy Ervin
III, who worked with Thompson for 25 years at Rocketdyne and last
saw him a week before the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little numb. It just doesn't seem fair. There he
was, off on another one of his adventures. What were (the
passengers) thinking? It's just frightening,'' Ervin said at his
Chatsworth home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice a week, Thompson attended ballroom and folk
dancing classes with his wife, who learned of the fatal crash while
attending an Armenian folk dance Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He would frequently serenade his wife, who works as an office
administrator at a property management company, to encourage her
into retiring so that they could spend the rest of their lives
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would sing the song `I Wanna Dance With You' to me and say,
I want you to retire 'cause I want to dance with you,'' Mary said
Saturday, pulling from her wallet a palm-size anniversary card from
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``To 30 years of thick and thin, better and worse, happiness,
trials and tribulations, warmth, love _ in other words to life _
shared with a wonderful woman as dear to me today as the day we
married, Ernie,'' his message read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We nicknamed him `Earnest Ernest.' That was him. He always
paid close attention to things going on and was always eager to
listen to what people had to say. Of course, you had to listen to
him because he had things to say, too. That was his quality, the
importance of being earnest, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oswego, N.Y., Thompson was an Army paratrooper before
graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He
later worked as an engineer for Pratt &AMP; Whitney Aircraft in Windsor
Locks, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he moved to suburban Canoga Park, working in
aeronautics. In 1961 he became a welding engineer at Rocketdyne,
where he worked for 26 years, assigned to projects requiring
special welding techniques, such as in the building of rocket
engines and the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Though retired for more than 10 years, Thompson was routinely
called back as a consultant at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Energy
Technology Engineering Center _ even as recently as two weeks ago
to help with a ``fast breeder'' nuclear reactor project for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had special knowledge that nobody else did,'' Ervin said,
calling Thompson a meticulous worker who always had stories to tell
of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with Greece stemmed from his Greek father, his
wife said. ``He was constantly learning,'' Mary said.
</P>
<P>
   His trip would have included spending three weeks with an elder
hostel group touring the antiquities of Greece, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sorry that I wasn't going with him. I guess it wasn't
meant for me to go,'' Mary said Saturday at their Chatsworth home.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Saturday before he traveled, she was
concerned about his trip, worried about the recent bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I was not comfortable with him going on this
trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, the family instead focused on Thompson's love of
life.
</P>
<P>
   When away from his consulting work, Thompson immersed himself in
his family _ always the one to wait around at his children's new
homes for utility workers to show up, or to ``cat-sit'' for a
vacationing family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested and interesting,'' said one of Thompson's
daughters, Kathy, 42, at the family home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no task too big if his children needed something,''
added son Stephen, 39, of Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   His other surviving family members include daughter Kim
Thompson-Janecke, 44, of Seattle and son David, 36, of Simi Valley
in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Hills labor law attorney Jana DeMeire, 39, also was
among the passengers on the MD-11 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire had left for a two-week vacation in Greece, said her
father, Frank DeMeire, 65, who had come from his home in Costa Rica
to watch his daughter's cats while she was away.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, he said, had planned to travel with her, but missed
a connecting flight in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said that on the day before his daughter left, she spoke
to him by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished her a bon voyage,'' he said. ``I was going to meet
her when she got back. We were very close.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said his daughter was ``very outgoing, very friendly,
had lots of friends.'' She also volunteered at the Venice Family
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just looked forward to seeing me when she got back,'' said
her father, who described what he has been going through since the
crash as ``hell.''

ARIZONA DEMOCRATS IN WEAKEST SPOT IN YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Arizona Democrats go to the polls Tuesday, they're in for a
severe case of ballot shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Democratic candidates for a number of statewide
offices, nobody for legislative races. There's nothing,'' said
Phoenix attorney Tim Hogan, who was stunned recently when he opened
his sample Democratic primary ballot and found no reason to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't anything to vote for in my district, so I
guess I've got to wonder what the point is.''
</P>
<P>
   His dismay reflects a growing concern over the fate of Arizona's
second-largest political party. The harsh reality is that the
Democratic Party is in its weakest position in years, and if it
suffers across-the-board losses in statewide races in November, it
could emerge powerless for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Eddie
Basha, though temporary, is enough to dishearten even the most
hard-core party loyalists. But he was only the highest profile
Democrat to bail out, not the only one. Others, put off by the
Democrats' weak showing this year, did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, expressing frustration with both parties, opted to
re-register as an independent, meaning he will sit out the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix political consultant Steve Tuttle registered as a
Republican after seeing a barren Democratic field in his north
Phoenix district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really believe yourself to be an honest-to-God
Democrat, it is frustrating. You have to ask yourself, what the
hell are they doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats such as Tuttle and Basha aren't giving up all hope.
After casting ballots for GOP friends on Tuesday, they plan to
re-register as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But they may come back to a party _ should the Democrats' worst
nightmares materialize _ that's little more than a political speed
bump to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP is trying to sweep all major races in the Nov. 3
general election and seize control of the next redrawing of state
political boundaries, after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   If they do that, the state Democratic Party will be even further
diminished and demoralized, and Republicans will rule over Arizona
politics for well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is whether we will be in the ballgame or not
in the next decade,'' said Melodee Jackson, the state Democratic
Party's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to live under lines drawn by the Republicans, we
might as well go and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Corporation Commissioner Renz Jennings, the party's only
statewide officeholder, ``It's pretty important to have a two-party
state . . . and we're dangerously close to having a totally
Republican state.''
</P>
<P>
   He is retiring this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the signs for Arizona Democrats are ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Party members who do go to the polls Tuesday will find few, if
any, contested races. Democrats didn't even bother to field
candidates for three statewide offices, treasurer, superintendent
of public instruction and mine inspector. The party's U.S. Senate
candidate, attorney Ed Ranger, has no political experience.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Republican Gov. Jane Hull has a
commanding lead over Democrat Paul Johnson in the polls, and she
has a huge advantage in fund-raising. Key Democrats, including
Basha, are expected after the primary to endorse Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In legislative races, the party is so disorganized it missed a
sure bet in District 3, a Democratic stronghold that includes the
Navajo Reservation. Because of a mix-up, Democrats failed to field
any House candidates in the district this year, giving Republicans
a rare opening. Both parties are fielding write-in candidates for
seats in the district.
</P>
<P>
   And former Democratic chairman Steve Owens, in his second bid to
unseat GOP Rep. J.D. Hayworth, gave his opponent a major opening
last week by saying he had invited President Clinton to help him in
the state's sprawling Congressional District 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being politically tone deaf,'' said Hayworth, noting that
many other Democrats around the country are putting distance
between themselves and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since (former Rep.) Karan English brought in (handgun
control advocate) Sarah Brady have we had such a fundamental
misreading of the constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, though, see signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Because they have only a handful of contested primary contests,
the party's brightest lights have been able to conserve campaign
funds and avoid political blood-letting. Strategists point to
intraparty GOP warfare in the races for attorney general and
Arizona Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though primary turnout may be low, there are many, many
pluses. We do not have John Kaites and Tom McGovern killing each
other,'' Jackson said, referring to the Republican candidates for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democrats' attorney general candidate, former U.S.
Attorney Janet Napolitano, may be the party's best hope for
avoiding an across-the-board defeat in statewide races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also feel they have a chance, albeit slight, of
regaining parity with the GOP in the state Senate. If they can do
that, and avoid being crushed in statewide contests, Democratic
strategists say that the party's resurgence is possible. They point
to a projected large increase in the state's Hispanic population, a
traditionally Democratic group.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the 1980s, Democrats enjoyed a comfortable advantage in
statewide voter registration. Since then, Republicans have gained
an overwhelming edge in Maricopa County, the state's largest
county, and made significant inroads into the state's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Hayworth's large district, Republicans this year for the
first time have a slight voter registration advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman attributes the shift to a large influx of
Republicans to suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Californians who come here are coming from Orange County
and not Marin,'' he said. ``I think there is a growing conservative
majority in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is Republican domination of the Legislature, the
state's congressional delegation, the executive branch, the
corporation commission and the Maricopa County Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Democrats said they don't see hope for the
party's revival unless a dynamic leader emerges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the party had many dominant figures, including
Gov. Bruce Babbitt, U.S. Rep. Morris Udall and Sen. Dennis
DeConcini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until another Bruce Babbitt comes along to sort of
reinvigorate the party, it's kind of hard to imagine it coming
back,'' one prominent Arizona Democrat said. ``It literally is
going to take that.'' &QL;

CARDS SIGN WADSWORTH TO SIX-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Who needs practice?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth apparently
doesn't need training camp or drills after ending his 44-day
holdout Saturday by signing a six-year deal that could be worth as
much as $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, who received a team-record signing bonus of $10.491
million, not only will dress for today's season opener against the
Dallas Cowboys but also is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume he's in good physical condition, knowing the type
of person Andre is,'' said Coach Vince Tobin, who released rookie
defensive end Mike Moten to make room for Wadsworth on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he'll get some snaps in the nickel as a pass rusher.
When you're the left end, you've got four guys rushing, all you
need to know is you rush up the field and try to sack the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's agent, Roosevelt Barnes, said Wadsworth is ready to
play. ``He's like a caged animal,'' Barnes said. ``If they would
let him start, he'd start.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he is in ``the best physical shape he could
possibly be in but not football shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to train for constant repetitions of seven or eight
seconds of total explosion,'' said Wadsworth, who added that he's
not concerned of the health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make sure I stretch real well and make sure I watch what
I eat in the pregame meal because I know I'll have the butterflies.
Hopefully, I can dance around and (play) a little nickel, take some
little baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late Friday night, a deal between the Cardinals and
Wadsworth's agents, Eugene Parker and Barnes, didn't appear
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals maintained Wadsworth, the Florida state defensive
end who was the third pick overall, wanted to be paid as much as
San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf, the second pick
overall who received a five-year, $31 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth didn't get as much as Leaf, but the Cardinals can opt
out of the deal after three years. If they decide to end the
contract after five years, Wadsworth's total deal would be worth
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill, team vice president who had been in France
until Friday, said both sides made concessions.
</P>
<P>
   A concession the Cardinals made was to allow the contract to
include escalators, pay-for-performance clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the escalators were likely to be earned, Barnes said
they were if Wadsworth is  &UR; ...  &UR; (MISSINGTYPE)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no gimmes, but he should be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A concession Wadsworth's agents made a week ago was to abandon
their demand that the contract include voidable years. On Friday,
they dropped the amount of total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to play football,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``Andre
wanted to play football. We wanted him to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Wadsworth got involved in the negotiations and that
he started dealing directly with Michael Bidwill and his brother,
Bill Jr., who oversees contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days, B.J. (Bidwill Jr.) and Michael got
personally involved,'' Barnes said. ``It was a lot smoother dealing
directly with them. They called me late (Friday) night and put a
proposal on the table. We put a proposal on the table. We were
within striking distance and then Michael and B.J. got aggressive
when they saw we could make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The final contract wasn't much different than the deal the two
sides almost reached a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he wasn't upset that the negotiations took so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually I was going to come (to terms),'' Wadsworth
said. ``I didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the Cardinals for showing confidence in me and
investing in me. I think this was perfect timing. Like a fine wine
or fine cheese, it takes time to come out and taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't know that the impasse had ended until 12:45
p.m. Saturday when team owner Bill Bidwill grabbed the microphone
on the team's charter plane and told the team that Wadsworth had
agreed to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, meanwhile, then boarded a plane in Tallahassee, Fla.,
for Dallas. He has been living there and taking a graduate class in
business administration during his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus the Cardinals paid Wadsworth _ part of it will be
deferred _ is the third largest given to an NFL rookie.
Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the first pick overall,
received an $11.6 million bonus. Leaf was paid a bonus of $11.25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth will earn the minium base salary of $144,000 for a
rookie this year. His annual salaries will then increase 25 percent
each year.
</P>
<P>
   His salary-cap figure for this season will be $1.89 million, the
remaining available under the team's rookie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With Wadsworth signing, the Cardinals now are about $2 million
under the $54.3 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to the organization it stepped up to the plate
and got the contract signed,'' Tobin said. ``Hopefully, this is a
turning point in this organization.''

CARDINALS HEAVE BIG SIGH OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS - Wake the children.
</P>
<P>
   Call the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Our long nightmare is over.
</P>
<P>
   One day before the Cardinals' season opener, Andre Wadsworth
ended his 44-day holdout and agreed to a breathtaking contract that
left Bill Bidwill sucking oxygen from one of those little drop-down
masks on the team flight.
</P>
<P>
   The owner broke the news while en route to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, (``inhal''e) I'm pleased to announce we have signed
our No. 1 draft choice (``inhal''e) to a contract that will
``inhale'' pay him (``inhal''e)forty-(``inhal''e)-two (``inhale
inhale'' ``inhale'' ``inhal''e) MILLION dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players let out a cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson wept.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis kissed his line coach, Joe
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see such giddyness at 30,000 feet except maybe on a
weekend Southwest free-drink coupons flight to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane felt lighter,'' Aeneas Williams said of the soaring
spirits. ``I thought we had dropped our luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``had'' to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth wasn't going to sit out the season and turn down a $10
million bonus, the third largest offered a rookie in NFL history.
How would his agents explain ``that'' strategy to prospective
clients?
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Cardinals allow their top pick _ whom draftniks
call Wadsworth the next Bruce Smith _ to get away.
</P>
<P>
   Management already had taken a public-relations flogging.
Editorialists expressed righteous outrage, much of it directed at
Bill Bidwill Jr., who nixed a deal last week. The voice of reason,
talk radio called for frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
   All the optimism and civic goodwill generated by the draft had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals critics saw the impasse as the latest example of
front-office incompetence and a lack of commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Players were upset. Coaches shook their heads. On Friday,
McGinnis said the only thing he could say about the prospect of
opening the season against the Cowboys without the 6-foot-3,
278-pound defensive end in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. But he had to be thinking what everyone else was:
``This is'' ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had to compromise. (Both did.) The Cardinals lost
what little leverage they had after Brad Ottis, who was scheduled
to start at left defensive end until Wadsworth was ready to move
in, fractured his foot and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to blink (The Cardinals did).
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's $10.491 million signing bonus is the largest in club
history. His six-year deal includes the kind of monetary exchange
that usually involves a Brinks truck, pantyhose masks and automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully, it's over. No more posturing. No more
negotiating in the media. No more talks about voidables and
escalators and other terminology that leaves most fans glassy-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no more wild speculation. When I got the news
Saturday I was sitting alone on the grassy knoll pondering the
latest conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard this one. The one about how Dallas owner Jerry
Jones asked Wadsworth's agents, who are Deion Sanders' agents, to
encourage their client to hold out until after the Cowboys game,
presumably as a personal favor.
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, of course. Both sides wanted to get this done.
They had to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Now that Wadsworth is a Cardinal, it is time, to
quote our president, to move on. If the guy is half the athlete
everyone says he is there is no doubt what the Cardinals must do
today.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Wadsworth missing two-a-days. Never mind the fact
he is a rookie and hasn't memorized the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   For what this guy is making, here's what the team should do.
Introduce him to his teammates. Give him jersey No. 90. After a
pregame meal of T-bone steak (rare), present him a wallet-size
color photo of Troy Aikman and three words of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him.'' &QL;

FORMER MERCURY ASTRONAUTS CHEER ON JOHN GLENN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John, Scott, Wally, Gordo. Just four of them now. Alan died of
leukemia in July. Gus died in the fire aboard Apollo I, back in the
glory days. Deke died of cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; They used to be seven _ Ameri ca's original astronauts, men who
strapped themselves into test planes over California's deserts and
then into Corvettes and rocket ships in Florida, always competing
to be the fastest, go the highest, be the best.
</P>
<P>
   They're in their 70s now and they haven't lost their famous
drive to compete. It's just that their lifelong contest between
``brothers,'' which is what they call each other, is played out in
more ordinary settings with less expensive equipment. They still
try to outrun, outski, outbike and outplay each other on tennis
courts, hills, tracks and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   When NASA unveiled the seven heroes-to-be at a news conference
in April 1959, a reporter asked who would like to be first in
space. They all raised their hands. The competi tiveness and the
attention of an admiring world would be a part of their lives from
that moment on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid John has made us all famous again,'' said Scott
Carpenter, talking about himself and the other survivors, Gordon
``Gordo'' Cooper and Walter ``Wally'' Schirra. The Arizona Republic
recently talked to all of them about Sen. John Glenn's upcoming
return to space as well as their lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn has been training in Houston for the second trip of
a lifetime, the others aren't exactly playing croquet. None is
retired. They are still striving in life, even though their places
in history are secure.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper wants to go to Mars. It's a dream he has held onto since
reading Buck Rogers comic strips as a kid. He's only 71, the
youngest of the original astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Still at his high school weight, Cooper jogs and race-walks 15
miles a week, plays tennis twice a week and plays golf on nights
and weekends. He flies airplanes when ever he can, and is rearing
two teenagers _ his second batch.
</P>
<P>
   Though Carpenter, 73, doesn't have any plans to go back into
space, he is ferociously active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skiing is the best way to fly and keep my feet on the
ground,'' he jokes. He also rides horses, plays tennis and golfs
regularly. He's working on his third book. &UR; All three of the former
astronauts say they weigh the same as when they were suiting-up for
space.
</P>
<P>
   Without the fanfare of going into zero atmosphere, they are
breaking new barriers now: those of age, of lifetime endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although Carpenter believes older people may feel empowered by
Glenn's return to space, he hopes that young people will learn some
thing from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep your mind alert and your body fit through
your whole life. John is a perfect exam ple of someone who has done
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The other former astronauts are, too.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges Schirra, 75, de scribed having with Glenn at Alan
Shepard's funeral in July indicate that the old competitive juices
have been running strong _ even on a solemn day when they buried
one of their brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra quietly jabbed Glenn: ``John,'' he said, ``why don't
they just send up Strom Thurmond if they want an old senator in
space?'' He then ribbed Glenn for taking the mission because he
needed the flight hours. Glenn had been in space only once. Schirra
had flown on Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The astronauts meet at least a couple times a year. They ski at
Vail, Colo., where they go fast and work out hard. Each May in
Florida they distribute money to science and engineering students
from the As tronaut Scholarship Foundation they established.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those occasions three years ago, Glenn, then 74, told
them he was interested in going back up. He asked the others what
they thought about it. For a moment, Schirra thought, it sounded
like a rocking chair fantasy. He recalled telling Glenn, ``Oh,
John, grow up; get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn had been considering it for some time. &UR; Flying in space
was important to him, and he finally saw an opening in the field of
aging research. After all, his body in the 1960s was one of the
most thor oughly documented human speci mens on Earth. If you
wanted to measure changes, here was a willing subject. He started
talking to re searchers on aging and to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``John told me about this dream, but I never really thought it
would happen,'' Carpenter told The Repub lic.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpenter, who has always had a deep friendship with Glenn,
is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``John meets all the challenges he sees. Here's a chance to do
something that's a hell of a lot of fun, and to do some meaningful
science. It's the climax of his life spent in service to the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would he go back up himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John I'd be his backup again, but this time I'd make
sure something would happen to him so I'd get to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's time in space, pilot ing the Aurora 7 spacecraft
through three revolutions of the Earth, gave him a deeply spiritual
connection with &UR; Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``From space, Earth is a lonely, isolated, fragile outpost in
the mid dle of nowhere. You don't fully appreciate that until you
see it from a distance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That moment of concern for the Earth led him to undersea
research after his astronaut service ended. With the Navy's Sealab
Program he helped transfer space technology to deep-sea studies. He
lived in a capsule on the sea floor for 30 days, and still helps
direct an ocean research institute in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now he divides his time between New York City and Vail. He has
written two books about the ocean and is writing a family history
with one of his four grown children.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was one of the first to encourage Glenn to take the new
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aging body in good shape can do just as much as a younger
body in good shape,'' he says. He thinks that the medical experts
consistently underestimate what people are physically capable of
achieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it a matter of physical ability, never a
matter of age,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   He also recognizes that the Glenn flight might help him with his
own dream of going to Mars. For now, he works full time for his own
aerospace consulting firm, the Gal axy Group in Van Nuys, Calif.,
which is his big workshop for developing home energy systems and
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the California coast near San Diego, Schirra lives
with his wife of 52 years in Rancho Santa Fe. Like Glenn, he is
still married to his original partner.
</P>
<P>
   After his astronaut days, Schirra served as CEO of a number of
businesses and as a board member of some large firms, including
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex and feminine-hygiene
products. &UR; Schirra flew in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,
and he thinks test pilots should be pilots, not passengers. He
isn't as excited about Glenn's coming mission as the other
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a strap hanger, like a subway rider,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra would rather see Glenn at the helm if he's going to
bother going up. That's the only way he would consider going up
himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trained to be a test pilot. I wouldn't want to go on as
a passenger. I wouldn't want to leap in the back and hang on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands why Glenn wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, would do what I could to get out of the U.S. Senate in
a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribbing aside, Schirra is proud of Glenn for going back up. He
thinks it will do wonders for NASA. All the former astronauts have
a pater nal concern for the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn story reminds him of the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time an astronaut was on the cover of Time
and other news magazines?'' he asked. ``And what do you know about
any of the experiments aboard Mir? Who flew our last shuttle?''
</P>
<P>
   NASA confirms that media inter est in the upcoming Glenn flight
is surpassing all recent missions. The only comparable interest was
the post-Challenger launch of the space shuttle in September 1988,
and the first Hubble Telescope mission in December 1993, said Rob
Navias, a NASA spokesman in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fascination from a historical and a human interest
perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the mission will showcase a wide range of experi
ments, it is being seen by many as an historical turning point in
how we think about older people. Old barriers are about to be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   And, again, it will be Glenn out in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always the one to be out there in front,'' Schirra said
with a laugh. ``That's John.''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Mercury 7 astro nauts have been contracted by
major television networks to provide ex pert commentary Oct. 29
when Glenn goes back up.
</P>
<P>
   Last time it was Carpenter who watched the rocket rise in 1962
and said on behalf of a breathless world, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>

   He'll likely say it again for us, one more time with feeling, on
the morning of Oct. 29. &QL;

CARDINALS HEAVE BIG SIGH OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS - Wake the children.
</P>
<P>
   Call the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Our long nightmare is over.
</P>
<P>
   One day before the Cardinals' season opener, Andre Wadsworth
ended his 44-day holdout and agreed to a breathtaking contract that
left Bill Bidwill sucking oxygen from one of those little drop-down
masks on the team flight.
</P>
<P>
   The owner broke the news while en route to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, (``inhal''e) I'm pleased to announce we have signed
our No. 1 draft choice (``inhal''e) to a contract that will
``inhale'' pay him (``inhal''e)forty-(``inhal''e)-two (``inhale
inhale'' ``inhale'' ``inhal''e) MILLION dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players let out a cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson wept.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis kissed his line coach, Joe
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see such giddyness at 30,000 feet except maybe on a
weekend Southwest free-drink coupons flight to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane felt lighter,'' Aeneas Williams said of the soaring
spirits. ``I thought we had dropped our luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``had'' to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth wasn't going to sit out the season and turn down a $10
million bonus, the third largest offered a rookie in NFL history.
How would his agents explain ``that'' strategy to prospective
clients?
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Cardinals allow their top pick _ whom draftniks
call Wadsworth the next Bruce Smith _ to get away.
</P>
<P>
   Management already had taken a public-relations flogging.
Editorialists expressed righteous outrage, much of it directed at
Bill Bidwill Jr., who nixed a deal last week. The voice of reason,
talk radio called for frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
   All the optimism and civic goodwill generated by the draft had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals critics saw the impasse as the latest example of
front-office incompetence and a lack of commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Players were upset. Coaches shook their heads. On Friday,
McGinnis said the only thing he could say about the prospect of
opening the season against the Cowboys without the 6-foot-3,
278-pound defensive end in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. But he had to be thinking what everyone else was:
``This is'' ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had to compromise. (Both did.) The Cardinals lost
what little leverage they had after Brad Ottis, who was scheduled
to start at left defensive end until Wadsworth was ready to move
in, fractured his foot and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to blink (The Cardinals did).
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's $10.491 million signing bonus is the largest in club
history. His six-year deal includes the kind of monetary exchange
that usually involves a Brinks truck, pantyhose masks and automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully, it's over. No more posturing. No more
negotiating in the media. No more talks about voidables and
escalators and other terminology that leaves most fans glassy-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no more wild speculation. When I got the news
Saturday I was sitting alone on the grassy knoll pondering the
latest conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard this one. The one about how Dallas owner Jerry
Jones asked Wadsworth's agents, who are Deion Sanders' agents, to
encourage their client to hold out until after the Cowboys game,
presumably as a personal favor.
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, of course. Both sides wanted to get this done.
They had to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Now that Wadsworth is a Cardinal, it is time, to
quote our president, to move on. If the guy is half the athlete
everyone says he is there is no doubt what the Cardinals must do
today.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Wadsworth missing two-a-days. Never mind the fact
he is a rookie and hasn't memorized the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   For what this guy is making, here's what the team should do.
Introduce him to his teammates. Give him jersey No. 90. After a
pregame meal of T-bone steak (rare), present him a wallet-size
color photo of Troy Aikman and three words of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him.'' &QL;

MEMORIES OF DAD HARD TO IGNORE 
 SEASON WILL BE LONG FOR COWBOYS LINEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys center  &UR; Dale Hellestrae says his late father's
favorite song was the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last thing he heard,'' Hellestrae said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after hearing it played before the Cardinals' preseason
game against the Chicago Bears on Aug. 14 at Sun Devil Stadium,
Hellestrae's father,  &UR; Lawrence, suffered a fatal heart attack in
Section 210.
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae, a Scottsdale native, has been thinking about his dad
this week as the Cowboys prepare for today's season opener against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big Cardinals fan,'' Hellestrae said. ``He was an
original season ticket holder. He wished the Cardinals would go
14-2 every year. He rooted for them in every game except when they
played us. He loved those games. He loved his seats.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, 66, also loved any team for which Hellestrae played.
He was at Sun Devil Stadium in 1980 when Hellestrae helped
Scottsdale Saguaro High School win the Class 3A state title. He was
there again in January 1996, when the Cowboys beat the Pittsburgh
Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always liked to kid him,'' Hellestrae said. ``He would get
more worked up for games than I did. He would come to Dallas for
two games a year. My wife would have to drop him off three and a
half, four hours before the game, because he was so excited. He
would walk around the stadium and meet people. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, a longtime Valley mailman, was in good health. He
had cut the lawn that day and regularly rode a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been glued to the TV on Sunday for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever season it was, that was his favorite sport,''
Hellestrae said. ``Whatever team I played on was his favorite
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae knows it will be difficult to return to Sun Devil
Stadium when the Cowboys play there Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be tougher for them (his family members) to go
watch their first game back,'' he said of the Cardinals' home
opener against Philadelphia on Sept. 20. ``But if they can do it, I
can do it. Still, it will be hard.'' &QL; 
No Fun League
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals defensive end  &UR; Mike Jones discovered he had a
problem when the St. Louis Rams acquired him from the New England
Patriots last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams already had a player named Mike Jones, an outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The public-address announcer at the TWA Dome in St. Louis came
up with a solution. He refers to the defensive end as  &UR; Mike D.
Jones and the linebacker as  &UR; Mike A. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams originally were told that players can't place their
middle initials on the back of their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the league said,'' club equipment manager  &UR; Todd
Hewitt said. ``They looked it up in the bylaws.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, league officials came to their senses.  &QL; 
Bad News Bears
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer and former Chicago running back  &UR; Gale Sayers
maintains his former team is three players away from being three
players away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Hatley, club personnel vice president, thinks the Bears
are worse that that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had eight more good players, we'd be a pretty decent
football team,'' Hatley said. ``We'd have a chance to break even or
maybe a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help the Bears any that they are playing $6.4 million
short of the salary cap because of hits they've taken on five
players they've let go _ linebacker  &UR; Bryan Cox, quarterback  &UR; Rick
Mirer, defensive end  &UR; Alonzo Spellman, returner  &UR; Tyrone Hughes and
running back
 &UR; Rashaan Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put us two years behind,'' Hatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of their top three draft choices from a year ago,
second-round pick  &UR; John Allred, is still on the roster, and he has
been beaten out by rookie  &UR; Alonzo Mayes at tight end. &QL; 
Lopsided affair
</P>
<P>
   Here's how dominant the Denver Broncos have been over New
England in their past 10 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have outscored the Patriots, 105-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have gained 1,205 yards to the Patriots' 809.
</P>
<P>
   They have run for 511 yards to the Patriots' 149.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad in 1996, Broncos tight end  &UR; Shannon Sharpe picked
up a phone on the sideline and said, ``President, we need the
National Guard. We need as many men as you can spare because we are
killing the Patriots. So call the dogs off. Send the National
Guard, please. They need emergency help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who host the Patriots on Monday night, won the '96
game, 34-8. &QL; 
Feeling out of place
</P>
<P>
   How strange it was for former Cardinals linebacker  &UR; Seth Joyner,
a member of Green Bay's Super Bowl runner-ups last season, to be
traded to the league champion Broncos last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like I am year behind my quest,'' Joyner said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner doesn't think the Packers took the AFC winners seriously
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a large part we underestimated this football team
(the Broncos) more because we dominated so much in the NFC through
the last part of the season,'' he said. ``I guess I feel we went
into the game with the feeling it was almost a done deal. Nobody
likes to say that, but when you look at how the game turned out and
things of that nature, I think in some ways we might have taken
them a little lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that you need to respect your opponent,
no matter who they are, no matter what the circumstances are.
They're a great team to even make it to the Super Bowl.'' &QL;

FAMILY, FRIENDS RECALL SWISSAIR CRASH VICTIM'S ZEST FOR LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ernest Thompson was eagerly bound for another leg
of his lifetime odyssey to absorb his family heritage in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the resident of suburban Chatsworth wound up among
the 229 killed aboard Swissair's ill-fated Flight 111 off the Nova
Scotia coast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Rocketdyne engineer's death seems unfair, his
grieving family and friends said Saturday as they sifted through
photographs and meaningful passages by Thompson, an avid reader and
passionate writer.
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 70, he still had a passion to learn more about his
wife of 45 years and four grown children, whose hands he would
proudly clasp while walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved life and everything that went with it. He was
gregarious, is another word that comes to mind,'' said Guy Ervin
III, who worked with Thompson for 25 years at Rocketdyne and last
saw him a week before the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little numb. It just doesn't seem fair. There he
was, off on another one of his adventures. What were (the
passengers) thinking? It's just frightening,'' Ervin said at his
Chatsworth home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice a week, Thompson attended ballroom and folk
dancing classes with his wife, who learned of the fatal crash while
attending an Armenian folk dance Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He would frequently serenade his wife, who works as an office
administrator at a property management company, to encourage her
into retiring so that they could spend the rest of their lives
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would sing the song `I Wanna Dance With You' to me and say,
I want you to retire 'cause I want to dance with you,'' Mary said
Saturday, pulling from her wallet a palm-size anniversary card from
her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``To 30 years of thick and thin, better and worse, happiness,
trials and tribulations, warmth, love _ in other words to life _
shared with a wonderful woman as dear to me today as the day we
married, Ernie,'' his message read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We nicknamed him `Earnest Ernest.' That was him. He always
paid close attention to things going on and was always eager to
listen to what people had to say. Of course, you had to listen to
him because he had things to say, too. That was his quality, the
importance of being earnest, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oswego, N.Y., Thompson was an Army paratrooper before
graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He
later worked as an engineer for Pratt &AMP; Whitney Aircraft in Windsor
Locks, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he moved to suburban Canoga Park, working in
aeronautics. In 1961 he became a welding engineer at Rocketdyne,
where he worked for 26 years, assigned to projects requiring
special welding techniques, such as in the building of rocket
engines and the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Though retired for more than 10 years, Thompson was routinely
called back as a consultant at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Energy
Technology Engineering Center _ even as recently as two weeks ago
to help with a ``fast breeder'' nuclear reactor project for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had special knowledge that nobody else did,'' Ervin said,
calling Thompson a meticulous worker who always had stories to tell
of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with Greece stemmed from his Greek father, his
wife said. ``He was constantly learning,'' Mary said.
</P>
<P>
   His trip would have included spending three weeks with an elder
hostel group touring the antiquities of Greece, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sorry that I wasn't going with him. I guess it wasn't
meant for me to go,'' Mary said Saturday at their Chatsworth home.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Saturday before he traveled, she was
concerned about his trip, worried about the recent bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I was not comfortable with him going on this
trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, the family instead focused on Thompson's love of
life.
</P>
<P>
   When away from his consulting work, Thompson immersed himself in
his family _ always the one to wait around at his children's new
homes for utility workers to show up, or to ``cat-sit'' for a
vacationing family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested and interesting,'' said one of Thompson's
daughters, Kathy, 42, at the family home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no task too big if his children needed something,''
added son Stephen, 39, of Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   His other surviving family members include daughter Kim
Thompson-Janecke, 44, of Seattle and son David, 36, of Simi Valley
in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Hills labor law attorney Jana DeMeire, 39, also was
among the passengers on the MD-11 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire had left for a two-week vacation in Greece, said her
father, Frank DeMeire, 65, who had come from his home in Costa Rica
to watch his daughter's cats while she was away.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, he said, had planned to travel with her, but missed
a connecting flight in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said that on the day before his daughter left, she spoke
to him by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished her a bon voyage,'' he said. ``I was going to meet
her when she got back. We were very close.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said his daughter was ``very outgoing, very friendly,
had lots of friends.'' She also volunteered at the Venice Family
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just looked forward to seeing me when she got back,'' said
her father, who described what he has been going through since the
crash as ``hell.''

WASHINGTON PULLS OUT WIN ON LATE PASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Brock Huard couldn't pull his hands away from his
face.
</P>
<P>
   He had thought it was over. Everybody did. But moments before,
with just 28 seconds remaining, he found Washington tight end
Reggie Davis, who wiped out Arizona State's national championship
hopes with a 63-yard touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   Someone hit the mute button on the 72,118 fans at Sun Devil
Stadium. One of No. 8 ASU's most important season openers in years
ended Saturday night with a 42-38 victory by the No. 18 Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm emotionally drained, exhausted,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder
said. ``We all participated, all had a hand in the outcome, we must
share in it. . . . It's a terrible loss, but we're going to rebound
from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes earlier, it looked as if the Sun Devils would
survive. J.R. Redmond's 61-yard punt return set up an amazing
8-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Kealy to Tariq McDonald that put
ASU up, 38-35.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, who appears to have recovered just fine from last
season's knee surgery, completed 20 of 35 passes for 302 yards and
three touchdowns. Redmond carried 22 times for 108 yards and caught
four passes for 68 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Huard completed 27 of 47 passes for 318 yards and four
touchdowns, two to little-known Dane Looker.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said before the contest that this game will not make or
break ASU's season. But it might shift its goals a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's offense lived up to its billing, but its defense
struggled. The unit rarely put pressure on Huard, and the
secondary's lack of depth revealed itself.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sun Devils need some good news, they got an early look at
their future, and the results were promising. Among the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Todd Heap lived up to his preseason billing. The true
freshman from Mesa Mountain View High School made a stunning
one-handed catch in the end zone to give ASU a seven-point lead in
the first quarter. It was the first catch of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman Kyion Graves pounced on a pooch kick that the
Huskies failed to pursue and set up ASU's fourth touchdown of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Redshirt freshman tailback Daveron Hightower, who rehabilitated
a serious leg injury last season, saw limited action, but when he
played, he made an impact. He scored on a 2-yard run in the second
quarter, and his pitch to Redmond on the Sun Devils' next drive
resulted in a 22-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Coach Jim Lambright predicted a shootout, and that's
what he got.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils took the opening drive and marched 61 yards,
capping it with a 13-yard pass from Kealy to tight end Kendrick
Bates. Kealy made the most of his versatile offense, turning to
five different teammates during the seven-play series.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies rarely pressured Kealy until late in the game, which
was as much a statement about Washington's pass rush as it was
about ASU's skilled offensive line. If the quarterback wanted a
test for the knee he injured last season, this wasn't the game to
get it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington came right back and took advantage of a J'Juan Cherry
pass interference on third down. The highlight of the drive was a
13-yard keeper by backup quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo that caught
the Sun Devils off guard and put the Huskies at ASU's 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington closed the deal with a 3-yard pass from Huard to
tight end Reggie Davis that tied the game, 7-7, with 8:29
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils scored again on their next possession, and it was
during this drive that Kealy had his first incompletion. One of his
connections was Heap's amazing catch, which the freshman tipped
with his right arm and then pulled down, all with Washington's
Toure Butler and Marques Hairston hanging on him.
</P>
<P>
   If Heaps embarks on a mission next season, as scheduled, the Sun
Devils will miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ASU linebacker Stephen Trejo made sure the Huskies didn't score
on their next possession by sacking Huard at the Sun Devils'
27-yard line on a third-and-1 play.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies tied the game at 14 with a 16-yard run by fullback
Pat Conniff with 9:05 remaining in the second quarter. It was the
sophomore's longest run and his first career touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils' next drive was highlighted by Kealy's swing pass
to Redmond that he converted into a 47-yard play. Hightower capped
the drive with his 2-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   ASU got tricky on the next series. Stephen Baker's pooch kick
caught the Huskies off guard, and they let it bounce without
reacting. Grayes pounced on it, and the Sun Devils took over at
Washington's 31.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Kealy handed off to Hightower, who pitched it
to Redmond and watched as he ran 22 yards for the score. ASU led,
28-14. &QL;

WADSWORTH DEAL BRINGS CARDS FULL CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Everyone knew something was up when the flight
attendant on the Cardinals' charter plane came on the public
address system and said Bill Bidwill Sr. had a special
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Memories were tested to recall the last time the team's
reclusive owner did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to tell us that Mark McGwire broke the
home run record,'' said linebacker Jamir Miller, one of the
defensive captains.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who'd seen Coach Vince Tobin tap backup defensive lineman
Mike Moten on the shoulder and escort him off the plane before
takeoff could have guessed differently.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals held out hope for 44 days while Andre Wadsworth
simply held out. Finally, the impasse was resolved on Saturday with
Wadsworth, the Cardinals first-round draft pick, signing a six-year
contract that could be worth as much as $42 million if he achieves
escalator incentives. Wadsworth receives a club-record $10.49
million signing bonus entering today's opener against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis was one of those cheering
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the announcement I went right up and shook Mr. B's
hand,'' McGinnis said. ``It was a very good emotional bump for all
of us. Mentally for this team, there's no question that this is
really outstanding. I had full confidence we'd get this done. I've
been in the league too long to think it wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That was echoed by one of the behind-the-scene deal-savers, team
vice president Michael Bidwill, who just returned from vacation in
France. While on the continent, Bidwill was briefed by telephone of
the raging firestorm last week over allegations that the club had
killed a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best player in the draft was not going to get away from
us,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``Everybody knew what the ramifications
were. It was time to play football. The two parties came together
and made an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a moment too soon, according to Wadsworth's new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who should benefit from the improved pass-rush that
Wadsworth can provide is the secondary, anchored by four-time Pro
Bowl starter Aeneas Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it will be like the difference between having the fire
department one block away and two miles away,'' said Williams, one
of the team's defensive captains. ``The airplane seemed to start
traveling a lot faster. There was a lighter load.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said all the hype and projections are now moot. Wadsworth
is a pro football player who has to make his mark on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this stops the questions about whether he'll sign,''
Miller said. ``Hopefully he'll come in here and prove that he is
the best defensive lineman drafted in the '90s. I'm happy the guy
is here, but now he has to do his thing and help us win. There will
be no congratulations until the end of the season and we go to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tobin: ``This makes us a better team. We're in kind of a
unique situation here. Last week we signed (cornerback) J.B. Brown,
and we put him in the game after he'd practiced about seven snaps
with us. This week we're going to play a guy who hasn't even been
on the field with us. I guess this sets back coaching a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it advances the players' faith in ownership. Quarterback
Jake Plummer seemed to speak for the team on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just proves to a lot of guys that, even though this took
longer than we thought, the team is committed to winning,'' Plummer
said. ``It shows that the Cardinals will step up and take
responsibility and do what is right to help the team.'' &QL;

MOURNING A FALLEN BROTHER  
 SIBLING'S DEATH HARD ON COWBOYS SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ten months later, Dallas Cowboys safety Kenny
Wheaton's pain hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton, a Tempe McClintock High School product, still can't get
his younger brother, Derrek, off his mind. It has consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about him 24 hours a day,'' Wheaton said. ``It will be
that way as long as I'm alive. Not a day will pass by when I'm not
thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   He still gets chills thinking about the phone call he received
in Dallas on Nov. 20. It was 3 a.m., and his older brother, Robert,
called to tell him that Derrek, 19, had been murdered outside a
Phoenix convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only get three hours of sleep every night, maximum,
because of the incident,'' Wheaton said. ``I have nightmares. It's
hard for me to do anything at night except sit there and think
about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton still can't understand why his brother was gunned down.
Family members told him it was a case of mistaken identity, but
that hasn't made it any easier for Wheaton, who will be with the
Cowboys today when they open their season against the Cardinals at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a happy person,'' Wheaton said of Derrek. ``He
always had a smile on his face. His friends called him `Sunshine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my coaches at McClintock. Derrek was the best athlete of
the three. All three of us brothers were very close, as close as
any three you'd ever find.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrek, a freshman cornerback at Phoenix Community College, had
stopped for gas at a convenience store as he returned home from the
school's football banquet. He had won two defensive honors that
night and hoped to transfer to Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a page from his girlfriend, Derrek went to a pay
phone and was on the line when a car pulled through the parking
lot. Gunshots were fired, and Derrek died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a chance to run,'' Wheaton told the ``Dallas''
``Morning News.'' ``He didn't know what hit him because he had his
back turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Wheaton's frustration is that the case is unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Phoenix) police, they're so full of it. They give us the
runaround,'' Wheaton said. ``They haven't told us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police spokesman Mike McCullough said he understands the
family's frustration but said the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leads we learn of are still being worked by homicide
investigators,'' McCullough said. ``At this point, it's too early
to explain to the family as far as who, what, when and where.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members claim the police have been slow to follow up on
tips because they consider the shooting to be gang-related and
difficult to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was not the type of person to hurt a soul,''
Wheaton said. ``Anyone who knew him could vouch that he's not in
any gang.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his family isn't doing well. ``I try to help
financially,'' he said. ``I try to be there for them. As hard as it
is on the entire family, they still are supportive. They come to
the games. They'll always still be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton wears D.K.W (his brother's initials) RIP on his practice
uniform. It's written with a felt-tipped marker, but it might as
well be etched indelibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear it every practice,'' Wheaton said. ``When I need
strength, when I'm tired or when I'm down, I put my right hand on
my chest and get that strength from touching his initials.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton also has taped his brother's obituary to his locker and
carries his picture with him at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wonder how you can always be thinking about him
and focus on what you do. It's possible. I think about him every
time I'm on the field, lifting weights. I think about him in
between plays. I think about him every day, all day.'' &QL;

DOVE HUNT BRIGHTENS NEAR TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The opening of dove season is sort of like comparing Mexican
restaurants. Some are more adventurous than others.
</P>
<P>
   The dove season opened Tuesday. My singing-chicken alarm clock
woke me at 2 a.m. At first, I thought I'd shoot it before I started
on doves. But, no, the chicken asks me to get up and dance.
Anything that asks me to dance can't be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the beginning of the adventure. About 2:45 a.m. I
stopped at a filling station, dressed in camouflage clothing. The
attendant gave me the rooster look, so to speak, wondering if I was
some kind of nut. I obliged by acting like one.
</P>
<P>
   By 3 a.m., I was on Loop 101 heading for Interstate 10. That's
when the two cars, one chasing the other, headed toward me, pulled
onto the shoulder and pulled in front of me. That's also when I saw
the flashes. The people in the cars were shooting at each another.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned around and came back toward me. I had a shotgun
in my truck but never thought about it. All I could think about was
ramming the gas pedal and getting out of there, which I did.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on toward the Harquahala Valley, an agricultural
area west of Phoenix where doves have flourished this year.
</P>
<P>
   The host was philanthropist rancher Bill O'Brien, who was having
a charity shoot for his favorite organization _ the Wendy Paine
O'Brien Foundation, a haven for troubled youths. It's named after
his late daughter.
</P>
<P>
   We met at Tonopah Joe's Truck Stop for breakfast, then we headed
for the fields.
</P>
<P>
   The area had been scouted for doves. But this morning, the rain
was falling. The flight would be late. O'Brien had three fields in
mind. The one he picked had desert terrain on one side of the road
and a fallow crop field on the other.
</P>
<P>
   By about 5:30 a.m. we were standing in the fields. I can't
remember seeing more doves. I had my limit of 10 before 7 a.m.
Others shot their due number of shells but didn't do the same. But
by 9 a.m. we had enough for a sumptuous meal.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Michael De Maria and his staff had agreed to cook a dove
feast. He is the chief chef for Michael's Restaurant at Pinnacle
Peak Road and Pima Road. He slept in while others hunted but was
well prepared by 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   All the doves we shot were small. Bruce Taubert, a deputy
director of the Arizona Game and Fish Department, said that was a
good sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means we've had good dove reproduction,'' he said. ``These
are birds that have been bred here. It bodes well for another good
dove population next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at O'Brien's Eagle Tail Ranch _ more than 500,000 acres of
it _ chef De Maria was getting ready.
</P>
<P>
   The adobe ranch house with a Persian cooling system (a tower
that naturally evaporates water into cool air) was awaiting.
</P>
<P>
   De Maria served a fabulous salad, barley, asparagus, glazed
carrots and dove breasts cooked in juniper. It was unbelievable.
The crusty bread served with the meal was the best I've ever eaten.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said he raised at least $450 for the Wendy Paine O'Brien
Foundation and perhaps a lot more.
</P>
<P>
   Gunfight aside, it was among the best experiences I've ever
had. &QL;

ALREADY PLAYING CATCH-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Pfffffft.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of a championship bubble bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Thud.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of a football team crashing back to reality.
</P>
<P>
   A football team that stubbed its collective toe on Saturday,
tripping over its lofty expectations. A football team that snatched
defeat from the jaws of victory, watching a pivotal game slip
through its fingers.
</P>
<P>
   A football team that watched a conference rival celebrate on its
turf.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils wake up in the cellar this morning, and the
reflection in the mirror will be painful. They squandered a
14-point lead. They broke down in the second half. They engaged in
a track meet and lost. They fought back on the heroics of J.R.
Redmond and Ryan Kealy, only to give it all back in one improbable
moment.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the season only a few days old, they're already
playing catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the field, the new motto _ Playing With Fire _ is
posted on a fence. It is meant to describe the passion demanded by
Coach Bruce Snyder. On Saturday, it was symbolic of a 42-38 loss to
the Washington Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts fumbled. They committed a few costly penalties. They
did everything they could to help the visitors prevail, including
the worst of all digressions: allowing 63-yard touchdown pass from
Brock Huard on 4th-and-17 with only 28 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terribly disappointing to all of us,'' Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Much was expected of ASU this season. The players talked of a
national title. Of playing at home, in the Fiesta Bowl, for the big
prize. Those expectations should be tempered just a bit, because
until they shore up a porous, peanut brittle defense, they are
nowhere near contention.
</P>
<P>
   In the fog of defeat, there are glimmers of hope. Despite a
costly fumble, Redmond willed his way into a 61-yard punt return
that set up ASU's final touchdown. And despite a barrage of blitzes
in the second half, Kealy displayed the poise of a championship
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the three touchdown passes. It wasn't the 302 yards
passing, a new career high. It was simply the execution under
duress.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing, 35-31, the Sun Devils marched to the Washington 8. On
second down, Kealy rifled a pass that went through the arms of Matt
Cercone in the end zone. On fourth down, he fired a perfect strike
to Tariq McDonald, a boyhood pal, appearing to save the night.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a quarterback with one of the strangest nicknames
you'll ever hear.
</P>
<P>
   Stinky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't clean his locker,'' Snyder said. ``And he still
doesn't comb his hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, not much has changed since Kealy's performance over
the final six games of 1997, where he threw 11 touchdowns and only
three interceptions, when he capped the finest season ever posted
by a freshman quarterback at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is more confident and he knows our system better, but
there's an edge to that,'' Snyder said. ``There's an edge when
you're expected to be good. Can you live up to that? There was a
point in camp when he was pressing like hell, and it was because of
that. Because of the expectations. He worked through it, and now
he's overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   The real concern with Kealy is his legs, and whether he'll be
the Danny Manning of college football. He tore a ligament in his
right knee in the final game of last season, matching an injury he
suffered to his left knee the previous year. In his first real
test, he survived quite nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot in the last two years,'' Kealy said.
``But I have all the confidence in the world bouncing back from
this injury. I think there will be more pressure on me to make
plays this year. But everyone has more experience. Last year, I
didn't have much confidence because I hadn't succeeded at this
level. Now, I know what I can do, what I can't do, what I'm
supposed to do. I have a better idea of what my role is on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is good.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if he can do something about the nickname. And a defense
worthy of his moniker. &QL;

FORCED OVERTIME PUSHING THEM TO THE LIMIT, WORKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time his 15-year career with Albertson's stores ended,
Richard Sorrells knew the extra hours at work were taking their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come home grumping and griping _ I was stressed'' after
routinely putting in at least 10 hours of extra work a week, said
Sorrells, now a Glendale business owner. ``I've got a 4-year-old
daughter. She doesn't need to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sorrells, Americans are feeling as overworked as ever this
Labor Day. Frustrated by working too many hours _ both paid and
unpaid _ they are sometimes grabbing headlines by battling the
corporations whose profits depend on their extra work.
</P>
<P>
   From a national lawsuit filed against Albertson's grocery stores
to the recent US West strike, the number of hours spent on the job
is a flash point for employee discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with America today _ all these companies do
is look at the bottom line,'' Sorrells said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 34,000 US West employees in 13 states returned to
work after a 15-day strike protesting salaries, benefits and the
telephone giant's policy of forcing long hours of overtime work.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement hammered out over the weekend would cap
the amount of weekly overtime that phone company employees are
required to work at 16 hours next year and 8 hours in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few national statistics documenting use of
overtime or legal challenges of employer overtime policies, one of
the few measures devised by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
suggests that we are, in fact, working more overtime than we used
to.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1988, U.S. factory employees worked an average of 3.9
hours of overtime a week. By July 1998, Bureau of Labor figures
show, it was 4.8 hours a week, an increase of more than 25 percent
and near the all-time high of 4.9 set five times in 1997 and once
this year.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona survey of local communications and public utilities
industries found employees working an average of 42 hours a week in
1997. So far this year, it's 43.7 hours, while 10 years ago, it was
42.3 hours. &QL; 
OVERTIME LOSES APPEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Americans are feeling overworked, chances are it's because
they often are. But it isn't necessarily new. As early as 1992,
Harvard University economist Juliet Schor warned in her bestseller,
``The Overworked American,'' that heavier workloads were making
Americans surly and wishful for simpler lives.
</P>
<P>
   Where once overtime was viewed as a good way to earn extra
bucks, it is now often seen as a stressful drain on leisure or
family time. And it may not be as good a financial deal as it once
seemed: The Cato Institute, a national think-tank, concluded last
year that the average employee loses much of their gains from
overtime pay to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And workers who build a lifestyle around overtime pay may have
trouble scaling back when overtime evaporates. Some companies ask
managers to warn employees about the dangers of basing their
standard of living on overtime pay. &QL; 
MARKET FORCES OVERTIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the use of overtime by employers continues unabated, the
longer hours coming as a logical economic consequence of today's
labor market, said Peter Hom, professor of management at Arizona
State University and an expert on compensation administration.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is low. The economy is strong. To keep up with
demand for their products, employers must either pay more to hire
and train new workers, or ask current workers to work longer.
</P>
<P>
   It's cheaper to pay employees overtime than it is to hire new
workers in a tight market, then provide benefits.
</P>
<P>
   International forces have spurred changes in the domestic labor
market as well. With offshore competition and what Hom calls
``variable pay practices'' becoming more common _ special benefits,
flexible shifts and such _ competition is stiff for new, reasonably
priced employees.
</P>
<P>
   If overtime seems painful to workers, Hom says, there is a
benefit: When the economy shrinks, companies are less likely to lay
off employees if they relied on overtime instead of hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side, he adds, is a decline in employee
satisfaction. A 500-employee survey Hom conducted for a national
retail chain found that heavy overtime led to employee discontent
and disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are feeling greater work-family conflicts,'' Hom
said. And it isn't simply among women, who traditionally felt
sharper conflicts between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   Hom said men and women also complain about conflicts with other
off-time activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conflict seems to be of great concern to employees _ the
infringement of personal time,'' Hom said. ``It's going to lead
employees to quit employment (and look) for other employers with a
more friendly environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflict often exists for managers, most of whom are
not covered by the overtime regulations but have to work long hours
as well. Their stress often is compounded by having to continually
ask more of overworked subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have family lives, too,'' said Bill Ankrom, vice
president of the Western region for Methods West, a Phoenix
machine-tool company. If managers' morale slips, so too will that
of other workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ankrom said the manufacturing industry is rife these days with
examples of companies whose cadre of managers are unhappy, and the
unhappiness spreads to workers at large. Methods West has avoided
problems, he said, by offering bonuses to managers working long
hours without overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The situation appears no different among government workers.
Angel Rodriguez, field representative for Council 97 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
his union often hears complaints about overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles, for example,
Rodriguez said the department responded to complaints about long
customer lines and poor service by calling on employees to work
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The agency budget is limited, so overtime workers are offered
``flex time'' _ coming to work an hour or two later the day after
overtime is worked _ rather than overtime pay or compensatory time
off that is accrued and taken later.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said many state employees don't like flex time because
it does not allow them to schedule compensatory time off to mesh
with their personal schedules.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially vexing for employees with children. Overtime
work upsets child-care routines, and flex time is usually offered
at times when employees cannot make up for time lost with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees suffer, because they don't find family life
satisfying, they have to adjust their child care and it creates
some problems,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the practice is legal. Federal laws allow employers to use
flex time to ensure workers do not work more than 40 hours a week.
Unlike private-sector workers, government employees can be forced
to take time off in lieu of overtime pay. &QL; 
FEWER WORKER COMPLAINTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Albertson's case aside, it is unclear whether the longer
hours have led to in an upswing in legal challenges. Some experts
believe lawsuits are on the rise because workers no longer fear
reprisals _ they know they can find new jobs in the booming job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the U.S. Department of Labor saw a steady decrease in
worker complaints filed during this decade. From 1989 to 1997, for
example, the number of wage-and-hour complaints filed with the
department declined about 45 percent to 34,649 from 63,965.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Nutini, a labor lawyer at the Phoenix law firm of Lewis &AMP;
Roca, suspects workers who feel they are being mistreated simply
walk away from their jobs, knowing they can be easily re-employed
in the current economy.
</P>
<P>
   But John Fraser, acting administrator of the Labor Department's
wage and hour division, thinks employees are worrying about job
security and as a result, are less likely to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a good labor market, Fraser argued, workers increasingly
find themselves in ``contingent work relationships'' _ holding jobs
under contract or under limitations imposed by employers. Simply
put, they don't think challenging their employer is a safe option.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases now litigated by the Labor Department are identified
by the department itself by aiming enforcement at specific
industries. The department's hot list these days includes the
agriculture, garment and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   With one month left in the federal fiscal year, the Arizona
district office has brought 699 overtime or minimum wage cases,
recovering $3.9 million in back wages for employees. The number of
cases is fewer than in past years, mirroring a national decline
blamed on long slide in the size of the Labor Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime violations typically result from employees being paid
regular wages for overtime, or being told to take time off in lieu
of legally required payment, said Cynthia Watson, the Labor
Department's Arizona District director.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not limit the overtime work employers may
demand, provided that non-salaried workers are paid at least 1{
times their normal wage for more 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Routine violations often make the job of labor organizers easier
because employees have common complaints against what they see as
an unfair employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the major issues in organizing workplaces,''
said Jim McLaughlin, Phoenix market-share coordinator for the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. ``They're trying to
squeeze every dime out of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFCW has helped current and former Albertson's employees _
both union and non-union _ sue the company, claiming they were
routinely expected to put in extra time on the job, but off the
clock. A federal judge has been asked to certify it as a national
class-action lawsuit, expanding it to include nearly 7,000 employee
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Read, Albertson's executive vice president for public
affairs, called the claims ``absolutely false'' and said company
policy ``is very clear and unequivocal. Off-the-clock work is
clearly not policy. It is not expected, and frankly, not
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells _ one of the lawsuit's original plaintiffs and one of
five from Arizona _ was liquor department manager for a Glendale
Albertson's when he was fired last year. Albertson's accused him of
not performing certain duties, duties he says were impossible to
fulfill during regular working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sorrells runs his own cleaning business and he calls his
firing a blessing. He sets his own hours. When he works longer, he
takes home more money. His income is slightly higher than before.
His family life is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the fourth or fifth day (after being fired), my wife said,
`Man, you're so much nicer,' '' he said. &QL;

WAGNER CREDITED FOR WORK IN RETURN TO INJURY SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Try as he might,  &UR; Tony Batista couldn't pull the
rabbit out of the hat for the Diamondbacks this time.
</P>
<P>
   The infielder had come up with more than his share of heroics,
including a home run and triple in a 2-1, 11-inning victory over
the Pirates in Pittsburgh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's game in the 12th inning, Batista felt the heat
as the third and final strikeout victim of Houston left-hander
 &UR; Billy
 &UR; Wagner as the Astros recorded a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it works for you, sometimes it doesn't,'' he said.
``We'll just have to try to do better the next time. He (Wagner)
was throwing very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a triumph within a triumph for Wagner, who during the
Astros' previous visit to Bank One Ballpark on July 15 was struck
in the left side of his head by a line drive off the bat of Arizona
catcher  &UR; Kelly Stinnett.
</P>
<P>
   A walk to Stinnett, who hit in the order just before Batista,
was the only blemish against Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I hate to say it because we lost, you have to be
happy for Billy Wagner that he was able to come back and pitch
again,'' Diamondbacks  &UR; Manager Buck Showalter said. &QL; 
3 million fans &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks drew 43,638 fans Saturday, bringing their
season total to 2,985,344, meaning they will reach the 3 million
mark in today's finale of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The team is averaging 44,559 after 67 home dates, third in the
major leagues behind Colorado and Baltimore. &QL; 
Still closed &QL; 
Although the temperature has cooled a bit, team officials say the
retractable roof will remain closed for the rest of this homestand
(through Wednesday) and perhaps for the next homestand (Sept.
14-20). The team hopes to have the roof open for the final three
games of the season against the San Diego Padres on Sept. 25-27. &QL; 
Almost ready? &QL; 
Right-hander  &UR; Bobby Chouinard, on the disabled list since Aug. 22
because of tightness in his shoulder, is expected to pitch in a
rehabilitation assignment for Triple-A Tucson today and could
rejoin the big club later this week. &QL; 
Silent auction &QL; 
The wives of Diamondbacks players will hold a silent auction on
Monday between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. at Bank One Ballpark's Cox
Communications Clubhouse to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy
Association. &QL;

HOME RUN CHASE BRINGS INCREASED SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While most of the free world follows every sneeze from &UR; Mark
 &UR; McGwire, some people that are paid to be very nervous follow the
slugger's every move.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has assigned two security people to act as
McGwire's bodyguards as the assault on home run No. 62 continues.
They follow him home, go out with him and even escort him off the
team charter when it arrives in St. Louis, taking him down the
jetway instead of through the airport like the rest of his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, fearing a worst-case scenario, even has
asked the FBI to place undercover agents at Busch Stadium this
weekend. It's all precautionary but also shows the society we live
in today.
</P>
<P>
   Not wanting to get into a situation where several fans say they
have one of McGwire's famous home run balls,  &UR; Kevin Hallinan, head
of major league security, has set up guards in the most likely
areas where the slugger's home runs might land.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hallinan will personally place an unknown mark on
the batch of balls to be used once McGwire has 61 home runs, which
will allow baseball officials to distinguish the authenticity of
what will become the most famous baseball in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say this: We are confident we will be able to
identify that ball,'' Hallinan said. &QL; 
Is hell freezing? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly whispers at this point, but a silent minority is
wondering what has happened to  &UR; Greg Maddux in the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a slam dunk for the National League Cy Young Award a
month ago, Maddux has become very mortal. The four-time Cy Young
winner is 5-5 since the All-Star break. In his last start, a highly
anticipated match-up against Houston's  &UR; Randy Johnson, Maddux
allowed 10 hits, three home runs, as he and the Braves lost to the
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has allowed 31 hits in his past 26 innings. His ERA over
his past five games is 6.33. Possibly the most amazing statistic of
the past month is that Maddux has allowed three home runs in a game
twice in his past three starts. Maddux hadn't done that in his
first 392 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about it,'' Maddux said. ``I haven't been
pitching good. I've been up. I've been over the plate. I've been
behind. I gave up some runs (against Houston last week). I could
have given up some more runs very easily.'' &QL; 
Now it can be told &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's  &UR; Vladimir Guerrero, possibly the best young player in
the game today, was signed after an Expos scout saw one at-bat of
the then-16-year-old at a tryout camp in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fred Ferreira, Montreal's director of international operations,
is the scout who saw Guerrero arrive on the back of a motorcycle
and practically plead to join the tryout. Ferreira happily agreed.
</P>
<P>
   While the rest is history, Guerrero was despondent that day
after he pulled a groin muscle while running to first base after
hitting the first pitch he saw that afternoon under the intense
Dominican Republic sun.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day, Guerrero ran a 60-yard dash in 6.6 seconds,
which was more impressive considering he was wearing two different
shoes, one several sizes larger with a rag stuffed into the toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the players were telling me I should talk to this kid,''
Ferreira said. ``The first thing we had him do was throw, and right
away you could see he could really throw. He was really distraught
(after the injury), sitting over in the dugout with his head
between his legs. I went over and talked to him, tried to cheer him
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferreira signed Guerrero that afternoon. One side note: The
Dodgers had checked out Guerrero earlier that year and rejected him
as too skinny and too slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the tools,'' Ferreira said. ``You always look for the
tools. It always seems to me that he's like a guy playing
slow-pitch softball when everyone else is playing hardball. He's
just standing there saying, `C'mon, man, throw one over the plate.'
'' &QL; 
Dodger blues &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not only is closer  &UR; Jeff Shaw's season unraveling, as his three
blown saves in his past four chances demonstrate, but the Dodgers
appear to have no chance to make interim General Manager  &UR; Tommy
Lasorda's guarantee of a playoff berth come true.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who entered the weekend only one game over .500
since the  &UR; Bill Russell- &UR; Fred Claire dumpings, were eight games
behind the Chicago Cubs in the wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   Their chances were basically tossed in the trash once  &UR; Gary
 &UR; Sheffield's season ended last weekend because of a severely
sprained left ankle, an injury that will take six weeks to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Also out for the season is reliever  &UR; Antonio Osuna, who will
undergo arthroscopic elbow surgery this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield batted .316 with 16 home runs and 57 RBIs in 90 games
since Florida made the blockbuster trade with the Dodgers, and
finished at .302, 22 home runs, 85 RBIs and 22 stolen bases for the
season. It was Sheffield's first 20-20 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fans, or anyone on the outside, say this is frustrating
for them, well, magnify that 1,000 times for us,'' first baseman
 &UR; Eric
 &UR; Karros said. ``We've had opportunities. We get right to that point
where there's a game we have to win, and the bottom line is that we
don't get it done.'' &QL; 
No mas &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado outfielder  &UR; Dante Bichette, a spokesman for a
nutritional company that produces the controversial supplement
androstenedione, has decided to stop using the controversial pills.
</P>
<P>
   Bichette will continue to use other supplements from the company
and will continue to commercially endorse other EAS products.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say I won't get back on (andro) down the road a
little bit,'' Bichette said. ``But I want it understood that I
still believe very strongly in what they're doing at EAS. Those
guys are trying to provide a safe alternative (to steroids).
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason (I stopped taking andro) is just all the junk that
has come out with it. I just don't want to promote something that
everybody's all scared about. I'll wait until some more research is
done, but I still think it's a safe supplement.'' &QL;

KICKOFF COVERAGE LACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Arizona State Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder has fretted for
months about his team's kicker and punter, both of whom are new,
but both performed reasonably well Saturday against Washington. The
kickoff coverage team, however, could use some work.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stephen Baker, &UR; a freshman, handled the kickoff chores well,
placing the ball relatively deep. His first try went into the end
zone, but it was called back because of illegal procedure on the
Sun Devils. His next attempt landed at the 2, but Washington's  &UR; Joe
Jarzynka returned it 42 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The net gain of 24 yards helped Washington score on its first
drive. Washington's  &UR; Ja'Warren Hooker later returned a kickoff 61
yards, and ASU seemed to give up kicking deep. Baker pooched one
kick, which ASU recovered, setting up its fourth touchdown of the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had only one punt attempt in the first half and boomed it
55 yards. Place kicker Mike Gauthier missed a 42-yard field goal
attempt near the end of the first half and made a 42-yarder in the
fourth-quarter. &QL; 
A fast start &QL; 
Pac-10 Commissioner  &UR; Tom Hansen, &UR; who attended Saturday night's
game, has been impressed by the conference's performance in the
opening week of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Arizona beat Hawaii, Oregon beat Michigan State and
Washington State beat Illinois. Oregon State also won its opener
over Nevada. The major disappointment was Stanford, which lost to
San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought before the season we'd have two really fine teams in
UCLA and Arizona State,'' he said. ``And I thought from Oregon,
USC, Washington and Arizona, we would happen to find some other
teams that were very, very good. And that's been the case so far.
This is a fine Washington team on offense, and Arizona played a
very strong game, and Oregon was just outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that I said at media day that's been so true is we
have just some outstanding quarterbacks. These two here (ASU's
 &UR; Ryan Kealy and Washington's  &UR; Brock Huard) are sensational.'' &QL; 
Flag bearer &QL; 
Backup quarterback  &UR; Steve Campbell was awarded the honor of
carrying the team's flag and leading the Sun Devils out of the
locker room before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bruce Snyder bestows the honor on a senior who shows a
commitment to the team. Campbell, a senior, is either second or
third team. Snyder hasn't made that clear. If starter Kealy had to
be replaced, it's possible Snyder could chose redshirt freshman
 &UR; Chad
 &UR; Elliott instead of Campbell. &QL; 
Briefly &QL; 
Washington receiver/kick returner Hooker suffered a partially
separated left shoulder during the first quarter and didn't return
to action. Hooker suffered the injury on a 61-yard kickoff return
in the first quarter. His prognosis for the rest of the season was
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker means a lot to the Huskies offense. He was the NCAA
indoor 55-meter champion last spring and is one of the fastest
players in the country. A sophomore, he was expected to be one of
the most exciting players in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies didn't seem to miss him much Saturday. Receiver
 &UR; Dane
 &UR; Looker caught 8 passes for 85 yards and a touchdown in the first
half alone. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game will be replayed at 4 p.m. today on Fox Sports
Arizona cable network. &QL;

HEAP SHINES IN DEBUT  
 FRESHMAN MAKES 1-HANDED TD SNAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Todd Heap has a tough act to follow.
</P>
<P>
   His own.
</P>
<P>
   Barely four months out of Mesa Mountain View High School, in his
first college game, on his first college play, Heap made the catch
of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a leaping, falling, juggling, one-handed grab in the end
zone, with not one but two defenders belting him in midair.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough for Arizona State as the Sun Devils lost to
Washington, 42-38, on Saturday on opening night for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen playing in their first game usually are supposed to
watch and learn and stay out of the way. Heap, apparently, is a
somewhat unusual freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he has two nicknames. ASU Coach Bruce Snyder calls the
6-foot-5, 220-pound Heap ``The Retriever.'' John Pettas, ASU
quarterbacks coach, calls him ``Jim Thorpe, All-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the description, Heap lived up to it on a single play,
retrieving a Ryan Kealy pass in the back of the end zone. Heap
tipped the ball, took a hit from defenders Marques Hairston and
Toure Butler and hooked the ball with his right hand while falling
down. The catch, worthy of any All-American, capped a 14-play,
71-yard drive and gave ASU a 14-7 lead with 2:19 left in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just glad to be in the game,'' said Heap, whose uncle
and grandfather played basketball for ASU. ``Kealy put it up. . . .
I didn't think he was going to throw it. But he put it up, and I
got a hand on it. I just saw the ball coming, and I had to make the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody else had a chance to get it but me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game where the big plays practically outnumbered the small
plays, this might not have been the biggest. But it certainly was
the most spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Heap was ``The Republi''c's Class 5A Player of the Year last
season, a terror at tight end and linebacker for Mountain View. But
this wasn't Westwood High on a Friday night in Mesa in front of
friends and family. This was Pac-10 rival Washington in Sun Devil
Stadium on a Saturday night in front of 72,118, many of whom
perhaps never had heard of Heap.
</P>
<P>
   They have now.
</P>
<P>
   And they had better enjoy Heap's work while they can. He is
expected to serve a Mormon mission for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devil Stadium has provided the launching pad for many
careers. Among those who started there is Washington quarterback
Brock Huard, who came in as a freshman two years ago and rallied
the Huskies before ASU prevailed, 45-42.
</P>
<P>
   In his return engagement, Huard, now a junior and a Heisman
Trophy candidate, exacted some payback, passing for 318 yards and
four touchdowns to lead Washington's upset.
</P>
<P>
   Heap wasn't the only ASU freshman who contributed. Tailback
Davaren Hightower, who redshirted last year while recovering from a
broken leg, scored the first touchdown of his career, a two-yard
run in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baker, who also redshirted last year, handled punting
and kickoff duties. His first punt went 55 yards (he later added a
35-yarder) and successfully pooched an onside kickoff. It was
recovered by Kyion Grayes, a first-year freshman.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a touchdown and a 28-14 lead for ASU in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But ASU's offense fizzled in the face of a newfound Huskies pass
rush, and the Sun Devils had no answers for Huard and the
Washington offense. &QL;

2-QB SYSTEM LIKELY TO CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _  &UR; Keith Smith and  &UR; Ortege Jenkins are two
quarterbacks in a system instead of a race.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   Or forever.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's season-opening victory on Thursday night at Hawaii was
nothing if not further evidence that coach &UR; Dick Tomey will continue
to rely on both for as long as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The whole season?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what may happen,' Tomey said after Smith helped lead
Arizona to a 27-6 victory. ``OJ's going to keep playing. Keith is
going to keep playing. We're trying to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith emerged as a leader in this mini-drama as the Wildcats
prepare for a Pacific-10 Conference opener on Sept. 12 at Stanford,
which was upset Saturday, 35-23, by San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Smith came on in relief of Jenkins, who struggled in the opening
quarter at Aloha Stadium. But Smith spoke as if he were prepared
for the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``OJ and I were talking on the sidelines about if we don't start
right, one of us automatically has to pick it up,'' said Smith, who
was 17 of 22 for 218 yards passing as opposed to Jenkins' 3 of 11
for 19 yards. ``You can't guarantee you're going to be great all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be off in some games, and that's when he has to
step in and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins wasn't looking for excuses.

   ``I just didn't get things going,'' he said. ``Keith did a great
job. he was hot as I'ver seen him.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Trung Canidate, the projected starter at running back from
Central High, is expected to practice this week after undergoing
rehabilitation for a stress fracture to his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Tomey, who was unhappy with a spotty running
game at Hawaii. ``We tried to get him to do things in rehab that
are tougher than he'll face in a game. If Hawaii had been the last
game in his career, I think he could have played.'' &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of Arizona's loudest fans Thursday night were from the crew
of the USS Tucson, a submarine stationed at nearby Peral Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. The Wildcats were not expecting Stanford's
loss to San Jose State. The Cardinal has a new offensive
coordinator. ``I'm not expecting them to show too much against San
Jose State,'' Tomey said Saturday before the upset. Tomey didn't
know how prophetic he was.
</P>
<P>
   And do-it-all  &UR; Chris McAlister was seen running to the Aloha
Stadium locker room midway through the game. He was moving almost
as fast as he did in the 100-yard touchdown return of the game's
opening kickoff. Trouble? Not really. As McAlister explained it, he
was under pressure from having consumed too much liquid before
kickoff. &QL;

5 CONTENDERS STILL IN HUNT FOR 2 SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 baseball season will end three weeks from today. In the
meantime, there are two hotly-contested playoff races taking place.
</P>
<P>
   While five of the six division races are practically over, the
American League West and the National League wild-card races have
five clubs vying for two postseason spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like being in a pennant race,'' said St. Louis
Manager Tony La Russa. ``It's the ultimate test for every member of
a club. You go through the highs, the lows and when it's over,
especially if you've won or made a spirited run, you feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the time, there was no telling the members of the 1993
San Francisco Giants about the good they had done for the game by
winning 103 games and pushing the Atlanta Braves to 104 victories
and an NL West championship.
</P>
<P>
   The players, coaching staff and manager were despondent on the
day they were trounced in Los Angeles on the last day of the
season, knowing Atlanta had already won. No amount of consoling
could lift the spirits of the Giants that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who put on as good a show as baseball has seen, were
spent, all because they had put everything out for six months and
come away with no more than a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Battling for a postseason spot in baseball has always meant
more, because the sport has so few playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three years ago, with the addition of the wild card,
that the game allowed a second place team to reach the playoffs.
Securing a playoff spot in baseball meant more because a club had
to finish in first place to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why baseball has such a special spot,'' said
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter, who guided the 1995 New York
Yankees to the playoffs. ``What you do in April and May matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike basketball and hockey, where 16 clubs make the playoffs,
or football, where 12 make it, baseball allows only eight of its 30
to move on.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to the 1995 Mariners-Angels race, the
Braves-Giants race of 1993 was probably the last great one in the
game. But no matter if a race is great or not, just being in a
playoff race is special.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim and Texas are scrapping for the final spot in the AL
playoffs while the NL wild-card race, which looks like a dandy at
this stage, is being fought by the Giants, Chicago Cubs and New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty is that only one of those clubs in each race will
play beyond Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who were surprising the baseball world by pulling
away from Texas in the past few weeks, received their gut-check in
the form of a major injury.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, easily the best all-around player on the Angels
roster, pulled up lame last week while running to first base. A
severe hamstring injury may keep him out of the lineup the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this season is a test, I want to know when you pass, when
it's finally over,'' Anaheim Manager Terry Collins told Angels
writers last week. ``I've had enough of it. It's time for us to get
some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming breaks has always been a part of baseball. The true
character of a club rarely surfaces until it is met with adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Angels will find out what makes them tick over the next
three weeks. The Angels and Texas will play five times in the
coming weeks. They will be games that will be engulfed with playoff
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem for whoever wins the final two playoff
spots is being emotionally empty when the postseason begins. It was
a problem that definitely affected the 1993 Braves, who were
eliminated by Philadelphia, clearly inferior, in the first round
that season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience of reaching the playoffs has always
out-weighted whatever side effects getting there might create.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like a playoff game,'' said Baltimore
shortstop Mike Bordick, who has played in the post-season for
Oakland the Orioles. ``The intensity of the games is incredible.
It's rare for any regular season game to measure up to what you
feel in the playoffs. It's the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they're fighting for. &QL;

GONNA LEAVE YOU, BABE  
 MCGWIRE TIES RUTH'S 60; MARIS NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - Baseball's highly exclusive 60-home run club
admitted its third member Saturday afternoon when Mark McGwire
ripped a 381-foot line drive into the left-field seats at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is now in the company of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, the
only other men ever to hit 60 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he is also the oldest player to reach 60. Ruth was 32
when he hit 60 in 1927, and Maris was 27 when he set the record of
61 in 1961. That only three players in the 129-year history of the
game have reached this milestone helps deliver some perspective of
exactly how difficult this feat is.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's afternoon began brilliantly when he laced a flat
fastball, the third pitch he'd seen from Cincinnati starter Dennis
Reyes, over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 47,994, which had already been standing
when McGwire was announced, roared its approval with a deafening
sound for all of downtown St. Louis to hear.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went hitless in his other three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unbelievable,'' McGwire said of the phenomena he has
created. ``What can you say? If you want to say it has brought
America together, it has. So be it. Let's just ride the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen!
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Manager Jack McKeon was asked after the game if, with
first base open and runners at second and third, he contemplated
walking McGwire in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I thought about it,'' the crusty McKeon said. ``But I
also thought about all those people who have been calling my voice
mail asking me to heal the country. So I decided to heal the
country, and we pitched to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is unleashing its mystic powers in all the right ways
these days. All the talk of the recent strikes has basically been
eliminated. The focus is where it should have been all along _ on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has indeed returned to its proper place, and McGwire
isn't just part of the bandwagon, he's driving the sucker.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NFL season will begin today, and while football's
television ratings will once again tower over baseball's, don't let
that be the true barometer of which is the hotter sport.
</P>
<P>
   Because baseball plays so many games, its TV ratings will always
be smaller. What McGwire and Sammy Sosa are doing for the game this
summer can never be measured by how many households are watching
what.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is back at the top of the heap precisely because of
McGwire's personal charge on the single-season home run record. No
other sport captivates the country's attention quite like baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? How many of you know the record for most yards in an
NFL season? How about most points in an NBA season? It's a good bet
very few know.
</P>
<P>
   However, just bring up the number 56 or 61 or 755, and any
baseball fan will be able to recite in order: Joe DiMaggio's
hitting streak, Maris' single-season home run record and Hank
Aaron's career home run total.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game steeped in tradition and interwoven into the very
roots of our society. Even nearby societies, especially in Latin
America, have adopted the national pastime of the United States as
theirs, too.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's quest for 61 has flooded all of our memories with
everything we have always loved about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it's very cool to be an avid baseball fan again.
Earlier this year, Commissioner Bud Selig predicted the game was in
the early to middle stages of what would amount to a powerful
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about the commish, but the man looks like an
awfully talented prophet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few days, possibly today, McGwire will step
to the head of the single-season home run class. His undeniable
passion for the game practically jumps out when he speaks about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The game is nearing the top of the sports heap once again.
Magical seasons like this don't happen every year. Baseball is new
to our area, but it's important we all sit back and soak in exactly
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is our generation's Babe Ruth. His achievements
have taken a stranglehold on the country unlike anything we've seen
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   As Ruth once notably put it, baseball truly is the greatest game
ever invented. Hallelujah for what's going on right now. &QL;

HE'S GOT ANSWERS 
 BATTING COACH REVIEWS SOSA, MAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jeff Pentland became the Chicago Cubs batting
instructor on July 15 last season and is generally considered the
force behind Sammy Sosa's remarkable and unexpected power assault
on the National League this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pentland lives in Tempe during the off-season. He graduated from
Arizona State in 1968 with a degree in biomechanics and was batting
coach for the Sun Devils in the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning as he prepared to leave for the club's trip to
Pittsburgh, Pentland answered these questions on Mark McGwire,
Sammy Sosa and the home run mania of the 1998 Major League Baseball
season:  &QL; 
 &UR; QUESTION: Are you surprised at Mark McGwire's accomplishments this
year? &QL; 
 &UR; ANSWER: In a way. I've known Mark McGwire since he was in high
school. When I was at Arizona State we competed against him when he
was at Southern Cal. He wasn't that good then, and his early years
of professional ball were not very good. Mark almost didn't make it
to the big leagues. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: What happened?  &QL; 
 &UR; A: To his credit, he had the ability to make adjustments. In fact,
he's made significant adjustments in going from the American League
to the National. He's become a better hitter since going to the
Cardinals.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: How is that?  &QL; 
 &UR; A: The American League is a breaking-ball league. When McGwire was
with Oakland, he tended to hang on his backside so he didn't
transfer his weight nearly as much as he does in the National
League, a fastball league. With Oakland, his swing was loopier and
longer. With the Cardinals, he had to shorten his swing because
they were throwing him fastballs inside.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: Is McGwire so good because he's so big?  &QL; 
 &UR; A: Normally size is not a positive in baseball. Large men with long
arms are at a disadvantage because their swing takes longer, which
gives them less time to read the pitch. McGwire is that rare
combination of power, quickness and coordination.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: Do you think McGwire's accomplishments have been tainted because
of his highly publicized use of the over-the-counter dietary
supplement androstenedione?  &QL; 
 &UR; A: I don't know much about that sort of thing. When I went to
Arizona State, they were talking about blood doping where you save
your blood and re-enter it into your system. It's always something.
But like I said, body building and body-building drugs are not
usually an advantage for hitters.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: How about Sammy? What is he doing differently this season? &QL; 
 &UR; A: Sammy has natural talent, natural easy power, but he was
swinging as hard as he could at every pitch. All I had to do was
convince him to keep his front foot back longer so he could more
effectively explode into the baseball with all his weight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: But for the most part, are home run hitters born rather than
made?  &QL; 
 &UR; A: Major league hitters tend to choose what they want to be. I used
to watch Rod Carew, who was one of the game's best singles hitters.
But when he wanted to, I've seen him put 10 balls in a row over the
fence in batting practice. Same with Wade Boggs. These guys chose
not to be home run hitters. I tell young hitters you can't get
locked into just one specific way of doing something.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: What's the most difficult thing about being a home run hitter? &QL; 
 &UR; A: That's easy. The major stumbling block is the inability to
repeat the same swing the same way every at-bat. Sammy is pretty
amazing that way. He repeats his swing consistently and rarely does
he come out of it.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Q: He's also become more selective? &QL; 
 &UR; A: Sometimes a player's game can all come together by correcting
one flaw. You open up their mind and this opens up their physical
ability. Most of your athletes have no idea how good they are. I
don't think Sammy ever thought he would be here. But once he
realized he was this good, he captured it and ran with it. &QL;

D-BACKS CAN'T SLAM DOOR ON HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks' uniforms should not be stained by
tears of despondence. They have nobody to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They had plenty of opportunities to extend their club-record
winning streak to eight games on Saturday and set an expansion
record in the process. The stark reality is that time after time,
they couldn't come through, leaving the door open for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th inning, the Astros finally slipped through, scoring
on a bases-loaded groundout by Ricky Gutierrez for a 6-5 victory at
Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, the leader in the National League Central Division,
raised its record to 89-53. Arizona fell to 57-86. The teams end
their three-game series today at 4:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first inning and
managed to stay a step ahead of the Astros until the seventh
inning, when a base hit by Sean Berry scored Derek Bell with the
tying run to make it 5-5. Bell had led off the inning with a
bad-hop single that bounced over the head of Arizona second baseman
Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox again figured prominently in Houston's winning effort in the
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou doubled off left-hander Alan Embree with one out.
Embree walked Richard Hidalgo. Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
called on right-hander Felix Rodriguez, who promptly hit Russ
Johnson to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks figured they still had a good chance to escape,
given the fact that Gutierrez had grounded into a team-high 16
double plays. Arizona's infield was set at double-play depth.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez obliged _ sort of. He hit the ball on the ground
toward Fox, but the ball was hit too slowly. Fox came in, saw he
couldn't get Alou at the plate or tag Johnson, then had to spin,
throw and settle for a force-out of Johnson at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing was that the ball wasn't hit that hard. I
was caught in No Man's Land. It was just one of those things,'' Fox
said. ``That just shows that you don't have to hit the ball hard to
be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (winning streak) was a nice run we had, and it would have
been good to keep going, but we just couldn't put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   After Houston pulled to within 3-2 in the top of the second, the
Diamondbacks had two men on base with one out in the bottom of the
inning, but Jay Bell fouled out to Jeff Bagwell at first base, and
Devon White grounded out to Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   A one-run inning in the third could have been more, but Damian
Miller, whose two-out triple drove in David Dellucci, was left
stranded at third as Karim Garcia grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had the bases loaded with nobody out in the fourth but
could only increase its lead from 4-3 to 5-3. Right-hander Scott
Elarton, who entered the game in place of starter Shane Reynolds,
struck out White, retired Lee on an RBI groundout and struck out
Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks stranded two men in the fifth against Elarton
and two more in both the ninth and 10th innings against
right-hander Doug Henry, who pitched at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't score yourself and give them that many
opportunities, things will be difficult for you,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``We just couldn't push one across.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Billy Wagner, who was hit in the head by a line
drive in the Astros' previous visit here in mid-July, retired the
side in order in the 11th and struck out the side in the 12th to
raise his record to 4-3. The only blemish was a walk to Kelly
Stinnett, who hit the line drive that injured him. &QL;

US WEST CUSTOMERS STILL WAITING FOR SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BECKY RAMSDELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 64-year-old Sheila Brown moved from one apartment to
another within her complex last month, she expected to be without a
telephone for about a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the US West strike has left the Phoenix woman, who lives
alone and suffers from chronic asthma attacks and other health
problems, fighting to get her new installation done on an emergency
basis. She's been without phone service for 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the work stoppage, we had a whole bunch more people
define themselves as emergency cases than we normally do,'' US West
spokesman Jim Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   The company typically gives emergency cases priority, but
doesn't formally track how many of those requests are received.
Roof estimated that only a small number of the 500 orders received
daily are labeled emergencies. And it's also hard to tell how many
of those cases are valid emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   What customers define as an emergency situation isn't always
critical in US West's view. For instance, people who are concerned
about elderly parents in another state can't get emergency service,
Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compelling emergency case situation is going to be someone
with a medical condition of significance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers began returning to work last week to tackle a backlog
of 13,000 new orders and several thousand repair orders. New orders
are keeping the backlog at about that number, Roof added. It will
be four to six weeks before the backlog is cleared and orders
return to a normal three- to four-day wait for hookup, he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As a thank-you gesture to US West customers, the company offered
free directory assistance Saturday and Sunday. Company officials
said they didn't know how many customers took advantage of the
offer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crews are now doing more business orders than residential ones
to minimize the financial effects on companies. Some crews were
working specifically on emergencies during the strike, but those
cases are now assigned to the crew working in the area, Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from businesses, `If I can't get my calls, I'm not in
business,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she told US West of her health condition, but added
that it hasn't helped. She said she often wakes up during the
night, choking and struggling to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone, years ago, used to be a luxury. Now it's a
necessity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her friends, Olivia L'Heureux, lives close by and checks
on Brown daily. Both women say the lack of service is the strikers'
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do blame the strikers,'' L'Heureux said. ``I really don't
have a lot of sympathy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A local union leader said he sympathizes with Brown, but US West
has restricted overtime hours for returning workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are permitted only eight overtime hours a week, said Joe
Gosiger, president of Communication Workers of America Local 7019.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have them question why the company, US West, is
limiting the amount of voluntary overtime to our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said the company is limiting overtime because it was one of
the union's biggest issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want to get people back and just load them
up with overtime,'' he said. ``We're trying to be as sensitive as
we can to the Number 1 issue they mentioned again and again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's installation was scheduled for Aug. 20 but was delayed
by the strike. After a series of attempts to get service, Brown
said she was told her order would be taken care of around Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said part of the delay in Brown's case was that she
requested two phone lines. Her first line is scheduled for
installation Tuesday, but Roof said he has requested both lines be

COYOTES SEE GOALIE AS PRIZE CATCH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Patrick DesRochers says he was destined to live his
life around the nets. For the longest time, though, he thought it
would be fishing nets.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Louis, has owned and operated a successful marina on
Georgian Bay, Ontario, ever since he can remember. As a child, he
spent much of his youth fishing off the pier of the family
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've caught just about everything,'' Patrick said. `I really
got pretty good at reeling them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not nearly as good, it turns out, as turning them back.
</P>
<P>
   DesRochers (pronounced DE-row-SHAY) was the top-rated amateur
goalie in North America last season. After posting a 26-17-3 record
with a 3.35 goals-against average and a .901 save percentage for
the Sarnia Sting in the Ontario Hockey league, the Coyotes made the
6-foot-3{, 199-pounder their first-round pick in June's NHL draft.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th overall pick, DesRochers was the first goalie taken.
Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith said the scouting staff liked
him so much that the team was prepared to move up several spots to
snare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid has got it all,'' said Dave Farrish, head coach of
the Coyotes' minor league affiliate in Springfield, Mass., where
DesRochers likely will play in 1999-2000. ``He's got all the
tools.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrish should know. An avid outdoorsman himself, he used to
keep his boats docked at the DesRochers family marina. For years,
young Patrick diligently would gas up the vessel, help keep it in
ship-shape, and even offer fishing tips to the former pro hockey
player.
</P>
<P>
   But DesRochers has turned out to be the prize catch.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since they hooked him, the Coyotes will get a
chance to monitor his progress up close as the team's rookie camp
opens today at the Cellular One Ice Den in Scottsdale. DesRochers,
18, is one of dozens of prospects and various first-year players
who have been invited to attend the weeklong workout before
veterans report next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Others participating include the 1996 first-round draft picks,
center Daniel Briere and defenseman Dan Focht, '97 picks such as
German-born left wing Robert Francz and defensemen Scott McCallum
and Curtis Suter, and four other members of the '98 draft class,
including center Erik Westrum, a sophomore at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``He paid his own way here so he could keep his amateur status
and (NCAA) eligibility,'' Smith said of Westrum, the 187th player
drafted overall. `He's going to have to pay for his own hotel, his
own sticks, his own meals. He's really making a commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But most eyes will be locked on DesRochers, whom NHL scouts have
called a can't-miss franchise goalie. It will be a while before
he's ready to challenge incumbent Nikolai Khabibulin for the
starter's job in Phoenix, but someday, it definitely will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have high hopes for him,'' Smith said. ``That hasn't
changed one bit since the day we drafted him back in June.''
</P>
<P>
   DesRochers has all the attributes that scouts say a good goalie
should possess, namely size and strength. He's so big that he
smothers the puck. He's so strong that he doesn't have to flop to
his knees at the first sight of a slap shot. He also has uncanny
side-to-side mobility for a goalie so tall, an intangible that
completes the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes with all sorts of credentials,'' one scout told
``The'' ``Hockey News.'' `I think he's right on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great physical makeup to be a goalie,'' another scout
said. ``He is an opposing presence to oncoming forwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping pucks has become a family tradition every bit as much
as the family marina business. Patrick's dad and two of his three
older brothers played goalie, so he almost seemed destined to
follow in their footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to do something with all that goalie equipment,'' he
said, laughing. `I kind of had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   `It's been great, though. My goal has always been to play in the
NHL and get a chance to win the Stanley Cup someday. I never really
thought about being the first goaltender picked in the draft, but
in the last year or so, the thought definitely crossed my mind that
it could be a possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes are in no rush to put him in their sweater, however.
For now, the club is secure at the position with Khabibulin,
veteran Jimmy Waite and two other prospects who are close to
getting there, Scott Langkow and Sylvain Daigle.
</P>
<P>
   DesRochers will figure into the mix, but not for at least a
couple more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goaltenders need time to develop, and I know that,'' he said.
``It's important to take that next step, but not to make it too
quickly, so I'm not in any big hurry. I feel I'm developing on
schedule, but I'll leave it up to the Coyotes to decide when I'm
ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better for me to go to the minors and play lots of games
rather than going up to the big team right away and just sit on the
bench. But someday, I hope to be there. (Khabibulin) is an
excellent goaltender, and I look up to him big time. But I don't
know. We'll see what happens in the future. A lot of things can
happen in the game of hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   After training camp, DesRochers will report to Sarnia for his
fourth and final year of juniors, or he could wind up with the
Canadian national team, which is based in Calgary. &QL;

SOCCER LEAGUE NOT HOT ON PHOENIX FOR EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Professional sports leagues long have viewed
exhibition games in non-league cities as litmus tests for
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's Desert Series in 1993-94 is a good example. Despite
mediocre attendance figures in the Valley, the Winnipeg Jets soon
became the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition tradition continues tonight at Scottsdale Stadium
when the USISL's D-3 Arizona Sahuaros take on Major League Soccer's
Colorado Rapids in the league's sponsored event in the Valley. The
Sahuaros have sold 2,500 tickets for the game and are optimistic
that more fans will buy at the gates.
</P>
<P>
   But those who think tonight's game is a precursor for an
expansion MLS franchise may be jumping the gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I would say our fervor for an Arizona team is tepid
at best,'' MLS Commissioner Doug Logan said. ``There are a number
of criteria we look at when considering expansion, and right now
Phoenix has a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan said those problems include the lack of a proper facility,
the lack of committed investors and the Valley's unaccommodating
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   The MLS hopes to add two teams in 2000 or 2001 and another two
in 2002 or 2003 to reach its ideal size of 16. With 12 teams
already in the fold, Phoenix doesn't even rate a mention on the
league's wish list: Seattle, Charlotte, Cincinnati, Pittsburgh, San
Diego, Houston, Portland, Anaheim, Rochester, N.Y., and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Philadelphia are considered the front-runners for
the first wave of expansion. Philadelphia is the largest market
without a team, and Logan said Houston's combination of ethnic
minorities, solid investment groups and a domed stadium makes it a
virtual lock.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest is the focal point of the latter expansion
plans with Seattle and possibly Portland the leading candidates.
Logan said the league is strongly considering adding a second team
to the New York/New Jersey area and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of these plans stand the second-year Sahuaros with
high hopes. The team recently reached an agreement to play its
games at Scottsdale Stadium after playing all of last season and
most of this year at Mesa's Dobson High School. The move was widely
viewed as an upgrade within the organization. But Logan said
Scottsdale still is far from optimal for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not up to our standards,'' Logan said. ``From a
fan's standpoint, it's very marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   The field of play at Scottsdale stretches across the outfield
and a portion of the middle infield to minimize the amount of dirt
in play. The problem is that most of the seats at Scottsdale are
situated alongside or behind the infield, leaving fans far from the
action.
</P>
<P>
   Since the MLS is committed to television contracts with ABC,
ESPN and Univision that require weekend afternoon games, a Phoenix
site may have to be indoors anyway to avoid exposing fans to
temperatures that usually exceed 100 degrees. Logan likes Sun Devil
Stadium but fears a lag in attendance because of the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Ballpark is the only such indoor facility in the Valley
that could house soccer. But the ballpark's general manager, Bob
Machen, said the field is no more conducive to soccer than
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult to overlap seasons with the
Diamondbacks also playing in the summer,'' Machen said. ``We've
learned a lot about turf management this year, and we feel like
we've done an excellent job considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``But obviously, soccer is much tougher on a playing surface. If
we added soccer to baseball in the same season, having to remove
the mound and keep up the sod, it would be a very difficult thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Rio Salado Crossing would be another possibility.
Sahuaros President Ali Alexander has spoken with Michael Bidwill,
Cardinals vice president and general counsel, about sharing a
stadium but characterized those talks as premature.
</P>
<P>
   The money problems come next. In a sports landscape dominated by
the Colangelo and Bidwill families, neither camp seems overly
interested in the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, we were confronted by a group about the
possibility of starting up a team and we took a pass,'' Suns
General Manager Bryan Colangelo said. ``We're always aware of
different types of opportunities in sports, and the MLS is
interesting due to its early success in terms of fan support. But
at this time, there's really not a high level of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander said it probably is more prudent to build slowly and
focus on a move to the A league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to build a solid foundation in management
and sponsors,'' he said. ``I think it would be a mistake to go too
fast like some of the past teams tried to do. For me the MLS is not
out of reach, but it's something we'll have to earn.''
</P>
<P>
   Logan agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every project needs a rabbi, and we look for a bell cow no
matter where we go,'' he said. ``I don't want to dissuade any
community from pursuing a franchise. We can't afford to exclude
anyone. But we have to look at realistic expectations, and I don't
think it would be fair to consider Phoenix right now.'' &QL;

D-BACKS CAN'T SLAM DOOR ON HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks' uniforms should not be stained by
tears of despondence. They have nobody to blame but themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They had plenty of opportunities to extend their club-record
winning streak to eight games on Saturday and set an expansion
record in the process. The stark reality is that time after time,
they couldn't come through, leaving the door open for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th inning, the Astros finally slipped through, scoring
on a bases-loaded groundout by Ricky Gutierrez for a 6-5 victory at
Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, the leader in the National League Central Division,
raised its record to 89-53. Arizona fell to 57-86. The teams end
their three-game series today at 4:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks jumped to a 3-0 lead in the first inning and
managed to stay a step ahead of the Astros until the seventh
inning, when a base hit by Sean Berry scored Derek Bell with the
tying run to make it 5-5. Bell had led off the inning with a
bad-hop single that bounced over the head of Arizona second baseman
Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox again figured prominently in Houston's winning effort in the
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou doubled off left-hander Alan Embree with one out.
Embree walked Richard Hidalgo. Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
called on right-hander Felix Rodriguez, who promptly hit Russ
Johnson to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks figured they still had a good chance to escape,
given the fact that Gutierrez had grounded into a team-high 16
double plays. Arizona's infield was set at double-play depth.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez obliged _ sort of. He hit the ball on the ground
toward Fox, but the ball was hit too slowly. Fox came in, saw he
couldn't get Alou at the plate or tag Johnson, then had to spin,
throw and settle for a force-out of Johnson at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing was that the ball wasn't hit that hard. I
was caught in No Man's Land. It was just one of those things,'' Fox
said. ``That just shows that you don't have to hit the ball hard to
be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (winning streak) was a nice run we had, and it would have
been good to keep going, but we just couldn't put them away.''
</P>
<P>
   After Houston pulled to within 3-2 in the top of the second, the
Diamondbacks had two men on base with one out in the bottom of the
inning, but Jay Bell fouled out to Jeff Bagwell at first base, and
Devon White grounded out to Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   A one-run inning in the third could have been more, but Damian
Miller, whose two-out triple drove in David Dellucci, was left
stranded at third as Karim Garcia grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had the bases loaded with nobody out in the fourth but
could only increase its lead from 4-3 to 5-3. Right-hander Scott
Elarton, who entered the game in place of starter Shane Reynolds,
struck out White, retired Lee on an RBI groundout and struck out
Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks stranded two men in the fifth against Elarton
and two more in both the ninth and 10th innings against
right-hander Doug Henry, who pitched at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't score yourself and give them that many
opportunities, things will be difficult for you,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said. ``We just couldn't push one across.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Billy Wagner, who was hit in the head by a line
drive in the Astros' previous visit here in mid-July, retired the
side in order in the 11th and struck out the side in the 12th to
raise his record to 4-3. The only blemish was a walk to Kelly
Stinnett, who hit the line drive that injured him. &QL;

GONNA LEAVE YOU, BABE  
 MCGWIRE TIES RUTH'S 60; MARIS NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS - Baseball's highly exclusive 60-home run club
admitted its third member Saturday afternoon when Mark McGwire
ripped a 381-foot line drive into the left-field seats at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is now in the company of Babe Ruth and Roger Maris, the
only other men ever to hit 60 home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, he is also the oldest player to reach 60. Ruth was 32
when he hit 60 in 1927, and Maris was 27 when he set the record of
61 in 1961. That only three players in the 129-year history of the
game have reached this milestone helps deliver some perspective of
exactly how difficult this feat is.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's afternoon began brilliantly when he laced a flat
fastball, the third pitch he'd seen from Cincinnati starter Dennis
Reyes, over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 47,994, which had already been standing
when McGwire was announced, roared its approval with a deafening
sound for all of downtown St. Louis to hear.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went hitless in his other three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unbelievable,'' McGwire said of the phenomena he has
created. ``What can you say? If you want to say it has brought
America together, it has. So be it. Let's just ride the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen!
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Manager Jack McKeon was asked after the game if, with
first base open and runners at second and third, he contemplated
walking McGwire in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I thought about it,'' the crusty McKeon said. ``But I
also thought about all those people who have been calling my voice
mail asking me to heal the country. So I decided to heal the
country, and we pitched to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is unleashing its mystic powers in all the right ways
these days. All the talk of the recent strikes has basically been
eliminated. The focus is where it should have been all along _ on
the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has indeed returned to its proper place, and McGwire
isn't just part of the bandwagon, he's driving the sucker.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 NFL season will begin today, and while football's
television ratings will once again tower over baseball's, don't let
that be the true barometer of which is the hotter sport.
</P>
<P>
   Because baseball plays so many games, its TV ratings will always
be smaller. What McGwire and Sammy Sosa are doing for the game this
summer can never be measured by how many households are watching
what.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is back at the top of the heap precisely because of
McGwire's personal charge on the single-season home run record. No
other sport captivates the country's attention quite like baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Want proof? How many of you know the record for most yards in an
NFL season? How about most points in an NBA season? It's a good bet
very few know.
</P>
<P>
   However, just bring up the number 56 or 61 or 755, and any
baseball fan will be able to recite in order: Joe DiMaggio's
hitting streak, Maris' single-season home run record and Hank
Aaron's career home run total.
</P>
<P>
   It's a game steeped in tradition and interwoven into the very
roots of our society. Even nearby societies, especially in Latin
America, have adopted the national pastime of the United States as
theirs, too.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's quest for 61 has flooded all of our memories with
everything we have always loved about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it's very cool to be an avid baseball fan again.
Earlier this year, Commissioner Bud Selig predicted the game was in
the early to middle stages of what would amount to a powerful
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about the commish, but the man looks like an
awfully talented prophet these days.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the next few days, possibly today, McGwire will step
to the head of the single-season home run class. His undeniable
passion for the game practically jumps out when he speaks about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The game is nearing the top of the sports heap once again.
Magical seasons like this don't happen every year. Baseball is new
to our area, but it's important we all sit back and soak in exactly
what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire is our generation's Babe Ruth. His achievements
have taken a stranglehold on the country unlike anything we've seen
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   As Ruth once notably put it, baseball truly is the greatest game
ever invented. Hallelujah for what's going on right now. &QL;

5 CONTENDERS STILL IN HUNT FOR 2 SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 baseball season will end three weeks from today. In the
meantime, there are two hotly-contested playoff races taking place.
</P>
<P>
   While five of the six division races are practically over, the
American League West and the National League wild-card races have
five clubs vying for two postseason spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like being in a pennant race,'' said St. Louis
Manager Tony La Russa. ``It's the ultimate test for every member of
a club. You go through the highs, the lows and when it's over,
especially if you've won or made a spirited run, you feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   But, at the time, there was no telling the members of the 1993
San Francisco Giants about the good they had done for the game by
winning 103 games and pushing the Atlanta Braves to 104 victories
and an NL West championship.
</P>
<P>
   The players, coaching staff and manager were despondent on the
day they were trounced in Los Angeles on the last day of the
season, knowing Atlanta had already won. No amount of consoling
could lift the spirits of the Giants that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who put on as good a show as baseball has seen, were
spent, all because they had put everything out for six months and
come away with no more than a second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Battling for a postseason spot in baseball has always meant
more, because the sport has so few playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three years ago, with the addition of the wild card,
that the game allowed a second place team to reach the playoffs.
Securing a playoff spot in baseball meant more because a club had
to finish in first place to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why baseball has such a special spot,'' said
Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter, who guided the 1995 New York
Yankees to the playoffs. ``What you do in April and May matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike basketball and hockey, where 16 clubs make the playoffs,
or football, where 12 make it, baseball allows only eight of its 30
to move on.
</P>
<P>
   With due respect to the 1995 Mariners-Angels race, the
Braves-Giants race of 1993 was probably the last great one in the
game. But no matter if a race is great or not, just being in a
playoff race is special.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim and Texas are scrapping for the final spot in the AL
playoffs while the NL wild-card race, which looks like a dandy at
this stage, is being fought by the Giants, Chicago Cubs and New
York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty is that only one of those clubs in each race will
play beyond Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who were surprising the baseball world by pulling
away from Texas in the past few weeks, received their gut-check in
the form of a major injury.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad, easily the best all-around player on the Angels
roster, pulled up lame last week while running to first base. A
severe hamstring injury may keep him out of the lineup the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this season is a test, I want to know when you pass, when
it's finally over,'' Anaheim Manager Terry Collins told Angels
writers last week. ``I've had enough of it. It's time for us to get
some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming breaks has always been a part of baseball. The true
character of a club rarely surfaces until it is met with adversity.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 Angels will find out what makes them tick over the next
three weeks. The Angels and Texas will play five times in the
coming weeks. They will be games that will be engulfed with playoff
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem for whoever wins the final two playoff
spots is being emotionally empty when the postseason begins. It was
a problem that definitely affected the 1993 Braves, who were
eliminated by Philadelphia, clearly inferior, in the first round
that season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience of reaching the playoffs has always
out-weighted whatever side effects getting there might create.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like a playoff game,'' said Baltimore
shortstop Mike Bordick, who has played in the post-season for
Oakland the Orioles. ``The intensity of the games is incredible.
It's rare for any regular season game to measure up to what you
feel in the playoffs. It's the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what they're fighting for. &QL;

2-QB SYSTEM LIKELY TO CONTINUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _  &UR; Keith Smith and  &UR; Ortege Jenkins are two
quarterbacks in a system instead of a race.
</P>
<P>
   For now.
</P>
<P>
   Or forever.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's season-opening victory on Thursday night at Hawaii was
nothing if not further evidence that coach &UR; Dick Tomey will continue
to rely on both for as long as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The whole season?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what may happen,' Tomey said after Smith helped lead
Arizona to a 27-6 victory. ``OJ's going to keep playing. Keith is
going to keep playing. We're trying to win games.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith emerged as a leader in this mini-drama as the Wildcats
prepare for a Pacific-10 Conference opener on Sept. 12 at Stanford,
which was upset Saturday, 35-23, by San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
   Smith came on in relief of Jenkins, who struggled in the opening
quarter at Aloha Stadium. But Smith spoke as if he were prepared
for the reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``OJ and I were talking on the sidelines about if we don't start
right, one of us automatically has to pick it up,'' said Smith, who
was 17 of 22 for 218 yards passing as opposed to Jenkins' 3 of 11
for 19 yards. ``You can't guarantee you're going to be great all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be off in some games, and that's when he has to
step in and do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins wasn't looking for excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't get things going,'' he said. ``Keith did a great
job. he was hot as I'ver seen him.'' &QL; 
Getting back &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trung Canidate, the projected starter at running back from
Central High, is expected to practice this week after undergoing
rehabilitation for a stress fracture to his right foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see,'' said Tomey, who was unhappy with a spotty running
game at Hawaii. ``We tried to get him to do things in rehab that
are tougher than he'll face in a game. If Hawaii had been the last
game in his career, I think he could have played.'' &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of Arizona's loudest fans Thursday night were from the crew
of the USS Tucson, a submarine stationed at nearby Peral Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise. The Wildcats were not expecting Stanford's
loss to San Jose State. The Cardinal has a new offensive
coordinator. ``I'm not expecting them to show too much against San
Jose State,'' Tomey said Saturday before the upset. Tomey didn't
know how prophetic he was.
</P>
<P>
   And do-it-all  &UR; Chris McAlister was seen running to the Aloha
Stadium locker room midway through the game. He was moving almost
as fast as he did in the 100-yard touchdown return of the game's
opening kickoff. Trouble? Not really. As McAlister explained it, he
was under pressure from having consumed too much liquid before
kickoff. &QL;

FORCED OVERTIME PUSHING THEM TO THE LIMIT, WORKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time his 15-year career with Albertson's stores ended,
Richard Sorrells knew the extra hours at work were taking their
toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd come home grumping and griping _ I was stressed'' after
routinely putting in at least 10 hours of extra work a week, said
Sorrells, now a Glendale business owner. ``I've got a 4-year-old
daughter. She doesn't need to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Sorrells, Americans are feeling as overworked as ever this
Labor Day. Frustrated by working too many hours _ both paid and
unpaid _ they are sometimes grabbing headlines by battling the
corporations whose profits depend on their extra work.
</P>
<P>
   From a national lawsuit filed against Albertson's grocery stores
to the recent US West strike, the number of hours spent on the job
is a flash point for employee discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem with America today _ all these companies do
is look at the bottom line,'' Sorrells said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, 34,000 US West employees in 13 states returned to
work after a 15-day strike protesting salaries, benefits and the
telephone giant's policy of forcing long hours of overtime work.
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement hammered out over the weekend would cap
the amount of weekly overtime that phone company employees are
required to work at 16 hours next year and 8 hours in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   While there are few national statistics documenting use of
overtime or legal challenges of employer overtime policies, one of
the few measures devised by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics
suggests that we are, in fact, working more overtime than we used
to.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1988, U.S. factory employees worked an average of 3.9
hours of overtime a week. By July 1998, Bureau of Labor figures
show, it was 4.8 hours a week, an increase of more than 25 percent
and near the all-time high of 4.9 set five times in 1997 and once
this year.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona survey of local communications and public utilities
industries found employees working an average of 42 hours a week in
1997. So far this year, it's 43.7 hours, while 10 years ago, it was
42.3 hours. &QL; 
OVERTIME LOSES APPEAL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Americans are feeling overworked, chances are it's because
they often are. But it isn't necessarily new. As early as 1992,
Harvard University economist Juliet Schor warned in her bestseller,
``The Overworked American,'' that heavier workloads were making
Americans surly and wishful for simpler lives.
</P>
<P>
   Where once overtime was viewed as a good way to earn extra
bucks, it is now often seen as a stressful drain on leisure or
family time. And it may not be as good a financial deal as it once
seemed: The Cato Institute, a national think-tank, concluded last
year that the average employee loses much of their gains from
overtime pay to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And workers who build a lifestyle around overtime pay may have
trouble scaling back when overtime evaporates. Some companies ask
managers to warn employees about the dangers of basing their
standard of living on overtime pay. &QL; 
MARKET FORCES OVERTIME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the use of overtime by employers continues unabated, the
longer hours coming as a logical economic consequence of today's
labor market, said Peter Hom, professor of management at Arizona
State University and an expert on compensation administration.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is low. The economy is strong. To keep up with
demand for their products, employers must either pay more to hire
and train new workers, or ask current workers to work longer.
</P>
<P>
   It's cheaper to pay employees overtime than it is to hire new
workers in a tight market, then provide benefits.
</P>
<P>
   International forces have spurred changes in the domestic labor
market as well. With offshore competition and what Hom calls
``variable pay practices'' becoming more common _ special benefits,
flexible shifts and such _ competition is stiff for new, reasonably
priced employees.
</P>
<P>
   If overtime seems painful to workers, Hom says, there is a
benefit: When the economy shrinks, companies are less likely to lay
off employees if they relied on overtime instead of hiring new
workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the flip side, he adds, is a decline in employee
satisfaction. A 500-employee survey Hom conducted for a national
retail chain found that heavy overtime led to employee discontent
and disloyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees are feeling greater work-family conflicts,'' Hom
said. And it isn't simply among women, who traditionally felt
sharper conflicts between work and family.
</P>
<P>
   Hom said men and women also complain about conflicts with other
off-time activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That conflict seems to be of great concern to employees _ the
infringement of personal time,'' Hom said. ``It's going to lead
employees to quit employment (and look) for other employers with a
more friendly environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The same conflict often exists for managers, most of whom are
not covered by the overtime regulations but have to work long hours
as well. Their stress often is compounded by having to continually
ask more of overworked subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have family lives, too,'' said Bill Ankrom, vice
president of the Western region for Methods West, a Phoenix
machine-tool company. If managers' morale slips, so too will that
of other workers.
</P>
<P>
   Ankrom said the manufacturing industry is rife these days with
examples of companies whose cadre of managers are unhappy, and the
unhappiness spreads to workers at large. Methods West has avoided
problems, he said, by offering bonuses to managers working long
hours without overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The situation appears no different among government workers.
Angel Rodriguez, field representative for Council 97 of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
his union often hears complaints about overtime.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arizona Department of Motor Vehicles, for example,
Rodriguez said the department responded to complaints about long
customer lines and poor service by calling on employees to work
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   The agency budget is limited, so overtime workers are offered
``flex time'' _ coming to work an hour or two later the day after
overtime is worked _ rather than overtime pay or compensatory time
off that is accrued and taken later.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said many state employees don't like flex time because
it does not allow them to schedule compensatory time off to mesh
with their personal schedules.
</P>
<P>
   It is especially vexing for employees with children. Overtime
work upsets child-care routines, and flex time is usually offered
at times when employees cannot make up for time lost with family
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees suffer, because they don't find family life
satisfying, they have to adjust their child care and it creates
some problems,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the practice is legal. Federal laws allow employers to use
flex time to ensure workers do not work more than 40 hours a week.
Unlike private-sector workers, government employees can be forced
to take time off in lieu of overtime pay. &QL; 
FEWER WORKER COMPLAINTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Albertson's case aside, it is unclear whether the longer
hours have led to in an upswing in legal challenges. Some experts
believe lawsuits are on the rise because workers no longer fear
reprisals _ they know they can find new jobs in the booming job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the U.S. Department of Labor saw a steady decrease in
worker complaints filed during this decade. From 1989 to 1997, for
example, the number of wage-and-hour complaints filed with the
department declined about 45 percent to 34,649 from 63,965.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Nutini, a labor lawyer at the Phoenix law firm of Lewis &AMP;
Roca, suspects workers who feel they are being mistreated simply
walk away from their jobs, knowing they can be easily re-employed
in the current economy.
</P>
<P>
   But John Fraser, acting administrator of the Labor Department's
wage and hour division, thinks employees are worrying about job
security and as a result, are less likely to complain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a good labor market, Fraser argued, workers increasingly
find themselves in ``contingent work relationships'' _ holding jobs
under contract or under limitations imposed by employers. Simply
put, they don't think challenging their employer is a safe option.
</P>
<P>
   Many cases now litigated by the Labor Department are identified
by the department itself by aiming enforcement at specific
industries. The department's hot list these days includes the
agriculture, garment and health care industries.
</P>
<P>
   With one month left in the federal fiscal year, the Arizona
district office has brought 699 overtime or minimum wage cases,
recovering $3.9 million in back wages for employees. The number of
cases is fewer than in past years, mirroring a national decline
blamed on long slide in the size of the Labor Department budget.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime violations typically result from employees being paid
regular wages for overtime, or being told to take time off in lieu
of legally required payment, said Cynthia Watson, the Labor
Department's Arizona District director.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law does not limit the overtime work employers may
demand, provided that non-salaried workers are paid at least 1{
times their normal wage for more 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Routine violations often make the job of labor organizers easier
because employees have common complaints against what they see as
an unfair employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the major issues in organizing workplaces,''
said Jim McLaughlin, Phoenix market-share coordinator for the
United Food and Commercial Workers Union. ``They're trying to
squeeze every dime out of labor.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFCW has helped current and former Albertson's employees _
both union and non-union _ sue the company, claiming they were
routinely expected to put in extra time on the job, but off the
clock. A federal judge has been asked to certify it as a national
class-action lawsuit, expanding it to include nearly 7,000 employee
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Read, Albertson's executive vice president for public
affairs, called the claims ``absolutely false'' and said company
policy ``is very clear and unequivocal. Off-the-clock work is
clearly not policy. It is not expected, and frankly, not
tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorrells _ one of the lawsuit's original plaintiffs and one of
five from Arizona _ was liquor department manager for a Glendale
Albertson's when he was fired last year. Albertson's accused him of
not performing certain duties, duties he says were impossible to
fulfill during regular working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sorrells runs his own cleaning business and he calls his
firing a blessing. He sets his own hours. When he works longer, he
takes home more money. His income is slightly higher than before.
His family life is better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the fourth or fifth day (after being fired), my wife said,
`Man, you're so much nicer,' '' he said. &QL;

MOURNING A FALLEN BROTHER  
 SIBLING'S DEATH HARD ON COWBOYS SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ten months later, Dallas Cowboys safety Kenny
Wheaton's pain hasn't gone away.
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton, a Tempe McClintock High School product, still can't get
his younger brother, Derrek, off his mind. It has consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think about him 24 hours a day,'' Wheaton said. ``It will be
that way as long as I'm alive. Not a day will pass by when I'm not
thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   He still gets chills thinking about the phone call he received
in Dallas on Nov. 20. It was 3 a.m., and his older brother, Robert,
called to tell him that Derrek, 19, had been murdered outside a
Phoenix convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only get three hours of sleep every night, maximum,
because of the incident,'' Wheaton said. ``I have nightmares. It's
hard for me to do anything at night except sit there and think
about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton still can't understand why his brother was gunned down.
Family members told him it was a case of mistaken identity, but
that hasn't made it any easier for Wheaton, who will be with the
Cowboys today when they open their season against the Cardinals at
Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a happy person,'' Wheaton said of Derrek. ``He
always had a smile on his face. His friends called him `Sunshine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask my coaches at McClintock. Derrek was the best athlete of
the three. All three of us brothers were very close, as close as
any three you'd ever find.''
</P>
<P>
   Derrek, a freshman cornerback at Phoenix Community College, had
stopped for gas at a convenience store as he returned home from the
school's football banquet. He had won two defensive honors that
night and hoped to transfer to Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a page from his girlfriend, Derrek went to a pay
phone and was on the line when a car pulled through the parking
lot. Gunshots were fired, and Derrek died instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a chance to run,'' Wheaton told the ``Dallas''
``Morning News.'' ``He didn't know what hit him because he had his
back turned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Wheaton's frustration is that the case is unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Phoenix) police, they're so full of it. They give us the
runaround,'' Wheaton said. ``They haven't told us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police spokesman Mike McCullough said he understands the
family's frustration but said the investigation is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leads we learn of are still being worked by homicide
investigators,'' McCullough said. ``At this point, it's too early
to explain to the family as far as who, what, when and where.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members claim the police have been slow to follow up on
tips because they consider the shooting to be gang-related and
difficult to solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother was not the type of person to hurt a soul,''
Wheaton said. ``Anyone who knew him could vouch that he's not in
any gang.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his family isn't doing well. ``I try to help
financially,'' he said. ``I try to be there for them. As hard as it
is on the entire family, they still are supportive. They come to
the games. They'll always still be there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton wears D.K.W (his brother's initials) RIP on his practice
uniform. It's written with a felt-tipped marker, but it might as
well be etched indelibly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear it every practice,'' Wheaton said. ``When I need
strength, when I'm tired or when I'm down, I put my right hand on
my chest and get that strength from touching his initials.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheaton also has taped his brother's obituary to his locker and
carries his picture with him at all times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people wonder how you can always be thinking about him
and focus on what you do. It's possible. I think about him every
time I'm on the field, lifting weights. I think about him in
between plays. I think about him every day, all day.'' &QL;

WADSWORTH DEAL BRINGS CARDS FULL CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Everyone knew something was up when the flight
attendant on the Cardinals' charter plane came on the public
address system and said Bill Bidwill Sr. had a special
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Memories were tested to recall the last time the team's
reclusive owner did that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to tell us that Mark McGwire broke the
home run record,'' said linebacker Jamir Miller, one of the
defensive captains.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who'd seen Coach Vince Tobin tap backup defensive lineman
Mike Moten on the shoulder and escort him off the plane before
takeoff could have guessed differently.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals held out hope for 44 days while Andre Wadsworth
simply held out. Finally, the impasse was resolved on Saturday with
Wadsworth, the Cardinals first-round draft pick, signing a six-year
contract that could be worth as much as $42 million if he achieves
escalator incentives. Wadsworth receives a club-record $10.49
million signing bonus entering today's opener against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis was one of those cheering
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the announcement I went right up and shook Mr. B's
hand,'' McGinnis said. ``It was a very good emotional bump for all
of us. Mentally for this team, there's no question that this is
really outstanding. I had full confidence we'd get this done. I've
been in the league too long to think it wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That was echoed by one of the behind-the-scene deal-savers, team
vice president Michael Bidwill, who just returned from vacation in
France. While on the continent, Bidwill was briefed by telephone of
the raging firestorm last week over allegations that the club had
killed a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best player in the draft was not going to get away from
us,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``Everybody knew what the ramifications
were. It was time to play football. The two parties came together
and made an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a moment too soon, according to Wadsworth's new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who should benefit from the improved pass-rush that
Wadsworth can provide is the secondary, anchored by four-time Pro
Bowl starter Aeneas Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it will be like the difference between having the fire
department one block away and two miles away,'' said Williams, one
of the team's defensive captains. ``The airplane seemed to start
traveling a lot faster. There was a lighter load.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said all the hype and projections are now moot. Wadsworth
is a pro football player who has to make his mark on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least this stops the questions about whether he'll sign,''
Miller said. ``Hopefully he'll come in here and prove that he is
the best defensive lineman drafted in the '90s. I'm happy the guy
is here, but now he has to do his thing and help us win. There will
be no congratulations until the end of the season and we go to the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Tobin: ``This makes us a better team. We're in kind of a
unique situation here. Last week we signed (cornerback) J.B. Brown,
and we put him in the game after he'd practiced about seven snaps
with us. This week we're going to play a guy who hasn't even been
on the field with us. I guess this sets back coaching a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   But it advances the players' faith in ownership. Quarterback
Jake Plummer seemed to speak for the team on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just proves to a lot of guys that, even though this took
longer than we thought, the team is committed to winning,'' Plummer
said. ``It shows that the Cardinals will step up and take
responsibility and do what is right to help the team.'' &QL;

MEMORIES OF DAD HARD TO IGNORE 
 SEASON WILL BE LONG FOR COWBOYS LINEMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys center  &UR; Dale Hellestrae says his late father's
favorite song was the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last thing he heard,'' Hellestrae said.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after hearing it played before the Cardinals' preseason
game against the Chicago Bears on Aug. 14 at Sun Devil Stadium,
Hellestrae's father,  &UR; Lawrence, suffered a fatal heart attack in
Section 210.
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae, a Scottsdale native, has been thinking about his dad
this week as the Cowboys prepare for today's season opener against
the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big Cardinals fan,'' Hellestrae said. ``He was an
original season ticket holder. He wished the Cardinals would go
14-2 every year. He rooted for them in every game except when they
played us. He loved those games. He loved his seats.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, 66, also loved any team for which Hellestrae played.
He was at Sun Devil Stadium in 1980 when Hellestrae helped
Scottsdale Saguaro High School win the Class 3A state title. He was
there again in January 1996, when the Cowboys beat the Pittsburgh
Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always liked to kid him,'' Hellestrae said. ``He would get
more worked up for games than I did. He would come to Dallas for
two games a year. My wife would have to drop him off three and a
half, four hours before the game, because he was so excited. He
would walk around the stadium and meet people. He loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, a longtime Valley mailman, was in good health. He
had cut the lawn that day and regularly rode a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   He would have been glued to the TV on Sunday for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever season it was, that was his favorite sport,''
Hellestrae said. ``Whatever team I played on was his favorite
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hellestrae knows it will be difficult to return to Sun Devil
Stadium when the Cowboys play there Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be tougher for them (his family members) to go
watch their first game back,'' he said of the Cardinals' home
opener against Philadelphia on Sept. 20. ``But if they can do it, I
can do it. Still, it will be hard.'' &QL; 
No Fun League
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals defensive end  &UR; Mike Jones discovered he had a
problem when the St. Louis Rams acquired him from the New England
Patriots last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams already had a player named Mike Jones, an outside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   The public-address announcer at the TWA Dome in St. Louis came
up with a solution. He refers to the defensive end as  &UR; Mike D.
Jones and the linebacker as  &UR; Mike A. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rams originally were told that players can't place their
middle initials on the back of their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what the league said,'' club equipment manager  &UR; Todd
Hewitt said. ``They looked it up in the bylaws.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, league officials came to their senses.  &QL; 
Bad News Bears
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer and former Chicago running back  &UR; Gale Sayers
maintains his former team is three players away from being three
players away.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mark Hatley, club personnel vice president, thinks the Bears
are worse that that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had eight more good players, we'd be a pretty decent
football team,'' Hatley said. ``We'd have a chance to break even or
maybe a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help the Bears any that they are playing $6.4 million
short of the salary cap because of hits they've taken on five
players they've let go _ linebacker  &UR; Bryan Cox, quarterback  &UR; Rick
Mirer, defensive end  &UR; Alonzo Spellman, returner  &UR; Tyrone Hughes and
running back
 &UR; Rashaan Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It put us two years behind,'' Hatley said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of their top three draft choices from a year ago,
second-round pick  &UR; John Allred, is still on the roster, and he has
been beaten out by rookie  &UR; Alonzo Mayes at tight end. &QL; 
Lopsided affair
</P>
<P>
   Here's how dominant the Denver Broncos have been over New
England in their past 10 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have outscored the Patriots, 105-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos have gained 1,205 yards to the Patriots' 809.
</P>
<P>
   They have run for 511 yards to the Patriots' 149.
</P>
<P>
   It got so bad in 1996, Broncos tight end  &UR; Shannon Sharpe picked
up a phone on the sideline and said, ``President, we need the
National Guard. We need as many men as you can spare because we are
killing the Patriots. So call the dogs off. Send the National
Guard, please. They need emergency help.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos, who host the Patriots on Monday night, won the '96
game, 34-8. &QL; 
Feeling out of place
</P>
<P>
   How strange it was for former Cardinals linebacker  &UR; Seth Joyner,
a member of Green Bay's Super Bowl runner-ups last season, to be
traded to the league champion Broncos last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like I am year behind my quest,'' Joyner said.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner doesn't think the Packers took the AFC winners seriously
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a large part we underestimated this football team
(the Broncos) more because we dominated so much in the NFC through
the last part of the season,'' he said. ``I guess I feel we went
into the game with the feeling it was almost a done deal. Nobody
likes to say that, but when you look at how the game turned out and
things of that nature, I think in some ways we might have taken
them a little lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that you need to respect your opponent,
no matter who they are, no matter what the circumstances are.
They're a great team to even make it to the Super Bowl.'' &QL;

CARDINALS HEAVE BIG SIGH OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, TEXAS - Wake the children.
</P>
<P>
   Call the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Our long nightmare is over.
</P>
<P>
   One day before the Cardinals' season opener, Andre Wadsworth
ended his 44-day holdout and agreed to a breathtaking contract that
left Bill Bidwill sucking oxygen from one of those little drop-down
masks on the team flight.
</P>
<P>
   The owner broke the news while en route to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gentlemen, (``inhal''e) I'm pleased to announce we have signed
our No. 1 draft choice (``inhal''e) to a contract that will
``inhale'' pay him (``inhal''e)forty-(``inhal''e)-two (``inhale
inhale'' ``inhale'' ``inhal''e) MILLION dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals players let out a cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson wept.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis kissed his line coach, Joe
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   You don't see such giddyness at 30,000 feet except maybe on a
weekend Southwest free-drink coupons flight to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plane felt lighter,'' Aeneas Williams said of the soaring
spirits. ``I thought we had dropped our luggage.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``had'' to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth wasn't going to sit out the season and turn down a $10
million bonus, the third largest offered a rookie in NFL history.
How would his agents explain ``that'' strategy to prospective
clients?
</P>
<P>
   Nor could the Cardinals allow their top pick _ whom draftniks
call Wadsworth the next Bruce Smith _ to get away.
</P>
<P>
   Management already had taken a public-relations flogging.
Editorialists expressed righteous outrage, much of it directed at
Bill Bidwill Jr., who nixed a deal last week. The voice of reason,
talk radio called for frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
   All the optimism and civic goodwill generated by the draft had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals critics saw the impasse as the latest example of
front-office incompetence and a lack of commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Players were upset. Coaches shook their heads. On Friday,
McGinnis said the only thing he could say about the prospect of
opening the season against the Cowboys without the 6-foot-3,
278-pound defensive end in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. But he had to be thinking what everyone else was:
``This is'' ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had to compromise. (Both did.) The Cardinals lost
what little leverage they had after Brad Ottis, who was scheduled
to start at left defensive end until Wadsworth was ready to move
in, fractured his foot and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to blink (The Cardinals did).
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's $10.491 million signing bonus is the largest in club
history. His six-year deal includes the kind of monetary exchange
that usually involves a Brinks truck, pantyhose masks and automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully, it's over. No more posturing. No more
negotiating in the media. No more talks about voidables and
escalators and other terminology that leaves most fans glassy-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no more wild speculation. When I got the news
Saturday I was sitting alone on the grassy knoll pondering the
latest conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard this one. The one about how Dallas owner Jerry
Jones asked Wadsworth's agents, who are Deion Sanders' agents, to
encourage their client to hold out until after the Cowboys game,
presumably as a personal favor.
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, of course. Both sides wanted to get this done.
They had to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Now that Wadsworth is a Cardinal, it is time, to
quote our president, to move on. If the guy is half the athlete
everyone says he is there is no doubt what the Cardinals must do
today.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Wadsworth missing two-a-days. Never mind the fact
he is a rookie and hasn't memorized the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   For what this guy is making, here's what the team should do.
Introduce him to his teammates. Give him jersey No. 90. After a
pregame meal of T-bone steak (rare), present him a wallet-size
color photo of Troy Aikman and three words of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him.'' &QL;

FORMER MERCURY ASTRONAUTS CHEER ON JOHN GLENN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John, Scott, Wally, Gordo. Just four of them now. Alan died of
leukemia in July. Gus died in the fire aboard Apollo I, back in the
glory days. Deke died of cancer in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; They used to be seven _ Ameri ca's original astronauts, men who
strapped themselves into test planes over California's deserts and
then into Corvettes and rocket ships in Florida, always competing
to be the fastest, go the highest, be the best.
</P>
<P>
   They're in their 70s now and they haven't lost their famous
drive to compete. It's just that their lifelong contest between
``brothers,'' which is what they call each other, is played out in
more ordinary settings with less expensive equipment. They still
try to outrun, outski, outbike and outplay each other on tennis
courts, hills, tracks and golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   When NASA unveiled the seven heroes-to-be at a news conference
in April 1959, a reporter asked who would like to be first in
space. They all raised their hands. The competi tiveness and the
attention of an admiring world would be a part of their lives from
that moment on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid John has made us all famous again,'' said Scott
Carpenter, talking about himself and the other survivors, Gordon
``Gordo'' Cooper and Walter ``Wally'' Schirra. The Arizona Republic
recently talked to all of them about Sen. John Glenn's upcoming
return to space as well as their lives.
</P>
<P>
   While Glenn has been training in Houston for the second trip of
a lifetime, the others aren't exactly playing croquet. None is
retired. They are still striving in life, even though their places
in history are secure.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper wants to go to Mars. It's a dream he has held onto since
reading Buck Rogers comic strips as a kid. He's only 71, the
youngest of the original astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Still at his high school weight, Cooper jogs and race-walks 15
miles a week, plays tennis twice a week and plays golf on nights
and weekends. He flies airplanes when ever he can, and is rearing
two teenagers _ his second batch.
</P>
<P>
   Though Carpenter, 73, doesn't have any plans to go back into
space, he is ferociously active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skiing is the best way to fly and keep my feet on the
ground,'' he jokes. He also rides horses, plays tennis and golfs
regularly. He's working on his third book. &UR; All three of the former
astronauts say they weigh the same as when they were suiting-up for
space.
</P>
<P>
   Without the fanfare of going into zero atmosphere, they are
breaking new barriers now: those of age, of lifetime endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Although Carpenter believes older people may feel empowered by
Glenn's return to space, he hopes that young people will learn some
thing from it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep your mind alert and your body fit through
your whole life. John is a perfect exam ple of someone who has done
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The other former astronauts are, too.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges Schirra, 75, de scribed having with Glenn at Alan
Shepard's funeral in July indicate that the old competitive juices
have been running strong _ even on a solemn day when they buried
one of their brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra quietly jabbed Glenn: ``John,'' he said, ``why don't
they just send up Strom Thurmond if they want an old senator in
space?'' He then ribbed Glenn for taking the mission because he
needed the flight hours. Glenn had been in space only once. Schirra
had flown on Mercury, Gemini and Apollo missions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The astronauts meet at least a couple times a year. They ski at
Vail, Colo., where they go fast and work out hard. Each May in
Florida they distribute money to science and engineering students
from the As tronaut Scholarship Foundation they established.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those occasions three years ago, Glenn, then 74, told
them he was interested in going back up. He asked the others what
they thought about it. For a moment, Schirra thought, it sounded
like a rocking chair fantasy. He recalled telling Glenn, ``Oh,
John, grow up; get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn had been considering it for some time. &UR; Flying in space
was important to him, and he finally saw an opening in the field of
aging research. After all, his body in the 1960s was one of the
most thor oughly documented human speci mens on Earth. If you
wanted to measure changes, here was a willing subject. He started
talking to re searchers on aging and to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``John told me about this dream, but I never really thought it
would happen,'' Carpenter told The Repub lic.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpenter, who has always had a deep friendship with Glenn,
is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``John meets all the challenges he sees. Here's a chance to do
something that's a hell of a lot of fun, and to do some meaningful
science. It's the climax of his life spent in service to the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Would he go back up himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told John I'd be his backup again, but this time I'd make
sure something would happen to him so I'd get to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's time in space, pilot ing the Aurora 7 spacecraft
through three revolutions of the Earth, gave him a deeply spiritual
connection with &UR; Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``From space, Earth is a lonely, isolated, fragile outpost in
the mid dle of nowhere. You don't fully appreciate that until you
see it from a distance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That moment of concern for the Earth led him to undersea
research after his astronaut service ended. With the Navy's Sealab
Program he helped transfer space technology to deep-sea studies. He
lived in a capsule on the sea floor for 30 days, and still helps
direct an ocean research institute in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Now he divides his time between New York City and Vail. He has
written two books about the ocean and is writing a family history
with one of his four grown children.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was one of the first to encourage Glenn to take the new
flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``An aging body in good shape can do just as much as a younger
body in good shape,'' he says. He thinks that the medical experts
consistently underestimate what people are physically capable of
achieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it a matter of physical ability, never a
matter of age,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   He also recognizes that the Glenn flight might help him with his
own dream of going to Mars. For now, he works full time for his own
aerospace consulting firm, the Gal axy Group in Van Nuys, Calif.,
which is his big workshop for developing home energy systems and
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the California coast near San Diego, Schirra lives
with his wife of 52 years in Rancho Santa Fe. Like Glenn, he is
still married to his original partner.
</P>
<P>
   After his astronaut days, Schirra served as CEO of a number of
businesses and as a board member of some large firms, including
Kimberly-Clark, maker of Kleenex and feminine-hygiene
products. &UR; Schirra flew in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs,
and he thinks test pilots should be pilots, not passengers. He
isn't as excited about Glenn's coming mission as the other
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be a strap hanger, like a subway rider,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Schirra would rather see Glenn at the helm if he's going to
bother going up. That's the only way he would consider going up
himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trained to be a test pilot. I wouldn't want to go on as
a passenger. I wouldn't want to leap in the back and hang on,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands why Glenn wants to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, would do what I could to get out of the U.S. Senate in
a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ribbing aside, Schirra is proud of Glenn for going back up. He
thinks it will do wonders for NASA. All the former astronauts have
a pater nal concern for the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn story reminds him of the old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time an astronaut was on the cover of Time
and other news magazines?'' he asked. ``And what do you know about
any of the experiments aboard Mir? Who flew our last shuttle?''
</P>
<P>
   NASA confirms that media inter est in the upcoming Glenn flight
is surpassing all recent missions. The only comparable interest was
the post-Challenger launch of the space shuttle in September 1988,
and the first Hubble Telescope mission in December 1993, said Rob
Navias, a NASA spokesman in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fascination from a historical and a human interest
perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, though the mission will showcase a wide range of experi
ments, it is being seen by many as an historical turning point in
how we think about older people. Old barriers are about to be
broken.
</P>
<P>
   And, again, it will be Glenn out in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always the one to be out there in front,'' Schirra said
with a laugh. ``That's John.''
</P>
<P>
   The surviving Mercury 7 astro nauts have been contracted by
major television networks to provide ex pert commentary Oct. 29
when Glenn goes back up.
</P>
<P>
   Last time it was Carpenter who watched the rocket rise in 1962
and said on behalf of a breathless world, ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely say it again for us, one more time with feeling, on
the morning of Oct. 29. &QL;

Editorialists expressed righteous outrage, much of it directed at
Bill Bidwill Jr., who nixed a deal last week. The voice of reason,
talk radio called for frontier justice.
</P>
<P>
   All the optimism and civic goodwill generated by the draft had
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals critics saw the impasse as the latest example of
front-office incompetence and a lack of commitment to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Players were upset. Coaches shook their heads. On Friday,
McGinnis said the only thing he could say about the prospect of
opening the season against the Cowboys without the 6-foot-3,
278-pound defensive end in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. But he had to be thinking what everyone else was:
``This is'' ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had to compromise. (Both did.) The Cardinals lost
what little leverage they had after Brad Ottis, who was scheduled
to start at left defensive end until Wadsworth was ready to move
in, fractured his foot and was lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Someone had to blink (The Cardinals did).
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's $10.491 million signing bonus is the largest in club
history. His six-year deal includes the kind of monetary exchange
that usually involves a Brinks truck, pantyhose masks and automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But thankfully, it's over. No more posturing. No more
negotiating in the media. No more talks about voidables and
escalators and other terminology that leaves most fans glassy-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, no more wild speculation. When I got the news
Saturday I was sitting alone on the grassy knoll pondering the
latest conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you heard this one. The one about how Dallas owner Jerry
Jones asked Wadsworth's agents, who are Deion Sanders' agents, to
encourage their client to hold out until after the Cowboys game,
presumably as a personal favor.
</P>
<P>
   It's nonsense, of course. Both sides wanted to get this done.
They had to make this happen.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Now that Wadsworth is a Cardinal, it is time, to
quote our president, to move on. If the guy is half the athlete
everyone says he is there is no doubt what the Cardinals must do
today.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Wadsworth missing two-a-days. Never mind the fact
he is a rookie and hasn't memorized the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   For what this guy is making, here's what the team should do.
Introduce him to his teammates. Give him jersey No. 90. After a
pregame meal of T-bone steak (rare), present him a wallet-size
color photo of Troy Aikman and three words of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go get him.'' &QL;

CARDS SIGN WADSWORTH TO SIX-YEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Who needs practice?
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals first-round draft pick Andre Wadsworth apparently
doesn't need training camp or drills after ending his 44-day
holdout Saturday by signing a six-year deal that could be worth as
much as $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, who received a team-record signing bonus of $10.491
million, not only will dress for today's season opener against the
Dallas Cowboys but also is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We presume he's in good physical condition, knowing the type
of person Andre is,'' said Coach Vince Tobin, who released rookie
defensive end Mike Moten to make room for Wadsworth on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he'll get some snaps in the nickel as a pass rusher.
When you're the left end, you've got four guys rushing, all you
need to know is you rush up the field and try to sack the
quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's agent, Roosevelt Barnes, said Wadsworth is ready to
play. ``He's like a caged animal,'' Barnes said. ``If they would
let him start, he'd start.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he is in ``the best physical shape he could
possibly be in but not football shape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to train for constant repetitions of seven or eight
seconds of total explosion,'' said Wadsworth, who added that he's
not concerned of the health risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make sure I stretch real well and make sure I watch what
I eat in the pregame meal because I know I'll have the butterflies.
Hopefully, I can dance around and (play) a little nickel, take some
little baby steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Until late Friday night, a deal between the Cardinals and
Wadsworth's agents, Eugene Parker and Barnes, didn't appear
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals maintained Wadsworth, the Florida state defensive
end who was the third pick overall, wanted to be paid as much as
San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf, the second pick
overall who received a five-year, $31 million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth didn't get as much as Leaf, but the Cardinals can opt
out of the deal after three years. If they decide to end the
contract after five years, Wadsworth's total deal would be worth
$30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bidwill, team vice president who had been in France
until Friday, said both sides made concessions.
</P>
<P>
   A concession the Cardinals made was to allow the contract to
include escalators, pay-for-performance clauses.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the escalators were likely to be earned, Barnes said
they were if Wadsworth is  &UR; ...  &UR; (MISSINGTYPE)
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no gimmes, but he should be able to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A concession Wadsworth's agents made a week ago was to abandon
their demand that the contract include voidable years. On Friday,
they dropped the amount of total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to play football,'' Michael Bidwill said. ``Andre
wanted to play football. We wanted him to play football.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said Wadsworth got involved in the negotiations and that
he started dealing directly with Michael Bidwill and his brother,
Bill Jr., who oversees contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two days, B.J. (Bidwill Jr.) and Michael got
personally involved,'' Barnes said. ``It was a lot smoother dealing
directly with them. They called me late (Friday) night and put a
proposal on the table. We put a proposal on the table. We were
within striking distance and then Michael and B.J. got aggressive
when they saw we could make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The final contract wasn't much different than the deal the two
sides almost reached a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth said he wasn't upset that the negotiations took so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew eventually I was going to come (to terms),'' Wadsworth
said. ``I didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank the Cardinals for showing confidence in me and
investing in me. I think this was perfect timing. Like a fine wine
or fine cheese, it takes time to come out and taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals didn't know that the impasse had ended until 12:45
p.m. Saturday when team owner Bill Bidwill grabbed the microphone
on the team's charter plane and told the team that Wadsworth had
agreed to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, meanwhile, then boarded a plane in Tallahassee, Fla.,
for Dallas. He has been living there and taking a graduate class in
business administration during his holdout.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus the Cardinals paid Wadsworth _ part of it will be
deferred _ is the third largest given to an NFL rookie.
Indianapolis quarterback Peyton Manning, the first pick overall,
received an $11.6 million bonus. Leaf was paid a bonus of $11.25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth will earn the minium base salary of $144,000 for a
rookie this year. His annual salaries will then increase 25 percent
each year.
</P>
<P>
   His salary-cap figure for this season will be $1.89 million, the
remaining available under the team's rookie pool.
</P>
<P>
   With Wadsworth signing, the Cardinals now are about $2 million
under the $54.3 million salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to the organization it stepped up to the plate
and got the contract signed,'' Tobin said. ``Hopefully, this is a
turning point in this organization.''

ARIZONA DEMOCRATS IN WEAKEST SPOT IN YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Arizona Democrats go to the polls Tuesday, they're in for a
severe case of ballot shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no Democratic candidates for a number of statewide
offices, nobody for legislative races. There's nothing,'' said
Phoenix attorney Tim Hogan, who was stunned recently when he opened
his sample Democratic primary ballot and found no reason to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really isn't anything to vote for in my district, so I
guess I've got to wonder what the point is.''
</P>
<P>
   His dismay reflects a growing concern over the fate of Arizona's
second-largest political party. The harsh reality is that the
Democratic Party is in its weakest position in years, and if it
suffers across-the-board losses in statewide races in November, it
could emerge powerless for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Eddie
Basha, though temporary, is enough to dishearten even the most
hard-core party loyalists. But he was only the highest profile
Democrat to bail out, not the only one. Others, put off by the
Democrats' weak showing this year, did the same.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, expressing frustration with both parties, opted to
re-register as an independent, meaning he will sit out the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix political consultant Steve Tuttle registered as a
Republican after seeing a barren Democratic field in his north
Phoenix district.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really believe yourself to be an honest-to-God
Democrat, it is frustrating. You have to ask yourself, what the
hell are they doing?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats such as Tuttle and Basha aren't giving up all hope.
After casting ballots for GOP friends on Tuesday, they plan to
re-register as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But they may come back to a party _ should the Democrats' worst
nightmares materialize _ that's little more than a political speed
bump to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The state GOP is trying to sweep all major races in the Nov. 3
general election and seize control of the next redrawing of state
political boundaries, after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   If they do that, the state Democratic Party will be even further
diminished and demoralized, and Republicans will rule over Arizona
politics for well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's at stake is whether we will be in the ballgame or not
in the next decade,'' said Melodee Jackson, the state Democratic
Party's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to live under lines drawn by the Republicans, we
might as well go and do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Corporation Commissioner Renz Jennings, the party's only
statewide officeholder, ``It's pretty important to have a two-party
state . . . and we're dangerously close to having a totally
Republican state.''
</P>
<P>
   He is retiring this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the signs for Arizona Democrats are ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Party members who do go to the polls Tuesday will find few, if
any, contested races. Democrats didn't even bother to field
candidates for three statewide offices, treasurer, superintendent
of public instruction and mine inspector. The party's U.S. Senate
candidate, attorney Ed Ranger, has no political experience.
</P>
<P>
   In the governor's race, Republican Gov. Jane Hull has a
commanding lead over Democrat Paul Johnson in the polls, and she
has a huge advantage in fund-raising. Key Democrats, including
Basha, are expected after the primary to endorse Hull.
</P>
<P>
   In legislative races, the party is so disorganized it missed a
sure bet in District 3, a Democratic stronghold that includes the
Navajo Reservation. Because of a mix-up, Democrats failed to field
any House candidates in the district this year, giving Republicans
a rare opening. Both parties are fielding write-in candidates for
seats in the district.
</P>
<P>
   And former Democratic chairman Steve Owens, in his second bid to
unseat GOP Rep. J.D. Hayworth, gave his opponent a major opening
last week by saying he had invited President Clinton to help him in
the state's sprawling Congressional District 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's being politically tone deaf,'' said Hayworth, noting that
many other Democrats around the country are putting distance
between themselves and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not since (former Rep.) Karan English brought in (handgun
control advocate) Sarah Brady have we had such a fundamental
misreading of the constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, though, see signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Because they have only a handful of contested primary contests,
the party's brightest lights have been able to conserve campaign
funds and avoid political blood-letting. Strategists point to
intraparty GOP warfare in the races for attorney general and
Arizona Corporation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though primary turnout may be low, there are many, many
pluses. We do not have John Kaites and Tom McGovern killing each
other,'' Jackson said, referring to the Republican candidates for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Democrats' attorney general candidate, former U.S.
Attorney Janet Napolitano, may be the party's best hope for
avoiding an across-the-board defeat in statewide races this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also feel they have a chance, albeit slight, of
regaining parity with the GOP in the state Senate. If they can do
that, and avoid being crushed in statewide contests, Democratic
strategists say that the party's resurgence is possible. They point
to a projected large increase in the state's Hispanic population, a
traditionally Democratic group.
</P>
<P>
   Up until the 1980s, Democrats enjoyed a comfortable advantage in
statewide voter registration. Since then, Republicans have gained
an overwhelming edge in Maricopa County, the state's largest
county, and made significant inroads into the state's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Hayworth's large district, Republicans this year for the
first time have a slight voter registration advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman attributes the shift to a large influx of
Republicans to suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Californians who come here are coming from Orange County
and not Marin,'' he said. ``I think there is a growing conservative
majority in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is Republican domination of the Legislature, the
state's congressional delegation, the executive branch, the
corporation commission and the Maricopa County Board of
Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, some Democrats said they don't see hope for the
party's revival unless a dynamic leader emerges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the party had many dominant figures, including
Gov. Bruce Babbitt, U.S. Rep. Morris Udall and Sen. Dennis
DeConcini.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until another Bruce Babbitt comes along to sort of
reinvigorate the party, it's kind of hard to imagine it coming
back,'' one prominent Arizona Democrat said. ``It literally is
going to take that.'' &QL;

US WEST CUSTOMERS STILL WAITING FOR SERVICE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BECKY RAMSDELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 64-year-old Sheila Brown moved from one apartment to
another within her complex last month, she expected to be without a
telephone for about a day.
</P>
<P>
   But the US West strike has left the Phoenix woman, who lives
alone and suffers from chronic asthma attacks and other health
problems, fighting to get her new installation done on an emergency
basis. She's been without phone service for 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   And she's not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the work stoppage, we had a whole bunch more people
define themselves as emergency cases than we normally do,'' US West
spokesman Jim Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   The company typically gives emergency cases priority, but
doesn't formally track how many of those requests are received.
Roof estimated that only a small number of the 500 orders received
daily are labeled emergencies. And it's also hard to tell how many
of those cases are valid emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   What customers define as an emergency situation isn't always
critical in US West's view. For instance, people who are concerned
about elderly parents in another state can't get emergency service,
Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The compelling emergency case situation is going to be someone
with a medical condition of significance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers began returning to work last week to tackle a backlog
of 13,000 new orders and several thousand repair orders. New orders
are keeping the backlog at about that number, Roof added. It will
be four to six weeks before the backlog is cleared and orders
return to a normal three- to four-day wait for hookup, he
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   As a thank-you gesture to US West customers, the company offered
free directory assistance Saturday and Sunday. Company officials
said they didn't know how many customers took advantage of the
offer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crews are now doing more business orders than residential ones
to minimize the financial effects on companies. Some crews were
working specifically on emergencies during the strike, but those
cases are now assigned to the crew working in the area, Roof said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from businesses, `If I can't get my calls, I'm not in
business,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said she told US West of her health condition, but added
that it hasn't helped. She said she often wakes up during the
night, choking and struggling to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone, years ago, used to be a luxury. Now it's a
necessity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her friends, Olivia L'Heureux, lives close by and checks
on Brown daily. Both women say the lack of service is the strikers'
fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do blame the strikers,'' L'Heureux said. ``I really don't
have a lot of sympathy for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A local union leader said he sympathizes with Brown, but US West
has restricted overtime hours for returning workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are permitted only eight overtime hours a week, said Joe
Gosiger, president of Communication Workers of America Local 7019.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have them question why the company, US West, is
limiting the amount of voluntary overtime to our people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said the company is limiting overtime because it was one of
the union's biggest issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we don't want to get people back and just load them
up with overtime,'' he said. ``We're trying to be as sensitive as
we can to the Number 1 issue they mentioned again and again and
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's installation was scheduled for Aug. 20 but was delayed
by the strike. After a series of attempts to get service, Brown
said she was told her order would be taken care of around Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Roof said part of the delay in Brown's case was that she
requested two phone lines. Her first line is scheduled for
installation Tuesday, but Roof said he has requested both lines be
done then.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who doesn't have a computer, said she only asked for one
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't order two. What do I need two for?'' she asked. ``I
just want my own little phone ringing again.'' &QL;

A BIGGER HITTER THAN BIG MAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After four years on the Queens College baseball team, Albert
Kapikian had to face the fact that he'd never make it to the big
leagues; never stand in the batter's box at Yankee Stadium in his
hometown, the Bronx; never break the records of Ruth or Maris or
anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to most guys.
</P>
<P>
   You reach an age when you must come to terms with your abilities
_ or lack of them _ and move on. Kapikian understood this and
adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't hit more than 60 home runs a year, so he settled for
saving 600,000 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   All of them under the age of 5.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Dr. Kapikian will receive no fat endorsement deals, no
multimillion-dollar signing bonuses, no standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   His face has never been on a magazine cover, playing card or box
of Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, he wonders why a writer for a newspaper in Phoenix
would want to speak with an obscure research scientist in Bethesda,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   So I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   It's because he receives no fat endorsement deals, no
multimillion-dollar siging bonuses, no standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   It's because his face has never been on a magazine cover,
playing card or box of Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   It's because kids all over America _ all over the world _ know
the name Mark McGwire and don't know the name Albert Kapikian.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better at this, thankfully, than I was at baseball,'' he
says. &QL; 
PRODUCES A VACCINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 25 years of work, Dr. Kapikian and scientists at the
National Institutes of Health, produced a vaccine against
rotavirus, an infection that kills hundreds of thousands of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who work on research studies are like baseball
players,'' he says. ``We must think of it as a long season. Our
percentage of success is small. But the work is a joy. And, in a
way, it's getting paid for performing a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among
children. Just about every boy and girl in every country, rich or
poor, contracts it sooner or later. In America, somewhere between
50,000 and 100,000 kids wind up in the hospital because of it. Few
of them die, however, because health care here is good.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, millions had died, and would continue to die without
people like Kapikian. I stumbled on his name in a brief wire
service story.
</P>
<P>
   He the son of Armenian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   His mother worked in a tie factory. His father was a photo
engraver. He got into research after medical school, thinking he'd
work in the field for only a short time. That was 40 years ago. &QL; 
`WOULDN'T TRADE MY LIFE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade my life for anything,'' he says. ``I have a
wonderful family. I've worked with dedicated, talented people. And
now, this vaccine could have a major impact on a part of the world
where children suffer most. That would mean everything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The drug company Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories worked with
Kapikian's group and will produce the vaccine. Getting it to
children will require working with the World Health Organization
and others. It's expensive, complicated, political.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it will happen,`` Kapikian says. ``It must.''
</P>
<P>
   Generations from now, children reading about the exploits of the

   ``Our field has many other rewards,'' he says. ``I think of the
children who'll get to live to adulthood, all the potential they
possess and what they may accomplish with their lives. There's
plenty of satisfaction in that. More than I could dream of.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ernest Thompson was eagerly bound for another leg
of his lifetime odyssey to absorb his family heritage in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the resident of suburban Chatsworth wound up among
the 229 killed aboard Swissair's ill-fated Flight 111 off the Nova
Scotia coast Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The retired Rocketdyne engineer's death seems unfair, his
grieving family and friends said Saturday as they sifted through
photographs and meaningful passages by Thompson, an avid reader and
passionate writer.
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 70, he still had a passion to learn more about his
wife of 45 years and four grown children, whose hands he would
proudly clasp while walking down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved life and everything that went with it. He was
gregarious, is another word that comes to mind,'' said Guy Ervin
III, who worked with Thompson for 25 years at Rocketdyne and last
saw him a week before the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little numb. It just doesn't seem fair. There he
was, off on another one of his adventures. What were (the
passengers) thinking? It's just frightening,'' Ervin said at his
Chatsworth home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice a week, Thompson attended ballroom and folk
dancing classes with his wife, who learned of the fatal crash while
attending an Armenian folk dance Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He would frequently serenade his wife, who works as an office
administrator at a property management company, to encourage her
into retiring so that they could spend the rest of their lives
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would sing the song `I Wanna Dance With You' to me and say,
I want you to retire 'cause I want to dance with you,'' his widow,
Mary, said Saturday, pulling from her wallet a palm-size
anniversary card from her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``To 30 years of thick and thin, better and worse, happiness,
trials and tribulations, warmth, love _ in other words to life _
shared with a wonderful woman as dear to me today as the day we
married, Ernie,'' his message read.
</P>
<P>
   ``We nicknamed him `Earnest Ernest.' That was him,'' Ervin said.
``He always paid close attention to things going on and was always
eager to listen to what people had to say. Of course, you had to
listen to him because he had things to say, too. That was his
quality, the importance of being earnest, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oswego, N.Y., Thompson was an Army paratrooper before
graduating from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y. He
later worked as an engineer for Pratt &AMP; Whitney Aircraft in Windsor
Locks, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 he moved to suburban Canoga Park, working in
aeronautics. In 1961 he became a welding engineer at Rocketdyne,
where he worked for 26 years, assigned to projects requiring
special welding techniques, such as in the building of rocket
engines and the space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Though retired for more than 10 years, Thompson was routinely
called back as a consultant at Rocketdyne's Santa Susana Energy
Technology Engineering Center _ even as recently as two weeks ago
to help with a ``fast breeder'' nuclear reactor project for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had special knowledge that nobody else did,'' Ervin said,
calling Thompson a meticulous worker who always had stories to tell
of his travels.
</P>
<P>
   His fascination with Greece stemmed from his Greek father, said
his widow. ``He was constantly learning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   His trip would have included spending three weeks with an elder
hostel group touring the antiquities of Greece, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was sorry that I wasn't going with him. I guess it wasn't
meant for me to go,'' his widow said Saturday at their Chatsworth
home.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the Saturday before he traveled, she was
concerned about his trip, worried about the recent bombings of the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that I was not comfortable with him going on this
trip,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday, the family instead focused on Thompson's love of
life.
</P>
<P>
   When away from his consulting work, Thompson immersed himself in
his family _ always the one to wait around at his children's new
homes for utility workers to show up, or to ``cat-sit'' for a
vacationing family member.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was interested and interesting,'' said one of Thompson's
daughters, Kathy, 42, at the family home Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no task too big if his children needed something,''
added son Stephen, 39, of Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   His other surviving family members include daughter Kim
Thompson-Janecke, 44, of Seattle and son David, 36, of Simi Valley
in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Hills labor law attorney Jana DeMeire, 39, also was
among the passengers on the MD-11 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire had left for a two-week vacation in Greece, said her
father, Frank DeMeire, 65, who had come from his home in Costa Rica
to watch his daughter's cats while she was away.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, he said, had planned to travel with her, but missed
a connecting flight in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said that on the day before his daughter left, she spoke
to him by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wished her a bon voyage,'' he said. ``I was going to meet
her when she got back. We were very close.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMeire said his daughter was ``very outgoing, very friendly,
had lots of friends.'' She also volunteered at the Venice Family
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just looked forward to seeing me when she got back,'' said
her father, who described what he has been going through since the
crash as ``hell.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Aug. 29,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000

such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

   &UR; SPIN CYCLE: HOW THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE MEDIA MANIPULATE THE
NEWS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Howard Kurtz. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the bad marriage between President Clinton's
spinmeisters and a deeply mistrustful press corps, the media
reporter for The Washington Post shows how both sides connive to
control and package the news. The book, which features a new
chapter on the Lewinsky relationship, is ``a revealing, highly
detailed insider account,'' Wendy Kaminer wrote here earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAKING WAVES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mario Vargas Llosa. Edited by John King. Penguin, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   In a collection of essays written over a 30-year period, the
Peruvian author reveals an enduring fascination with history and
politics, as well as a desire to balance social justice and
individual freedom, employing models from Sartre to Faulkner to
Isaiah Berlin. Last year in the Book Review, Jay Parini called this
``a diverse and representative volume that allows us, for the first
time, to trace this enigmatic, often brilliant writer's ...
intellectual journey.''  &UR; WHO KILLED PALOMINO MOLERO? &LR; 
(Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $11), one of two novels by Vargas
Llosa that have recently been restored to print, is a detective
story about the murder of a singer and a meditation on the elusive
nature of truth, love and evil. In 1987 our reviewer, Richard
Lourie, called the writing ``spare, rich and cruelly beautiful.''
The same publisher has reissued  &UR; THE REAL LIFE OF ALEJANDRO MAYTA &LR; 
($13), which interweaves two narratives: that of the title
character, a guerrilla who leads a failed uprising in the Peruvian
mountains, and that of the novelist-narrator, who struggles to
reconstruct Mayta's life and times. ``It is the reader in the end
who 'writes' the story, piecing it together from all the lies and
contradictions, the unreliable testimony and historical `data'''
Robert Coover wrote here in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SEX ON THE BRAIN: THE BIOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND
WOMEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Deborah Blum. Penguin, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   Are women sentenced to be nurturing and passive? Are men doomed
to be aggressive? Judging from the physiological and behavioral
research into such loaded questions, our actions appear to be
driven in surprising ways by both biology and culture. ``Blum
manages the tricky art of good science reporting'' and writes
''clearly and accessibly,'' Ann Finkbeiner said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY LIFE, STARRING DARA FALCON &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Beattie. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This novel's narrator, a naive housewife who is both passive and
sympathetic, is victimized in ways large and small by a would-be
actress who blows into her New Hampshire town. Beattie ``is as good
at acute observation as she ever was,'' Jim Shepard wrote here in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY: A MEMOIR OF LIFE IN DEATH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jean-Dominique Bauby. Vintage International, $11.
</P>
<P>
   A French magazine editor, after suffering a major stroke at the
age of 43, was left totally alert but unable to move anything but
his left eyelid, a condition that nonetheless allowed him to write
this lyrical book by means of an alphabetical code. ``The author
displays a writerly control equal to his honesty,'' our reviewer,
Thomas Mallon, said last year.  &UR; LOOK UP FOR YES &LR; , by Julia Tavalaro
and Richard Tayson (Penguin, $12.95), is another vivid survival
story by a stroke victim, in this case a Long Island woman who
awakens paralyzed in an unfamiliar hospital after a seven-month
coma. Tavalaro is ``endowed with extraordinary powers of memory and
description,'' Paula Friedman said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GUT SYMMETRIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeanette Winterson. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   This novel, whose title refers to both the human body and the
grand unified theory pursued by physicists, unfolds in the minds of
its three main characters: a Princeton scientist, his longtime wife
and a woman physicist who becomes romantically involved with both.
Last year our reviewer, Bruce Bawer, admired the author's ``fresh,
vivid way of putting things.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE FIRST MODERNS: PROFILES IN THE ORIGINS OF TWENTIETH-CENTURY
THOUGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William R. Everdell. University of Chicago, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The author locates the roots of modernism in discontinuity, a
fractured worldview that rejects smoothness as illusory and began
percolating through math, physics and painting in the late 19th
century. Everdell ``has himself recombined the parts of our era's
intellectual history in new and startling ways,'' Hugh Kenner said
here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE OF US &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Freeman. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   During the last days of British rule in Egypt, an ambassador
tries to turn the young King Farouk into a proper Englishman, a
misguided plan that results in cuckoldry and revenge. In this
historical novel of clashing cultures, ``Freeman has splendidly
re-created a fading colonial world,'' Jonathan Wilson wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHERE LATE THE SWEET BIRDS SANG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Kate Wilhelm. Orb/Tom Doherty, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   In this science fiction tale, the sterile survivors of a global
environmental catastrophe turn to mass cloning, but the clones'
communal upbringing deprives them of imagination and creativity.
The author's ``cautionary message comes through loud and clear,''
Gerald Jonas said here in 1976.

   LABORDAY-CAMPAIGN _ Though it's traditionally considered the
start of the fall political season, Georgia politicos will be doing
little campaign labor on that day. With the advent of media driven
campaigns, old fashioned barbeques and parades culminating in
rallies on the courthouse square on national holidays have given
way to ratings points and carefully crafted 30-second scripts that
really haven't stopped since the July 21 primaries. We take a look
at what the top tier candidates are doing and what politicos and
such have to say about how the races will shape up from here
entering the homestretch of the campaign. (Pruitt, Atlanta

   MOVING-MUSICIANS (New York) _ For thousands of musicians who

was Dr. William Minor, a surgeon residing in Crowthorne in the
English countryside in Berkshire. Murray, who had not yet met
Minor, assumed that he was a ``practicing medical man of literary
tastes with a good deal of leisure.'' To his astonishment, he
turned out to be a patient in the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic

old economic model for success on its head. While broadcast
networks battle to attract big audiences with expensive
programming, so-called narrowcast channels have been building
highly profitable businesses by thinking small and keeping

IS XEROX RUNNING THE NETWORKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are only so many original ideas out there, right? Then
again, maybe the big shots have decided to put the same show on the
air twice, at different times and on different networks, as a
service to harried consumers. (Sure. And the different titles and
different casts are just a necessary means of getting around some
union red tape.) Thus, on the fall schedule we have:
</P>
<P>
   A family comedy about an independent woman juggling her job
(barmaid), her dreams (finding a better job) and her
responsibilities (an oddball family). On NBC it's called ``Jesse,''
with Christina Applegate (``Married . . . With Children'') as a
spunky single mom. On Fox it's ``Costello,'' with comedian Sue
Costello as a spunky single ma'am.
</P>
<P>
   A family comedy about a little kid living with two bachelors. On
ABC it's ``Brother's Keeper'' (the boy is 8; the older guys are his
dad and uncle). On UPN it's ``Guys Like Us'' (the boy is 6; the
older guys are his brother and the brother's roommate). For good
measure, there's also ``Holding the Baby'' on Fox, in which an
infant lives with his father and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dream as seen by an African American family moving
to the white suburbs. On ABC it's ``The Hughleys.'' On Fox it's
``Living in Captivity.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, a ``Twin Peaks'' Update
</P>
<P>
   If cherry pie and a good cuppa joe start turning up in scripts
this fall, the ``Twin Peaks'' TV renaissance will be virtually
complete, if not a little unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Flynn Boyle started it last season when she joined ``The
Practice'' as a hard prosecutor with a soft spot for Dylan
McDermott. Of course, ``Peaks'' fans will always know her as Donna
Hayward, Laura Palmer's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   This season, five more people with close ties to the ``Peaks''
phenomenon of the early '90s are back with TV series. It could have
been six, but Fox said ixnay to a new version of ``The Invisible
Man'' featuring Kyle MacLachlan (Agent Dale Cooper). The ``Peaks''
rundown:
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Lee _ Laura Palmer herself _ plays a physician in ``L.A.
Doctors'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Madchen Amick, formerly the abused waitress, Shelly Johnson, is
one of Mr. Roarke's mysterious assistants on ABC's remake of
``Fantasy Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherilynn Fenn, the sexy Audrey Horne, is now a recovering
alcoholic on Showtime's new series, ``Rude Awakening,'' which
premiered last month.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Frost, a co-creator of ``Twin Peaks,'' has a new series on
CBS _ ``Buddy Faro'' _ with Dennis Farina playing a private eye.
</P>
<P>
   Moira Kelly, who played Boyle's character, Donna Hayward, in the
1992 film, ``Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,'' is, like Boyle,
playing a prosecuting attorney _ in CBS's ``To Have and To Hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Next, Please
</P>
<P>
   The next Chuck Norris?
</P>
<P>
   Gotta be the well-padded Sammo Hung, whose ``Martial Law''
precedes Norris' ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' on Saturday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The next almost perfect match?
</P>
<P>
   A tossup: Debra Messing and Eric McCormack of ``Will &AMP; Grace'';
Paula Marshall and Jeremy Piven of ``Cupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The next laughingstock?
</P>
<P>
   Neck and neck between ``The Army Show'' or ``The Secret Diary of
Desmond Pfeiffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Best reason for a title change
</P>
<P>
   ``That '70s Show'' was going to be ``Teenage Wasteland,'' but
producer Terry Turner says Pete Townshend of The Who wouldn't give
his permission. The producers toyed with ``Reelin' in the Years,''
then settled on ``Feelin' Alright,'' but focus-group participants
who liked the concept kept calling it ``That '70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' Turner said, ``we just gave up.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-best reason for a title change
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. Doctors'' was originally going to be ``L.A. Docs.'' But
producer Mark Johnson said a change was made to avoid any
misconception that the series was about hunky stevedores on the
wharves at San Pedro.

AND THE CHIEFTAINS WILL DO THE MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of writers in Hollywood now wish ``Ally McBeal'' had
sprung from their laptops, but most have a legitimate excuse. They
were busy working on Irish-themed series for the coming season when
Ally emerged from David E. Kelley's prolific shop.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised, however, if the following TV treatments pop
up soon as the febrile honchos at the networks and the studios try
to play catch-up _ and cash in on two trends at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Alley McReal'': Searching for truer grit, MTV merges ``The
Real World'' with ``Road Rules'' to focus on a dozen Gen-X'ers
living out of Dumpsters in a seedy part of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Bali McKneel'': An inner-city Catholic priest moves his
parish to a diocese across the international date line so his
Saturday night show on ABC can air on Sunday and attract a larger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cali McHeal'': Hector Elizondo plays a courageous physician
who, with the help of the IRA, infiltrates the Colombian drug
cartel for no particular reason in this lighthearted CBS spinoff of
``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Deli McDeal'': From NBC Studios comes this comedy about a
high-powered theatrical agent who won't sign new clients until
they've shared a corned-beef sandwich with her.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Finale McReel'': American Movie Classics takes a look at the
endings of the best-loved Irish-themed films of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Galley McVeal'': PBS introduces a Saturday cooking show
devoted exclusively to dishes incorporating the meat of calves
raised on Irish whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rally McWheel'': Fox tracks down obscure footage of the
wackiest crashes from the Irish road-racing circuit.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Sally McField'': A&AMP;E aims to snare some unsuspecting viewers
with this coyly titled installment of ``Biography,'' slated to air
around St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Tamale McPeal'': Pepsi underwrites a syndicated series based
on Hemingway's ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' shot on location inside
Taco Bells around the world.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Valley McMeal'': Like, three teenagers get work at, like, a
burger place in, like, Southern California. Starring, like,
whoever's been in the latest horror film. On The WB.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out of the city
</P>
<P>
   No big surprise that the Los Angeles/New York axis continues to
dominate when creators are situating their new series. (Boston,
Chicago and San Francisco tend to serve as the most creative
alternatives.) After all, writers write what they know _ and what's
least expensive to shoot _ and not too many of them live in Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
   So, bonus points to these five new shows for hauling out the
atlas and venturing beyond Hohum, U.S.A., even if a couple of the
places are fictional.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Guys Like Us'' (UPN). Can Cleveland be cool enough to
accommodate Drew Carey and former MTV game-show host Chris
Hardwick?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Legacy'' (UPN). Set in and around Lexington, Ky., this
period piece (late 1800s) is actually shot in Virginia. But, in an
industry where North Carolina can sub for Massachusetts (``Dawson's
Creek''), it's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``That '70s Show'' (Fox). ``Laverne &AMP; Shirley'' was set in
Milwaukee in the '70s. Now comes this series, set in fictional
Point Place, Wis. Must be the cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Maggie Winters'' (CBS). Faith Ford played a Southerner in
D.C. for a decade on ``Murphy Brown,'' so she didn't want this
coming-home comedy to make her another Daughter of the Confederacy.
They settled on Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Wind on Water'' (NBC). True, ``Magnum'' and ``Five-O'' did
the Hawaii thing, but they never strayed far from Honolulu. This Bo
Derek vehicle, while it may lack traction, manages to bounce all
over the geographically blessed Big Island.

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Monday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   The people behind this show were wise to create a gimmick _
namely, that the ``p'' in Pfeiffer is not silent _ just so critics
might have something to write about. The show itself isn't worth a
lot of ink.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, ironically, it's a hoot. For one thing, there aren't
many comedies set during the Lincoln administration. And who knew
that Lincoln's butler was his closest confidant? In execution,
though, ``Desmond Pfeiffer'' is just another White House scandal
awaiting prosecution, or at least an apology. The crime: using the
Oval Office and the Lincoln bedroom for questionable comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The producers and the network have been invoking the name Monty
Python in describing the sort of modern-day satire they're
attempting here. It's good to have lofty goals, but such talk does
a grievous disservice to the brave comedy of the Python troupe.
</P>
<P>
   Chi McBride (``The John Larroquette Show'') and Dann Florek
(``L.A. Law,'' ``Law &AMP; Order'') probably thought they were getting
into something fresh and distinctive with ``Desmond Pfeiffer.''
Turns out they're up to their armpits in it. Bottom line:
Puh-feiffer isn't puh-funny.
</P>
<P>
   _ The King of Queens
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   You may have already seen _ and rejected _ this show. ABC had a
midseason entry earlier this year titled ``That's Life.'' The
premise was identical: Working-class dude finally gets his ``guy
sanctuary,'' complete with big-screen TV, only to have some
unfortunate relatives move in and disrupt his idea of nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Remini (``Fired Up'') and Kevin James (``Everybody Loves
Raymond'') make ``The King of Queens'' a bit more engaging than
``That's Life,'' but not so appealing as to cause one to alter
one's viewing habits. Indeed, an inexplicable cast change after the
pilot was shot may make it even less engaging. Jack Carter,
perfectly acceptable as the father of Remini's character, Carrie
Heffernan, was jettisoned in favor of Jerry Stiller (``Seinfeld'').
</P>
<P>
   Carter's scenes have now been reshot with Stiller, but to what
advantage? With ``Seinfeld'' reruns on every day, we already see
plenty of George Costanza's annoying father.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hyperion Bay
</P>
<P>
   The WB
</P>
<P>
   This slick relationship drama might not seem to be the logical
stablemate for ``7th Heaven,'' but those programmers at The WB are
pretty cagey. ``Hyperion Bay'' is nothing more than the parable of
the prodigal son, updated for Windows 98. What better to follow a
show about a minister's family?
</P>
<P>
   Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who had a mini-career as the hunky blond
heartthrob, Zack Morris, on ``Saved by the Bell'' and ``Saved by
the Bell: The College Years,'' goes the dark-haired route as the
star of his first prime-time series. Gosselaar is the prodigal son,
Dennis Sweeny, a geeky kid who left the decaying seaside town of
Hyperion, Calif., in a beater Honda and returns in a Mercedes
drop-top with a drop-dead girlfriend (Sydney Penny). He's back in
town to open and manage a new division of the software company that
has made him rich and powerful, and he is the great hope of
Hyperion's failing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The town is happy to see him, save for older brother Nick (Dylan
Neal). Nick used to be the star of the family _ great athlete,
perfect marriage _ and he's the one who stayed behind to work in
their father's construction business, Sweeny &AMP; Son.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's resentment of Dennis sets up the necessary conflict in
this reasonably well-crafted drama, but it can't possibly sustai a
season unless ``Hyperion Bay'' aspires to becoming a daytime soap.
Another disadvantage: ``Hyperion Bay'' goes up against ``Ally
McBeal,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and, in most parts of the
country, ``Monday Night Football.'' The WB is accustomed to small,
cultish audiences, but the audience for this one might fit into
Dennis Sweeny's Mercedes coupe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Conrad Bloom
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   Conrad Bloom is one of the last unmarried nice guys in New York
City, so it follows that women are flocking to him like CNBC
pundits to a camera.
</P>
<P>
   But not for reasons you might imagine. Conrad is a guy who can't
say no, and so the women in his life _ his boss, his co-worker, his
sister, his ex-girlfriend and his mom _ are happy to take
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode, Mark Feuerstein (``Fired Up'') plays
Conrad with just enough backbone to keep him upright, allowing
Linda Lavin to steal the show as his recently widowed mother,
Florie. With equal measures honey and vinegar, Lavin lays claim to
the best Jewish mother role in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein is pleasant enough as a put-upon ad copywriter, but
``Conrad Bloom'' has the look and feel of so many other NBC
comedies of recent vintage that, if it were tossed into a blender
with its two Monday night bookends _ ``Suddenly Susan'' and
``Caroline in the City'' _ the viewer probably wouldn't see much
difference in the end result.
</P>
<P>
   _ Guys Like Us
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Jenny McCarthy. This year, it's Chris
Hardwick's turn. Who knew that the MTV game show, ``Singled Out,''
was such a launching pad to sitcom mediocrity?
</P>
<P>
   Hardwick plays Sean Barker, a musician whose layabout bachelor
lifestyle is seriously threatened when his roommate's 6-year-old
brother moves in with them. As always happens in these shows, the
youngster _ Maestro Harrell in this case _ is cuter than the latest
Beanie Baby. And, as UPN sitcoms go, this one is a slight
improvement over its many embarrassing predecessors. But, while
imparting some valuable information _ example: The words to
``Amazing Grace'' fit perfectly to the theme song from of
``Gilligan's Island'' _ this is still a very average entrant on a
very crowded schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Hardwick's overacting is tempered somewhat by Bumper Robinson's
less frantic portrayal of roommate Jared Harris, a smooth-talking
ladies' man, but it's hard to imagine making a second date with
``Guys Like Us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ DiResta
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   John DiResta and Leila Kenzle have that warm-and-bubbly kind of
chemistry that can make all the difference in a TV show. It seems
they genuinely like each other, or maybe they're just fabulous
actors. Either way, it well serves a comedy that is otherwise
unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiResta'' is based on DiResta's 12 years as a New York City
subway cop, an experience he has already milked as a stand-up comic
and as the star of his own off-Broadway show, ``BEAT, A Subway
Cop's Comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind DiResta's tough-guy exterior is a real softie, both on
the job (New York's squalid subway tunnels) and at home (a rented
house in Queens). Kenzle decided to leave ``Mad About You'' to play
DiResta's headstrong wife, Kate, who is usually right about most
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiResta'' is going for the same ``Honeymooners'' feel that its
time-slot competitor, ``The King of Queens,'' is seeking.
``DiResta'' comes a little closer, possibly because John DiResta
looks a little like Jackie Gleason, possibly because DiResta and
Kenzle make a nice TV couple.
</P>
<P>
   _ Will &AMP; Grace
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, Debra Messing is going to hit it big. Casting
directors love those wide-set eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Stage experience doesn't hurt, either. From a pre-Broadway
workshop of ``Angels in America: Perestroika'' to a Seattle
appearance in ``The Importance of Being Earnest'' (Intiman, 1993),
Messing's resume has gotten her steady work in TV, including
recurring roles on ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Seinfeld,'' two seasons on
``Ned &AMP; Stacey'' and a well-received though short-lived stint as a
scientist on last season's ``Prey.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is the vehicle that carries Messing to,
say, the Helen Hunt stratum is anybody's guess. But ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' is certainly one of the more polished comedies emerging
from the studio factories this fall. Some will label it
controversial because one of the principal characters is
homosexual. Others will be annoyed that the show doesn't wear the
homosexuality issue on its sleeve the way ``Ellen'' did in its last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Messing's character, Grace, isn't the gay one. That would be
Will, played smartly _ and not stereotypically _ by Eric McCormack.
Will and Grace are clearly soulmates, both looking for love, and
both aware that romance between them, despite their perfect
chemistry, isn't an option. If for no other reason than the
opportunity to explore a male-female relationship that doesn't
hinge on their ending up in the sack, ``Will &AMP; Grace'' looks like a
refreshing new TV comedy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Brian Benben Show
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   In the HBO comedy series ``Dream On,'' Brian Benben played to
small but extremely devoted audiences. CBS is banking on that
loyalty by using Benben's unusual surname in the title of his new
show.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing like a little pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what ``The Brian Benben Show'' is all about. Benben
plays a competent Los Angeles news anchor who gets bounced down to
feature reporter in favor of a new Ken-and-Barbie anchor team.
Benben wants his old job back, and he uses every trick he knows to
get back to the top in the high-anxiety world of TV news.
</P>
<P>
   Benben goes more for laughs than for dead-on realism, and he
succeeds some of the time in the pilot episode. The rest of the
pilot, however, has that unnatural, forced feeling. Kind of like a
bad TV newscast.
</P>
<P>
   _ L.A. Doctors
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent series (``EZ Streets''), Ken Olin played a
troubled cop with a mysterious dark side. In ``L.A. Doctors,''
Olin's character, Roger Cattan, isn't without attitude, but as an
idealistic physician dismayed by the red tape of HMOs and managed
care, he is definitely painted several shades lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers expecting a hospital show in the manner of ``ER'' and
``Chicago Hope'' may be disappointed. ``L.A. Doctors'' has the same
stylish appeal as ``L.A. Law,'' combining breezy banter with stormy
issues in an office setting.
</P>
<P>
   Olin is joined by Matt Craven, Rick Roberts and Sheryl Lee in
trying to practice medicine the way Hippocrates intended. The main
problem with the pilot episode is a serious case of goshdarn
earnestness. Being idealistic is fine; being unrealistic is
dangerous.

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Tuesday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Hughleys
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   The Hughleys are pursuing the dream, which still comes with a
house in the suburbs. For Darryl Hughley, however, it might be a
nightmare on Elm Street.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley, played by comedian D.L. Hughley, is a successful
businessman with a nice family. He's not a bad guy, but he can be a
little chippy at times, quick to question the most innocent
intentions because he's a black person in a white neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl's wife, Yvonne (Elise Neal), is the diplomat who smooths
things over, but Darryl is going to have to come around one of
these days, or all the neighbors will be talking about him, but not
necessarily to him.
</P>
<P>
   Of two new sitcoms with nearly identical premises (the other is
``Living in Captivity'' on Fox), ``The Hughleys'' may have the
edge, because it's edgier. Maybe it's that Chris Rock is one of the
executive producers. Maybe it's that the neighbors aren't made out
to be idiots.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, it's pronounced HYOO-gleez, not HYOO-leez.
</P>
<P>
   _ Costello
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of those who might think Costello is Italian instead of
Irish, the producers changed the name of Sue Costello's character
to Sue Murphy for this working-class comedy set in South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, though. Sue Costello is Irish from Southie. If
she were Italian, she'd live in the North End.
</P>
<P>
   Costello could light an entire city with her energy. She's
bright, funny, and fun to be with. Some of that comes across in the
pilot of ``Costello,'' but not all of it.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the curse of the comedian as actor. Some are able to
pull it off. Others never quite get it. Or it could be that the
writing isn't capturing Costello's true nature.
</P>
<P>
   And naming the show ``Costello,'' as if she's as well known as,
say, Bill Cosby, is a bit much. The feisty Costello probably
doesn't mind the pressure _ the show is indeed based on her life _
but it seems a bit presumptuous to expect viewers to recognize the
name. ``Mouthy in Southie'' might have worked better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Encore! Encore!
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!,'' starring Tony Award winner Nathan Lane, is
still a mystery, mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Given a nice spot between ``Mad About You'' and ``Just Shoot
Me,'' it ought to do reasonably well. But NBC chose not to show it
to critics during the July press tour. ``Retooling,'' they said.
Perhaps to make it look less like ``Frasier.''
</P>
<P>
   The premise has Lane playing Joseph Pinoni, an opera star forced
to retire to his family's Napa Valley vineyard. Though he has left
the stage, Pinoni has not abandoned theatricality. Master of the
grand entrance, he works hard at being the center of attention. His
best friend, Joseph (James Patrick Stuart), is described as ``a
wealthy dilettante and self-styled artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? It should. David Angell, Peter Casey and David
Lee, the creative collective behind ``Frasier,'' are the creators
of ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   _ Brimstone
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   When someone suggests that Ezekiel Stone can go to hell, he can
reply smugly, ``Been there, done that, thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone, you see, is already dead, and because he killed a man in
cold blood during his days as a New York cop, he went to hell when
he died. He's back on Earth now under a devilish work-release
program that requires him to round up 113 escapees from Hades, all
of whom who happen to possess supernatural powers. In fact, Satan
has promised Stone redemption if he can round up all 113.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. One hundred and thirteen miscreants divided by 22
episodes a year. That's five seasons. Stone won't need redemption;
with that many shows in the can, he'll be in eternal syndication,
where the pay is better.
</P>
<P>
   But Stone can't worry about royalties right now. He knows that
if he doesn't round up the escapees, the whole world is doomed _
and he goes back to hell. Peter Horton plays Stone with a touch of
black humor, but ``Brimstone,'' like ``Millennium,'' will probably
seem a little dark and inaccessible to most viewers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Felicity
</P>
<P>
   The WB
</P>
<P>
   Living up to heavy-duty buzz can be torture for a new TV show.
And the buzz champ for the '98-'99 season is ``Felicity,'' which
means expectations will be completely unrealistic, and backlash
virtually certain.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, ``Felicity'' airs on The WB, a small network that gives
shows time to grow, and time to suffer the inevitable disaffection
of people who like the sizzle more than the steak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dawson's Creek'' experienced it last season, but settled in
comfortably after riding the roller coaster.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Felicity,'' The WB has another chance to position itself
as the network of well-made, relationship drama, regardless of the
expectations. Keri Russell plays Felicity Porter, a teen-ager who
disapoints her parents by choosing to go to college at a university
in New York, even though her dad could have pulled some strings to
get her into Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity herself is a little bummed after tasting her first bite
of the Apple. She chose a school in New York because a boy she
hardly knew in high school chose the same university. And it turns
out he's already attached.
</P>
<P>
   So Felicity, growing up fast in a strange place, wrestles with
her choices _ stay or go, pre-med or art, paper or plastic _ and we
get to watch. Russell makes it eminently watchable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mercy Point
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   Finally! A good hospital where you can get quality care whenever
you suspect one of those wormy alien creatures is living inside
your chest.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that HMOs haven't yet figured out the maximum
permissible hospital stay for an alienectomy. At Mercy Point, it's
probably 20 minutes. We're in the 23rd century, after all, when
modern medicine is even able to eliminate the embarrassment of
decapitation.
</P>
<P>
   To work at Mercy Point, situated at the farthest known explored
point of the galaxy, it helps to have an odd name, such as Dr.
Grote Maxwell, or Dr. Haylen Breslauer, or Dr. Caleb Jurado, or Dr.
Rema Cook.
</P>
<P>
   The most normal name at Mercy Point belongs to the head nurse.
At least it sounds normal: Annie. But it's spelled ANI, for Android
Nursing Interface. Looks like the nurses' union lost the battle
over the hiring of cyborgs.
</P>
<P>
   Quality-wise, ``Mercy Point'' is closer to ``Babylon 5'' than it
is to ``ER.'' But that's not all bad. ``Babylon 5'' has better
fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sports Night
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   Attention, sports fans (and non-sports fans, too). ``Sports
Night'' may be one of the most attractive new shows of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fitted to the comedy model, ``Sport Night'' isn't your average
comedy. ABC doesn't even call it a comedy, though it will play with
a laugh track. (Creator Aaron Sorkin, who wrote ``A Few Good Men''
and ``The American President,'' wishes it wouldn't.)
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of ``Sports Night,'' possibly reflecting the
involvement of Ron Howard's Imagine Television, is that the
characters are amazingly, refreshingly real. No buffoons, no wacky
neighbors. Even the boss (Robert Guillaume) seems relatively
normal. The humor derives more from reality and less from rimshot
jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Krause and Josh Charles are the main players, portraying
co-anchors of an ESPN-style cable show called ``Sports Night.''
But, while the series is set in the workplace, it appears to be
more about relationships _ a nifty trick that most comedies never
master.

<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Wednesday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seven Days
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   This is not a misprint. ``Seven Days'' is a UPN show that looks
halfway decent. Maybe even three-quarters decent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the pilot was shot as a movie, which can be
misleading. Will the ensuing episodes have the same production
values, the same high-caliber feel? Impossible to know, but we can
hope, can't we?
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan LaPaglia (``New York Undercover'') plays Frank Parker,
a former high-maintenance CIA operative who's confined to a mental
hospital when he is recruited for a covert operation by an elite,
military intelligence unit. His mission: Go back in time to undo a
present-day calamity. His problem: The way-back machine hasn't
quite passed inspection, but since it can only send someone back a
maximum of seven days, there's no time for fine-tuning. Parker must
court disaster to prevent disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The machine works, but not without putting Parker through a
couple of rugged spin cycles. Still, the weirdest part of his job
isn't going back in time or trying to prevent the mayhem that has
already taken place, it's the consequence of his actions. For
example, let's say Parker puts the moves on the sexy Dr. Olga
Vukavitch (Justina Vail), which, it is safe to say, will probably
happen in every episode. After he goes back in time and changes the
course of events, the romantic overtures he made before entering
last week have been erased. So it's back to square one. Talk about
sexual tension! Every time the guy gets to first base, the game is
called on account of it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   As a time-travel drama that doesn't get gunked up in sci-fi
jargon, ``Seven Days'' could have broad appeal if it weren't up
against ``Dateline NBC,'' ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``The Nanny,''
``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ``Dawson's Creek.'' UPN's expectations
are never outrageously high, but it may have a hard time carving
out a share of Wednesday's typically splintered audience.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, LaPaglia's laconic Parker and Vail's smoldering
Vukavitch provide a bubbly romantic subtext to the main story. The
presence of estimable supporting players like Norman Lloyd and Nick
Searcy doesn't hurt, either. ``Seven Days'' is good escapist fare
with an eye for quality.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maggie Winters
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   Maggie Winters is not Corky Sherwood. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Maggie, like Corky of ``Murphy Brown'' fame,
left a small town to work in the big city. Never mind that Maggie's
marriage, like Corky's, didn't work out. Maggie is from the
Midwest, not the South. So there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, seeing Faith Ford as someone other than Corky is a tall
order. Maybe if we think of ``Maggie Winters'' as the small-screen
version of the movie ``Hope Floats,'' Ford will remind us of Sandra
Bullock and take our minds off Corky Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Now we can cope. But Maggie can't. Jobless and
divorced, she's back in Shelbyville, Ind., a shell of the girl
``Most Likely To Succeed,'' living with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   One has to assume Maggie won't wallow in self pity for 10
seasons. But if she doesn't snap out of it by Thanksgiving, she may
need a swift kick from Murphy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   _ To Have and To Hold
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Ally McBeal'' last season re-legitimized the
hourlong romantic comedy/drama. With ``To Have and To Hold,'' CBS
hopes to offer a comfortable transition from an hour of sitcoms
(``The Nanny,'' ``Maggie Winters'') to an hour of ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in Boston, ``To Have and To Hold'' is part of this season's
Irish invasion. Moira Kelly and Jason Beghe play public defender
Annie Cornell and police detective Sean McGrail, respectively.
They've known each other forever, are madly in love, and often end
up on different sides of a criminal case. When troubled, Annie
confides in her sister, who's married to Sean's firefighter
brother. Sean also has two other brothers, both cops, and a mother
(Fionnula Flanagan) who may be a few shingles short of a roof.
</P>
<P>
   Annie and Sean argue a lot, but don't be fooled. They're
inseparable. And occasionally insufferable. If there's a Celtic
word for schmaltz, it would fit nicely here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Charmed
</P>
<P>
   The WB
</P>
<P>
   As if this show didn't already have enough going on, what with
the reunion of producer Aaron Spelling and former ``90210'' star
Shannen Doherty, the pilot had to be reshot after Lori Rom abruptly
left the cast. In her place: one-time child star Alyssa Milano,
most recently of ``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Milano, Doherty and Holly Marie Combs (``Picket Fences'') play
the sisters Halliwell: free-spirited Phoebe, the youngest;
ambitious and driven Prue, the eldest, and earthy and creative
Piper, the one who usually acts as buffer between the other two.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting a grand old Victorian home in San Francisco,
the sisters learn that, by putting aside their differences and
working together, they can summon supernatural powers they never
knew they had. Naturally, these witchy women use their abilities
only for good, but they have to keep their talents a secret because
the neighbors might not understand.
</P>
<P>
   The original pilot was of C-plus to B-minus quality, and unless
Milano turns in the bravura performance of the century (or someone
punches up the script), the second pilot will be about the same.
Also, with ``Party of Five'' in the same time period going after
the identical audience demographic, the Halliwell sisters may have
to work overtime to charm their way to renewal.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Secret Lives of Men
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   Surprise! The secret lives of men do not revolve around beer,
nachos and the Victoria's Secret catalog. Guess that's just one of
those urban legends.
</P>
<P>
   The secret lives of men revolve around golf and Italian food. At
least in the cases of Phil, Michael and Andy.
</P>
<P>
   They play golf every week. It's their outlet, their means of
bonding over shared experiences. And when they're not on the
course, they're at their favorite trattoria, bonding over shared
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   This could get really old, but the first episode of ``The Secret
Lives of Men'' is reasonably amusing, thanks to some actors who
have been around the block and actually may have bonded over shared
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Whitford, Peter Gallagher and Mitch Rouse play guys who are
well north of their 20s and not entirely comfortable with their
singleness, possibly because the ex-wives got the kids, the houses
and the money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while their maturity as actors lends a reassuring depth,
it's hard to imagine ``Secret Lives'' as appointment television on
a weekly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Where'd that catalog go?

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON THURSDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Thursday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jesse
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Bundy has a brain!
</P>
<P>
   Oops, wrong show.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Warner has a brain, which is nice for Christina Applegate,
who played the witless Kelly Bundy on ``Married . . . With
Children'' for 11 seasons. In ``Jesse,'' Applegate plays a smart,
devoted, hard-working single mom who is so overwhelmed by
responsibility that she refuses to make time for herself.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pilot episode of ``Jesse'' has its amusing moments,
it offers nothing particularly special. And producers
Bright/Kauffman/Crane (``Friends,'' ``Veronica's Closet'') were
retooling the pilot and making cast changes to find the right
chemistry before foisting it on the masses. So, as they say in TV
land, stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vengeance Unlimited
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   Introducing the new venge-o-matic! He slices around the law, he
dices with danger, he doubles as judge and jury.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Mr. Chapel, but there's nothing sacred about his
occupation. He gets even when the justice system gets it wrong. If
a terrorist has murdered your family but goes free on a
technicality, Mr. Chapel is the go-to guy _ a wily trickster who'll
bring the miscreant to justice any way he sees fit. Only one catch:
It'll cost a million bucks, or you'll owe Mr. Chapel a favor down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to appeal to the baser human instincts, ``Vengeance
Unlimited'' is a perfectly cynical counterpoint to CBS's ``Promised
Land,'' one of its Thursday night competitors. Michael Madsen stars
as Mr. Chapel, a mysterious man who has apparently been hideously
wronged by the system. We don't know exactly why or how, but it's
clear that his capacity for retribution makes him one sick puppy.
</P>
<P>
   Lending a hand and making sure that Mr. Chapel doesn't wax too
wacko is paralegal KC Griffin (Kathleen York), a former beneficiary
of Chapel's services who works for the district attorney and has
access to helpful information on baddies who've gone free or
goodies who've been wrongly accused.
</P>
<P>
   She could wash her hands of Mr. Chapel after doing him one
favor, but there's something that keeps her coming back for another
sting operation. Maybe it's her thirst for justice, maybe it's his
English Leather.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the attraction, this isn't a show for children, even
though ABC is putting it on at 8 o'clock. And if you know of any
adults who end up liking ``Vengeance Unlimited,'' make sure you've
returned everything you borrowed from them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hollyweird
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   Fox announced in January that ``Hollyweird'' would be on its
fall schedule, but production was delayed so the producers could
revise the concept. And now comes word that Fox won't put it on the
air any earlier than midseason, and possibly not at all.
</P>
<P>
   That could be a bad sign. Or it could be a good sign. It
certainly is a sign that the first attempt to deliver a finished
product didn't work out so well. Fox decided to go back to the
drawing board and recast the show after reaction to the initial
concept was less than enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollyweird'' is described as a ``quirky noir/gothic show''
from Wes Craven and Shaun Cassidy about a trio of undercover cops
in Los Angeles, originally hand-picked by the LAPD for a
reality-based TV series. The police department scrapped plans for
the TV show, but kept the unit intact to probe the ``wild,
glamorous and often scary'' world of Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   While the fate of ``Hollyweird'' is debated, Fox is likely to
fill the Thursday night time slot with the summer series ``Guinness
World Records,'' another in its seemingly endless reservoir of
reality shows.

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Friday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two of a Kind
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   ABC stumbled last year with a couple of Friday night clunkers
named ``You Wish'' and ``Teen Angel.'' It rebounds this season with
two new replacements that more faithfully uphold the network's
youth-oriented TGIF tradition.
</P>
<P>
   One is ``Brother's Keeper,'' discussed elsewhere on this page.
The other is ``Two of a Kind,'' featuring the Olsen twins in their
first series since the demise of ``Full House'' three years ago.
This time, Ashley and Mary-Kate don't have to share a role. They
play the identical but not very similar twin daughters of a widowed
college professor who's struggling with single parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the season's more hackneyed themes, but ``Two of a
Kind'' manages a palatable treatment, particularly for ABC's
intended TGIF audience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Living in Captivity
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   Most of the sitcoms that roll off the assembly line each season
are painfully average. This appears to be one of them, despite the
auspices of Diane English and Joel Shukovsky, the husand-and-wife
team that created ``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   A hit series involves a fair amount of lucky casting, and
``Murphy Brown'' had it. ``Living in Captivity'' may end up having
a similar dream cast, but you wouldn't know it from the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Dondre T. Whitfield (``Between Brothers'') and Kira Arne play an
upwardly mobile African-American couple who have moved to a gated
community in the suburbs. Living next door is an ignoramus muffler
monger named Carmine Santucci (Lenny Venito), who is severely
overdrawn at the brain bank.
</P>
<P>
   To balance things out, another neighbor is Will Marek (Matthew
Letscher), a frustrated writer who is to political correctness what
Miss Manners is to behavioral etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in the first episode, the Cooks encounter racism in its
most blatant and most subtle forms, all to the accompaniment of a
laugh track. Eee-ew.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legacy
</P>
<P>
   UPN
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Bonanza'' and ``The Big Valley'' on UPN! But it's not
exactly a western. More like a southern.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Cullen plays Ned Logan, widowed head of a proud and
prominent family in post-Civil War Kentucky. Ned has four kids of
his own, but his heart is big, and he takes in a roguish
17-year-old orphan named Jeremy Bradford (Ron Melendez).
</P>
<P>
   Whenever trouble strikes _ and the Logans seem to court it _
Jeremy is implicated. But patriarch Ned stands by the kid in the
fine and honorable tradition of Ben Cartwright and Victoria
Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legacy'' is called ``Legacy'' because Ned Logan, a horse
breeder, firmly believes in the philosophy of his Irish forebears,
that is, to build a family through unconditional love and firm
support while providing opportunities to others who are less
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a noble legacy, but even within the Logan family it is a
source of controversy. At least it's predictable controversy. (And
they get the good old barn fire out of the way in the first
episode.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Buddy Faro
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Faro used to be king of the L.A. private eyes. Then he
disappeared in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, thanks to another private eye named Bob Jones,
who found Buddy wasting away in Margaritaville. Bob cleaned Buddy
up, put some gas in Buddy's old T-bird, and Buddy is once again Mr.
Smooth, albeit in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Buddy has Bob and Bob's lovely assistant, Julie
Barber, to keep his calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In the demo tape sent to critics, the story of Buddy's return
from exile moves more slowly than a latte line at Starbucks. CBS
says this will be ``fixed,'' so ``Budd Faro'' may yet be worth a
visit. But the original also tries to be hip and amusing, and
succeeds only part of the time, resulting in a lightweight drama
that has more style than substance.
</P>
<P>
   Once back in L.A., Dennis Farina's Buddy Faro is a swaggering
caricature, the sort of role Farina does well. Frank Whaley,
meanwhile, is unspectacular as the unspectacular Bob Jones, and
Allison Smith seems to get the standard window-dressing treatment
as Julie Barber.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trinity
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McNair Carnahan named his creation ``Trinity'' because
it was inspired by ``conflicting feelings about being Irish
American, about spirituality, and about connecting with family in
an increasingly fragmented world.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that answer helps explain the tediousness of the first
episode, which drags noticeably through the introduction of the
McCallister family: an Irish cliche to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   There's Bobby (Justin Louis), the cop; Liam (Sam Trammell), the
union leader tied to organized crime; Kevin (Tate Donovan), the
priest; Amanda (Bonnie Root), the substance abuser, and, just for
good measure, Fiona (Charlotte Ross), a successful stockbroker
who's having an affair with her married boss. There's also Clarissa
(Kim Raver), Bobby's wife, who seems very chummy with Liam.
</P>
<P>
   As if to recharge their souls, and despite some enormous
differences, the kids get together every Sunday for dinner at the
McCallister home. It's a touching idea, but the McCallisters are
going to have to pick up the pace to keep viewers from nodding off
before dessert.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brother's Keeper
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   The single-parent syndrome strikes again.
</P>
<P>
   In this permutation, a geeky, stick-in-the mud guy with a young,
impressionable son gets a wake-up call when his trouble-prone,
pro-football-playing brother moves in because his
million-dollar-a-year contract says he needs to live with a
responsible party.
</P>
<P>
   The twist here is that the requisite female character in the
show isn't a nanny. She's a sports agent who babysits the brother,
not the son.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of sitcomedy, this isn't the paragon of funny.
But Sean O'Bryan, as place-kicker Bobby Waide, the pain-in-the-neck
brother, makes the extra point to give ABC a chance for Friday
night victory.

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Saturday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wind on Water
</P>
<P>
   NBC
</P>
<P>
   According to experts, wind on water is one of the things that
helps make waves. But even with Bo Derek riding a horse in a white
bikini (Bo's in the bikini, not the horse), ``Wind on Water'' will
be lucky to cause a ripple this season.
</P>
<P>
   The luckiest person in ``Wind on Water'' may be Raymond J.
Barry, who dies in the first episode, leaving Derek to play a
feisty widow trying to keep the family's Hawaiian ranch from being
swallowed up by a slimy developer.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Derek's two sons are expert surfers and awesome
snowboarders who venture out on the extreme-sports circuit to earn
enough money to keep the ranch running.
</P>
<P>
   This makes for lush photography of the Big Island, but not much
else. With dull writing and duller acting, ``Wind on Water'' could
very well put the viewer into a tropical depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ Martial Law
</P>
<P>
   CBS
</P>
<P>
   The TV commercials for ``Martial Law,'' featuring Hong Kong
martial arts guru Sammo Hung, pretty much say it all. Hung plays
Sammo Law, a visiting cop from China who doesn't carry a gun, so he
has to get creative when bringing evildoers to justice. The
well-timed and vigorous opening of a door, for instance, is a good
way to knock the wind out of a miscreant's sails, as well as the
teeth out of his mouth. But even normal, everyday items can become
part of Law's arsenal: combs, credit cards, staplers. He's the
MacGyver of law enforcement, and proponents of gun control may be
hailing ``Martial Law'' as a breakthrough cop show.
</P>
<P>
   This is good, because the series probably won't win any other
awards. Though a complete pilot wasn't available for review,
``Martial Law'' obviously falls into the same category as ``Nash
Bridges,'' ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and ``Diagnosis Murder'':
simplistic, unimaginative entertainment for viewers not interested
in being challenged.
</P>
<P>
   While there certainly is room on mainstream TV for escapist
programming that doesn't engage too many brain cells, a little
twist of originality would be welcome. (See ``Fantasy Island,'' for
instance.) The demonstration tape of ``Martial Law'' seems to
follow the trite formula so closely that viewers should be able to
figure out the ending by the first commercial break. The only
unknown will be Sammo's weapon of choice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fantasy Island
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   This isn't your father's ``Fantasy Island.'' The new Mr. Roarke
(Malcolm McDowell) is a shade more mysterious, almost ominous, and
there's no Tattoo yelling, ``Ze plane! Ze plane!'' But there's a
new female assistant (Madchen Amick) who can take on the identity
of anyone she chooses, and there's Fyvush Finkel running one of the
eeriest travel agencies around.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sonnenfeld, the same guy responsible for ABC's summertime
hit, ``Maximum Bob,'' is adding his dark and humorous touch to this
remake. Though not nearly as quirky as ``Maximum Bob,'' it does
show signs of emerging from the large (but very average) cauldron
of typical Saturday escapist fare.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be in the writing, which didn't exactly crackle in
the demo tape provided critics. But it was better than average,
which is every critic's fantasy this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cupid
</P>
<P>
   ABC
</P>
<P>
   This may be one of the best new shows to be canceled before most
of the country even knows it existed. Or it could be the sleeper of
the new season.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 p.m. slot on Saturday is usually ABC's kiss of death, but
if anyone can reverse the hex, surely it's the Roman god of erotic
love. Shoot, if ABC had named this series for Cupid's Greek
counterpart, Eros, it might have solved its Saturday ratings
problem for good.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Jeremy Piven is brilliantly cast as a man who claims
to be the mischief-maker of myth. He says he has been sent to Earth
to relearn his craft and won't be allowed back among the gods until
he has made 100 lasting matches.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Cupid, a k a Trevor Hale, is institutionalized, and
he becomes the pet project of psychiatrist Claire Allen (Paula
Marshall). Dr. Allen doesn't believe for a moment that Hale is
Cupid, but he does seem to be having an effect on people's
heartstrings. Maybe even hers.
</P>
<P>
   Piven and Marshall are wonderful together, and ``Cupid'' is a
romantic comedy worth keeping.

WHAT'S NEW THIS FALL ON SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a look at the new TV shows on Sunday this fall. Check
local listings for times, channels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Holding the Baby
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   In England, it's rare for a television show to reach 50 or 100
episodes. The British concept of a ``series' is more akin to the
American ``limited series'' notion: a predetermined run _ say, 10
or 20 shows _ and then everyone says goodbye and is off to another
project.
</P>
<P>
   However, Granada Television, one of the biggest creators of TV
programming in England, obviously sees profit potential in the U.S
model. Its American cousin, Granada Entertainment USA, helped bring
an Americanized ``Cracker'' to U.S. TV last season. ``Cracker''
crumbled just shy of a full season, but Granada is undeterred. Its
second Americanization effort is ``Holding the Baby'' in
association with former ``Home Improvement'' producer Howard J.
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Morris would very much like to get to 100 episodes _ the
equivalent of almost five seasons _ but he has his work cut out for
him. Airing opposite the second half of ``60 Minutes,'' his new
show isn't likely to draw a big audience unless Mike Wallace does a
guest spot.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do tune in may be pleasantly surprised. Despite a
single-parenthood premise that has been massaged one way or another
since the beginning of TV, ``Holding the Baby'' has a charm that is
easygoing, unthreatening _ and decidedly un-Foxy. How it fits as a
lead-in to an edgier, more sarcastic show like ``The Simpsons''
isn't clear, but the producers and the actors can't worry about
that.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal derives from Jon Patrick Walker, as single dad Gordon
Stiles, and Jennifer Westfeldt, as grad student Kelly O'Malley.
O'Malley would like a job at the ad agency where Stiles works, but
the desperate Stiles, recently abandoned by his wife, sees greater
nanny potential in the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between this show and others that have plowed
similar ground is that the hassles of raising an infant aren't
usually the focus of an entire series. More like a few episodes. If
``Holding the Baby'' avoids the usual pitfalls of such ``baby
shows,'' the surest sign of its success may be when they change the
title to ``Holding the Toddler.''
</P>
<P>
   _ That '70s Show
</P>
<P>
   Fox
</P>
<P>
   If your only memory of 1976 is the Bicentennial celebration,
then ``That '70s Show'' is a pretty good refresher.
</P>
<P>
   It's also pretty amusing, which probably has the suits at Fox
breathing easier, since ``That '70s Show'' constitutes one half of
a very big gamble. The other half was the moving of ``King of the
Hill'' to Tuesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   A proven performer in the cushy slot between ``The Simpsons''
and ``The X-Files'' on Sunday, ``King of the Hill'' is being asked
to anchor what has been a difficult night for Fox. In its place,
viewers get not an animated comedy but a live-action show that
stirred up controversy even before its premiere.
</P>
<P>
   The show is an attempt to portray with some accuracy the
fashions, the attitudes and the tenor of the '70s through the
experiences of six teenagers. Its first episode showed some of them
sneaking a few brewskis down to the basement and later enjoying the
effects of wacky tabacky. The episode centered on the hallowed
ritual of a teen getting his own car, so the decision to do scenes
about intoxicating substances _ with no immediate repercussions _
was certainly questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the same treatment in an episode of ``The Simpsons''
or ``King of the Hill'' might not raise a peep of protest.
Regardless, the producers have promised to deal responsibly with
the tough coming-of-age issues.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy aside, ``That '70s Show'' stands out because of
spiffy, energetic writing and a well-cast group of young actors,
particularly Topher Grace and Laura Prepon as two kids who've been
friends since they were 4 but are discovering that they really, uh,
like each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Army Show
</P>
<P>
   The WB
</P>
<P>
   As the law of diminishing returns takes hold, network executives
are saying there just isn't enough writing talent out there to keep
up with the demand (by whom we're not sure) for TV comedies. The
result: Each season, the networks are forced to put on increasing
amounts of substandard fare because the alternative _ putting on
nothing at all in a particular time slot _ isn't a widely accepted
programming tactic.
</P>
<P>
   That explains the presence of ``The Army Show'' in The WB's fall
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army Show'' is a bad show. The only possible reason for
its existence is to perpetuate the tradition of midseason
replacements. It makes ``McHale's Navy'' look like Shakespeare,
which would make Capt. Binghamton the equivalent of Lear (the king,
not Norman).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps trying for its own bit of the Bard, ``The Army Show''
has a character named Caesar _ Pvt. John Caesar, a computer hacker
who's been sentenced to a four-year hitch in the Army instead of
jail time. John Sencio, who got his acting training at MTV, plays
Caesar too brutally to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Even more painful is watching the capable David Anthony Higgins,
who spent four seasons on ``Ellen,'' dealing with material that
would be sophomoric if only it hadn't flunked freshman comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The premise: Some goldbricks are enjoying the life of Riley at a
``forgotten'' military base named, appropriately enough, Fort
(William?) Bendix. The series borrows liberally from its TV
predecessors _ from ``Sergeant Bilko'' to ``Gomer Pyle, USMC'' to
``MASH'' _ but nothing in the pilot episode gives any evidence that
``The Army Show'' will ever be all that it can be. Desertion is
highly recommended.

THE MADMAN WITH A QUOTATION FOR EVERY WORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1879 when Professor James Murray began the challenging
assignment of editing the first edition of the Oxford English
Dictionary, a project of unprecedented historical and cultural
importance, the call went out for volunteers to supply quotations
to illustrate definitions.
</P>
<P>
   The most prolific and faithful correspondent, represented by
more than 10,000 entries, was Dr. William C. Minor, a surgeon
living in Crowthorne, Berkshire, in the English countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who had not yet met Minor, assumed that he was a
``practicing medical man of literary tastes with a good deal of
leisure.'' To his astonishment, Minor turned out to be a patient in
the Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The strange story of the interwoven lives of Murray and Minor is
the subject of Simon Winchester's new book, ``The Professor and the
Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity and the Making of the Oxford
English Dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1872, in a moment of insanity, Minor, an American and a
veteran of the Civil War, had killed a man in London and been
sentenced to Broadmoor. He remained there under guard for the next
37 years, until he was transferred to St. Elizabeth's Hospital for
the criminally insane in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Murray realized Minor's true situation, he still
regarded him as his most reliable source, a madman whose words were
very much to be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester artfully parallels the story of the two extraordinary
men, the eccentric professor and the murderer with a sharp
intellect. Minor's photograph appears on the jacket of the book;
with his long beard and gentle eyes, he somewhat resembles
portraits of Claude Monet. He also looks like Murray. The two are
twinned in appearance as well as in their dedication to codifying
the English language.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Winchester enriches his story with a selection of
intricate definitions and also offers a brief and cogent history of
dictionaries.
</P>
<P>
   Parenthetically, he ponders such matters as the fact that in
Shakespeare's time there were no English dictionaries. Therefore,
the playwright ``could not look things up,'' but he still knew the
meaning of esoteric words. How, he wonders, did Shakespeare know
what an elephant was?
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary (known as the OED), which
eventually took 70 years to complete, was to transform the
lexicographic landscape and to become, in Winchester's estimation,
a literary masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Professor and the Madman,'' recently published by
HarperCollins, is a kind of philological detective story. It is
already a best seller in England and has been sold to Mel Gibson's
company for a movie to be directed by Luc Besson.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the book has caught Winchester by surprise. For
almost 30 years, he has been a globe-trotting journalist, reporting
for several English newspapers while also writing a dozen books
inspired by his travels. His last was about the Yangtze River. In
common with the others, it received respectful reviews but had a
limited readership. One book sold only 11 copies.
</P>
<P>
   This time the runaway is the book, not the author, although old
habits die slowly. The day the book reached the top of the
best-seller list in England, Winchester was on an ice floe in
northern Canada (researching a book about the Arctic explorer
Adolphus Greeley). Soon after being interviewed in New York, he was
on the Manchurian-Siberian border for an article he was writing for
National Geographic.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to his research for other books, for ``The Professor
and the Madman'' Winchester stayed home _ in England and the United
States. (He now lives in Wassaic, N.Y.) Basically, it was a matter
of historical research, although in good reportorial fashion there
was a measure of investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester has always had an interest in words (and in doing
crosswords) but was first drawn to his subject by a mention of
Minor in ``Chasing the Sun,'' a book about lexicography by Jonathon
Green. Although Minor's role in the OED was known to others in the
profession, no one had yet been permitted to look at the files on
him at Broadmoor.
</P>
<P>
   After persuading officials at the asylum to cooperate,
Winchester asked his publisher, Henry Holt, for a six-month
postponement on his next book. He had planned to buy a small cargo
ship and sail around the world to write a history of tramp
steamers. The publisher insisted he fulfill his contract or pay
back his advance. When HarperCollins was taken with the idea of the
OED book, he paid his debt and unpacked his bags.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of several thousand pages in the Broadmoor files,
many of them written in Minor's own meticulous handwriting, he was
able to paint a full picture of the patient's daily life, and of
how, with the approval of the governor of the asylum, he surrounded
himself with books, turning his two cells into an extensive private
library. From these volumes, he extracted quotations for
definitions and mailed them to Murray at Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   As Winchester says in the book, ``Before long the gentle shower
of paper had turned into a raging blizzard, one that was to howl up
from Crowthorne unceasingly for almost all of the next 20 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trying to explain such productivity, Winchester said, ``Minor
concentrated very hard, and some synapse in his brain presumably
fired in such a way as to eliminate his symptoms of
schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   To all outward appearances, he remained a dignified, solitary
figure. He sought penance for his crime by apologizing to the widow
of the man he had killed, and he gave her and her children money.
She visited him at Broadmoor, at his request bringing books to add
to his collection.
</P>
<P>
   There is a suggestion in the book that they may have had an
affair. Winchester is unsure, although Minor was, he said, ``a man
of prodigious sexual energy: sex and words were the two most
important things in his life.'' He said that he had no doubt ``that
if a film gets made,'' the two will have had a romance.
</P>
<P>
   When Winchester tried to see the files at St. Elizabeth's, where
Minor was confined in his later years, he was rebuffed. But because
the hospital had once been a federal institution, he managed to get
access to the files on the Internet, one of several modern
resources he used. He has an edition of the OED, but found it
quicker to look up Minor's quotations on a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   His most valuable discovery was a descendant of Minor who had a
box of family papers in an attic in Connecticut. Among the papers
was a letter from Murray in which he told the true story of how he
found out that Minor was a madman. On a visit to England, the
librarian of Harvard College thanked Murray for being so kind to
``our poor Dr. Minor.'' ``Poor Dr. Minor?'' Murray said. ``What can
you possibly mean?''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the two met, he was well aware of Minor's past, and
that fact did not alter their relationship. Murray described him as
``a fine Christian gentleman, the same as myself.'' With the Minor
papers was also the photograph that appears on the jacket of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Murray was much easier to obtain. His story
has been well documented in a biography written by his
granddaughter, K.M. Elisabeth Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's house in Oxford is now owned by the anthropologist
Desmond Morris, who has placed a plaque in his garden saying that
this was site of the Scriptorium where the OED was edited. Murray
is Winchester's hero, an autodidact of great erudition and a
limitless facility for languages.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Winchester speaks no languages other than English,
depending on interpreters when he travels. He has been to both
poles (and prefers the Arctic because there are people there).
Asked if there are any places he has not visited, he named the
Hamptons in New York, and Peru, quickly adding that he had recently
been to see friends on Georgica Pond and could therefore strike one
from his list.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking like a newly retired explorer, he said: ``It's a
rootless life, being at home everywhere and at home nowhere. I
think the idea of settling down and writing books about strange
episodes in history, which somehow illuminate something rather
greater, would be a nice way to spend a life, if I can wean myself
from travel.''
</P>
<P>
   When Winchester finished his book, his American publisher wanted
to call it ``Mad for Words,'' a title that made him wince. ``It
sounds like a game show,'' he said. ``Now it's `Mad for Words,' and
our guest tonight is William C. Minor!'' In England, the book has
the title he favors, ``The Surgeon of Crowthorne.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after all the research, questions remain about Minor. Most
of all, Winchester wonders what drove him insane _ perhaps that
traumatic moment in the Civil War when he was ordered to brand a
deserter with a letter D on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The author said that one of the ironies of the story _ a kind of
Catch-22 _ is that Minor probably would not have had the time to
work on the OED had he not been confined in an institution. The
author added, ``And if this had been even 20 years later, he would
have been given the kind of drugs that would probably have sapped
his will to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Minor was released from St. Elizabeth's and was sent
to a hospital for the elderly insane in Hartford, Conn. He died in
obscurity in 1920. There were no obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   If there had been one, said Winchester, it should have begun,
``Dr. William C. Minor, murderer and lunatic, who redeemed himself
mightily by making one of the greatest of all contributions to the
English language ... .''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Samuel Sachs II, director of the Frick Collection,
may work at a Chippendale desk in a paneled room built more than
eight decades ago as the boudoir of Adelaide Childs Frick, but he
spends his days looking toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing across his computer screen is a picture of the Frick's
famous living hall with its 16th-century paintings, fine French
furniture, Renaissance bronzes and magnificent Persian carpet. With
the click of a mouse, he made the hall spin in every direction.
Nine months in the making, the museum's new Web site
(www.frick.org) offers the usual menu of practical information but
also includes a virtual-reality tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had hits from all over,'' Sachs said. ``Four-thousand
people in the first two days pulled up the Web site from countries
like Australia, New Zealand and Scandinavia.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Sachs, 62, left the financially troubled Detroit
Institute of Art, where he had been director for 12 years, to
become director of the Frick, replacing Charles Ryskamp, who
retired after a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, with judicious infusions of technology and a good deal
of patience, Sachs is trying to transform one of the most famously
old-fashioned institutions in Manhattan into one that is more
user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his ideas, like the Web site and a multilanguage digital
Acoustiguide, are coming to fruition. He knows that other ideas,
like expanding the institution's exhibition space, extending its
hours, opening a cafe and even relocating the entrance may be a bit
ambitious for what has long been viewed as a place where nothing
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Since it opened to the public in 1935, the limestone mansion at
1 E. 70th St. built for Henry Clay Frick, the Pittsburgh coal and
steel industrialist, quickly became one of the city's most popular
attractions among dedicated art lovers, with attendance of more
than 250,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The last gasp of America's Gilded Age in the heart of the Upper
East Side, the Frick offers an intimate look into what was once a
grand home. Its artwork and objects from the 14th to the 19th
centuries _ fine French furniture of the 18th century, bronzes,
Chinese porcelains and Limoges enamels _ are arranged as though the
Fricks still lived there.
</P>
<P>
   The walls are lined with Holbeins, Vermeers, Rembrandts,
Turners, Gainsboroughs and Van Dycks, and rooms are filled with
Bouchers and Fragonards. Europeans particularly identify with the
Frick because its setting is the U.S. equivalent of an Italian
palazzo, a French chateau or an English stately home.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs refers to his mission as one of ``fine-tuning'' rather
than making major changes. The trick, as he well knows, is to make
the museum more dynamic without ruining what people love about it.
</P>
<P>
   When Frick died in 1919, he left his home and art collection to
a board of trustees with instructions that they become a study
center for art and related subjects. The institution has a large
endowment for its size, more than $200 million, but little space to
mount temporary exhibitions. It also has a notoriously guarded
nine-member board, run by Henry Clay Frick II, Frick's grandson,
and several other family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do things very carefully,'' said Helen Clay Chase, the
oldest of Frick's 15 great-grandchildren. ``When I think of my
great-grandfather's legacy I know that he very much wanted to make
it accessible to the public, and we want it to be more welcoming.
But at the same time, we want to be sure that the serenity is not
disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   While many museums are courting the newly rich to become members
of expanded boards, the Frick has kept its board at its original
size, giving the impression that it is a private club. Some
supporters say privately that they fear any changes will ruin the
Frick's special character; others say the Frick needs to keep up
with the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extraordinary thing about the Frick is that it has always
changed, but all the while giving the illusion that it's the
same,'' said Everett Fahy, a former director of the Frick who is
now chairman of the department of European paintings at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``During my tenure, we added a new
wing, put in the garden on 70th Street and installed a state-of-art
security system.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many misconceptions about the Frick Collection, Sachs
said. ``The first is that we don't make acquisitions. We do. Many
people don't realize that about 30 percent of the collection has
been acquired since Frick's death. The second is that if we were
offered a painting, it would be turned away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another misconception is that the institution is unable to lend
any of the collection. Although it cannot lend the two-thirds that
belonged to Frick, as stipulated in his will, it does lend artworks
and objects acquired since his death.
</P>
<P>
   High on Sachs' agenda is to spread the word that the Frick is
not a members-only institution, and that despite its large
endowment, the institution still needs money to preserve the
building. (Fund-raising efforts are under way for replacement of
the copper roof and windows, which must be done this year, Sachs
said.)
</P>
<P>
   As all museums are doing, the Frick has reached out to a growing
group of younger supporters. ``There are lots of people who love
the Frick,'' Sachs said. ``But they don't think they'd be welcome
here. I want to make this a more welcoming place, not mess it up.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Already the front door has been made more welcoming. Until
recently, visitors were greeted by a dark entrance with only a
guard to direct them. There is now a well-lighted information desk
where people can pay their admission fee ($7 for adults and $5 for
students and the elderly) and pick up a free Art Phone, the latest
version of an Acoustiguide.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly revolutionary, Acoustiguides signal a huge leap
into modernity for the Frick. And this one is the latest
incarnation, a random-access digital guide with more than three
hours of recorded information. The guide looks like a high-tech
cellular telephone, and it discusses every room and the major
paintings, furniture and objects, without requiring visitors to
follow a prescribed tour. By October it will be available in
English, French, Spanish, Japanese and German.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since about 35 percent of the visitors are non-English
speaking, I thought it was important to offer several languages,''
said Mr. Sachs. ``If we find we need Russian, we'll add it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides its permanent collection, the Frick has always organized
small, well-focused temporary exhibitions, and Sachs has begun
aggressively working on broadening the kinds of shows it will
offer, adding some that have been popular in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Two on the schedule are ``Victorian Fairy Painting,'' a smaller
version of the show that was at the Royal Academy in London, which
opens on Oct. 14, and ``The Medieval Housebook,'' pages from an
illuminated manuscript that show life in a princely court at the
end of the Middle Ages. That show, from Germany, will open in the
United States at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in
November and at the Frick in May.
</P>
<P>
   Like all museum directors, Sachs wants to draw a larger
audience. But once he gets visitors into the museum, he would like
to keep them there longer, he said. One way is with a cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great gentleman's house, and if you come and visit,
you wouldn't be surprised if you were offered a small amenity,'' he
said. But the issue of how to give visitors a refreshment in a
manner befitting the setting is touchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are days when I think, yes, it would be nice to have a
place people could have tea or coffee,'' said Mrs. Chase. ``And
then there are other days when I think, do we need to hear the
clutter of dishes?''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes on Sachs' wish list include extending the Frick's
hours on Friday and Saturday evenings to coincide with the late
closings of other institutions along Fifth Avenue's Museum Mile. He
also says that entering the Frick through the 70th Street garden
would be more welcoming.
</P>
<P>
   More ambitious is his desire to expand the museum, building
temporary exhibition galleries under the Fifth Avenue garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rome wasn't built in a day,'' Sachs said when asked if it was
true that board members were aghast at the idea of an expansion.
``These things take time and money.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his progressive thinking, however, there is one rule _
particularly unpopular among parents of young children _ that isn't
about to change: Children under 10 are not allowed in the museum,
to protect the many pieces of fragile furniture and objects.
</P>
<P>
   The rule has been supported by state officials, Sachs said. ``I
don't think it's restrictive. I think it's reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   But ever mindful of a new generation of visitors, Sachs said he
would like to welcome children as soon as they are old enough to
enter: ``I'm thinking we should have a tea party for 10-year-olds,
as a rite of passage.''

COMPANIES LEARN POISON E-MAIL LETTERS HAVE A LONG LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When managers blunder at certain high-technology companies, they
are sure to read all about it _ not in the morning papers, but on
their companies' internal computer networks, from their own
subordinates, and often in language that would make a sailor blush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the managers say they welcome the uncensored, sometimes
vitriolic outpouring.
</P>
<P>
   More than a handful of high-technology companies permit, even
encourage, employees to vent frustrations, passions, hopes and
suggestions in internal company mailing lists and bulletin boards.
The topics range from rants against the cafeteria food or restroom
toilet paper to critiques of new products.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any universal rule on such mail lists, however, it
is that these cathartic exchanges are never to be shared with
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came to the fore last week when it became known that
Microsoft Corp. had subpoenaed the archives of two such e-mail
lists _ known as Bad Attitude and Really Bad Attitude _ from
Netscape Communications Corp. Microsoft officials said they hoped
that the archives would provide evidence for use in their defense
against the federal government's antitrust lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape officials declined to comment last week, saying their
lawyers were still studying the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Microsoft will find evidence _ or whether a federal
court will even permit access to Netscape's archives _ remains to
be seen. What is certain is that Netscape's ``Bad Attitude'' files
are typical of the level of candor that high-technology employees
often are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape adopted the ``Bad Attitude'' concept from Silicon
Graphics Inc., which has an internal e-mail list of the same name.
Apple Computer's employees, meanwhile, can post to a wide-ranging
discussion called Can We Talk, while the At-Home Network has the
Attitude, Cnet has Spam, and Starwave lets employees e-mail
anonymous suggestions and complaints to the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are so bright and creative,'' said Kandis Malefyt,
Netscape's senior vice president of human relations. ``The worst
thing you can do is snuff out their opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers and employees alike say the discussion groups serve two
key purposes. Foremost, they are a way to let employees vent
frustrations, or as one Bad Attitude veteran put it, ``for
catharsis and telling the truth without fear of reprisals.'' They
also enable executives to gauge the sentiments of the rank and file
_ and, if they choose, to mollify those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Netscape's Bad Attitude became so inflamed two
years ago when the company's chief executive, Jim Barksdale,
decreed that employees could not bring dogs to work that the
company decided to change its policy. The impact can be more
substantive, too: Earlier this year, Netscape changed an e-mail
feature of its Netcenter portal site after employees complained
about it on Bad Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, Cnet announced that employees would be allowed
to invite a date to the company holiday party. Days later, the
company rescinded the offer, saying that employees would have to
pay $45 to bring a guest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone went completely up in arms and started ranting about
it over Spam,'' said Jan Fleischer, managing editor of Cnet Game
Center, a site devoted to video game news and reviews. ``Finally
the executive staff stepped in and said: `We're taking this back.
Everyone please come and please bring a guest.'''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Wood, a spokeswoman for Cnet, said that the company paid
close attention to Spam, in part to take the company's pulse.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that any and all commentary is acceptable.
During the Christmas party incident at Cnet, one employee sent
repeated, angry e-mails not just to Spam but to another
company-wide message area. In response, the employee received a
not-so-subtle response from a manager: ``Looking for a promotion
any time soon? Don't hold your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges can indeed become strident. At Apple several years
ago, a former employee, Lori Kaplan, complained on Can We Talk that
the company should not say it has a multicultural environment and
then spend holiday money exclusively on Christmas decorations. Ms.
Kaplan said that the responses were so insulting that she asked the
company to intervene on her behalf, which she said it did.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing sentiments from a number of companies, Ms. Wood of Cnet
said the company expected employees to follow company guidelines
when participating in Spam. ``Harassment won't be tolerated,'' she
said. ``People are governed by the same policies as when they talk
face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, companies, their employees and intellectual property
lawyers say that Microsoft's subpoena has awakened them to a
potentially dangerous aspect of these e-mail exchanges: They can
stick around for a long time and may someday even wind up in court.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees say they will now exercise more caution, lest
what they write wind up in litigation. For its part, Netscape said
it would continue to allow employees to participate in Bad
Attitude.
</P>
<P>
   However, one notorious Netscape gadfly, Jamie Zawanksi, has
closed down ``Really Bad Attitude,'' a more elite internal mail
list at Netscape, whose participants had to prove they could flame
``so hard that bile flowed from eye sockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say that Zawanski is right to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're creating a pool of bad evidence,'' said John Steele, a
partner and intellectual property specialist with the Palo Alto,
Calif., law firm of Fenwick &AMP; West. Steele noted that while judges
increasingly have come to disregard casual, informal, even
sarcastic e-mail, juries continue to regard them as meaningful
evidence. Steele recommends that companies either restrict the type
of feedback permitted or erase the e-mail as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the Bad Attitude discussions at Netscape are
turned not inward, but outward at Microsoft, for potentially
destroying the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is going to pay some jackass lawyer $200 an hour to
find out that we hate our cafeteria food, don't like the security
posters, had a sucky news feed, and think `Navigator' was a cooler
name than `Communicator,''' one Netscape employee wrote in Bad
Attitude. ``And I smile.''

`THE GUN RUNNER'S DAUGHTER': THE TALE OF ESTHER AS MODERN-DAY
THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Neil Gordon's first novel, ``Sacrifice of Isaac,'' was an
international murder story that used the biblical story of Abraham
and Isaac as a kind of thematic refrain. His new book is ``The Gun
Runner's Daughter,'' and this time the biblical reference is to the
Book of Esther, in which the Jewish people were saved from
annihilation by the secretly Jewish wife of the Persian king. The
Esther in this more modern guise is a sexy and savvy
Israeli-American woman named Allison, Alley to her friends. By
cleverly manipulating the legal system, and by sleeping with the
enemy, she saves at least some Jews from a cynical, politically
motivated federal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Transforming biblical parables into modern-day thrillers is a
creative approach to the problem that writers face in these
post-Cold War days: the absence of convincingly dangerous
international evildoers. The Bible as inspiration is not the only
thing that is creative about ``The Gun Runner's Daughter'': Gordon
has devised a complicated plot bursting with skulduggery and
finishing off with a satisfying surprise. But the very
imaginativeness of the plot makes one wonder why he falls back on
so many hackneyed and melodramatic devices in the telling of his
tale that he robs himself of his own originality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Gun Runner's Daughter'' is in this sense a promising yarn
that fails to rise above the level of the standard, and rather
tired, thriller conventions. The most standard of Gordon's standard
devices is a style of inflated portent that is presumably aimed at
giving the story an exceptional air, making it suspenseful and
raising the emotional stakes for the dramatis personae.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the innocent wake unafraid,'' Gordon's narrator intones
in the first chapter, creating a sentence that is not only well
within the ``It was a dark and stormy night'' tradition of
melodramatic writing but is also simply wrong. Plenty of guilty
people wake unworried, while the innocent come to consciousness
terrified.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains lots of those single-sentence, or nonsentence
paragraphs that seem almost mandatory in standard thriller writing.
This device is supposed to impart a narrational terseness to the
story, but it has been so overused by now that it is about as
original as a sport-utility vehicle for city driving.
</P>
<P>
   Other passages are overwrought and vague at the same time:
``Then, not for the first time, but stronger than ever before, a
sense of disbelief swept over him, sudden amazement at the swift,
absolute fatality of what had happened.'' Or, ``And then, with an
interior sense of factitiousness that was only too familiar, she
leaned toward him and raised her voice through the mounting volume
of the band.''
</P>
<P>
   When the characters are not experiencing absolute fatality or
familiar factitiousness (whatever that is), they are using a lot of
the more common four-letter vulgarisms, so frequently in fact that
the dialogue, rather than seeming natural and informal, takes on
the forced quality of people trying too hard to be natural and
informal. And then there is Gordon's handling of emotion, usually
by means of some exaggerated physiognomic effect. The condition of
the main characters' stomachs is referred to often enough in this
novel to turn them into characters themselves. ``Real frustration
was in Dee's stomach now.'' Somewhat later: ``Alley's stomach was
plummeting now.'' And then: ``A strange lightness was in Dee's
stomach now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon tells a good story, especially if you can suspend
disbelief enough to accept the basic premise. This is that Alley's
father, Ronald Rosenthal, an Israeli-American arms dealer, has been
arrested on charges of breaking the U.N. embargo against selling
arms to the Bosnian Muslims. One just wonders why he uses a kind of
borrowed style to tell what would otherwise have been a far more
tingling and saucy adventure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prosecution is taking place even though the Clinton
administration wants arms to be smuggled to the Bosnian Muslims
who, after all, faced genocide during the civil war in the former
Yugoslavia. But the infinite cynicism of international politics, as
depicted by Gordon, leads the administration to throw the book at
Rosenthal in order to give credibility to its false assurance to
the British and the French that it is respecting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The chief prosecutor in the case is a well-born, ambitious young
man named Dee Dennis who happens to have had a sexual encounter
with Alley 10 years earlier when both were teen-agers summering on
Martha's Vineyard. The romance is resumed as trial preparation
takes place, so Alley is actually sleeping with her father's
prosecutor, and this causes a conflict-of-interest problem. Also in
the picture is a radical investigative journalist, Nicky Dymitryck,
who is striving to get the goods on an arms-dealing associate of
Rosenthal's named Eastbrook, who is running for the Senate in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Into this morass of conflicting interests and hypocritical
maneuverings, Alley devises a plot to turn the case against her
father around. Her complicated steps, which are based on her
knowledge of her father's hidden files, are intricately plotted and
plausibly based on court procedure and the law. Alley turns out to
be a master manipulator and a superb amoralist as well as a sexy
one, and, as her scheme unfolds, Gordon's story picks up
considerably in both momentum and quality, despite the occasional
slip into portentous cliche: ``While in Allison Rosenthal's
stomach, deep in her stomach, joy was born,'' Gordon writes at one
crucial point in the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Alley's manipulations include using the services of some bearded
Orthodox Jewish gunmen, arranging for her own arrest on charges of
embezzlement, and cleverly manipulating Dee in the evidence that he
introduces against her father during the trial. Gordon clearly
knows how to create a good yarn. The plot here is well-constructed,
very clever, so much so that you don't figure out what Allison is
up to until the end.

FOR MEN OF A CERTAIN AGE, THREE ROLES TO SAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One set. Three characters. At least nine lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's the scorecard for Yasmina Reza's hit play ``Art,'' which
last week embarked upon its second Broadway cast, as its seventh
cast in the West End of London continued performances. In an era in
which few straight plays on either side of the Atlantic survive
cast changes, ``Art,'' which in June won the Tony Award for best
play, has become something more than a small theatrical industry.
It has turned into a blessed employment opportunity for a growing
group of not-so-young male actors in the hunt for ever more elusive
substantive roles.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cox, Henry Goodman and David Haig are now ensconced on
Broadway, replacing New York's initial ensemble of Alan Alda,
Victor Garber and Alfred Molina. Two of the British newcomers to
New York will be changing roles in a play in which they already
appeared in London.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alda, Garber and Molina will open in Los Angeles in
January. Another cast will take on a 44-week national tour that
will probably start in San Francisco a year from now. Albert
Finney, Tom Courtenay and David Dukes have all taken their turns in
London.
</P>
<P>
   And in the spring, it looks likely that New York will play host
to an all-``Frasier'' company during the seasonal hiatus of the NBC
series. John Mahoney, Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce are in
negotiations to take on the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of prime beef on the hoof,'' said George Wendt,
the 49-year-old American television star of ``Cheers,'' who is now
playing the role of Yvan in London. ``There's no shortage of
middle-aged actors, that's for sure, with 20 to 30 years
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Yasmina Reza, the play's 39-year-old playwright, said
the ideal age of actors for ``Art'' is around 50. (The comedy is
about a longtime three-way friendship bruised, perhaps irrevocably,
by a dispute over an all-white painting.) ``If they are too young,
they have no history, and so the breakup of a friendship doesn't
mean so much,'' she said in a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Actors with a history seem to appreciate aspects of the work
that might prove frustrating to younger men. ``The play allows the
actors involved, if they take the offer, to work in a different
way, which is not necessarily about impressing with your skills,
but about sharing a common humanity,'' said Goodman, Broadway's
current Serge, who comes to this trio having played Marc in the
third West End cast. ``Without being sentimental about it, there's
an ensemble opportunity in the play.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the absence of an obvious starring role can sometimes be
problematic for a play's success, the equal division of the spoils
seems to have worked to the advantage of ``Art.'' Though the
apparent philistine Marc has attracted the bigger names (Alda on
Broadway, Finney in the West End premiere), the emotionally beset
middleman Yvan is the one who tends to generate awards. Both
Broadway's Molina and Ken Stott in London were nominated for best
actor prizes. (The character's breathless monologue halfway
through, as close as a nonmusical these days gets to a showstopper,
doesn't hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the dermatologist, Serge, who is the character who
buys the contentious painting. The role has attracted the likes of
Courtenay and Garber. It is now being played in London by Dukes,
remembered on Broadway for his work in shows like ``Bent'' and ``M.
Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, more than fine ensemble opportunities account for the
platform the play allows its actors. In the pragmatic world of the
theater, no trophy confers the success of cash in the bank, and
here, too, ``Art'' tells an estimable tale.
</P>
<P>
   The original West End production recouped its investment in a
swift seven weeks. On Broadway, where the production cost $1.5
million, or triple the London version, the show had paid for itself
within nine weeks and has so far made around $2 million, said David
Pugh, who with actor Sean Connery, produced the play in London.
(They were joined by Joan Cullman on Broadway.) Internationally,
the play has had 125 productions in 30 languages.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first West End cast finished its six-month run, the
producers have furthered the cause of the middle-aged actor by
signing the successive London companies to 13-week contracts. (The
current New York company has signed on for 16 weeks.) Sometimes,
said Matthew Warchus, the director of the play in both cities, one
of the three roles is not even cast a week before rehearsals, which
makes for a certain tension as well as a useful flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   The short tours have allowed Goodman and other actors to return
to the play again, often in different roles. Haig, New York's
current Yvan, was London's second Marc, while Roger Allam, London's
third Serge, was the production's fifth Marc.
</P>
<P>
   The requirements of the play allow for casting ideas, such as
the ``Frasier'' one, that have set Pugh, for one, to thinking. He
talks hopefully of Tony Shalhoub doing the play with his ``Big
Night'' collaborators Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott, and reports
that he is now spending a lot more time in video stores mulling
casting combinations.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Reza, whose play ``The Unexpected Man'' is
expected off-Broadway this winter, is open to any possibility _
black and Hispanic companies, for example _ as long as the actors
are of a certain age and male. ``These are really men's words,''
she said. ``I don't want any women to play it.''

NEW VENTURE FOR CSPAN: ALL BOOKS, ALL WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>

 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expanding beyond its deadpan gavel-to-gavel coverage of
Congress, C-Span is poised to bring similar unfiltered
page-to-binding treatment of the publishing industry with the start
on Saturday of Book TV, a regular weekend lit-a-thon of programs
devoted to just books.
</P>
<P>
   Make that nonfiction titles, said Brian Lamb, chief executive of
Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network and the longtime host and
low-key interrogator for C-Span's ``Book-notes'' program, who
allows that he has not read any fiction since Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire
of the Vanities,'' which was published 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for information; that's the underlying reason
for the program,'' Lamb said last week while on a swing through New
York to film interviews of executives at several top trade
publishing houses. ``Richness of language _ we don't make judgments
about that. What we're about is transmitting information. It's hard
for us to display beautiful language.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a nonprofit public affairs network _
subsidized by the cable industry _ although some of the books
featured on the programs seem to obliterate the line between fact
and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Mouse, Senate Mouse,'' for example, is a children's
storybook that describes the intense legislative effort to
designate a national cheese, which passes under the scrutiny of the
squeaker of the House and President Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The book's authors, Peter Barnes, the CNBC broadcaster, and his
wife, Cheryl Shaw Barnes, will be interviewed by a 9-year-old guest
host, Sherryl Grant, whose day job is fourth-grade pupil at Robert
Brent Elementary School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to appeal to a younger age group,'' said Lamb,
who says that C-Span will be able to experiment with such
programming because it does not measure success by viewer ratings.
In fact, it doesn't measure them at all.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span does reach 73 million households on its primary channel
and 50.4 million on its sister channel, C-Span2, which will be
showing the book programming.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, which accepts no contributions, is spending more than
$1.1 million to start Book TV with eight employees who will create
programming to run from 8 a.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Monday. The
schedule is still evolving, but it will include programs exploring
the business of publishing along with interviews of authors, panel
discussions, bookstore tours and literary events like book signings
and regional festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may never have a way to judge if it is a success other than
if we get feedback from teachers who are telling us that they're
using it,'' Lamb said of the project. So instead, he judges success
by the customer in a New York cafe who gives him a thumbs-up sign.
Or he measures his impact by the sales of his collection of
interviews with authors, which is now in its seventh printing with
35,000 copies in print.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lamb, a native of Lafayette, Ind., wears a dark jacket and an
understated print tie. He likes to cast himself as an average
reader with no intellectual pretensions and a curiosity for
substantive information (although in his youth he was the host of a
Lafayette television show that would now seem a little frivolous by
C-Span standards: ``Dance Date'').
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for interviewing authors, he said, he marks up and
reads at least 75 percent of each book featured on the show. And on
the basis of this expansive reading list, he makes one of his few
judgments: Many books, he said, are too long.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, which started its ``Book-notes'' interview programs in
the late 1980s, has long had a habit of zigging in different
directions from the book coverage of commercial networks. As Lamb
notes with some pride, C-Span maintained the sanctity of an O.J.
Simpson-literature-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Book TV format, Lamb said, there will be no interviews
with authors debating the latest twists of the JonBenet Ramsey
case. Instead, the programs' producers will be seeking authors of
perennial backlist books, which may have been published 10 years
earlier, or ``non-best-selling authors'' who sell in modest numbers
_ 5,000 copies or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why we're doing Book TV is that I've
learned that you've got to be different,'' Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said Book TV's cameras would soon start tracking
neighborhood reading clubs, quirky independent stores and personal
home libraries. Last week, a film crew was wandering the Great Hall
of the Library of Congress. And of course Book TV will continue to
feature authors who are willing to open themselves up to Lamb's
calm, relentlessly neutral questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to create an environment that's not frantic,''
Lamb said. ``It's not meant to be confrontational. It's meant to be
substantive, conversational.''

   MENLO PARK, Calif. _ When people on Wall Street think these days
about the entrepreneur Jim Clark _ founder of Silicon Graphics in
1982 and co-founder of Netscape Communications in 1994 _ their
thoughts most likely involve his third start-up, Healtheon Corp.
That is because Healtheon, an online service for the health-care
industry, is planning a widely anticipated public offering in late
September.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark, chairman of Healtheon and a major investor in it,
seems nearly as intent on a separate autumn launching, set for
mid-November. That is when the 155-foot sailboat Hyperion, a highly
computerized vessel that Clark began planning in 1995, is to start
its maiden voyage from a port in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to the
Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working harder on this project than I have any time
since the beginning of Netscape,'' Clark, a 54-year-old,
6-foot-4-inch lanky blond, said in a recent interview in a modest
office here in a dissonant setting: above a Jenny Craig Weight Loss
Center, enveloped in the fast-food aromas of a nearby Arby's
roast-beef restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Though work on the Hyperion has involved long hours lately and
frequent trips to the Netherlands by chartered jet, Clark shows no
signs of travel fatigue as he speaks excitedly about the yacht,
which outside experts estimate is costing him $30 million to build.
(He declined to discuss such matters.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an RV _ a luxurious RV,'' Clark said. ``A self-contained,
extremely sophisticated vehicle made for a harsh environment. And
it has the most complex nonindustrial automation system that's ever
been built.''
</P>
<P>
   If this last superlative sounds like a sales pitch, someday it
just might be. More than the expensive hobby of a man with an
estimated net worth of $600 million, the Hyperion has begotten yet
another Clark start-up _ Seascape Communications, a venture in
which he and three former Silicon Graphics engineers have been
developing the technological guts of the sailboat. Someday, Clark
said, some of their work may find its way into marketable products.
</P>
<P>
   Because no commercial system existed for the completely
computerized operating and navigational system that Clark had
envisioned for Hyperion, he decided to create his own. ``I had a
particular idea in mind,'' Clark said. ``I wrote 20 percent of the
Hyperion's software code. I built an underlying set of tools, and
the engineers used that as a nucleus.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an aluminum-hulled vessel housing 20 powerful
Silicon Graphics computers, 37 miles of network cables and 500
billion bytes of storage for an electronic log that will
automatically record everything that happens with the ship, from
changing the oil to hoisting sails totaling 13,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is shooting over the horizon and our objective is to meet
him on the horizon,'' said Jan Bokxem, who as technical project
manager is overseeing the installation of the ship's computer
systems at the 114-year-old Royal Huisman Shipyard in the
Netherlands. ``The industry isn't ready yet for some of what he's
requesting. Everything on Hyperion needs to be controlled and
interfaced to computers.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship's data and control systems are automated on a central
server computer, where all monitoring data is formatted and entered
into a database that becomes part of the ship's memory.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is for this database to help teach the ship, its
captain and crew to sail better, using past experience to determine
optimal sail settings for specific wind conditions, for example.
(Not that Clark is expecting Hyperion's captain, Alan Prior, who
has been a crew member in the America's Cup and Whitbread races, to
require much tutoring.)
</P>
<P>
   Each of the touch-screen computer terminals throughout Hyperion
will offer passengers amenities like activating towel heaters in
bathrooms, selecting wine from the cellar, or choosing a CD from
the 700-plus titles in a music library with selections from
Beethoven to U2.
</P>
<P>
   But most noteworthy may be Hyperion's bridge _ the control deck,
which on most yachts is where the various gauges and monitoring
instruments are arrayed. On many modern ships, these devices tend
to be a hodgepodge of systems from various vendors, with readouts
that are difficult to consolidate to provide a single look at
overall operations.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hyperion's streamlined bridge has six
20-inch-diagonal computer screens displaying virtual instruments
designed to look like conventional ones and using software that can
automate all of these monitoring functions and integrate them into
a single operational system.
</P>
<P>
   This approach makes it possible for the captain on the bridge,
the owner from a remote location and the crew members from various
positions on the ship to have access to the information and to give
commands _ assuming they have personal-identification numbers that
authorize them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Hyperion's system is sophisticated and complex,
it's simple in terms of what the user sees,'' Clark said.
``Simplicity is the cornerstone of everything technical.''

<P>
   Clark has been an avid sailor since one of his Silicon Graphics
colleagues introduced him to the sport in 1986. In 1996, he helped
raise money for the San Francisco-based St. Francis Yacht Club's
backing of America One, a hopeful for the America's Cup challenge
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing is an enthusiasm shared by other members of the Silicon
Valley technocracy, including Tom Perkins and John Doerr, partners
in the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, and
Larry Ellison, chairman of the database software giant Oracle. In
June, Ellison's 78-foot maxi-racer, the Sayonara, won the ILC Maxi
World Championship, beating Morning Glory, a yacht owned by Hasso
Plattner, co-founder and chief executive of Oracle's rival SAP AG.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the Valley's other yachtsmen have been as personally
involved in creating their sailing vessels as Clark.
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration for Hyperion came in the summer of 1995, as
Netscape's phenomenally successful initial public offering was
making headlines, when Clark happened to see a ship called Juliet,
built by the Royal Huisman Shipyard, whose exquisite craftsmanship
caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Clark hired the ship designer German Frers to do Hyperion, with
another highly regarded designer, Pieter Beeldsnijder, to do the
interior styling. ``The craftsmanship is impeccable,'' Clark said.
Because of his schedule, Clark does not plan to be on board when
Hyperion leaves Amsterdam on its maiden voyage, though he may join
it when it stops in the Canary Islands en route to St. Barthelemy.
</P>
<P>
   Though the later itinerary is still to be arranged, eventually
the ship is to reach San Francisco, where the Hyperion's 194-foot
carbon-fiber mast _ the world's tallest, the Huisman shipbuilders
say _ will clear the Golden Gate Bridge by a mere 30 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clark does not intend to be aboard Hyperion for its
entire voyage, he will not need to be. Through a satellite link,
the ship is designed to enable him to monitor operations.
</P>
<P>
   He would even be able _ although he says he never intends to
usurp his crew by doing so _ to remotely take Hyperion's helm via
computer terminal from his Seascape office in Menlo Park, his
part-time residence in Atherton, Calif., his permanent home in Palm
Beach, Fla., or virtually anywhere else in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 2000, Clark plans to be aboard to sail the ship to
Auckland, New Zealand, to watch the America's Cup race. And when
might he plan to formally launch Seascape as his fourth company?
</P>
<P>
   Between preparing for Healtheon's initial public offering and
Hyperion's first voyage, Clark said he had scant free time to chart
the start-up's future. He does plan to keep Seascape's engineers
employed for at least a year after Hyperion sets sail, initially to
debug the system and then to explore the potential for
commercializing the software.
</P>
<P>
   He said he doubted that Seascape would pursue the obvious niche
for Hyperion's system, the yachting industry, because he sees the
market as too narrow. More likely, he said, the software would be
marketed to complex environments like petroleum-processing plants,
where many sophisticated operations must be monitored over a wide
area.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that is virtually certain for Clark, who
calls himself a ``half-entrepreneur, half-venture capitalist,'' is
that something more than a fancy sailboat lies over the horizon.
``I don't like spending this much time and energy on just a
hobby,'' he said.

WHEN THINGS KEPT SILENT ARE FINALLY SAID ALOUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing is more lethal than family quarrels. Not only do they
breed fury, grief and unforgiving righteousness, as anyone who has
studied history or drama knows (Where do we begin? Euripides,
Shakespeare, Lope de Vega?), family quarrels breed or mirror
national and international ones. And artists _ who, if they are
worth anything, tell all without flinching or fawning _ are often
accused of betraying the family's, the race's or the nation's
honor; telling secrets that render them less than implacably noble
in their triumph or suffering.
</P>
<P>
   This gets especially murky when the artist belongs to a group
that has been the butt of some of history's meanest tricks: mauled
by countries, ideologies, by a race or a sex with greater power;
debased here, despised there; exiled or exterminated; pleading or
fighting for its cause; craving sympathy, power and respect.
</P>
<P>
   The case that stirred me recently is that of ``Revoltillo''
(``Broken Eggs''), a play by the Cuban-American playwright and
filmmaker Eduardo Machado. Gilberto Zaldivar's New York-based
company, Repertorio Espanol, is taking the play to Cuba later this
month. Since this is their first visit, and cultural exchanges
between the two countries have been rare, there is controversy
among some Cuban-Americans here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The usual bomb threats,'' a reporter said wearily. But plenty
of verbal protests, too, and the nature of these was depressingly
familiar to me, as an African-American and a woman. ``Broken Eggs''
is anti-American and anti-Cuban-American, go the complaints. There
is homosexuality and divorce. The family is unhappy and neurotic.
</P>
<P>
   I know and like Eduardo Machado. I got to know him because I
admired his work. But artists I have never met and whose work I
don't necessarily like are attacked for the same reasons: told
wrongly and naively that they must embody the virtues, but only the
virtues, of their people.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because their people's political and social status is
constantly being challenged or attacked. So the group voice
declares, ``They have always thought we're ignorant, pathologically
damaged by what we've gone through.'' Or: ``This is true, but it's
shameful. They have no right to judge.'' Or: ``They'll never
understand, and they'll use it against us.''
</P>
<P>
   What I saw in ``Broken Eggs'' was a stage filled with
complicated people who cannot simplify the memories or consequences
of their past in Cuba and their present in America. Nor can they
pretend, for more than a few minutes at a time, that there aren't
complications when people linked by blood and upbringing are
divided by temperament, age, belief, love that stifles or love that
doesn't suffice. I defy anyone who has ever belonged to a family, a
people or a nation to say otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The talk in the play ricochets from the private to the
political. Manuela, the grandmother, despises Castro and only
Castro. Her daughter's generation recalls the excitement of
Batista's overthrow _ remember how sexy we thought Fidel was, says
one character _ and still resents the restrictions of its
upbringing (the father with a string of whores who wanted a pure
wife and daughter; the mother who prepared her daughter for
marriage but taught her that the only man really worth loving was
her father).
</P>
<P>
   The third generation grew up in America. Here, a son can be
openly homosexual, one daughter can marry a man who is not Cuban,
and the other can describe her role in the family with the
detachment of a clinical psychologist. ``When you're born the third
child,'' Mimi observes, ``the marriage is already half apart, and
being born into a family that's half over, half apart is a
disturbing thing to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Then her mother, Sonia, must try to explain: ``We had just
gotten to the U.S. ... We lived behind a hamburger stand between
two furniture stores, away from everything we knew, afraid of
everything around us. We were alone, no one spoke Spanish. Half of
the people thought we were Communist, the other half traitors to
the cause; 3,000 miles away from our real lives.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a rich play, with an undertow of sorrow and rushes of anger
and humor. The director, Rene Buch, modulates the emotional chord
changes beautifully. The cast, led by Miriam Colon Valle, is a
first-rate ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The night I saw ``Broken Eggs,'' the mostly Latino audience
laughed, whooped and clapped, clearly exhilarated the way you are
when things that have been kept silent or said only in private are
said aloud.
</P>
<P>
   Artists get trapped between the anxieties of their group and the
constrictions of the outside world. It is common for Latino, black,
Asian, gay and female writers (what a gloomy roll call in this
context) to be told by some of their own that they should not wash
dirty linen in public and that they should follow a certain
esthetic. It is just as common for them to be told by certain North
American whites what that public wants from them and what esthetic
they should, therefore, follow.
</P>
<P>
   Writers get trapped in these patterns of mistrust and abuse. But
it is better to be accused of disloyalty by one's so-called family
than to be truly disloyal and tell lies that simplify history and
imagination. (By these lights it seems only fitting that Machado's
just-completed film is called ``Exiles in New York.'')
</P>
<P>
   People complain that identity politics and political correctness
encourage us to believe that the only work that speaks to us is
work by and about people like us. And it is easy to feel, quite
arrogantly, that we have settler's claims on certain material.
</P>
<P>
   Put a diverse audience in a theater to see a play set in a
particular ethnic, racial or sexual world, and it's clear that the
audience members closest to that world feel that outsiders have no
right to invade it with their responses. (I've been on both sides
of this one: given and received those contemptuous or belligerent
stares.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem didn't begin here, though. It began with the
homogeneity that passed so long for universality in the arts. Only
in the last 30-something years have audiences been given more than
the most occasional chance to see themselves and the world through
people and circumstances once thought hopelessly alien. And a brief
survey of theater repertories around the country shows that plays
that are non-white and to a great extent non-Protestant are still
not a significant part of theater fare.
</P>
<P>
   I have been reading a fair amount of literature about and from
Latin America recently: assorted poems and essays; Wendy Gimbel's
``Havana Dreams,'' about three generations of ambitious, thwarted
Cuban women; and Eduardo Galeano's ``Memories of Fire,'' a
three-volume collage-chronicle of Latin American history from the
15th century to modern times.
</P>
<P>
   We need to know as much as we can about one another, we exiles,
immigrants and citizens. Read these words by the Chilean poet
Vicente Huidobro, from the Borzoi Anthology of Latin American
Literature:
</P>
<P>
   Let poetry be like a key
</P>
<P>
   That opens a thousand doors.
</P>
<P>
   A leaf falls, something flies overhead;
</P>
<P>
   Let as much as the eyes see be created,
</P>
<P>
   And the soul of the listener tremble.

   Minor Victory for Intuit in Suit on Year 2000 Woes
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, the maker of the financial software Quicken, has won the
opening round in a lawsuit that tests how active software companies
must be in avoiding problems their customers might suffer as a

</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of the lawsuit was mainly based on the reasoning
that no demonstrable damages had yet occurred because the program
had failed as a result of the Year 2000 problem. Intuit said it
expected to offer free upgrades of its older software to avoid Year
2000 problems.

REPORTER-EDITOR CLASH TAKES NEW TWIST: LIBEL SUIT AGAINST PAPER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Little has been certain here in recent years as
the city's population and employment base dwindled. Still, people
could usually count on two things: that The Philadelphia Inquirer
was investigating a major local institution and that James E.
Beasley Sr., a malpractice lawyer, was suing a major local
institution _ often The Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   In two epic libel battles, Beasley won $40 million in jury
verdicts against the newspaper, although one of the judgments, for
$6 million, has been sent back for a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an Antichrist as far as The Inquirer is concerned,''
Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the reaction in The Inquirer's newsroom recently when
Ralph Cipriano, a reporter, filed a libel suit against the paper
after the editor, Robert Rosenthal, publicly questioned the
objectivity and value of his reporting on the Archdiocese of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer? Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, accustomed to libel suits from outsiders,
Cipriano's in-house action was heresy. But Cipriano, who filed his
suit on Aug. 7, said that Rosenthal's public criticism _ the editor
was quoted in The Washington Post as saying that the reporter ``has
a very strong personal point of view and an agenda'' and ``There
were things that Ralph wrote that we didn't think were truthful'' _
had given him no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have literally destroyed his professional status as a
responsible reporter,'' Beasley said in an interview here, ``to
satisfy the intemperate outburst of a frustrated editor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what hit the newspaper's staff harder: that
the editors' disputes about coverage with a combative colleague had
escalated to public insults and a libel suit or that the colleague
had made common cause with a lawyer who, in the words of the media
editor, Beth Gillin, ``is very much despised'' in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks that have followed, tensions have escalated
further. Late last month, Cipriano, 44, was dismissed after he
refused to give editors his notes related to reporting on the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had turned to the newspaper's longtime antagonist
for aid, Cipriano said he wanted the best possible representation.
``The only thing I did was file a lawsuit to exercise my
constitutional rights,'' he said. ``How was I going to function as
a reporter after Bob Rosenthal said that about me?''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Philadelphia see a logic in the continued clashes
between Beasley, the senior partner in a firm that uses
www.tortlaw.com as its World Wide Web address, and the newspaper,
which has won 18 Pulitzer Prizes in 23 years, many for documenting
abuse or mismanagement in mental hospitals, the city police
department, state courts and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindset of a plaintiff's personal injury attorney is that
your life's endeavor is righting wrongs,'' said Frederick L. Voigt,
the executive director of the Committee of 70, a Philadelphia civic
group. ``There's a great commonality with journalists in terms of
mentality,'' he added. ``Both are on a mission. And sometimes those
missions are going to come into conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The words ``mission'' and ``conflict'' tend to crop up in
conversations about Cipriano as well _ though usually along with
the words ``good writer.'' Cipriano spent 11 years at The Inquirer,
covering the New Jersey suburbs, writing features and obituaries
and, last November, an article disclosing the eligibility problems
of a University of Pennsylvania football player _ disclosures that
led the school to forfeit the five games the team won in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he clashed often with Inquirer colleagues,
according to both Cipriano and some editors. When he arrived, he
objected to smoking in suburban bureaus. He argued about diversity
training sessions in the early 1990s. Cipriano _ who is of Italian
and Lebanese descent and says ``when I look in the mirror, I see
olive skin'' _ objected to being pigeonholed as a white male.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong sense of right and wrong,'' he said. ``I have
had it since I was a little kid. I know what's right and what's
wrong, and I stick to my principles. I have a tenacious character,
and I don't give up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   These were not qualities that endeared him to the hierarchy of
the Archdiocese of Philadelphia when Cipriano covered religion in
1992 and 1993. Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua was coping with the
thinning out of congregations that resulted from the city's
dwindling population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This archdiocese was looking for consolidation,'' recalled
Arlene Notoro Morgan, who is The Inquirer's assistant managing
editor for readership. ``And every time a church goes down, a part
of somebody's past goes with it, and they mourn it and get upset
about it. Some of those people found their way to Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano covered protests and Bevilacqua's spending decisions.
The public relations consultant to the archdiocese, Brian Tierney
of the Tierney Group, started raising objections to Inquirer
editors. In an interview last month, Tierney confirmed, ``We did
repeatedly say that we would not cooperate in any story in which
Ralph is the lead reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Cipriano's editors folded his reporting about the
church closings and simultaneous spending on accouterments for a
conference center into a longer profile that Cipriano was preparing
on Bevilacqua. He protested that decision, contending that the
reports should stand on their own. And when there were delays in
running the profile, Cipriano said, ``I stopped writing anything,
for maybe a month,'' to press his editors into running the critical
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the profile was published in February 1993, Cipriano
agreed to switch beats and began covering the neighborhoods of
south Philadelphia. None of his editors will speak on the record
about his work in the years that followed, but their attitudes can
be inferred from details offered by Cipriano. By 1997, he said, his
editors told him he was unreachable too often and required him to
carry a cellular phone and to write more articles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There had been many changes at the newspaper over those four
years. Maxwell King, the editor who had succeeded Eugene Roberts in
1990, was himself preparing to step down. There were disparaging
comments around the city that The Inquirer was not the paper it had
been when Roberts' staff won 17 Pulitzers in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had done some great stuff. but they really got soft,''
said Howard Altman, the news editor of The City Paper, an
alternative weekly. ``There was a move toward not offending
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Cipriano's contention in his suit that The Inquirer
``did not wish to offend the archdiocese'' and risk losing readers
among the area's 1.4 million Catholics that particularly makes the
newspaper's editors bristle.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor William Ward said, ``I'm offended at the
accusation'' that the paper's staff was solely motivated ``by a
desire to raise circulation, or is caving to outside influences,
when I know these people have not done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, who has been on vacation, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the editor of The Inquirer's Sunday magazine, Avery
Rome, assigned Cipriano to write another profile of Bevilacqua. In
a sequence that in Cipriano's account was an eerie echo of the 1993
battles, he discovered what he described as damaging information
about the cardinal that his editors were reluctant to print.
Infuriated by their objections and sure he was being unfairly
singled out for punitive treatment, he sought help from union
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gillin, who is also a shop steward for Local 10 of the
Newspaper Guild, corroborated Cipriano's account of a two-page
warning about his work habits and productivity that a city desk
editor gave to him. Several editors said they would not comment on
personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, by the spring of this year, convinced the best of
his work would not make it into The Inquirer, Cipriano wrote a
10,000-word article on Bevilacqua for The National Catholic
Reporter, a weekly newspaper based in Kansas City, Mo. Among other
things, the article said the cardinal had authorized spending $5
million on renovations for three office buildings, his house, his
vacation home and improvements to a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Frank Lewis, a reporter for The City Paper,
wrote an article detailing Cipriano's battles with clerics and
editors. Cipriano was quoted as referring to the cardinal as ``a
Pharisee.''
</P>
<P>
   When Howard Kurtz, the media critic for The Washington Post,
asked Rosenthal about Cipriano's contention that, for The Inquirer,
the cardinal was ``a sacred cow,'' the editor responded with his
criticisms of Cipriano's work.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Gillen, ``People think that it was a stupid
thing'' for Rosenthal to have publicly criticized his reporter. ``I
agree,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano, she said, called her at home the day The Post
published Rosenthal's remarks and asked, ``Can the union file a
libel suit?''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano said that it was a union lawyer who encouraged him to
file the suit, which also names the paper's parents, Knight Ridder
and its Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. unit, as defendants. But it
was Cipriano who selected Beasley, the paper's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Both in the suit and in an interview, Beasley echoed Cipriano's
contention that the newspaper's fear of declining circulation _ now
433,489 on weekdays and 871,659 on Sundays, down from 545,000 daily
in 1983 and 1.01 million on Sundays in 1985 _ made it reluctant to
take on the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony not lost on the newspaper's current and former
editors that Beasley, who won libel judgments for a lawyer and a
judge whom he argued were tarred by aggressive reporting done to
bolster circulation, is now arguing that The Inquirer has gone soft
to raise circulation. They are reluctant to comment on the record
about the lawyer, however.
</P>
<P>
   But the deputy foreign editor, Marc Kaufman, expressed the
feelings of several colleagues in commenting on Cipriano's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the newsroom feel kind of awful for everyone
involved,'' he said. ``Ralph was generally liked, however much
people might have thought that he had kind of tunnel vision on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   People also liked Rosenthal, Kaufman said, ``and feel the paper
is getting ready to take another major step up, not down. Everybody
feels a little let down that they weren't able to work it out.
Everyone feels a little knocked around.''

TECHNOLOGY START-UPS SUFFER MARKET JITTERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Mass., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a month of hot and heavy flirting about a prospective
merger, last Monday was going to be the day that CKS Group and
USWeb finally got serious and set the price. Then the stock market
started falling, dragging with it the already-depressed shares of
both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just froze,'' Mark Kvamme, the chief executive of CKS,
an interactive advertising agency, said in describing how the $340
million deal with USWeb, an Internet programming and services
company, came to a standstill. ``We just stayed in our offices
watching the market on our computers. We just hit return, return,
return'' to get up-to-the-second quotes on how far each company's
stock had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, their screens showed that CKS stock was
down 18 percent while USWeb had dropped 16 percent. That was close
enough that the two companies were able to proceed with their deal,
which was announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the way things were playing out in the offices of
start-ups throughout the high-flying technology industry, which had
been watching a slide in market value for weeks before Monday's
plunge. After that day of frozen panic, by the end of the week,
much of the business was cautiously proceeding as before.
</P>
<P>
   Sure the Nasdaq market, where most technology company stocks are
traded, closed Friday down 22 percent from its high on July 20, but
it is still essentially flat for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for many technology executives, the jumpy movement of the
market within a narrow range last week created the sort of nervous
anticipation felt on a plateau in one of those darkness-enclosed
roller coasters: you know the next move will be sudden and fast;
you just do not know whether it will be up or down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real effect on the mood here yet,'' said Garrett
Gruener, a venture capitalist with Alta Partners in San Francisco.
``But if the Nasdaq were to drop another 20 percent, that wouldn't
be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   If the market fell further and looked as if it was not going to
bounce back, the voluminous investments by venture capitalists and
public stock investors in small technology companies would slow,
bankers and investors say. And the existing companies would have to
scramble for cash.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there is still a lot of money poised to be invested
in promising new start-up companies involved in information
technology and the Internet. Less certain, however, is how many of
the two- and three-year-old companies now lined up to sell stock to
the public will be able to do so in a suddenly skittish market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not pain or panic here in the Valley,'' said David
Cowan, a venture capitalist with Bessemer Venture Partners in Palo
Alto, Calif. ``But there is concern. A stalled stock market will
create billionaires at a lower frequency.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more than a few longtime technology financiers see the
fall in technology stocks from outer orbit to mid-stratosphere as a
sign of some rationality in the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I lost a lot of money, but I think it's very
healthy,'' said Richard Burnes Jr., a partner in Charles River
Ventures, an old-line venture capital firm in Waltham, Mass.
``Stock prices had taken on a life of their own, and that is very
dangerous for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnes said he was worried about the billions of dollars that
have poured into venture capital funds. Over the last few years,
the soaring market for technology stocks has allowed many of these
funds to post returns of 50 to 100 percent a year as they take the
young companies in their portfolios public or sell them at equally
high prices to bigger technology companies. Now, anyone who can tap
out a business plan in Powerpoint has come to expect ready cash and
lucrative terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs come into our office who don't have $1 million
in revenue and they expect to value their companies at 30, 40, 50
million dollars,'' said Fred Wilson, a partner at Flatiron
Partners, a New York venture capital fund. ``That's absurd. You
can't make money investing in companies like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Flatiron, he said, has stopped making investments and has
encouraged the companies it owns to raise cash as a cushion in case
of a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Other funds say they are still investing, only more cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at things differently than I did two weeks ago,''
said Geoffrey Yang, a partner with Institutional Venture Partners
in Menlo Park, Calif. ``We will still invest, but the prices we pay
could come down 20 to 25 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   And the mad rush may have slowed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deals that would have been done in a week are now taking six
to eight week to get done,'' Yang said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other observers say all this talk of discipline will be
quickly set aside as the venture capitalists realize they need to
put to work the billions of dollars they have raised for their new
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much capital out there that the supply will drive
up the prices of deals,'' Cowan said. ``That means the return of
the funds will ultimately go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the venture capitalists write their first checks to the
budding entrepreneurs, their minds almost immediately turn to the
``exit strategy.'' That is, how they can sell the company at a
tenfold multiple, either to the public or to another company. In
tougher times those multiples may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   For now, deals of all sorts have slowed until the state of the
market becomes more clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``A record number of public offerings have been pulled in the
last month or two,'' said Alex Lynch, the co-head of the public
offerings practice at Brobeck Phleger &AMP; Harrison, a law firm that
specializes in high-technology firms.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best indicators of the strength of the market will be
the fate of the public offerings planned for the next few months.
These include E-Bay, a rapidly growing Web site that lets people
run their own auctions, and the Globe, a New York-based chat
service aimed at Generation-X.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these companies are not going to be able to proceed with
their public offerings, they will still be able to raise money from
venture capitalists and other private investors.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies that had already gone public issued more stock
over the summer, taking advantage of the surging market to build a
cash reserve to ride out a period of tight money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We completed a secondary offering two months ago, adding $22
million to the $47 million we already had in the bank,'' said Jason
Olim, the chief executive of CD Now, an online music store. ``Our
burn rate is probably $10 million a quarter,'' he said, referring
to the deficit spending common at start-up companies. ``So we have
a stockpile of cash that will last us longer than a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as stock prices fall, some midsized technology
companies may find themselves in a position to buy other companies
whose stocks have been hit even harder than their own.
</P>
<P>
   Some entrepreneurs say that a perhaps less visible consequence
of the careening market for technology stocks is the toll it takes
on employees with the perhaps enviable problem of coping with the
sudden appearance and disappearance of paper wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get concerned about the morale of people in the company if
everyone is looking at the stock price all day,'' said Christos
Cotsakos, the chairman of the E-Trade Group, an online stock
brokerage firm. ``When your stock price rockets up like a meteor,
it creates false expectations. Then when the price gets hammered,
it drives people crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in recent years, every dip in the market has been followed
shortly by another surge. And many longtime executives worry that
too many newcomers to technology companies have never seen a truly
down market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's scary to me is a lot of kids are coming here
who think that their options are automatically going to go up by 40
percent a year,'' Kvamme of CKS said. ``It's terrible when people
start to believe they are invincible.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to many young entrepreneurs, it seems perfectly clear that
the Internet, is, in fact, changing everything, and that they can
ride this wave to prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see only progress, only growth,'' said Olim, the 29-year-old
founder of CD Now. ``Value is being created at such a dramatic pace
that it overwhelms any macro-economic phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Kvamme, a 34-year-old alumnus of Apple Computer who has seen a
few of Silicon Valley's earlier surges and dips, says that things
are a lot more vulnerable now than they might seem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a feel-good business,'' he said last week. ``Any time
there is uncertainty, it erodes confidence. Then decisions take
longer; people stop spending. And once they stop spending, things
only get worse.''

AKIRA KUROSAWA, RENOWNED JAPANESE FILMMAKER, DIES AT 88
</HEADLINE>
   (See also OBIT-KUROSAWA-SHORT and KUROSAWA-FILMOGRAPHY) 
(jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Akira Kurosawa, who personified Japanese movies to most of the
world and who grew into one of the handful of truly important
directors that the cinema has produced, died Sunday at his home in
Tokyo. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa, the son of a military institute's athletic instructor,
stumbled into filmmaking after failing as a painter and became one
of the colossal figures in film history _ an autocratic
perfectionist with a painter's eye for composition, a dancer's
sense of movement and a humanist's quiet sensibility. Dozens of
directors spanning two generations have acknowledged his enduring
influence on their work.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurosawa's ``Rashomon'' reached Western audiences in 1951,
little was known outside Japan about the country's cinema. That
changed overnight with ``Rashomon,'' a compelling study of
ambiguity and deception that provides four contradictory accounts
of a medieval rape and murder recalled by a bandit, a noblewoman,
the ghost of her slain husband and a woodcutter. The characters,
Kurosawa said, have a ``sinful need for flattering falsehood'' and
``cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better
people than they really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's calculated blend of Japanese folklore with Western
acting styles and story-telling techniques provided a link between
the two worlds, reintroducing Japanese culture to a postwar global
audience and leading to an amazingly fertile decade that saw the
director produce several films that have widely been acclaimed as
among the finest ever made, including ``The Seven Samurai,''
``Ikiru'' and ``Yojimbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose all of my films have a common theme,'' Kurosawa once
told Japanese film scholar Donald Richie. ``If I think about it,
though, the only theme I can think of is really a question: Why
can't people be happier together?''
</P>
<P>
   Tall, large-boned and soft-fleshed, Kurosawa mixed a
workingman's thick, powerful hands with the face of a professor _
sometimes a very stern professor. He was known by colleagues, not
always affectionately, as ``the emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's ecumenical interests in Western literature, Japanese
folktales and American westerns led him to source material as
diverse as Gorky's ``The Lower Depths,'' Shakespeare's ``Macbeth''
and Ed McBain's ``High and Low.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a master of both of the most popular Japanese film genres
of his era, the jidai-geko (a costumed action film involving
medieval samurai) and the gendai-geki (a more realistic, often
domestic drama rooted in contemporary Japanese life).
</P>
<P>
   In her introduction to ``Voices from the Japanese Cinema''
(1975), Joan Mellen wrote: ``It is possible to draw a line from
Kurosawa's finest film, `Seven Samurai,' which Donald Richie has
called the greatest Japanese film ever made, back to Daisuke Ito's
`Man-Slashing, Horse-Piercing Sword' in 1930. But if Ito created
the genre of jidai-geki, Kurosawa perfected the form and gave it so
deep a historical resonance that each of his jidai-geki has
contained within it the entire progress of Japan from feudal to
modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa chafed when Japanese critics described his work as too
Western. ``I collect old Japanese lacquerware as well as antique
French and Dutch glassware,'' he said. ``In short, the Western and
the Japanese live side-by-side in my mind naturally, without the
least bit of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories of his perfectionism are plentiful. He once halted
production to reconstruct a hugely expensive medieval set because
he noticed a nail head was barely visible in one shot. For the
climax of ``Throne of Blood,'' his 1957 samurai version of
``Macbeth,'' he insisted that his star, Toshiro Mifune, wear a
protective vest and perform the scene while being shot with real
arrows.
</P>
<P>
   On the set, where he rarely brooked dissent, Kurosawa developed
his own technique for filmmaking that allowed him to edit each
day's scenes that night and be finished with a rough draft of the
film within hours of shooting the final scene.
</P>
<P>
   He would rehearse all of the scenes meticulously, sometimes for
weeks, then shoot them from beginning to end, using three cameras
positioned at strategic points. ``I put the A camera in the most
orthodox positions, use the B camera for quick, decisive shots and
the C camera as a kind of guerrilla unit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite different from the way scenes are normally made,
beginning with a ``master shot'' that is then augmented with
close-ups and reverse-angle shots that are pieced together into a
final version. Kurosawa wanted his scenes to be a record of a
single performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The editing stage is really, for me, a breeze,'' he said.
``Every day, I edit the rushes together, so that by the time I am
finished shooting, what is called the initial assembly is already
completed. It's not all that bad. I just stay for maybe an hour or
an hour-and-a-half after everyone has left. That's all it takes
me.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was quite strict with his technical crew, Kurosawa was
more patient with actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really strange,'' said Shiro Miroya, one of Kurosawa's
assistant directors. ``Kurosawa, who can be a real demon at times,
when he'll scream out, `The rain isn't falling like I want it to,'
or `That damn wind isn't blowing the dust right,' is always so
terribly gentle with actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa described his approach this way: ``Unless you can see,
as an actor, what the director is trying to express simply by how
he looks and acts himself, you are going to miss the finer points.
When my cast and I are on location, we always eat together, sleep
in the same rooms, are constantly talking together. As you might
say, here is where I direct.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach paid off with an intense loyalty. Kyoko Kagawa, who
starred in ``The Lower Depths'' (1957) and the contemporary
thriller ``The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960), told an interviewer: ``It
is only when I work with the Kurosawa group that I feel fulfilled
as an actress _ and coupled with that is the feeling of relief that
I know when I see that Kurosawa is satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest loyalty was between Kurosawa and Toshiro
Mifune, his most famous star. Kurosawa made 17 films between 1948
and 1965, and all but one of them starred Mifune. But the director
and his top star had a falling out following the making of 1965's
``Red Beard,'' partly because of Mifune's desire to mount his own
productions and partly due to his annoyance over what he saw as
Kurosawa's growing perfectionism. They never worked together again;
Mifune died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though internationally renowned, Kurosawa was not much of a
globe-trotter. He spent most of his time, when not working, at the
home that he shared with his wife, Yoko Yaguchi, a former actress,
who died in 1984. They had one son, Hisao, and one daughter,
Kuzuko, both of whom survive him.
</P>
<P>
   His global fame was not always matched by popularity at home,
and Japanese audiences seemed to tire of his costume epics.
Financial reversals following the release of ``Dodeskaden'' in 1970
combined with a persistent and painful ailment (later diagnosed as
gallstones) led him to attempt suicide in 1971. Though he
recovered, he seemed changed. After having made 22 films between
1946 and 1965, he made only five in the 28 years following
``Dodeskaden,'' although two of them _ the historical epics
``Kagemusha'' (1980) and ``Ran'' (1985) are considered among his
finest works.
</P>
<P>
   His final films, ``Rhapsody in August'' (1990) and ``Madadayo''
(1993) were poorly received and struck many as containing a new,
strident note of Japanese nationalism. In ``Rhapsody in August,''
for instance, an American travels to Japan to ask forgiveness for
the dropping of the atomic bomb; no acknowledgment is made of
Japanese atrocities or complicity in the war. Kurosawa seemed
puzzled when the film stirred an uproar at Cannes.
</P>
<P>
   But his influence on American filmmakers continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Kurosawa's ``The Seven Samurai'' was remade by director
John Sturges as ``The Magnificent Seven.'' In 1964, ``Rashomon''
was remade by Martin Ritt as ``The Outrage.'' In 1964, ``Yojimbo''
was remade by Sergio Leone as ``A Fistful of Dollars,'' then remade
again in 1996 by Walter Hill as ``Last Man Standing.''
</P>
<P>
   And George Lucas has acknowledged ``The Hidden Fortress,'' a
1968 adventure by Kurosawa in which a princess is escorted to
freedom with the help of two bickering peasants, as one of the
inspirations for his ``Star Wars'' series, in which he replaced the
peasants with two bickering robots.
</P>
<P>
   Akira Kurosawa was born in Tokyo on March 23, 1910. His father
was a former military officer who had become an athletic instructor
at the Imperial Army's Toyama Academy. His mother had come from a
well-to-do Osaka merchant family. ``My mother was a very gentle
woman,'' Kurosawa said, ``But my father was quite severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's father was also a movie fan with a passion for other
Western pastimes. He organized one of the first baseball teams in
Japan and built the country's first athletic swimming pool at the
Toyama Academy.
</P>
<P>
   The Kurosawa family had once been in the feudal nobility,
tracing its lineage to a legendary 11th century samurai, Abe
Sadato. But the family had been living in Tokyo for four
generations by the time Akira was born, and no longer had wealth or
status.
</P>
<P>
   Akira was the youngest of eight children; he had four sisters
and three brothers. In the book he wrote about the first decades of
his life, ``Something Like an Autobiography,'' he remembered
himself as shy and frail, ``a crybaby and a real little operator.''
He also suffered from periodic seizures caused by a form of
epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   This contrasts with the memories of childhood friends
interviewed by Richie, Audie Bock and other biographers, who
remembered him as a confident and charming young man who made
friends easily.
</P>
<P>
   While Kurosawa was in his second year of primary school, the
family moved to Edogawa, on the easternmost edge of the city, and
he entered the Kuroda School where a charismatic teacher inspired
an interest in painting. Kurosawa's father encouraged this, but the
family often did not have enough money to buy art supplies. Later,
Akira moved on to a more militaristic middle school, and began to
gravitate toward an older brother, Heigo, who shared his interest
in art. Heigo, who was four years older than Akira, did not get
along with their father and no longer lived at home.
</P>
<P>
   Without his father's knowledge, Akira spent much of his time
with Heigo during his teen-age years. Heigo was very interested in
a traditional form of storytelling known as kodan, which featured
tales of samurai and often involved intricate, stylized swordplay.
Akira made his own sword out of bamboo and began to practice with
friends, stalking the schoolyard and staging mock samurai battles.
</P>
<P>
   But what Akira remembered most about those years was going to
the movies with his brother, who had taken a job as a benshi, or
silent-film narrator. ``We would go to the movies, particularly
silent movies, and then discuss them all day,'' Kurosawa later
wrote. ``I began to love to read books, especially Dostoyevsky, and
I can remember when we went to see Abel Gance's `La Roue' and it
was the first film that really influenced me and made me think of
wanting to become a filmmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   When sound came to films, Heigo lost his livelihood. Shortly
thereafter, with what at the time seemed to Akira to be no warning,
Heigo went on a trip to the mountains outside Tokyo and killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I clearly remember the day before he committed suicide,''
Kurosawa wrote. ``He had taken me to a movie in the Yamate district
and afterward said that that was all for today, that I should go
home. We parted at Shin Okubo station. He started up the stairs and
I had started to walk off, then he stopped and called me back. He
looked at me, looked into my eyes, and then we parted. I know now
what he must have been feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Akira enrolled in the Doshusha School of Western Painting in
1927 and tried to supplement the family's income with his work, but
was never able to make much money. Finally, he postponed his hopes
of becoming a serious artist and took piecework for magazines and
cookbook publishers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, still desperate for cash, he noticed a small
advertisement for Tokyo's PCL Studios, which later became Toho Film
Production Co. It was looking for a half-dozen young men interested
in becoming apprentice assistant directors.
</P>
<P>
   All applicants _ there were 500 of them _ were asked to present
themselves for an interview and to bring along an essay they had
written on ``The Basic Defects of the Japanese Film Industry.''
Armed with his own essay, a 26-year-old Kurosawa found himself
facing Kajiro Yamamoto, then the most prominent film director in
Japan. Yamamoto later remembered the young Kurosawa as extremely
intelligent and refreshingly honest. He recommended that Kurosawa
be hired and, shortly afterward, took the young man under his wing.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa worked as Yamamoto's assistant for seven years.
Finally, in 1943, he was given the chance to direct his first film,
``Sanshiro Sugata,'' a slick judo adventure aimed at the popular
market. It was a box-office smash in wartime Tokyo. Kurosawa
followed it with ``The Most Beautiful,'' a blending of documentary
and dramatic scenes about Japanese women working in factories, and
``Sanshiro Sugata, Part II,'' another huge hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the war, I hungered for the beautiful,'' Kurosawa said.
``I therefore drowned myself in the world of Japanese traditional
beauty. I perhaps wanted to flee from reality, but through these
experiences I learned and absorbed more than I could ever
express.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Kurosawa found traditional, stylized storytelling
too confining and hungered for realism and the kind of filmmaking
he saw in the works of Roberto Rossellini and Vittorio De Sica.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Kurosawa directed ``No Regrets for My Youth,'' about
persecutions in postwar Tokyo by elements in the Japanese right
wing. ``It was the first film in which I had something to say and
in which my feelings were used,'' Kurosawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he made ``Drunken Angel,'' a crusading drama
about an alcoholic doctor in the Tokyo slums. The film made his
critical reputation in Japan. In 1950, Kurosawa released
``Rashomon'' in Tokyo. The Japanese critics thought it a
commendable though not exemplary work, nowhere near the director's
best. Nevertheless, the film won the Venice Film Festival's grand
prize and later an Academy Award as best foreign-language movie.
Its international success made Kurosawa Japan's most famous and
popular filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Japanese people, who had lost the war as well as their
pride, this meant immeasurable encouragement and hope,'' Kurosawa
said.
</P>
<P>
   His next film, a strange adaptation of ``The Idiot'' by
Dostoyevsky, was poorly received. But he followed it up, in 1952,
with ``Ikiru,'' which some consider his finest work. ``Ikiru,''
which means ``to live,'' is entirely unlike the later samurai epics
that would cement his international reputation. Set in contemporary
Tokyo, it follows a joyless, dying bureaucrat, memorably played by
Takashi Shimura, who decides to help slum parents build a
playground. The film was immediately recognized as a great work,
both in Japan and abroad. But it was soon overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, the Allied occupation forces rescinded the restrictions
on the making of films and the freedom stirred an amazing burst of
creativity. In that one year alone, Yasujiro Ozu made ``The Tokyo
Story.'' Kenji Mizoguchi made ``Ugetsu,'' Kon Ichikawa made ``Mr.
Pu,'' and Akira Kurosawa made ``The Seven Samurai.'' It was the
high water mark of Japanese filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's four-hour epic, often referred to as among the
greatest action films ever made, tells the story of
down-on-their-luck samurai who agree to defend a small village from
bandits. What Kurosawa did in ``The Seven Samurai'' is often
compared with what John Ford did in ``Stagecoach'' - take an
otherwise formulaic genre and inject it with vivid imagery and
complex characters. Specifically, he took the same kind of
characters he had been featuring in his neo-realist films and put
them into a jidai-geki.
</P>
<P>
   Following the commercial disappointment of 1965's ``Red Beard,''
Kurosawa found it harder to find funding. 20th Century Fox hired
him to direct the Japanese sequences in ``Tora! Tora! Tora!,'' its
1970 epic about Pearl Harbor, but he left the production shortly
after shooting began.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa was said to have thrown tantrums on the set and
demanded levels of perfection that caused a mutiny among the crew.
His supporters said that Kurosawa was angry when he discovered that
the American sequences would be filmed by Richard Fleischer, not
David Lean, as he had been told, and that he had staged the
tantrums to force Fox to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever the case, it further undermined his flagging
reputation. In response, Kurosawa became more withdrawn, at times
traveling around Tokyo with a retinue of bodyguards, like a Yakuza
kingpin.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had a major international success in 1974 with ``Dersu
Uzala,'' a Soviet production about the friendship between a Russian
explorer and a Manchurian hunter, he remained elusive and
incommunicative. It won the 1975 Academy Award for best
foreign-language film.
</P>
<P>
   Even in 1980, at the premiere of ``Kagemusha'' at the New York
Film Festival, Kurosawa struck many as cold and distant, even
hostile. To some, he seemed to shrug off the film, saying he would
rather have made ``Ran,'' an epic version of ``King Lear.'' But the
success of ``Kagemusha'' made ``Ran'' possible.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to the New York Film Festival in 1985 _ with
``Ran'' _ he seemed a changed man: friendlier, more relaxed, even
granting a handful of interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little mysterious, even to me,'' Kurosawa said during
one of those interviews. ``As my son frequently says to me now,
`Dad, you have changed completely. You are a much more relaxed,
open person than you were.' I am not sure why this is. It is simply
a greater degree of relaxation and peace with myself, not having
the tension that I had before.''
</P>
<P>
   Even his sets had become happier places.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Canby, writing in The New York Times, described ``Ran''
as ``almost a religious experience _ an epiphany'' that ``stands
above all other 1985-1986 movies with the implacable presence of a
force of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent films, ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams'' in 1990, which
harked back to his early years as a painter, ``Rhapsody in August''
and ``Madadayo'' never reached the critical or popular success of
``Ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he often diverted the conversation when asked about his
approach to filmmaking, Kurosawa frequently described his attitude
toward art in similar terms. ``To be an artist means never to avert
one's eyes,'' is how he put it once.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa also once described a trip he made with his brother,
Heigo, through the ruins of Tokyo in the aftermath of a massive
earthquake in 1923. Nearly half the city's population died in the
fires that followed the quake. But as the pair moved through the
ruins, Kurosawa said, his brother insisted that the young Akira
look closely at the charred corpses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you shut your eyes to a frightening sight, you end up being
frightened,'' Akira remembered Heigo's telling him. ``If you look
at everything straight on, there is nothing to be afraid of.'' &QL;

FUGUE FOR FREQUENT FLIERS: TRANSPORTING INSTRUMENTS REQUIRES A
VIRTUOSO 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: A photo of Gordon Gottlieb is being sent to NYT photo
clients. 888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.) 
(js) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gordon Gottlieb laid out the Polaroid shots of the
massive daiko drums he bought in Japan while touring Asia with the
New York Philharmonic in July. He rattled off their dimensions: The
biggest drum is 29 inches long and 90 inches in circumference with
a head that is 24 inches across. Each was hand-crafted from a
single piece of wood and took up to four years to make.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb is nearly as famous for his international collection of
instruments as for his technical prowess as a percussionist. And
his latest additions, the gleaming drums, sat safely in his Chelsea
loft, having moved through Kennedy Airport without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this easy.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, after performing in Brazil, Gottlieb stood at the
same airport, 15 fiberglass cases in a heap by his side, as he
waited in vain for the cartage company he had hired to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   First he got angry. Then he got serious. Somehow he hauled the
cases out of the terminal and persuaded two taxis to drive in
tandem back to his loft, the cases piled high in their front and
back seats, tied into their trunks and strapped to their roofs. He
rode in the first and prayed the second would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was desperate,'' he remembered. ``Here I was, stranded with
an army's worth of valuable stuff, in bad shape, and with no one to
get me out of the mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget the years of training, the hours of rehearsals, the
nightly performances and even the stage fright. For thousands of
musicians who, like Gottlieb, play instruments larger than a
piccolo, just getting there is more than half the battle. And in
summer, when musicians crisscross the continent _ and sometimes the
world _ on the festival circuit, the living is far from easy.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the professionals come in: the travel agents and
cartage companies and production managers who get their clients,
and their clients' equipment, to their destinations and home again.
</P>
<P>
   After his fiasco, Gottlieb turned to Gary Boxer, the owner of
Sound Moves LLC, a Manhattan company dedicated solely to
transporting equipment for musicians and recording studios. Boxer
counts among his ``few hundred'' clients percussionist Jack
DeJohnette, saxophonist Michael Brecker and pop singer James
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Needs vary, from the special dolly required to transport a harp,
to the coffinlike container custom-designed to hold a bass
saxophone, to ``holding pens'' for equipment too large to haul in
and out of pint-size apartments. But the goal is the same: getting
the client from point A to point B with minimum hassle.
</P>
<P>
   Large ensembles may have it easiest, relying on production
managers to handle the logistics of transporting instruments,
equipment and even wardrobes. Hank McHugh, the production manager
for the Dave Matthews Band, has moved the group among some 100
sites since April. A veteran of 23 years with performers like Tom
Petty and the Heartbreakers, Hall and Oates, and Bob Dylan, McHugh
approaches his job with assured nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   He oversees the contents of six 48-foot-long trucks, part of a
caravan that also includes six buses for the five musicians, 21
crew members and 12 drivers. Each morning by 7, McHugh and his team
plot the layout for a new stage, keeping it as similar as possible
to the last one. At 8, they begin a four-hour ordeal of unloading
trucks packed with instruments, lighting, sound equipment and
speakers, and making repairs to anything that is broken in the
process. They also set up the band's opening act.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, the crew takes it all back down, in a mere 90
minutes. ``It's amazing how things come apart more quickly when
you're thinking about going to sleep,'' he said.

<P>
   Not every instrument can withstand the conditions in an airplane
baggage hold. Most string instruments, made of tender, aged wood,
fly in the cabin with their owners.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Salm, the cellist with the Raphael Trio, knows the
intricacies of moving her instrument across continents and oceans
perhaps a bit too well. In addition to shuttling among apartments
in New York; Venice, Italy, and Vienna, Austria, this summer, she
performed at festivals ranging from Juneau Classics and Jazz in
Alaska to Music in Ouray in Colorado, where the trio is the
ensemble in residence, to the Chenango Festival in Hamilton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salm works with Jean Furukawa at VTS Travel in Manhattan,
who first makes sure that an appropriate plane and seat are found
to transport the musician and her cello. (Not all planes are
suitable because of the variations in the distance between the
seats and the overhead compartments. And cellos must almost always
rest in a window seat in a bulkhead row.)
</P>
<P>
   In her student days, she could often talk the cello's way on
board, Ms. Salm said. But today she buys a full-fare ticket for her
instrument. When she travels as part of an ensemble, her colleagues
share the cost. Frequent-flier miles earned by the cello may not be
honored by the airline. After the security check, Ms. Salm carries
her cello on board, where it is strapped into a seat using a
seat-belt extension. Some airlines, like British Airways, require
that a trained specialist do the strapping.
</P>
<P>
   War stories abound, from the amusing (in retrospect) to the
unnerving (like the time she was booked on a flight but her cello
was booked on standby).
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, there was a real horror story. Returning to
New York from London, her cello already ticketed, Ms. Salm was
informed that the plane was completely full, and despite the
cello's fully paid ticket, it was being bumped for a human
passenger. The cello would be relegated to the baggage hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a choice,'' she remembered. The airline promised
that the cello would be hand carried on and off the plane. At
Kennedy Airport, she claimed her suitcase and waited for the cello
at the designated rendezvous. And waited. ``Finally, three people
came over and said: `Aren't you Susan Salm? We don't know how to
tell you this, but there's no cello on that plane.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told them the value of the instrument they had just
lost, they freaked, maybe even more than I had.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the airline found Ms. Salm's Marconcini cello, made
in Ferrara, Italy, in the 1700s and worth about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with instruments ``never becomes a joy,'' said Rose
Hirschel, the owner of Musicians' Travel Services, a Manhattan
company that has specialized in making arrangements for musicians
for 15 years. Insurance is necessary, since airlines are not
responsible for damage to instruments, she said. ``My experience
has been that airline employees are not so much impressed about the
value of an instrument but rather the age.''
</P>
<P>
   New Federal Aviation Administration guidelines for carry-on
baggage, implemented on April 15, have also adversely affected
musicians like violinists, who normally stow their instruments in
overhead compartments. A violin case now falls outside the new size
guidelines. But the woodwind players often have the hardest time
clearing security.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the intricacies of the mechanism in a
wind instrument _ the rods and keys _ that are more likely to
arouse suspicion,'' Ms. Hirschel said. ``That and oboe players, who
travel with reed tools. They have all sorts of curious ways of
getting through.''
</P>
<P>
   To a security agent, those tools, with which oboists make the
reeds for their instruments, can look like an arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use knives, files and screw drivers,'' said Bert Lucarelli,
who taught an oboe seminar this summer at Music Mountain in Falls
Village, Conn., and performed at the Festivalde Artes de Itu in
Brazil. ``When I think of it, I'm smart, and put it in my luggage.
When I forget about it, that's another story entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Lucarelli forgot, he was playing in London. After
much debate with customs officials, he finally persuaded them to
give his tools to the pilot, who carried them back to New York. ``I
played oboe for them when we landed because they couldn't believe
this had anything to do with my instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass saxophones are perhaps the most difficult instruments to
ship, Ms. Hirschel said, because their cases resemble small
coffins. And though the instruments ride in the cargo hold, ``it
still requires a certain type of charm to get the case onto the
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Vince Giordano has perfected that charm. A free-lance musician
and former leader of Vince Giordano's Nighthawks, a big band that
has serenaded society functions ranging from the wedding of Steven
Spielberg and Kate Capshaw to President Clinton's Inaugural Ball,
he plays perhaps the most unwieldy trio of instruments imaginable:
a bass saxophone, a string bass and a tuba. For him, ``traveling
has always been a crazy adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the adventure was trying to get cases that
would withstand the abuse of airline baggage handlers, one of whom
once threw a case with such force that the wheels penetrated the
shell and damaged his gold-plated antique saxophone.
</P>
<P>
   He went to a metal shop, which riveted large sheets of
one-eighth-inch-thick aluminum to the case, increasing its weight
to 122 pounds with the horn inside, making it virtually ``airline
proof,'' he said. But then a new FAA regulation banned oversize
cargo on commercial airplanes. Giordano would now have to ship his
saxophone on a cargo plane, adding a day on each side of the trip
to make sure the instrument was there when he landed. The cost:
$120 each way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all leads to the joke, `You should have taken up the
flute,''' he said with a sigh. ``I wish I had a quarter for every
time I heard that, because I'd be able to pay all my excess baggage
costs.''

NEW VENTURE FOR CSPAN: ALL BOOKS, ALL WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating to remove photo note; no other changes.)  
 (ATTN: Ind.)  (lb) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Expanding beyond its deadpan gavel-to-gavel coverage of
Congress, C-Span is poised to bring similar unfiltered
page-to-binding treatment of the publishing industry with the start
on Saturday of Book TV, a regular weekend lit-a-thon of programs
devoted to just books.
</P>
<P>
   Make that nonfiction titles, said Brian Lamb, chief executive of
Cable Satellite Public Affairs Network and the longtime host and
low-key interrogator for C-Span's ``Book-notes'' program, who
allows that he has not read any fiction since Tom Wolfe's ``Bonfire
of the Vanities,'' which was published 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for information; that's the underlying reason
for the program,'' Lamb said last week while on a swing through New
York to film interviews of executives at several top trade
publishing houses. ``Richness of language _ we don't make judgments
about that. What we're about is transmitting information. It's hard
for us to display beautiful language.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a nonprofit public affairs network _
subsidized by the cable industry _ although some of the books
featured on the programs seem to obliterate the line between fact
and fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Mouse, Senate Mouse,'' for example, is a children's
storybook that describes the intense legislative effort to
designate a national cheese, which passes under the scrutiny of the
squeaker of the House and President Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The book's authors, Peter Barnes, the CNBC broadcaster, and his
wife, Cheryl Shaw Barnes, will be interviewed by a 9-year-old guest
host, Sherryl Grant, whose day job is fourth-grade pupil at Robert
Brent Elementary School in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to appeal to a younger age group,'' said Lamb,
who says that C-Span will be able to experiment with such
programming because it does not measure success by viewer ratings.
In fact, it doesn't measure them at all.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span does reach 73 million households on its primary channel
and 50.4 million on its sister channel, C-Span2, which will be
showing the book programming.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, which accepts no contributions, is spending more than
$1.1 million to start Book TV with eight employees who will create
programming to run from 8 a.m. Saturday to 8 a.m. Monday. The
schedule is still evolving, but it will include programs exploring
the business of publishing along with interviews of authors, panel
discussions, bookstore tours and literary events like book signings
and regional festivals.

   ``We may never have a way to judge if it is a success other than
if we get feedback from teachers who are telling us that they're
using it,'' Lamb said of the project. So instead, he judges success
by the customer in a New York cafe who gives him a thumbs-up sign.
Or he measures his impact by the sales of his collection of
interviews with authors, which is now in its seventh printing with
35,000 copies in print.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lamb, a native of Lafayette, Ind., wears a dark jacket and an
understated print tie. He likes to cast himself as an average
reader with no intellectual pretensions and a curiosity for
substantive information (although in his youth he was the host of a
Lafayette television show that would now seem a little frivolous by
C-Span standards: ``Dance Date'').
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for interviewing authors, he said, he marks up and
reads at least 75 percent of each book featured on the show. And on
the basis of this expansive reading list, he makes one of his few
judgments: Many books, he said, are too long.
</P>
<P>
   C-Span, which started its ``Book-notes'' interview programs in
the late 1980s, has long had a habit of zigging in different
directions from the book coverage of commercial networks. As Lamb
notes with some pride, C-Span maintained the sanctity of an O.J.
Simpson-literature-free zone.
</P>
<P>
   On the Book TV format, Lamb said, there will be no interviews
with authors debating the latest twists of the JonBenet Ramsey
case. Instead, the programs' producers will be seeking authors of
perennial backlist books, which may have been published 10 years
earlier, or ``non-best-selling authors'' who sell in modest numbers
_ 5,000 copies or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why we're doing Book TV is that I've
learned that you've got to be different,'' Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said Book TV's cameras would soon start tracking
neighborhood reading clubs, quirky independent stores and personal
home libraries. Last week, a film crew was wandering the Great Hall
of the Library of Congress. And of course Book TV will continue to
feature authors who are willing to open themselves up to Lamb's
calm, relentlessly neutral questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking to create an environment that's not frantic,''
Lamb said. ``It's not meant to be confrontational. It's meant to be
substantive, conversational.''

AKIRA KUROSAWA, RENOWNED JAPANESE FILMMAKER, DIES AT 88
</HEADLINE>
   (See also OBIT-KUROSAWA and KUROSAWA-FILMOGRAPHY) 
(jws) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Akira Kurosawa, who personified Japanese movies to most of the
world and who grew into one of the handful of truly important
directors that the cinema has produced, died Sunday at his home in
Tokyo. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa, born in Tokyo as the son of a military institute's
athletic instructor, stumbled into filmmaking after failing as a
painter and became one of the colossal figures in film history _ an
autocratic perfectionist with a painter's eye for composition, a
dancer's sense of movement and a humanist's quiet sensibility.
Dozens of directors spanning two generations have acknowledged his
enduring influence on their work.
</P>
<P>
   When Kurosawa's ``Rashomon'' reached Western audiences in 1951,
little was known outside Japan about the country's cinema. That
changed overnight with ``Rashomon,'' a compelling study of
ambiguity and deception that provides four contradictory accounts
of a medieval rape and murder recalled by a bandit, a noblewoman,
the ghost of her slain husband and a woodcutter. The characters,
Kurosawa said, have a ``sinful need for flattering falsehood'' and
``cannot survive without lies to make them feel they are better
people than they really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa's calculated blend of Japanese folklore with Western
acting styles and story-telling techniques provided a link between
the two worlds, reintroducing Japan to a postwar global audience
and leading to an amazingly fertile decade that saw the director
produce several films widely acclaimed as among the finest ever
made, including ``The Seven Samurai,'' ``Ikiru'' and ``Yojimbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose all of my films have a common theme,'' Kurosawa told
Japanese film scholar Donald Richie. ``If I think about it, though,
the only theme I can think of is really a question: Why can't
people be happier together?''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa was a master of both of the most popular Japanese film
genres of his era, the jidai-geko (a costumed action film involving
medieval samurai) and the gendai-geki (a more realistic, often
domestic drama rooted in contemporary Japanese life).
</P>
<P>
   In her introduction to ``Voices from the Japanese Cinema''
(1975), Joan Mellen wrote: ``It is possible to draw a line from
Kurosawa's finest film, `Seven Samurai,' which Donald Richie has
called the greatest Japanese film ever made, back to Daisuke Ito's
`Man-Slashing, Horse-Piercing Sword' in 1930. But if Ito created
the genre of jidai-geki, Kurosawa perfected the form and gave it so
deep a historical resonance that each of his jidai-geki has
contained within it the entire progress of Japan from feudal to
modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa chafed when Japanese critics described his work as too
Western. ``I collect old Japanese lacquerware as well as antique
French and Dutch glassware,'' he said. ``In short, the Western and
the Japanese live side-by-side in my mind naturally, without the
least bit of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories of his perfectionism are plentiful. He once halted
production to reconstruct a hugely expensive medieval set because
he noticed a nail head was barely visible in one shot. For the
climax of ``Throne of Blood,'' his 1957 samurai version of
``Macbeth,'' he insisted that his star, Toshiro Mifune, wear a
protective vest and perform the scene while being shot with real
arrows.
</P>
<P>
   On the set, where he rarely brooked dissent, Kurosawa developed
his own technique for filmmaking that allowed him to edit each
day's scenes that night and be finished with a rough draft of the
film within hours of shooting the final scene.
</P>
<P>
   While he was quite strict with his technical crew, Kurosawa was
more patient with actors.
</P>
<P>
   Kurosawa described his approach this way: ``Unless you can see,
as an actor, what the director is trying to express simply by how
he looks and acts himself, you are going to miss the finer points.
When my cast and I are on location, we always eat together, sleep
in the same rooms, are constantly talking together. As you might
say, here is where I direct.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach paid off with an intense loyalty. Kyoko Kagawa, who
starred in ``The Lower Depths'' (1957) and the contemporary
thriller ``The Bad Sleep Well'' (1960), told an interviewer: ``It
is only when I work with the Kurosawa group that I feel fulfilled
as an actress _ and coupled with that is the feeling of relief that
I know when I see that Kurosawa is satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Though internationally renowned, Kurosawa was not much of a
globe-trotter. He spent most of his time, when not working, at the
home that he shared with his wife, Yoko Yaguchi, a former actress,
who died in 1984. They had one son, Hisao, and one daughter,
Kuzuko, both of whom survive him.
</P>
<P>
   His global fame was not always matched by popularity at home,
and Japanese audiences seemed to tire of his costume epics.
Financial reversals following the release of ``Dodeskaden'' in 1970
combined with a painful ailment (later diagnosed as gallstones) led
him to attempt suicide in 1971. He recovered but seemed changed.
After having made 22 films between 1946 and 1965, he made only five
in the 28 years following ``Dodeskaden,'' although two of them _
the historical epics ``Kagemusha'' (1980) and ``Ran'' (1985) _ are
considered among his finest works.
</P>
<P>
   His final films, ``Rhapsody in August'' (1990) and ``Madadayo''
(1993) were poorly received and struck many as containing a new,
strident note of Japanese nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But his influence on American filmmakers continued.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Kurosawa's ``The Seven Samurai'' was remade by director
John Sturges as ``The Magnificent Seven.'' In 1964, ``Rashomon''
was remade by Martin Ritt as ``The Outrage.'' In 1964, ``Yojimbo''
was remade by Sergio Leone as ``A Fistful of Dollars,'' then remade
again in 1996 by Walter Hill as ``Last Man Standing.''

PATENTS: BOARD GAMES FOR FUN OR EDUCATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mo., N.J., Minn., Puerto Rico)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day is generally a celebration of time off from work and
school. Millions of people will spend the day in back yards, beside
pools, or at beaches and camp sites. Many of those will pass the
time with games _ sports, cards and board games _ without realizing
that they are playing with patented inventions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, hundreds of ball games, computer games, board games,
card games, arcade games and athletic games win patents each year.
Some are variations on games like poker or blackjack; others are
electronic, miniature or portable versions of traditional games
like basketball or football, and still others are creative hybrids
like golf-pool tables.
</P>
<P>
   Board games generally depend on players rolling dice to move
game pieces around a specific course, but the objectives of newly
patented games are often surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Up to six people could while away Labor Day playing Laurence
Brown's political board game. Players are randomly assigned a role
_ either as elected politicians or as members of a particular
constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Each turn begins with the roll of three differently colored
dice. A card is then drawn from a set that raises political
questions on which the players vote. The cards are divided into
public-interest fields like domestic and international affairs,
taxes, crime or the federal debt.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cards raise constitutional or ethical dilemmas.
Players can be ejected from the game if they are impeached for
unethical behavior or conflict-of-interest voting, or because their
votes violate the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who lives in Springfield, Va., says in his patent that
the object of the game is ``to direct voter attention to the
perspective of issues from various points of view and public
interest and to hone voting judgment and skill.'' He received
patent 5,769,715.
</P>
<P>
   Mathematics may not sound like a subject for an enjoyable board
game, but Patrick Thompson believes people can sharpen their math
skills with his game. Thompson, from Joplin, Mo., designed a board
divided into several pie-shaped wedges. Within each wedge are small
boxes bearing the numbers 1 through 15, and there is a set of cards
with instructions to add, subtract, divide or multiply.
</P>
<P>
   Each player is assigned a section of the game board, draws a
card and then rolls one, two or three dice. The player has up to 60
seconds to follow the instructions on the card he drew to calculate
a solution using the numbers on the dice to arrive at a figure that
appears on his part of the board. The object is to cover that
number with a chip and keep playing until all the numbers in the
section are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says that if a player ``rolls 4, 5 and 6, and draws the
add card, he could add all three to get 15,'' and then cover the
number 15 on the board. The player loses a turn if the calculation
is not done within the time limit. Players can challenge one
another's calculations, and remove an opponent's chips if the
challenge is successful. Thompson received patent 5,772,209.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Labor Day often includes picnics and barbecues, Ruth Bard
Pierce's new board game might be enjoyed more on another day. The
game is called ``Fat Chance,'' the objective is ``winner loses
all,'' and play revolves around losing as much weight as possible.
Players are issued tokens that represent pounds of excess weight,
and a predetermined amount they have to lose to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The game board is laced with routes that players can choose to
follow _ one is called Healthy Lifestyle, another is Crash Diet and
a third is named Excuses. Players roll dice and move game pieces
along the route they have selected. Each space along the path
indicates how much weight the player loses or gains within each
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Players who choose the Healthy Lifestyle path lose weight more
slowly than those on the Crash Diet, but crash dieters gain back
more. Along the way, players can land on question-and-answer
spaces, which require them to draw a card and answer a question.
Correct answers mean more pounds lost. The winner is the first
player to lose all of his or her weight. Ms. Pierce, who lives in
Annandale, N.J., received patent 5,704,611.
</P>
<P>
   For teen-agers preparing for their first driver's license test,
Gilberto Lopez has created a game that uses tokens, dice and cards
to reinforce the rules of the road. Lopez, who lives in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, designed a board with playing spaces that look like
roads, traffic signals and traffic hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Players roll the dice, move around the board and earn points by
memorizing and obeying safety rules, signs and speed limits. Cards
drawn on certain spaces raise questions just like those ``on the
written driver's license examination,'' Lopez says in his patent.
He won patent 5,749,580.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Schmid's patent doesn't cover a game, but rather
clothing with a game-board design and detachable playing pieces.
Ms. Schmid, who lives in Shelby Township, Minn., came up with the
idea of clothing bearing game-board patterns across the front or
back, and a series of hook-and-loop, or Velcro, fasteners.
</P>
<P>
   Game pieces like dice, tokens, chips, or player icons attach to
the garment at the fastener spots. To play the game represented on
the clothing, the garment is taken off and laid flat. Players then
pull the game pieces off and they're ready to go. Ms. Schmid holds
patent 5,734,991.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler air will surge across the Great Lakes states into
the interior Northeast on Monday. A cold front marking the leading
edge of the autumnal air mass will be accompanied by clouds and a
broken band of showers and thunderstorms. The strongest
thunderstorms are expected later Monday afternoon and evening in
the Middle Atlantic States, where several hours of sunshine will
add energy to the developing storms.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the front, winds from the north will gust over 25
miles an hour. A few showers will develop in the very cool air over
the northern Great Lakes and southern Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Another day of unseasonable heat will prevail from Virginia to
the interior Southeast. Sunshine will be plentiful in most
locations, although thunderstorms will erupt near the central
Appalachians as the cold front approaches from the north. Clusters
of clouds and thundershowers will brush the Gulf of Mexico coast.
Locally heavy showers are expected near the Texas and Louisiana
shores.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will boost temperatures to near 100 degrees
again over Texas and Oklahoma. Near the periphery of the hot air
mass, scattered afternoon thunderstorms will develop over parts of
the central Plains. Meanwhile, cool, dry air will spread over the
northern parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The western states will stay very warm with a mixture of
sunshine and clouds. Afternoon thunderstorms will form over many
mountains from the Sierra to the western slopes of the central
Rockies. A weak front will bring increasing clouds to the
northwestern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn by the Bay
</P>
<P>
   A surge of autumn chill will reach the Northeast this week
signaling summer's waning days. But in San Francisco late summer
and early fall are typically the warmest time of year. In midsummer
the city is often cooled by breezes from the 60-degree ocean water.
With the jet stream far to the north, weather systems are weak, so
local winds are the dominant influence. At this time of year, the
jet stream moves south, steering stronger lows and highs into the
Pacific Northwest. Clockwise flow around highs brings brisk winds
from the east, which temporarily push the maritime air out to sea.

E! ENTERTAINMENT: A WASTELAND, AND PROUD OF IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a new television season approaches, the
broadcast networks are winding up an annual rite that involves
spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing new series in
hopes of finding the next ``Seinfeld'' or ``ER.'' Though the
chances of success are minuscule, the networks persist because the
only way of attracting big audiences, and profits, is to come up
with an original hit.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect to see this sort of exercise on the niche cable
channels, like E! Entertainment, which often succeed by spending
far more modest sums and attracting relatively small but loyal
audiences _ even if the viewers watch for only a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of niche channels in recent years has turned
the old economic model for success on its head. Broadcast networks
battle to attract big audiences with hugely expensive programming _
such as the $13 million an episode NBC is paying for ``ER'' and the
billions of dollars networks like CBS and ABC are paying for the
rights to broadcast football games. But so-called narrowcast cable
channels have been building highly profitable businesses by
thinking small and keeping programming budgets tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe money sometimes gets in the way of creativity,'' Lee
Masters, E!'s president, said in an interview in his modest office
in the nondescript office block the company occupies here.
</P>
<P>
   E!, which mixes upbeat coverage of the entertainment and fashion
worlds with reruns of old broadcast series, is one of the more
telling examples of cable channels that have succeeded with few if
any truly original programming ideas or major hit shows. Other
niche channels _ whether the History Channel or the Sci-Fi Channel,
the Nashville Network or Black Entertainment Television _ have
built followings by focusing on narrow audiences. But E! stands
out, analysts say, in part because it is meta-entertainment _
entertainment about entertainment _ and in part because it has
prospered by keeping costs so low.
</P>
<P>
   The channel largely repackages others' programming and offers
everything about movies except opinions on what's good and what's
not.
</P>
<P>
   And E! wears a figurative smirk much of the time. Consider the
way John Henson, the irreverent host of ``Talk Soup,'' a late-night
compilation of clips from the day's talk shows, opened the program
on a recent evening: ``So you're a sick little freak who enjoys
talk-show highlights, eh? Good. I'm John Henson. Welcome back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is just the way Masters likes it. ``We're one step above
mindless, and proud of it,'' he said. ``We're not solving the
riddle of the Sphinx here.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the programming is designed for people who, by the
channel's own admission, are likely to surf in for a few minutes
then surf on. Such viewership is generally good enough for the
cable systems that agree to include E! in their basic cable
packages, giving the channel access to 51 million of the 76.8
million households that have access to E!.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an audience that generally suffices for E!, which
operates on a different financial basis from the networks. Unlike
broadcast networks, which rely solely on advertising for their
revenues, so-called basic cable channels like E! have two revenue
sources _ advertising and subscription fees.
</P>
<P>
   That means the networks are engaged in a relentless race not
just to generate the maximum number of viewers for each show but to
have as many of those viewers as possible fall within the desirable
18-to-49 age group that advertisers pay a premium to reach. Cable
companies, of course, do try to reach as large an audience as
feasible to generate the best advertising revenues. But with most
cable channels enjoying a continually growing base of subscribers,
the channels can prosper so long as people watch even a small
portion of the time _ assuming they pay their monthly bills.
Analysts estimate that E! receives on average about 9 cents to 10
cents a month for each of its 51 million subscribers (a figure
expected to grow to 54 million by year-end).
</P>
<P>
   E!, which is owned by a group of media companies, does not
release any financial figures, but Masters said the network
received about 50 percent of its overall revenues from advertising
and about 40 percent from subscription fees. The remaining 10
percent comes from E!'s international distribution in Asia, Latin
America and Europe, which Masters said could become one of the
fastest-growing portions of E!'s business.
</P>
<P>
   Started eight years ago by a group of cable companies, E! is
currently owned about 39 percent by Walt Disney Co., which also
owns ABC, and 40 percent by Comcast Communications Corp., which
manages E! The remaining 21 percent of E! is evenly split between
Media One and Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The channel has seen its overall value rise from a few million
dollars to roughly $800 million, according to analysts, based on a
rough calculation that a cable channel is worth between $15 and $20
for each subscriber. And it has achieved this mainly by running
movie trailers (provided free by the studios), covering
star-studded movie premieres and repackaging other programs. For
example, at 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. each day, E! telecasts a taping of
Howard Stern as he broadcasts his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   And E! stands clear of the ferocious competition that exists
between the two broadcast programs that focus on the entertainment
industry: ``Access Hollywood'' and ``Entertainment Tonight.'' Those
two shows, which run for a half-hour each week night, fight
bitterly over matters like which will get a film preview first or a
particular celebrity interview. E!, with its 24-hour format, is
generally content to succeed with volume and attitude.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Derek Baine of the cable industry research firm Paul Kagan
Associates estimates that E! will have revenues of $124 million
this year, with cash flow _ earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and other expenses _ expected to reach $45 million.
Next year, he said, he expects revenues to grow to $144 million and
cash flow to reach $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baine, like most analysts, tends to focus on cash flow rather
than net earnings. Cash flow is regarded as a more useful measure
of financial performance of cable channels _ because a channel
often carries a heavy debt load from the start-up costs and because
industry estimates of the acquisition price of a cable channel are
typically based on cash flow projections, not net profits. That
said, though, Baine estimated that 30 percent to 40 percent of E!'s
cash flow was net profit.
</P>
<P>
   By such reckoning, the contrast between the profitability of the
cable channels versus the broadcast networks could not be more
stark. According to Baine, the four principal networks had total
revenues of $12.7 billion last year and cash flow of just $697
million, nearly all of which came from NBC. That generated a cash
flow margin of just 5.5 percent. The cable channels together had
revenues of $9.4 billion and cash flow of $2.5 billion, Baine said.
The cash flow margin of 26 percent, he added, would have been even
higher if the average had not been dragged down by many new, and as
yet unprofitable, cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   E! has achieved success with ratings that by broadcast standards
are less than tiny. The channel tied for 27th place among all cable
channels for the month of July, according to Nielsen Media
Research, with a rating of 0.1 _ about the same level as the
Country Music Channel. That means that only one-tenth of 1 percent
of the roughly 98 million households with televisions were tuned in
to E! in the average minute in July.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Fox, fourth among the broadcast networks, has had
an average rating of 4.9 so far this year, and NBC, the leader, has
had a 9.5 rating. Even E!'s most popular show, ``The Howard Stern
Show,'' rated just 0.3, according to Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   But in the world of cable, that does not matter much.
</P>
<P>
   ``What E! does well is it's good at packaging,'' said Thomas
Eagan, an analyst at Paine Webber. ``It's all about packaging the
studio movie trailers with other stuff that's already been produced
by somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula is working so well that E! is going to start its
second channel in October. One of the current channel's successes
has been providing fashion news and helpful fashion hints to
viewers in need of a make-over, largely through a show called
``Fashion Emergency'' _ with segments that have included, for
instance, fashion tips for a woman who had just changed careers
after more than 20 years as a nun.
</P>
<P>
   Masters said the fashion-oriented shows were doing well but that
he was reluctant to take more time away from the core entertainment
news. So E! has developed Style, a channel that will focus entirely
on fashion, design, architecture and the like. The new channel will
be introduced on Oct. 1, taking over the channel formerly occupied
by Q2, a spinoff from the QVC cable shopping network that failed to
develop a following. That will give Style a potential list of 8
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Masters said he expected the Style channel to reach perhaps 10
million subscribers by the end of the year and to become profitable
in perhaps three years by offering a formula not unlike that on E!
_ keeping things light and upbeat. The new channel will include
original programming, produced in-house with a close eye on the
budget, involving tours of restaurants and homes, plus information
on hair styles, health and beauty, and wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any pretense about what we're doing,'' Masters
said. ``It's a diversion. That's all we are. It's a fun place to
hang out. It seems to work out for us.''

CAMBODIA JOURNAL: MEET MACHIAVELLI? THE MONKEY WRENCH IN CAMBODIAN
DEMOCRACY? 
 (NK)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ ``Read this,'' said Sam Rainsy, stepping
out of the room to dress for a political rally. ``A different point
of view.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a pro-government newspaper with a front-page editorial
that declared: ``Mr. Sam Rainsy, the machiavellian, maverick,
opportunistic, selfish, foolish and irresponsible politician, a
self-proclaimed opposition leader, must be prosecuted to the full
extent of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar characterization here in a country where Sam
Rainsy, 49, seems intent on keeping the political pot boiling until
he can achieve his goals. Not only the government but also many
diplomats see him as a power-hungry spoiler too convinced of his
own righteousness to even consider a compromise with his rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Sam Rainsy's own view and that of many Cambodians is
different. He sees himself, as do his many supporters here and
abroad, as a democratic idealist who has ``lost any illusion about
working with rotten people in a rotten system.''
</P>
<P>
   He is ready to paralyze the Parliament, to bring down the
government, to force this exhausted and poverty-stricken country
into a new round of elections and confrontations if that is what it
takes to achieve what he calls a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dream of a modern Cambodia,'' he said, returning from his
bedroom in a clean white shirt. ``I have lived more than half my
life in Europe and I have spent many months in the United States
and I can see the difference between a modern society and a
backward society.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a modern Cambodia means, first, the rule of law. It
sounds elementary, but it is crucial. Without that, we just have a
feudalistic system of warlords, of people who have guns and money
and who are just above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   He was clearly referring to the power structure of Hun Sen, who
has led the country _ first as a Communist, then as a prime
minister, then as the leader of a coup _ for most of the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pretend we have a market economy but I call it a jungle
economy,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``The difference is, there is no legal
framework. This is a real revolution because they are powerfully
entrenched interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks after a parliamentary election in which his party, the
Sam Rainsy Party, finished a distant third, Sam Rainsy has brought
the country to a standstill with a vigorous campaign of protests
and rallies and political maneuvers that threaten to block the
formation of a new government.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambodian terms, his campaign is already something of a
revolution: He is not using guns. Instead, in a style he has
perfected over the last few years, some diplomats say he is
taunting Hun Sen's government to use its guns against him, to
discredit itself and make martyrs of him and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, 1997, unknown assailants threw four grenades at a
rally he was leading in a park, killing 16 people and wounding more
than 100. Sam Rainsy blamed Hun Sen for the attack; Hun Sen said
Sam Rainsy himself was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for the last two weeks, Sam Rainsy has led thousands of
people in a rambunctious sit-in at the same park, which he has
called Democracy Square.
</P>
<P>
   Through determination, intelligence, political astuteness and
physical courage _ and with the partnership of his wife, Saumura _
Sam Rainsy has become a powerful political force.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of him and his wife, one Western analyst with long
experience in Cambodia said, ``They are people who have a zeal and
who see themselves as historical figures in a struggle for the
future of Cambodia.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Educated in France and Britain, eloquent in three languages, Sam
Rainsy inspires strong feelings of both adulation and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   He has unsettled many foreigners with the gutter language of his
attacks on Hun Sen and with his diatribes against the Vietnamese
minority. A wave of violence has taken the lives of at least five
ethnic Vietnamese in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of his efforts, the parliamentary election held
on July 26 has produced only political turmoil. In a vote Sam
Rainsy disputes, the election was won by Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party, which took 64 of the 122 seats.
</P>
<P>
   In second place, with 43 seats, was the royalist party of
Norodom Ranariddh, who was ousted by Hun Sen in a coup a year
earlier from the co-premiership the two men shared. The party of
Sam Rainsy, who had in turn been ousted from the royalist party by
Prince Ranariddh in 1995, won 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three parties won the two-thirds needed to form a
government. Sam Rainsy has persuaded the prince to join him in his
protests and in his refusal to form the needed coalition with Hun
Sen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the democratic alibi in such an
authoritarian system,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``If I cannot be part of
the cure, I do not want to be part of the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that the prince is as convinced as Sam Rainsy of
this position. But analysts say Sam Rainsy may have maneuvered him
so deeply into his protests that it will be difficult for the
prince now to do an about-face and accept pomp and financial
rewards of a coalition government that Hun Sen is offering.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy may or may not be sincere in the democratic ideals he
espouses. But he shares with his two rivals a frank and deep-seated
mutual animosity that is more than enough to sustain his campaign
against them.

SOFTWARE MAKERS WIN A ROUND IN YEAR 2000 COURT FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the first battles in what promises to be a long and
titanic legal struggle over year 2000 computer woes, the maker of
the popular financial software Quicken has scored a knockdown. But
ultimate victory for the company is far from certain in a lawsuit
that tests just how active software companies must be in heading
off problems their customers might suffer as a result of the
so-called millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The online banking package in several older versions of Quicken,
which is made by Intuit Inc. of Cupertino, Calif., flashes an
``error'' message when called on to deal with dates on or after
Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 problem, popularly known as Y2K, is a result of
software in which programmers saved memory by using only the final
two digits of a year, so that computers interpret ``00'' and ``01''
as the years 1900 and 1901.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed late last year on behalf of hundreds
of thousands of Quicken users, Intuit became one of the first
targets of class action litigation asserting liability for year
2000 problems.
</P>
<P>
   A California judge's recent decision to dismiss the lawsuit in
its current form gave Intuit, and perhaps other software companies,
some breathing room to work out strategies intended to minimize
their liabilities from year 2000 problems. The dismissal was mainly
based on the reasoning that no demonstrable damages had yet
occurred to the plaintiffs because the program had not yet failed
as a result of the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Santa Clara County, Calif., where
Intuit is based, in the name of Alan Issokson and other Quicken
users. The plaintiffs are represented by Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach, a law firm widely feared by businesses for its
success with class actions.
</P>
<P>
   Milberg Weiss also has Y2K class actions pending against four
other producers of business and consumer software: Software
Business Technologies Inc., Symantec Corp., Macola Inc. and Real
World Corp..
</P>
<P>
   The Issokson suit contended that Intuit was unfairly forcing
consumers who wanted to avoid banking problems resulting from year
2000 defects to pay anywhere from $20 to $40 to upgrade to Quicken
98, which is not prone to the problem. Five other law firms soon
filed copycat class actions _ two in California and three in New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intuit did not dispute that the early versions of Quicken have
year 2000 blind spots, but it argued that the program's defects _
such as an inability to schedule a full year's worth of bill
payments after Jan. 1, 1999 _ were not yet apparent to users.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Allison Hubbard Colgin, the company's senior counsel,
said that although there had been no public announcement before
Milberg Weiss filed its suit, Intuit had been working ``for
months'' on plans to offer free upgrades so that no one would be
damaged in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Aug. 27 ruling by Superior Court Judge John Herlihy, which
Intuit announced last week, was a legalistic version of the old
playground basketball rule: no blood, no foul. He also pointed out
that Milberg Weiss had not said that Issokson had actually sought
and been denied a remedy to the supposed defects. Milberg Weiss was
given the opportunity to reword the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spencer, a Milberg Weiss partner in New York, conceded
that it might be difficult to resurrect the lawsuit in a form that
Herlihy would accept. He and Intuit's lawyers agreed that motions
to quash the other Intuit suits would probably succeed if other
judges followed Herlihy's logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no material difference in the suits,'' Mrs. Colgin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawsuits against other software vendors differ in that they
include charges that some damage has already occurred. Spencer said
that forcing all computer users to suffer damages before they are
allowed to sue would delay remedies and add to the overall cost of
the year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterproductive,'' he said.

CASHING IN ON A PROGRAMMING TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention HBO, and most people think adult thoughts. The pay-cable
network is best known for sophisticated movies, R-rated comedy and
big-time boxing, with the occasional provocative documentary thrown
in. The words ``family fare'' definitely do not come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   But having seen how rapidly the market for family programming is
expanding, HBO is now leaping into that world, too, with a 24-hour,
commercial-free supplementary cable channel called HBO Family,
which the company is busily preparing for a February debut.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which is owned by Time Warner, has done some family
programming in the past, ranging from serious documentaries like
``Smoke Alarm: The Unfiltered Truth About Cigarettes'' and ``Faces
of Addiction'' to quirky children's shows like ``Fraggle Rock'' and
``Little Lulu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was sporadic, and not perceived as a real attribute of
our service,'' said Sheila Nevins, HBO's senior vice president of
original programming. ``Now we've decided to go into family
programming in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   In competitive terms, HBO may already be a little late. HBO
Family is being developed at the same time as several other new
family-oriented cable services, including the completely revamped
Fox Family Channel, begun last month; Noggin, a co-venture of
Nickelodeon and the Children's Television Workshop, due in January;
and a channel still in development by Hallmark Entertainment, Jim
Henson Co. and the Odyssey network.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Paxnet, a new broadcast network of 95 UHF stations,
started last Monday, with its schedule completely devoted to family
shows, mostly reruns of series like ``Touched by an Angel,''
``Eight Is Enough,'' ``Bonanza'' and the ``Father Dowling Mystery
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all of these start-ups, the new HBO effort is intended to
catch the wave of demand that has helped Nickelodeon become second
only to ESPN as the most profitable network in cable television and
has enabled the Disney Channel to raise its ratings 34 percent and
expand its subscriber base 56 percent _ to 41.8 million households
_ in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's an overcrowded marketplace,'' Ms. Nevins said.
``We will be distinctly different. We understand the competition,
and we think there's room for one more.''
</P>
<P>
   She also sees an opportunity for HBO to make money from this
venture. New programming that the network develops can be sold in
the international marketplace, where demand for well-produced
children's shows is high. She would not discuss financing, but an
HBO executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said HBO would
invest about $18 million in programming for the new channel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nevins said the new channel, like HBO itself, would be free
of commercials (unlike Nickelodeon, Fox Family Channel or the
broadcast networks) and of shows designed with the selling of toys
or other products in mind (like Fox's ``Power Rangers'' and
``Spiderman'' or WB's ``Men in Black'').
</P>
<P>
   ``And it will have the HBO edge,'' she said, describing it as
``slightly sarcastic but not anti-parent, like Nickelodeon,'' and
``educational but not as heavy-handed as some shows on PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan promoting it, matching the network's initials, is
``Honest, Brainy, Outrageous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The channel will have a combination of original programming
(some for very young children, some for older children), some shows
based on traditional children's books, like ``Babar,'' and PG-rated
movies from HBO's vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to differentiate ourselves as not just being a
kiddie channel,'' said Ms. Nevins' colleague, David Baldwin, senior
vice president of program planning. ``And many of our subscribers
still perceive HBO to be a movie network, and we want to use that
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the channel would have preschool programming in the
morning, movies or children's specials from noon until 4 p.m.,
educational game shows for older children in the later afternoon,
and family movies at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nevins said she hoped the children's shows would set HBO
Family apart from the competition. For preschoolers, she said: ``We
wanted something that wasn't furry animals getting all
snuggly-wuggly and saying `Let's all cooperate' or `What can we do
on this nice rainy day?' We thought the best thing is to go back to
pots and pans and all those ordinary things that kids really love
to play with _ a mop or a pail or a pencil.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``A Little Curious,'' a preschool show co-produced
by John Hoffman of HBO and Curious Pictures, creators of
``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Characters named Bob the Ball, Mr. String, Mop, Doris the Door
and Pad and Pencil (a sultry pair of lovebirds who sound like
Morticia and Gomez in ``The Addams Family'') all cavort in three
different video forms _ traditional hand-drawn animation, computer
animation and puppets. Each show teaches two or three basic
concepts, like the difference between ``slippery'' and ``sticky''
or ``near'' and ``far.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the other series for younger children are being
developed with one of three top children's production studios
(Nelvana, Cinar and Hit Entertainment), and include ``George and
Martha,'' ``The Adventures of Paddington Bear,'' ``Anthony Ant,''
``Pippi Longstocking'' and ``The Country Mouse and the City Mouse
Adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   The older children's offerings include a program called
``Crashbox,'' which will feature game shows about historical
figures, math, vocabulary, animals and ecological topics, all
linked to World Wide Web sites where viewers can actually play the
games and get responses.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Morris, the HBO Family vice president supervising the
older children's programs, is especially proud of ``30x30: Kid
Flicks,'' which is a half-hour series featuring films or ``video
diaries'' made by children, ages 8 to 18, and discovered in various
school, museum or community-center film programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say we're putting the edge back in education,'' Ms.
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   HBO subscribers will be able to get HBO Family at no additional
charge _ if their cable systems have enough capacity to carry it
and choose to offer it.

   The critics are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the current economic trend in major league baseball,
the Seattle Mariners don't need Randy Johnson, Jose Cruz, a new
manager or six new relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   All they need is more Beanie Babies. Which leads to another
conclusion. The M's don't need a new stadium. They need a toy
store.
</P>
<P>
   Each day of every summer, half the teams playing baseball will
make their fans unhappy. Any composer, performer or producer with
such a record of failure would be drummed out of show biz.
</P>
<P>
   The late Bill Veeck verbalized this basic challenge to the sport
he loved. And he determined that it was necessary to ensure that
his fans went home with some positive memory.
</P>
<P>
   Veeck sponsored baseball's first Bat Day. He gave free tickets
to anybody who showed up at the ballpark with a musical instrument
and then he led the concert.
</P>
<P>
   Between innings Veeck would call lucky-seat winners down onto
the field. The ``prize'' might be a new car, a lifetime supply of
bubble gum or a gaggle of live geese, and a Bo-Peep staff to herd
them off the field like sheep. On ``Turkey Day'' he gave away live
birds, but first you had to catch them. The White Sox still have a
``Dog Day'' when mutts and their owners get in free, a legacy of
Veeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the Indians win last night?'' a fan would ask his
neighbor, who attended the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the guy might respond. ``But between innings they gave
some fan a wheelbarrow containing 7,000 silver dollars. He couldn't
move it an inch. You shoulda been there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the M's win last night?'' the 1998 baseball fan is asked
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but we all got Mariner Moose Beanie Babies. You shoulda
been there.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's owe their remarkable attendance to the legacy left by
Veeck. He was the first executive to order his players to wear
their names on the back of their uniform shirts. He let female fans
in free every Saturday in Cleveland. He sponsored Joe Fan Nights
and on one occasion burned a soldier's home mortgage in a bonfire
hauled out into center field on a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Veeck introduced fireworks and exploding scoreboards. After a
home run ignited the first explosion, the Tigers threatened to
protest. When he installed baseball clown Max Patkin as his first
base coach, the Yankees threatened to protest. When Veeck sent a
midget up to the plate as a pinch hitter for the St. Louis Browns,
Detroit did file a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody threatened to protest when Veeck upgraded the food served
at his ballparks in St. Louis, Cleveland and Chicago. He blended
his hot-dog spices to achieve a perfect formula, rather than accept
the standard brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The packing houses told me some consumers were offended by
garlic,'' Veeck confided during one visit to Seattle. ``They told
me other people won't tolerate even a small amount of red pepper.
So they were turning out hot dogs that didn't offend anybody,
because they didn't have any taste.''
</P>
<P>
   At Veeck's ballparks they got tasty hot dogs, along with a
baseball game and a few circus acts.
</P>
<P>
   And fans returning home from a day game might celebrate Turkey
Day at the ballpark with a feast like this.
</P>
<P>
   Peanuts and Turkey
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds turkey tenders
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons lemon juice, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons ketchup, divided
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons oil, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Tabasco to taste
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup light cream (or evaporated milk)
</P>
<P>
   Cooked rice to serve four
</P>
<P>
   Whack the turkey tenders into cubes about 1 and one-half inches
square. Marinate 1 to 3 hours in a mixture of 6 tablespoons lemon
juice, the minced garlic, 3 tablespoons ketchupand the salt.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner time heat the oven broiler and distribute the turkey
hunks on skewers. (If you use bamboo rather than metal skewers,
make sure they have been thoroughly soaked in water.)
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan combine the leftover marinade with the peanut
butter, 1 tablespoon oil, 1 tablespoon lemon juice, 1 tablespoon
ketchup, light cream, sugar, and Tabasco to taste. Warm over low
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Place the skewers on a flat pan covered with aluminum foil,
about 2 inches from the heat. Broil a couple of minutes on each
side but try not to overcook the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Divide turkey hunks over four plates with some rice. Top the
meat with peanut sauce and serve, possibly with some:
</P>
<P>
   Stir-fried Cabbage
</P>
<P>
   1 small head cabbage
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped ginger root
</P>
<P>
   6 chopped green onions, including tops
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Core the cabbage and cut into inch-wide strips. Slice strips
into 3 or 4 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large skillet and stir-fry the garlic, green
onions and ginger 2 minutes. Add the cabbage and continue to
stir-fry until it is soft to the bite. Add salt and pepper and this
should serve four.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how Veeck marked the occasion when his highly touted
Cleveland Indians were eliminated from the American League race in
1949? He staged a funeral procession at the ballpark. The
pallbearers, wearing black suits and top hats, marched slowly out
from the dugout and then buried the pennant in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Say, that would be a terrific promotion for the '98 Mariners.
They could bury the pennant and Lou Piniella's cap in the same
hole.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As they take to the trail this Labor Day for the
traditional opening of the fall campaigns, Republican and
Democratic candidates say the Lewinsky matter, a jittery stock
market and tumult abroad have thrust them into the most unsettled,
and unpredictable, election season in years.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty has already altered the calculations of
Republicans, who say they have the most to gain, particularly from
President Clinton's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Newly emboldened, Republican officials have revised their
earlier predictions of modest gains and now say the party could
capture more than a dozen additional seats in the House and,
perhaps, even pick up five seats in the Senate. That would hand
Republicans the magic 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster when
Democrats try to block a vote.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Democrats find themselves on the defensive, and
party leaders are lowering their expectations; most have stopped
brazenly forecasting that they will retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much better than a couple months ago,'' said Brent
Siegrist, the Republican leader of the Iowa House. ``I do think
Clinton's troubles help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans now have the slimmest House majority held
by any party in the last half century, few Democratic leaders are
upbeat about their party's prospects for retaking the House, and
some party candidates are distancing themselves from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running my own race _ and I don't plan on running any
events with him,'' said Ken Lucas, a Democrat who is locked in a
tight House race in Kentucky. The latest Democrat to spurn Clinton
is Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, who said he ``will not pursue
the attendance of the president'' as planned for a fund-raising
event next month.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, at the annual meeting of the American Political
Science Association, the corridor chatter among academics was not
about political theory but fresh gossip about the Lewinsky
investigation and how it would play out on Election Day. Perhaps a
telling piece of evidence was that among the hundreds of academic
papers presented, the association ran out of copies for one in
particular demand: ``Compassion, Political Trust and Public
Opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said the ``formless uncertainty''
in the electorate may be welcome news for Republicans trying to
maintain their 11-seat majority in the House. He suggested that
voters may want to keep GOP control of Congress as a check on the
turbulence in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, what people want is stability in our government,
which I think bodes well for incumbents,'' McDermott said. ``I wish
they wanted to throw out the Republican majority and bring in
Democrats, but I think the uncertainty fosters the stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter participation in the statewide primaries this year has
been the lowest on record, which suggests that turnout in November
could be the lowest in history, according to a study by Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate. He and other experts said that could bode well for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Their hope is that while Democrats will be uninterested,
Republicans will be energized by Clinton's troubles and will
eagerly head to the polls to vote against his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like '94, where we had a bump up out of
anger,'' Gans said. ``What you have at this point is disengagement
but not profound anger _ except on the Republican right.'' If
conservative voters are motivated by their anger at Clinton, he
said, that would give Republicans an edge in close contests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the theories about depressed Democratic turnout and
an excited Republican electorate, polls thus far have not shown any
major upheaval in how people expect to vote or broad disaffection
with the Democratic Party. Despite signs that Clinton's personal
approval is eroding, his job approval rating remains impressive.
And despite Democrats' complaints that the Lewinsky debacle is
crowding out their attempts to talk about issues, there is no
statistical evidence that Clinton is dragging down Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the sense of a changed electoral landscape in
both the Republican and Democratic parties is founded on anecdotal
evidence. Two weeks ago, Stuart Rothenberg, an independent
political analyst, predicted that the Democrats would pick up two
or three seats in the House. Now, he says, the Republicans could
capture 10 or 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his change of heart, Rothenberg said: ``I don't
have micro or macro data that shows either a national move or a
move in individual races. We're going on gut here. You don't
discount gut. But you don't go too far.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of this year, politicians in both parties,
noting that voters seemed relatively content and disengaged from
politics, had forecast a status-quo election, where incumbents
would be safe and Republicans would cling to control Congress by
roughly the existing margins.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the buoyed spirits among Republicans, there are
still two months before Election Day. Politicians around the
country say they are bracing for a political hurricane with untold
consequences: They know it will hit but they do not know when _ or
with what force.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a massive, dramatic shift in the makeup of Congress
would be a surprise because far fewer than 100 House seats are
considered hotly competitive. That is because there are fewer open
seats than is traditional and many incumbents face particularly
weak rivals this year. A surging economy through much of the year
and unusually high approval ratings for Congress discouraged many
challengers from running.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates said the biggest wild card will be the report
by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which may be
issued this month. This is the first time since Watergate was
unfolding in 1974 that a general election campaign has occurred
amid a full-scale presidential scandal. But by Labor Day of 1974 it
was already clear to most strategists that Republicans would take a
huge hit that November. (Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and
five in the Senate.) This year, it is not as clear what the
reverberations could be for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also said that the dramatic downturn _ and partial
rebound _ of the stock market this week and the economic and
political crisis in Russia starkly reminded them how outside forces
could intrude on their carefully laid campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments have changed what was a very placid
election season to one that has a lot more uncertainty,'' said
Chris Bayley, a Republican running for Senate from Washington
state. ``Six months ago everyone assumed that since the economy was
good, incumbents would be favored and it would be harder for
challengers.'' Citing the financial crisis in Asia, he said,
``Everybody is much more nervous now.''
</P>
<P>
   William Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist in Los Angeles,
put it this way: ``I've never seen anything like this _ it's a
very, very strange season. We're all analytically groping for what
is this election about: Is it a referendum on the president? It
doesn't appear to be so. But it's clearly not a referendum on
Congress. Then you add in this enormous reluctance by the American
public to even get engaged in following the politics of any of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Republican candidates said they were uncertain
whether to make the Lewinsky matter an issue, several said they now
planned to raise the broader topic of trust. The scandal also seems
to have brought a broader overlay of moral scrutiny to the
campaign, and on Friday led Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., one of the
president's most persistent critics, to acknowledge that he is the
father of a child born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every one of us is going to have to run on
integrity,'' said Fay Boozman, a Republican running for the Senate
from Arkansas. ``I think there is a strong sense of the lack of
integrity of elected officials, and the breaking of the public
trust by elected officials. Bill Clinton is the headliner of that
because he is the President, but it crosses party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats, spurred, perhaps, by the strong rebuke of
Clinton last week by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Clinton's
problems would force them to discuss issues like morality. ``Here
in this particular race, integrity and taking responsibility for
your actions and honesty are big factors,'' said Lucas, the
Democrat running in Kentucky. ``And I think the recent events in
Washington are highlighting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Democrats said they feared that all the talk of trust
would drown out the discourse about their party's marquee issues
such as education, health care reform and preserving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will distract from the ability of candidates to articulate
the issues we think are important,'' said Jay Inslee, a Democrat
seeking a House seat in Washington. ``It's kind of like a wreck on
the freeway. The traffic going the other way is watching the wreck
instead of paying attention to where we're going. It's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many candidates in both parties have felt somewhat
neglected as the press focuses its energies less on electoral
politics and more on scandal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even the high-profile contests such as for governor of
California and senator from New York have drawn relatively little
attention. Contributing to the dilemma for candidates is that,
judging by the polls and by interviews with strategists, no single
issue seems to be gripping voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask about anything under the sun,'' said Rep. Adam Smith,
D-Wash. ``But no real issue is grabbing folks.''
</P>
<P>
   David Osterberg, a Democrat who is taking on Sen. Charles
Grassley of Iowa, is so frustrated by his failure to draw attention
that he is trying a new stunt: paddling across the state in a
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, a longtime Republican strategist in New Hampshire,
predicted that rather than energize voters, the Lewinsky matter
would make voters even less engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people want this whole process to go away,'' he
said. ``There's a tiredness in the electorate. They don't have the
stomach for a highly contested election season.''

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC, GOP LEADERS SEE CLINTON AT LEAST FACING CENSURE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Political pressure mounted against President
Clinton on Sunday, as
</P>
<P>
   a prominent Democrat said he should be formally censured and
Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott countered that
impeachment proceedings appear increasingly likely.
</P>
<P>
   With Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr due to report on his
investigation into the Monica Lewinsky scandal as early as this
week, Lott said that, based on what Clinton has already admitted,
it was doubtful that Congress would simply censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying that . . . that it's not a possibility, but
right now I'd say that's not likely,'' Lott, R-Miss., said on the
NBC-TV's Sunday program, ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Censure -- a formal way for Congress to register its collective
condemnation without exacting further punishment -- could be
considered ''nothing,'' by some people, said Lott. ''I don't think
that the circumstances now call for something, you know, that would
be interpreted by anybody as 'nothing.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's comments came on the heels of a Saturday announcement by
Maryland Gov. Parris N. Glendening, a Democrat, that he was
cancelling a scheduled fund-raiser with Clinton, out of fear that
the White House scandal could mar Glendening's own tough
re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton still plans to participate in
similar fund-raisers, such as events scheduled for later this month
in Florida and New York, and that Glendening's move was not part of
a trend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to say that has been an exception,'' White House
Communications Director Ann Lewis said on the CNN program, ''Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lewis, ''There's been a lot of interest in presidential
events, and that interest continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendening, who was to appear on Tuesday with Clinton at an
elementary school in a Washington suburb, denounced Clinton's
behavior in the Lewinsky matter, cancelled his Tuesday appearance
and a fund-raiser that had been set for Oct. 2, but stopped short
of prescribing punitive action against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., however, said he favored
censuring Clinton and hoped that would avert the need for a
wrenching impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who took to the Senate floor on Thursday to upbraid
Clinton for his admitted affair with Lewinsky and his seven-month
campaign to deceive the public on the matter, said censure would be
a way of ''setting up a standard of accountability, saying to the
country, to history, to our children, 'What the president did was
wrong and unacceptable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also appearing on ''Meet the Press,'' Lieberman said he hoped
''that will be the maximum we will want to do to end this sad
chapter in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats were not so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-Va., told the Fox television network's
''News Sunday'' program that the best Clinton can hope for is
censure, but he doubted the House of Representatives would stop
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''I now don't think that's really an option,'' Moran said. ''I
think we're bound to go through with impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sentiments were echoed by veteran Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have before us, and we ought to get on with it, is an
impeachment procedure,'' Moynihan said on ''This Week,'' ABC-TV's
Sunday news program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a crisis of the regime,'' said Moynihan. ''You cannot
have this kind of conduct as normal and acceptable and easily
dismissed, unless there is a great effort to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if in addition to what we know there are things we don't
know, that would make it worse,'' he said, referring to the
possibility that Starr's report could contain revelations that
further damage Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It is the role of the House, beginning with the Judiciary
Committee, to determine whether Starr's report contains allegations
that merit impeachment proceedings. If the House votes to impeach,
the Senate would try Clinton and vote on whether to remove him from
office. A two-thirds majority vote is required.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution deliberately does not spell out
impeachable offenses, stating only that presidents may be impeached
on charges of ''high crimes and misdemeanors.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders have said that it is premature to talk about
impeachment before Starr reports to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the moment we know one thing conclusively: the president
engaged in some rather significantly immoral acts,'' Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., said on the CBS television network's ''Face the
Nation'' program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not clear whether that constitutes a statutory offense
that in any way approaches the constitutional standards on
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said, however, the threshold for impeachment is high,
yet broad.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are the moral issues which are also relevant. An
impeachment process does not turn on legalities,'' Moynihan said.
''It's for being someone we don't like.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, whose criticism of Clinton has formed a rallying
point for Democrats in recent days, said he believed Clinton could
survive censure and restore to his administration the credibility
and moral authority needed to govern.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that doing so ''may be the greatest test,'' of
Clinton's career.
</P>
<P>
   ''My highest hope here is that President Clinton is able to
repair the damage that his misconduct has done and go on to end his
presidency in two and a half years honorably and effectively,''
said Lieberman. ''I'm confident he can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, however, concurred with
Lott. ``It is almost certain that a House committee is going to
consider more than one article of impeachment,'' Gramm said on
CBS's ``Face the Nation.'' ``I think we have passed the point where
we might wish this away.''
</P>
<P>
   Allegations surfaced in January that Clinton had an affair with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and later urged her to lie
about it under oath. Clinton denied both charges at the time in a
sworn statement in connection with the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit, which has since been dismissed. He also denied
both charges in an explicit statement to the American public. He
admitted on Aug. 17 to a relationship with Lewinsky that was ''not
appropriate,'' but insisted he had not counseled her to lie about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who returned late Saturday from a trip abroad, had no
public appearances on Sunday.

NORTH KOREA NAMES DECEASED LEADER TO POST OF `ETERNAL PRESIDENT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ North Korea announced Sunday that it had revised its
Constitution to make its late ``great leader,'' Kim Il Sung, the
country's ``eternal president.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting to the inconvenience of having a president who died
four years ago and is thus unable to make speeches, the Supreme
People's Assembly listened soberly to a tape recording of an
address Kim delivered in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of the announcement is that, as expected, Kim's son
Kim Jong Il _ the country's longtime ``dear leader'' _ will in
effect be head of state, based on his position as chairman of the
National Defense Commission. It is not clear whether it will matter
that North Korea does not have a living president: the country has
already functioned with a vacant presidency since Kim Il Sung died.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Kim Jong Il controls North Korea firmly
and that he could have had the presidency if he had wanted it. But
analysts cite two reasons why he may have preferred to let his late
father retain the post.
</P>
<P>
   The first is simply to show respect and filial piety to the man
who founded North Korea half a century ago and ruled it virtually
as a god until his death. Though he was often condemned as a
dictator in the West, Kim Il Sung seems to have been genuinely
revered by many North Koreans, a point that even defectors usually
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Jong Il needs his father, needs to wear his father's
jacket,'' said Han Park, a scholar of North Korea at the University
of Georgia. Park added that Kim may gradually emerge and rule more
openly on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason Kim may have been reluctant to take on the
presidency is that it would make him a far more public figure and
would oblige him to meet foreign visitors. He has always been an
intensely private figure, a man who virtually never travels or
meets with dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new Constitution, the tasks of receiving ambassadors
and representing the state for diplomatic purposes will be taken
over by the president of the presidium of the Supreme People's
Assembly, the legislature. The president of that presidium will be
Kim Yong Nam, the previous foreign minister.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kim Yong Nam is now ranked No. 2 in North Korea's hierarchy. He
is not related to Kim Jong Il; Kim is the most common Korean family
name, held by 22 percent of all Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why Kim Jong Il is so reluctant to meet
foreigners and appear in public. But a former top North Korean
official who defected to the South, Hwang Jang Yop, has said Kim
believes that he derives some charisma or power from the air of
mystery that surrounds him.
</P>
<P>
   North Koreans are expected to continue to focus their cult of
personality on the father, whose face continues to adorn the badges
worn by nearly every adult North Korean. But the son is also now
referred to as ``great leader'' in English-language statements _
although the Korean phrase used for him is different from the one
reserved for the father _ and the North Korean authorities are
hailing his rise to head of state as a major national triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The official Korean Central News Agency on Sunday described it
as ``a historic event and great jubilee of the nation which gives a
definite guarantee for certain victory in the revolutionary
struggle of the Korean people.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, for its part, urged Kim to be ``responsible'' and
to stop building up his country's armed forces at a time when many
North Koreans are starving.

<P>
   CHOR SHIBOLA, Bangladesh _ For two months, the people of this
village have been marooned on the tin roofs of their shacks,
unwilling to abandon their homesteads even as the Jamuna River
engulfed them in the longest-lasting flood in the history of this
disaster-prone country.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Harunuddin Sheik and his wife, Sufia, keep all-night
vigils to make sure their daughters, Taslima, 4, and Shujon, 2, do
not roll off the platform where they sleep and drown in the
tea-brown water that laps a few feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how God will save us,'' he said as he gestured at
the vast expanse of water surrounding his home. ``All my crops were
destroyed. Where will I get seeds to plant next year?''
</P>
<P>
   These villagers are among more than 20 million Bangladeshis
whose homes have been swamped by monsoon floods that have lasted
almost two months, twice as long as any other recorded. The waters
have inundated more than half the country, killed more than 520
people, closed many roads, damaged more than 4,000 schools, wiped
out a big chunk of the rice crop and threaten to bring deadly
diarrhea and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the prime minister, Sheik Hasina Wazed, pleaded
for international aid. So far, relief agencies and foreign donors
have pledged $82 million, but that is less than a tenth of what she
has requested in food, medicine and reconstruction of Bangladesh,
one of the poorest nations on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without help, the people will suffer,'' she said. ``At first
we thought we would be able to address this situation alone. But
the flood has stayed on for two months.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials here worry that the need to help the victims of
the epic flooding in China, the famine in the Sudan and war in the
Congo has slowed the response to Bangladesh's calamity.
</P>
<P>
   The misery is not limited to the countryside. More than half of
Dhaka, a capital of 9 million people, is flooded _ including its
landfills. With no place to dump garbage, people are throwing it
into the putrid floodwaters. And since the poor have no toilets,
the waters are soiled with their waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water is everywhere, but you can't use it for any purpose,''
said Mohammad Reazuddin, who directs the Dhaka division of the
national Department of Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Slum dwellers especially have no escape. In places the water has
turned black and thick, but people still wade through it and wash
their dishes in it and even drink it.
</P>
<P>
   Already more than 130,000 Bangladeshis have developed diarrhea,
a wasting condition spread by foul water and rotting food, and more
than 100 have died of the disease. The World Bank estimates that
3.5 million of the 125 million Bangladeshis will be afflicted with
diarrhea during the flood and its aftermath. The incidence will
increase after the floods recede because of the filthy sludge left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the International Center for Diarrheal Disease and Research,
hundreds of babies and children lie listless or squalling on cots.
Alea Begum, a widow, brought in her son, Moieen, 12, and she now
rests her hand on his bony chest. He is frighteningly still.
</P>
<P>
   This wraith of a boy, his eyes overlarge in a gaunt face, is the
family breadwinner because his father is dead. Each day he sloshed
into the floodwaters to catch fish with his bare hands. Some days
he caught nothing. On others he managed to snare enough fish to
sell for 25 taka, about 50 cents. That kept him, his mother and his
two little sisters from always going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of this disaster are in some ways as murky as the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh has had heavier than usual monsoon rains this year,
but most of the floodwater has come from the great rivers that rise
in the Himalayas, course through India, then empty into Bangladesh.
Torrential rains in Uttar Pradesh, in northern India, have
contributed to extensive flooding there, killing more than 1,000,
leaving millions homeless and swelling the Ganges as it rushes
through the Indian plains toward Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said on Sunday that the Ganges had risen past its
highest recorded level, surpassing the crest reached in 1988 when
floods killed more than 2,000 people, Agence France-Presse
reported.
</P>
<P>
   But normally the floods in Bangladesh would last just a few
weeks, then the waters would empty into the Bay of Bengal. This
year is different because the sea level is higher, trapping the
flood in low-lying Bangladesh. Stagnant waters breed mosquitoes
that swarm the streets of Dhaka, leading relief workers to fear an
outbreak of malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here say they lack the sophisticated equipment to
analyze the reasons for the higher sea level, but they offer some
possible reasons.
</P>
<P>
   They say earthquakes that shook the floor of the Indian Ocean
last month may be a factor. They also wonder whether global warming
is causing both the sea level to rise and snows to melt in greater
volume in the Himalayas, feeding the rivers that rush into
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday's full moon will keep the sea level high, but A.T.M.
Huda, the secretary of the ministry of water resources, said he
believes the waters will begin receding by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge now is to get food and medicine to people
stuck beyond the roads erased by flooding. Supplies can't be
airdropped because the waters would swallow them up. Boats are the
answer, but it will take money and organization to mobilize them,
said Julian Francis, deputy head of the delegation for the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, the victims need paid work helping to
rebuild roads, schools and hospitals so they will have the income
to buy food, rather than relying on the inefficient government to
hand it out. Studies of past famines have found that shortage of
food was less of a problem than people's inability to pay for it,
said Forrest Cookson, country representative of Development in
Democracy, a private consulting firm in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All across Bangladesh, it is apparent that urban laborers and
small farmers are unable to make a living because of the floods.
</P>
<P>
   In Gulshan, an upscale neighborhood in Dhaka that is home to
diplomats and wealthy business executives, small country boats
ferry people to their gated homes. Along the streets, the poor made
homeless by the floods have thrown up makeshift shanties, wooden
platforms covered with plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Maksuda Paul Begum lives in one shanty with three of her four
daughters. Her husband, a laborer, had gone to fetch the fourth,
who had been taken to her grandmother's to get away from the
floods. One night, the mother and her young children all crouched
in the cramped space, just three feet high, their faces illuminated
by lightning and the flickering of a kerosene lamp.
</P>
<P>
   While her husband is gone, they live on bags of rice and lentils
provided at relief centers. ``Hunger is part of life,'' she said.
When the rich drive by in their Land Rovers and Jeeps, she said,
they create waves that slosh over her platform. Her sari was
sopping wet. Her children have been sick with fever, colds and
rashes.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours' drive from Dhaka, the road disappears into the
floodwaters at Aricha, on the Jamuna River, and the only way to
Chor Shibola village is by boat.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Banu, who guesses she is 45 or 50, and her son Mohammad
Lalchan Hossain, 25, were standing on the rooftop, safe for the
moment from the chest-high water that has risen through their small
hut and destroyed the rice they had planted.
</P>
<P>
   She had to sell her family's three cows to pay for food. ``We
have no income,'' she explained. Next year, when the family needs
cows again to plow the fields, she will have to borrow the money to
replace them from a local moneylender who charges interest of 100
percent a year, potentially sinking them into a debt that could
chain them to the lender for life.
</P>
<P>
   Hossain was busy weaving a contraption of bamboo that he hopes
to use to catch shrimp that they could eat or sell. No one has
rowed out to their place to offer assistance, they said, nor are
they on the list their village officials put together for relief
supplies of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are floating on the sea here,'' said Mrs. Banu, a tall,
lean woman, as she tossed grain to the pigeons they are raising to
stave off hunger. ``No one has come to help us. They are giving the
relief to people with good houses.''

WITNESS LISTS SUGGEST STRATEGIES OF MICROSOFT, U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., Mass., Pa., N.Y., Texas, Calif., Va., N.J.)  (jw) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the filing of witness lists on Friday night, the government
and Microsoft Corp. offered the first glimpse of their courtroom
strategies in the historic antitrust trial scheduled to begin later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The government will portray Microsoft as an information-age
monopolist with anticompetitive practices that are wide-ranging and
that began long before anyone heard of the Internet. Microsoft
plans to mount its defense by putting eight top executives on the
stand, but with one conspicuous absence _ Bill Gates, Microsoft
chairman, who is not on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-person witness list for the Justice Department and 20
states suing Microsoft suggests a broadening of the evidence it
intends to marshal to make its case. Its industry witnesses include
executives from Intel Corp., IBM and Boeing Co., all of whom are
expected to offer evidence of what the plaintiffs say are Microsoft
tactics that unfairly curb competition. None were mentioned in the
complaint filed in May by the government and states.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this witness list, the government is trying to point to a
broader pattern of anticompetitive behavior over many years and to
put that long history in the record,'' said Robert Litan, a former
senior Justice Department official who is now at the Brookings
Institution. ``This is an effort to lift the court's nose out of
the details and look at the broader picture.''
</P>
<P>
   To help fill out that broader picture, the government will call
John Soyring, vice president of personal software products at IBM.
His history with Microsoft goes back nearly a decade, when he was a
manager on IBM's OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the two companies were ostensibly partners in the
operating system market with an early plan calling for Microsoft's
Windows being developed as a basic system and IBM's OS/2 evolving
into a high-performance operating system. The partnership broke up,
the two companies became rivals and Microsoft prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Another industry witness for the government is Steve McGeady, an
Intel vice president. He was present at meetings in 1995 when Gates
reportedly pressed Intel to curb its development of multimedia and
Internet software, and to limit its support for Netscape
Communications Corp., the early front-runner and Microsoft's main
rival in the market for software used to browse the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   To further broaden its evidence, the government wants to show
the court that Microsoft can pressure big companies not to purchase
software from its rivals. To provide the perspective of a big
corporate customer, the government plans to call Boeing executive
Scott Vesey.
</P>
<P>
   The other industry witnesses for the government and states
include James Barksdale, the president of Netscape, whose battle
with Microsoft in the browser market is the central focus of the
antitrust case; David Colburn, a senior vice president of America
Online Inc., and William Harris, president of Intuit Inc., the
personal finance software maker. In the America Online and Intuit
cases, the government contends that Microsoft unfairly used its
market muscle to get both companies to choose Microsoft's browser
over the Netscape offering.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department official characterized his side's witness
list as a ``Who's Who of America's technology leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft view is that the government and states'
witnesses are a ``sign that they are running away from their
original case,'' said Mark Murray, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A central accusation in the case filed in May, Murray noted, was
that Microsoft's licensing contracts with personal computer makers
were anticompetitive. The contracts, the government said, limited
personal computer makers in purchasing software from rival software
companies and denied them the freedom to select what Internet
services were featured on the desktop screens of the machines they
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the government did not call a single PC maker as a
witness,'' Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   One witness on the government's list works for a major PC maker,
IBM, but the IBM executive is expected to testify mainly about
Microsoft's tactics in the software business.
</P>
<P>
   An industry witness for Microsoft is an executive for a major
personal computer maker, John Rose, a senior vice president for
Compaq Computer Corp., who is expected to testify that his
company's contracts with Microsoft do not hinder its business.
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the Microsoft witness list is Gates, known as a
brilliant and energetic executive who is involved in every
important decision made at the company. Gates was omitted from the
witness list, Murray said, because the eight executives included
were those on the ``front lines of each of the issues raised in the
government's case; Bill Gates was not as directly involved in these
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Justice Department and states contend that Gates is the
central figure in Microsoft's strategy in the Internet software
market, and his memos and e-mail correspondence are a key part of
the evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   One person who was at the recent videotaped deposition of Gates
said that Microsoft's lawyers might have determined that putting
him on the stand could hurt them more than it helped. ``He's so
argumentative and contentious,'' this person said, ``that Gates
kind of took himself out of contention.''
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Gates not only professed to many memory
lapses but, this person said, disputed seemingly innocuous facts
like definitions of computing terms that appeared in Microsoft's
own documents. Gates, this person said, also professed not to know
the level of Microsoft's sales and profits and not to know the
share of the operating system market held by Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to industry witnesses, both sides will call economic
and technical experts. On the government side, the technology
experts include David Farber, a University of Pennsylvania computer
scientist and an Internet pioneer; Edward Felton, a computer
scientist at Princeton University, and Glenn Weadock, president of
Independent Software Inc. Its economic experts include Franklin
Fisher, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist who was a
witness for IBM in its antitrust confrontation with the government;
David Sibley, a University of Texas economist, and Frederick
Warren-Bolton, a former chief economist of the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft, its economic witness will be Richard Schmalensee,
an MIT economist, and its technical expert will be Michael
Dertouzos, director of IT's computer science laboratory.

UNIONS ARE STRIKING MORE AGGRESSIVE STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The recent strikes at Northwest Airlines, General Motors, Bell
Atlantic and US West represent the biggest surge in major walkouts
in years and, industrial relations experts say, point to a new
aggressiveness on the part of the nation's labor unions.
</P>
<P>
   For years unions were so discouraged by several disastrous
strikes, most notably the Caterpillar and the air controllers'
strikes, that they had generally shunned large-scale walkouts. And
even though union membership rolls are slipping and the slowing
economy threatens workers, unions have grown bolder, labor experts
say, because of the tight labor market, more combative union
leadership and the teamsters' gains in last year's UPS strike.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the number of strikes nationwide had fallen to its
lowest level in 50 years, 374, before rising to 394 last year. Even
before the prominent strikes of this summer, the number of work
stoppages increased this year, rising to 226 in the first six
months from 214 the first six months of last year, according to the
Bureau of National Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Even more significant for labor, striking unions have emerged
more successful than in recent years, pressuring US West, for
instance, to scale back mandatory overtime and Bell Atlantic to
stop making most new jobs nonunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this represents a more confident and aggressive labor
movement,'' said Harley Shaiken, a professor of industrial
relations at the University of California at Berkeley. ``In the
1980s, so many highly visible, pivotal strikes ended somewhere
between disaster and debacle, but what we've seen this year is a
number of important successes for unions. It might not be time to
crack out the champagne bottles, but it's probably time for a
couple of cold beers on Labor Day to celebrate what's taken
place.''
</P>
<P>
   But many business leaders assert that the recent eruption of
strikes stems not from an emboldened labor movement, but from
coincidence _ many collective bargaining agreements in industries
with volatile labor relations have expired this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a trend,'' said Patrick Cleary, vice president for
human resources policy at the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``I don't get a sense of any change in the national
Zeitgeist.''
</P>
<P>
   But one cause for the surge in strikes is that many corporations
continue to demand concessions. For instance, the 34,000 workers at
US West went on strike after the company insisted on replacing the
across-the-board pay increases that unions favor with a
pay-for-performance system, which would give management total
discretion over each worker's raises _ an idea abhorred by unions.
And the General Motors strike began after the company refused to
make good on promises to invest $300 million in a metal-stamping
plant in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these strikes show unions' willingness to fight back
more,'' said Richard Hurd, a professor of labor relations at
Cornell University. ``But it's not clear to me whether these
strikes are caused by newfound aggressiveness on the part of unions
or newfound aggressiveness on the part of employers.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the president of the American Federation of
Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations, attributes the increase
in strikes to both sides: greater labor confidence and to
management hardheadedness. He said it was understandable that
workers opt to strike when many corporations are making record
profits and union members feel they are not getting their fair
share of the expanding pie.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney called the current Northwest Airlines pilots' strike an
example of this, asserting that the airline had made a stingy offer
to its 6,200 pilots despite the company's booming profits and
soaring executive pay. But the airline maintains that it cannot
meet the pilots' demands, which management says would make them the
nation's highest-paid pilots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a complete lack of respect for workers,
for the jobs they do,'' Sweeney said in a telephone interview with
reporters. ``We're seeing so many examples of how insensitive
corporate America can be to their workers.''

 UNDATED: their workers.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor leaders also note that workers' wages are finally climbing
faster than inflation, after years of lagging behind. Despite
recent wage gains, the average worker's inflation-adjusted wages
remain 3 percent below 1989 levels.
</P>
<P>
   But they fear that the slowing economy and reeling stock market
will soon cause corporate America to clamp down on wage increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an economic slowdown or a recession, then wages
won't fully recover to where they were in 1989,'' said Lawrence
Mishel, research director of the Economic Policy Institute, a
union-backed research center.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unions' new aggressiveness and their recent strike
successes, labor is still faced with a declining membership.
</P>
<P>
   There were victories in recruitment of new members, like
organizing 19,000 passenger-service workers at United Airlines. So
far, however, labor has fallen short of the goal Sweeney set upon
becoming elected president of the AFL-CIO nearly three years ago:
to increase the labor federation's membership of 13 million by 3
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sweeney predicts that the labor movement will be
adding, not losing, members overall within a year or two largely
because unions are pumping much more money and manpower into
organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Unions now represent 14 percent of all workers, down from 35
percent in the 1950s, and Sweeney has repeatedly warned that unless
labor recruits millions of workers, it risks fading into
irrelevance and losing its bargaining clout. Under him, the AFL-CIO
has allocated $20 million a year for organizing, up from $2.5
million before he was elected.
</P>
<P>
   The federation says that unions recruited nearly 400,000 new
members last year, but nonetheless, union membership is down by
more than 200,000 since early 1996, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. The recruitment gains have been outweighed by
membership losses caused by layoffs, plant closings and other
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Organizing faces other problems. The highly publicized campaign
to unionize 20,000 strawberry workers in California has made little
headway largely because of fierce employer opposition. And the
teamsters' financial scandals and unions' tradition of holding
lavish conventions in places like Hawaii have hardly helped labor
burnish its image or woo new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're up against some pretty daunting challenges,'' said
Cleary of the manufacturers association. ``You look at where the
new jobs are _ data base administration, systems analysts _ and
unions have not had much luck penetrating those occupations. And if
you look where the job growth is geographically _ in the South and
Southwest _ these are areas where labor hasn't had great success.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Sweeney predicts that the labor movement will be
adding, not losing, members overall within a year or two largely
because unions are pumping much more money and manpower into
organizing. He boasted that eight unions had membership growth of
at least 3 percent last year, but that's a small fraction of the
70-plus unions in the federation. He also boasted that a handful of
unions, like the Service Employees International, have met his goal
of devoting 30 percent of their budget to organizing.
</P>
<P>
   But many labor experts are unimpressed. ``My assessment is that
union organizing efforts have only been modestly successful,'' said
Cornell's Hurd. ``There's not a tremendously significant movement
building for a wholehearted shift in commitment to organizing. You
can't blame Sweeney. The bottom line is decisions have to be made
by people in individual unions, and in most of those unions, hard
decisions are not being made.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania _ Investigators have arrested two more
suspects in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy here and have made
significant progress in determining how the bomb was made and taken
to the embassy, FBI and local police officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came in the same week that agents investigating the
simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, began
focusing on a Muslim businessman from the Comoros, a republic of
islands off East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The two explosions on Aug. 7 killed 258 people and wounded
thousands. Of those killed, 11 died in the blast here. Two men have
been arrested so far and charged in U.S. District Court in New York
in connection with the attacks after being deported from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, federal agents said the bombings were the work
of Al Qaeda, which they said was an international terrorist
organization financed and controlled by Osama bin Laden, a Saudi
Arabian businessman who supports militant Islamic causes.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that an arrest warrant had
been issued in New York for the Comoros businessman, known as
Abdallah Mohammed Fadhul, along with a sealed complaint against
him.
</P>
<P>
   A law-enforcement official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Sunday that there was a sealed complaint charging a new
suspect in the Kenya bombing but would not say if it was Fadhul.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is clear that FBI agents are searching for Fadhul. On
Wednesday, several U.S. agents accompanied by the Comoros police
raided two homes on the island of Moroni, searching for him. The
agents took Fadhul's wife and brother into custody for questioning
and collected evidence from the houses.
</P>
<P>
   Fadhul, who remained at large Sunday night, was reported by The
Associated Press to have been living with his wife in Sudan until
shortly after the embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   In Nairobi, law-enforcement officials who spoke on condition of
anonymity said they had determined that at least four men had been
involved with the bombing there. The two already arrested in
connection with the blast are Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed
Rashed Daoud Owhali.
</P>
<P>
   Owhali told investigators that he and another man had driven a
delivery van carrying the bomb to the embassy in Nairobi, court
papers say. He said he had thrown a small explosive device at
guards at the embassy's rear entrance just 10 seconds before the
bomb exploded, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, who has not been identified, is believed to have
died in the blast, but Owhali survived and was arrested in a
hospital, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Odeh left Nairobi on a plane to Pakistan the night
before the bombing. He has admitted to the FBI that he was a member
of the organization that planned the bombing but has denied taking
part, court papers say. Despite his statements, law-enforcement
officials say they suspect that Odeh provided logistical support to
the bombers.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators in Nairobi are also looking for a fourth man
who goes by the first name Abdallah, according to witnesses who
have been interviewed by the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   James Nganga, the manager of the Hilltop Lodge _ a seedy hotel
where Odeh and other suspects stayed in the three days before the
bombing _ said agents had searched his records for the name
Abdallah Sadiq and asked him repeatedly if he knew a man by that
name. The agents also showed him at least five pictures of people
he did not recognize, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Early last week, FBI agents detained and questioned Abdallah
Mohammed, the Nairobi manager of the Islamic charity Mercy
International. The charity, with branches in Sudan and Somalia, is
suspected to have links to bin Laden, law-enforcement officials
said. Agents have seized the organization's records, though
Mohammed was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday agents raided the homes of Abdallah Mohammed
Fahdul in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Horan, the FBI's special agent in charge of the
investigation, declined to say if Fahdul was a suspect in the case.
Nor would she comment on other aspects of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investigators here said in a news conference on
Saturday that they had determined what the bomb had been made of
and who had carried it to the embassy. But they would not give
details, saying that doing so would jeopardize the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Rajabi Adadi, Tanzania's director of criminal investigation,
told reporters that the police had two suspects and three new
witnesses in custody. He did not name them.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Piernick, head of the FBI investigators in Tanzania,
said investigators ``have made extraordinary discoveries,'' but he
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now well aware of the composition of the bomb and are
also well aware how the device was delivered and who delivered
it,'' he said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Adadi said one suspect arrested was a Tanzanian businessman and
the other was a foreigner. Adadi declined to comment on unconfirmed
local press reports that one of the suspects was a Sudanese
businessman named Amin Abdul Majid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police have some leads regarding the event,'' Adadi said.
``They know who took the device to the embassy, and they also know
some of the people responsible for the event and others whose roles
have not yet been proven.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the three witnesses in custody had all played a role in
the preparations for the bombing, though unwittingly, and were now
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers reported that one of these witnesses was Thomas
Lyimo, a well-known merchant who owns a string of milk and yogurt
outlets in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   There have been unconfirmed reports in Kenyan and Tanzanian
newspapers that the ingredients for the bombs came from the Middle
East and were transported by sea through the Comoros to Tanzania.
Reports in the Nairobi press said the explosives were taken from
Tanzania to Nairobi by truck.

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Although all-out war appears unlikely, the tens
of thousands of Iranian troops deployed in a threatening buildup
along the Afghan border have drawn attention to the hostility
between two of the world's most conservative Islamic governments.
</P>
<P>
   To some non-Muslims in the West, the bearded Shiite Muslim
clerics who govern Iran and the bearded Sunni Muslim Taliban
militants who now control most of Afghanistan may appear
indistinguishable, united by religious fervor and a shared belief
in an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   But they represent two wings of a great Islamic divide. And as
the Taliban have consolidated their hold on power, imposing a
strict vision of Islam across Afghanistan, Iranian leaders have
responded with contempt and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   They have accused the Taliban _ whose restrictions, particularly
on women, are far more rigid than those enforced in Iran _ of
giving Islam a bad name. They have provided support to the rival
Afghan militia that is the Taliban's sole remaining foe.
</P>
<P>
   And now there is the issue of the disappearance of scores of
Iranians, including at least 11 diplomats, who were caught up in
the fighting in Afghanistan last month. Iran has raised the
prospect of taking military action against the Taliban unless
reports that the Iranians were captured or killed can be quickly
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A commentary on Iranian radio on Saturday said the country had
the right ``to take all necessary action'' against the Taliban
movement under an article of the U.N. charter that guarantees a
right to self-defense. That has prompted a harsh reply from Taliban
leaders, who were quoted Sunday as saying that their followers were
prepared to spill blood to fend off any incursion.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Sunday, Arab diplomats and other experts said they
thought it unlikely that Iran really intended to mount a full-scale
invasion. They said the Iranian buildup, which began last week with
military exercises that included 70,000 troops, was almost
certainly intended as a show of muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, officials at the State and Defense Departments,
as well as intelligence analysts, said there were no new signs that
Iran was preparing an attack. ``There was apparently a skirmish on
the border, and some Afghan border guards may have been killed, but
it seems to involve drug traffickers and is not related to this
buildup,'' said one American official.
</P>
<P>
   One senior American official who monitors the region said that
if Iran did retaliate, air strikes were more likely than a major
land offensive. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Arab diplomats and other experts said that having suffered
through a long war with one neighbor, Iraq, from 1980 to 1988, Iran
probably had little appetite for becoming involved in what could be
another protracted conflict.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment appeared to be strengthened by comments
published Sunday from Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, who was reported to have told a gathering of students on
Thursday that there would be ``no confrontation with Taliban.''
</P>
<P>
   But the diplomats and experts said deep public anger in Iran
over the fate of the diplomats made any prediction risky. They said
a possible scenario remained for Iran to provide military support
for a limited attack into southwestern Afghanistan in which the
leading role would be played by several thousand exiled Afghan
fighters who have been given refuge in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed al-Sayed Said, a senior researcher at Al Ahram Center
for Strategic Studies in Cairo, said that even such a ``very
limited operation'' could serve Iran's purposes if it succeeded in
forcing the Taliban to turn their attention away from beleaguered
opponents and thus prevented the movement from consolidating its
hold over Afghanistan as a whole.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think Iran has to do anything,'' said Ahmed Rashid, a
writer on Afghan affairs who was quoted in a Reuters dispatch from
Pakistan. ``It has thousands of fighters exiled in Iran, and all it
has to do is rearm them and relaunch them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia
recognize the Taliban movement as Afghanistan's legitimate
government. The United Nations and all other members still
recognize the deposed president, Burhanuddin Rabbani. But along
with Russia, Iran has been among the most active in providing
support to militias opposed to the Taliban, according to
Tehran-based diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Although it denies the charge, the diplomats say that in the
past two years Iran has regularly used military aircraft to fly
military and other supplies to the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif,
which was a main opposition headquarters until it was captured by
Taliban forces on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   That city was also the base for the Iranian diplomats and the
journalist who have been missing since the takeover, adding to a
sense of Iranian outrage from a collapse that itself was a blow to
Iranian influence and prestige. The Taliban leader, Mullah Mohammad
Omar, has said that the diplomats are ``probably dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A report last week fom the human rights group Amnesty
International also contributed to Iranian anger. It said that
thousands of civilians were killed in the capture of the city and
that most were Shiites from Afghanistan's Hazara ethnic minority.
Because Iran sometimes portrays itself as a guardian of Shiites
worldwide, experts in the region said Sunday it may feel under some
pressure to respond with military force if it can be proved that
the Shiites were attacked for reasons of religious faith.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Iranian newspapers have debated the wisdom of a
military move against the Taliban, with hard-line conservative
publications supporting a strike and most moderate dailies
advocating self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
   With its ban on most work by women, and its prohibitions of
television, radio and most other forms of entertainment, the
Islamic regime imposed by the Taliban in Afghanistan since they
took control of the capital, Kabul, in 1996, is certainly the
world's strictest _ more so than even Saudi Arabia's.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years after they established the Iranian Republic
in 1979, Iran's revolutionary leaders took a similar pride in
rewriting what had long been accepted rules of conduct. The country
follows strict precepts of Islamic law. The rigid rules that still
govern, for example, how a woman must dress when she appears in
public, mean that Iran still ranks among the world's most
restrictive societies.
</P>
<P>
   But most revolutionary passions have mellowed in Iran over the
last two decades, and some social restrictions have been
considerably eased, to the extent that Iranian officials now point
to the Taliban as an example of misguided religious excess.

   MOSCOW _ On the night before Russia's parliament was to vote
again on whether he becomes prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin
warned on national television Sunday that the nation has entered a
fiscal nosedive and that further political squabbling could lead to
social chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin also said the economic situation was so dire that
``no classical anti-crisis measures apply,'' an assessment that
seemed crafted to defend seemingly contradictory parts of a fiscal
platform he outlined on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already gone into such a tailspin that straightforward
methods will not provide us with a way out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His platform calls for printing billions of rubles to pay years
of unpaid wages and pensions and to save failing banks, followed
only months later by strict controls on the printing of money and
renewed efforts to streamline the tax system and cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics quickly called the program a party-now, pay-later
solution to Russia's problems and warned that it could lead to
hyperinflation. By one measure, hyperinflation has already arrived:
the ruble was trading at nearly 19 to the dollar at some Moscow
shops on Sunday, nearly two rubles above Friday's rate and more
than three times the rate just a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's 90-minute appearance on an evening news interview
program was timed to have the most influence on the lower house of
the parliament, the Duma, which is scheduled to vote on
Chernomyrdin's nomination Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma decisively rejected the nomination last Monday, with
the dominant Communist Party joining reformers and nationalists in
dooming Chernomyrdin. The Communists in particular want a greater
say in the new government, including the choice of at least three
Cabinet ministers and a hand in setting economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Chernomyrdin and the acting deputy prime
minister, Boris Fyodorov, fleshed out parts of the economic
platform that they had described in general terms on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said the government intends to print money to
partially compensate civil servants, soldiers and defense workers
for billions of rubles in wages and pensions that have gone unpaid
in recent years. The size and timing of those payments were left
unclear, but Chernomyrdin said they would not be indexed for
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the government intends to double the gold and
hard-currency reserves in the Central Bank _ bringing them roughly
back to their level at mid-summer _ as part of an effort to
integrate Russia into the world financial system.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he intends to propose a 50 percent cut in the
profits tax as a way to stimulate business activity. ``The profit
tax should be halved immediately,'' he said. ``The taxation system
should be simplified and, simultaneously, tax collection seriously
improved.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate television appearance, Fyodorov said the
government should again make the U.S. dollar legal tender in
Russia, a status it enjoyed following the collapse of Communism.
The proposal would tie the value of the ruble to the dollar, much
as in so-called currency boards that have been employed to curb
inflation in countries such as Argentina and Bulgaria.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No one knows for certain, but by almost every estimate there are
far more dollars than rubles in Russia, mostly salted away in
households and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said by legalizing the dollar ``all that money
currently stored under mattresses will come into circulation and be
freely exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to acknowledge that there is a second money supply in
Russia,'' Fyodorov said. ``Under the system we are proposing today,
if anyone wants to pay in dollars, let him do so. But if someone
does not want to accept rubles, it cannot be allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his television appearance, Chernomyrdin said it was most
important to move quickly to select a new leader for the country
before inflation and economic collapse lead to social disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can anyone imagine a factory of whatever size operating
without a leader, without clear instructions for two weeks?'' he
asked. ``Here we have Russia, an entire country, with no leader for
two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Further delay, he said, risks a revolt that would ``wipe away
everyone, wipe the power that exists today. And then someone would
want to enter the Kremlin on a white horse. This should not be
permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Should the Duma reject Chernomyrdin again on Monday, his
nomination would be entitled to one more vote, after which
President Boris Yeltsin would be free to dissolve the parliament.
It was reported Sunday that the Communists' leader in the Duma,
Gennadi Zyuganov, had prepared a list of five men acceptable to his
party as nominees for prime minister _ a list topped by the mayor
of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some doubt over whether that roster will be needed.
Chernomyrdin's prospects brightened late Friday when the upper
house of parliament, the Federation Council, voted overwhelmingly
to support his nomination. And on Sunday the leader of the
ultranationalist Liberal Democrats, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, said he
was certain that Chernomyrdin would win approval either on Monday
or in the third vote.
</P>
<P>
   All but one Liberal Democrat abstained from the first vote, but
Zhirinovsky said his bloc, the third-largest in the Duma, would
support Chernomyrdin on Monday. Most members of the fourth-largest
bloc, the reform-minded Yabloko Party, are expected to vote against
Chernomyrdin on the grounds that his program is not strong enough
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Yabloko's leader, the Duma legislator Grigory Yavlinsky,
declined to say whether he thought Chernomyrdin would be confirmed.
``In Russia, only an idiot would make predictions,'' he said.

<P>
   In Baltimore this summer, prospective special-education teachers
were in such demand that they were offered more money than the
union contract requires: those with just a year's experience got
the starting salaries of four-year veterans _ the equivalent of a
$2,000 raise before ever putting chalk to blackboard. And like
applicants in all other subject areas, they were also entitled to
reduced-rate mortgages and low-interest $1,500 loans for
relocation.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, teaching candidates will soon be able to
compete for an even bigger windfall: Acting Gov. Argeo Paul
Cellucci signed a law last month establishing $20,000 signing
bonuses for nearly 200 of the most promising rookie teachers who
apply to work in the commonwealth's schools next year.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a new law curtailing bilingual education, California
districts remain so desperate for teachers who speak languages like
Spanish and Vietnamese that some are offering bonuses of up to
$5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Long accustomed to being supplicants in the labor force,
candidates for public-school teaching jobs _ especially in special
education, math and science _ are being put in the decidedly
unfamiliar position of being wooed with financial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   In making those overtures, recruiters from even the smallest
districts have logged thousands of miles in the spring and summer,
with those from teacher-needy states like Nevada and Alaska
canvassing universities in upstate New York, Montana and Iowa,
where there are far more rookie teachers than available jobs.
</P>
<P>
   New York City recruiters, frustrated in their search for
qualified math and science teachers, looked as far as Austria,
where they hired 23 instructors eager to escape widespread teacher
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Even substitute teachers, the second-class citizens on so many
faculties, have found themselves in demand: so depleted are the
ranks of substitutes in Kentucky that the state has allowed some
districts to hire those with only high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past,'' said Marcia Brown, the director of personnel
administration for the El Paso Independent School District in
Texas, ``what this school district has had to offer has been enough
to attract teachers: the climate, good sound programs and a safe
working environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now,'' she said, ``because every district across this
country is running short, especially in the high-need areas, the
competition is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Outbid countless times this past year by districts in Dallas and
Fort Worth, which offered signing bonuses of $500 to $2,000 to
hundreds of teaching candidates who committed virtually on the
spot, El Paso has decided to join the fray. Beginning later this
fall, new math teachers hired in El Paso will have their $25,012
starting salaries increased by $2,000 bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeting the current market are rising enrollments _ the
schools in Las Vegas have had to hire 2,000 new teachers over each
of the last two summers, largely to accommodate an influx of 20,000
new students _ as well as a drought of college graduates choosing
teaching careers, especially in math and science.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on districts is building as total public and
private school enrollment is expected to reach a record 52.7
million this fall, which the Department of Education says would
exceed the record high last fall by 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the competition promises only to get fiercer. The department
expects new enrollment records to be set for at least the next
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Public school rolls are expected to grow by 4 percent over the
next decade, to 48.3 million from 46.4 million, as hundreds of
thousands of teachers hired in the late 1960s and early 1970s
retire.
</P>
<P>
   While education experts say that signing bonuses and other perks
signal a new respect for teachers in some quarters, they say they
worry that such measures will amount to little more than a Band-Aid
on a profession that is in danger of hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, as districts around the country seek to fill
vacancies even after schools have opened for the year, they say the
best they can offer are virtual carrots. Yet they say they have
learned that even the most modest of gestures can cinch a
candidate's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lasheaka Timmons, 23, who graduated last spring with a degree in
secondary education and social studies from the University of
Arizona, was offered a job teaching a continent away at West
Baltimore Middle School, through Teach for America, which places
rookie teachers in urban districts. But Ms. Timmons said she would
have had to turn down the job, and work instead in Phoenix, without
the $1,200 loan to cover moving expenses that school officials
offered her through the municipal workers' credit union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Timmons is to pay back the loan at a rate of 13 percent _
better than that offered by most credit card companies _ through
weekly deductions from her paycheck over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just out of college, unless you come from a background where
your parents can afford to help you, especially coming from
Arizona, you wouldn't be able to relocate,'' she said. ``It
definitely makes you feel they want you.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore officials say that such perks, as well as mortgage
loans that are discounted by one-eighth to one-quarter of a point,
provided the teachers settle within the city limits, have been
mentioned as critical enticements by several dozen of the more than
700 teachers hired over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Baltimore schools opened last week, the district had
been unable to fill nearly 100 vacancies, especially for
special-education and elementary school teachers, needed to reduce
class size, and officials said they were still hiring. ``If you
could slant your story that way,'' Albrie Love Jr., personnel
director for the Baltimore schools, told a reporter, ``I would
appreciate it.''

</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, where 59 percent of teaching applicants failed
an entrance examination last spring, officials said they hoped to
use the $20,000 bonuses, spread over the first four years of a
teacher's career, to entice 175 of ``the best and the brightest''
into the profession each year. Under the program, up to 300
high-performing veteran teachers would receive bonuses of $50,000
divided over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Kathleen Kelley, president of the Massachusetts Federation
of Teachers, said it would take far more than bonuses to elevate
the working conditions for teachers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects so few people,'' Ms. Kelley said. ``It's a drop in
the bucket, and it doesn't take a systemic look at the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lupe Cruz, a bilingual education teacher in California with more
than a decade's experience, said she ranked the reputation of the
superintendent and his sense of teamwork as her top priorities in
choosing this summer to move from a nearby district to the Alum
Rock Union Elementary School district in East San Jose. Of no
weight, she said, was the $1,000 signing bonus that she received
for being a certified bilingual education teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she says that she intends to spend the bonus money on
her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's $1,000 when you look at it,'' she said. ``It's not
going to pay for a major vacation.''

ADAMS SAYS HE CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT IRA WILL AGREE TO DISARM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Gerry Adams, the leader of the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army, said Sunday that he could not
guarantee that the IRA would agree to disarm during the
negotiations in the new Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA said last week, timing its statement for President
Clinton's three-day visit to Ireland, that although it found the
new Northern Ireland peace agreement a ``significant development,''
it had no plans to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament will be a major hurdle for the Assembly, a mixture
of Roman Catholic and Protestant politicians. The Assembly is
charged with putting in effect the accord that was approved by
leaders in April and then overwhelmingly approved by voters in the
mostly Protestant British province of Northern Ireland and here in
the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line statement Sunday from Adams, president of Sinn
Fein, contrasted with his remarks on the eve of Clinton's visit,
when he emphasized that the sectarian warfare was a thing of the
past. But many politicians noted that he had stopped well short of
saying that the IRA would never use violence again.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie
Ahern of Ireland praised his statement last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday Adams returned to the intransigent position of the
IRA on disarmament, which has been that it is a matter for the IRA
alone to decide. The IRA has an estimated 100 tons of machine guns,
mortars and Semtex explosive. The outlawed overwhelmingly Catholic
organization has been observing a cease-fire for 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   Disarmament is likely to delay the work of the Assembly, even
though Adams is expected to meet this week for the first time with
David Trimble, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party and
First Minister of the Assembly. Until now Trimble has declined to
talk directly with Adams, saying he doubts that Sinn Fein and the
IRA are serious about working for a lasting peace settlement. The
sectarian warfare has killed more than 3,200 people in Northern
Ireland in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as Adams stuck to the IRA hard line, Trimble made
comments that appeared to soften his position, slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, in an interview with Irish national radio, said Sinn
Fein's chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, would discuss the issue
with the disarmament commission created in the April agreement, but
that this did not mean that there would be disarmament. Most
politicians involved in the peace effort, and most people in the
North and in the Irish Republic, believe that Sinn Fein represents
the IRA at the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek to use our influence to bring about
disarmament,'' Adams said. ``None of us have the ability to compel
those who have weapons to hand them over.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams also scoffed at the significance of whether he and Trimble
would perform a symbolic handshake at their expected meeting in
Belfast, the northern capital. He said the handshake issue had been
encouraged by Trimble and emphasized by reporters and commentators.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble is highly unlikely to shake hands, because that would
make him vulnerable to attack by hard-liners in his own party and
in the Democratic Unionist Party of the Rev. Ian Paisley. If
dissent grew among Assembly Protestants, the work of the Assembly
would be thwarted.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble sounded unusually positive Sunday about the
prospects for an eventual IRA disarmament. In an interview with
David Frost on the BBC, he said that the appointment of McGuinness
to talk with the disarmament panel, ``put the republican movement
on a conveyor belt which will lead to actual decommissioning,'' as
disarmament is called.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Trimble added, ``it will be very clear very quickly that
they are refusing, in which case the other parties will draw the
appropriate conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a conclusion could lead to an effort to expel Sinn Fein
from the Assembly, which would almost certainly lead to a
resumption of IRA violence.

<P>
   Among the congressional and gubernatorial races to watch in
November's midterm elections:
</P>
<P>
   Senate:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 55, Democrats 45.
</P>
<P>
   Seats at stake: 16 Republican; 18 Democrats; 5 open (three are
Democrats and two are Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   To invoke cloture you need three-fifths of the Senate
membership, or 60 votes.
</P>
<P>
   California - Barbara Boxer (D), incumbent, vs. state Treasurer
Matt Fong (R):
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Boxer is a prodigious fund raiser, she finds herself
in an unexpectedly tight race against Fong, whose moderate stands
on most issues and ties to the Asian-American community could make
him formidable. Ms. Boxer is seeking her second term.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina - Ernest Hollings (D), incumbent. vs. Rep. Bob
Inglis (R):
</P>
<P>
   After five terms Hollings is facing a vigorous challenge in what
has become a solid Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois - Carol Moseley-Braun (D), incumbent, vs. state Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald (R):
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun has tried to deflect her personal
controversies by underscoring Fitzgerald's staunchly conservative
record. But he is wealthy and has launched a massive advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada - Harry Reid (D), incumbent, vs. Rep. John Ensign (R):
</P>
<P>
   Reid's advantage as the incumbent may not be as valuable because
of a huge influx of new voters into the state and because Ensign is
grabbing some of the senator's support from casino interests.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky - Democrat Wendell Ford is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scotty Baesler (D) vs. Rep. Jim Bunning (R):
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a bruising contest and Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
has staked his reputation on electing Bunning from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina - Lauch Faircloth, (R) incumbent, vs. John
Edwards (D):
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth is considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable
incumbents and he faces a tough fight from Edwards, a wealthy
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   New York - Alphonse D'Amato (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary:
</P>
<P>
   National Democrats would love to oust D'Amato, and a hard-fought
battle is expected from whoever wins the primary: Geraldine
Ferraro, Rep. Charles Schumer or Mark Green, the New York City
public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   House:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 228, Democrats 206, 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   All seats are up for re-election
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are 34 departures _ 24 retirements and 10 running
for other office.
</P>
<P>
   Governors:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 32, Democrats 17, 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Seats at stake: 24 Republicans; 11 Democrats; 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 incumbent Republican governors seeking re-election;
six are retiring. Six incumbent Democratic governors are seeking
re-election, and five are retiring or are barred by state law from
seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   California - Republican Gov. Pete Wilson is barred from seeking
a third term. Attorney General Dan Lungren (R) faces Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis (D).
</P>
<P>
   While neither candidate is known as a scintillating campaigner,
this is the marquee race of them all because of the state's size
and political importance.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia - Democratic Gov. Zell Miller is retiring. State Rep.
Roy Barnes (D) faces Guy Millner (R).
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is a conservative, anti-abortion Democrat and Millner is
expected to make education a top issue and to far outspend the
Democrats even though both candidates are wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama - Fob James (R), incumbent, vs. Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman
(D):
</P>
<P>
   After a bruising primary where he was painted as a candidate of
the far right, James has to repair his image and is expected to
portray the moderate Siegelman as too liberal for the state.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico - Gary Johnson, (R), incumbent, vs. Martin Chavez
(D):
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say this represents one of their best chances to knock
off a Republican; Johnson is a relative newcomer to politics and
Chavez is considered a dynamic moderate Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois - Republican Gov. Jim Edgar is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glenn Poshard (D) vs. Secretary of State George Ryan (R):
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are worried because Poshard is so conservative that he
has alienated many in his party, and because Ryan is expected to
far outspend him.
</P>
<P>
   Other important races where there is still a primary:
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii - Benjamin Cayetano (D), incumbent, vs. the winner of the
Sept. 19 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland - Parris Glendening (D), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island - Lincoln Almond, (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts - Paul Cellucci (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota - Republican Gov. Arne Carlson is retiring. Both
parties have their primary on Sept. 15. The Democratic candidates
include Ted Mondale, Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III, Mike
Freeman, Mark Dayton and Doug Johnson. The Republican nominee is
likely to be St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman.

MEMO TO FANS: GENEROSITY COULD HAVE DIRE CONSEQUENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ If a fan catches the ball that breaks baseball's
home run record and generously gives it to the slugger, it could be
more than a great baseball event. It could be the taxable event of
a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Fans attending games featuring Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa might
want to buy extra tickets for their accountants. According to the
Internal Revenue Service, the bleacher bum who paid $6 to $10 for a
ticket _ not the multimillionaire slugger _ could owe federal gift
tax. For a fan giving a million-dollar ball to McGwire or Sosa, the
federal tax could reach $150,000 or more. And states also have gift
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The person receiving a gift owes no tax.
</P>
<P>
   The gift tax applies to ``any property'' worth $10,000 or more,
according to IRS regulations. It makes no difference under the tax
code whether the gift is cash, a diamond necklace or a
record-setting baseball. The tax is computed on the fair market
value of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the new, customer-friendly IRS has
the chutzpah to try to collect the tax from, say, a 12-year-old
baseball fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can confirm your understanding of how the gift tax works,''
an IRS spokesman, Steven J. Pyrek, said Sunday. ``The giver of the
gift is required to file the gift tax return. We'd have to take a
look at all the circumstances: the value of the gift and who owns
the baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   A ball that breaks Roger Maris' record of 61 homers could fetch
$1 million or more, sports collectors say. Already a donor who
asked to remain anonymous has offered to pay $1 million for the
ball to publicize the cause of three American nuns and a lay worker
who were murdered in El Salvador in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is the property of major-league baseball until it
leaves the field. Then whoever catches it owns it. The tax
permutations are more complicated than figuring a slugging
percentage, but tax experts lay out several options:
</P>
<P>
   _ If the fan keeps the ball, the fan owes no tax now. But the
ball would become part of the fan's estate, taxable after death.
</P>
<P>
   _ The only way to avoid tax entirely is to give the ball to a
charity. Any charity could then sell the ball for a profit, which
would not be taxed.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the fan sells the ball, the fan owes tax on the profit,
just as the seller of any property would. The transaction would put
the fan in the highest tax bracket, with 39.6 percent due. The tax
on a million-dollar ball would be $396,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a taxable event when the fan catches the ball, but it
is if he sells the ball or gives it away,'' said Philip J. Benoit,
a certified public accountant with Weikart Tax Associates in
Manhattan. ``If a fan catches a ball, it's worth what the market
will pay at auction. You'd probably want to get three appraisals.''
</P>
<P>
   A fan who wants to sell the ball would be wise to keep it for at
least a year. Then it becomes a long-term capital asset, subject to
the maximum capital-gains tax rate on collectibles of 28 percent,
or $280,000 on $1 million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the fan gives the ball to the player or the baseball team,
the gift tax is triggered. But the tax would probably not cost the
fan money unless the ball had a value of at least $625,000. Any tax
on a gift up to $625,000 would probably be wiped out by the IRS's
unified credit. That lifetime credit allows every person to
transfer that amount _ either while alive or after death _ free of
estate and gift taxes. But it's a pay now or pay later situation: a
person who uses part of the unified credit for a gift has less of
the credit left to reduce estate taxes after death, according to
the IRS instructions for Form 709, the gift tax return.
</P>
<P>
   Anything beyond $625,000 would be taxed at a rate of at least 40
percent. So a person giving away a ball worth $1 million would owe
at least 40 percent of the remaining $375,000, or a tax of
$150,000.
</P>
<P>
   People often avoid gift taxes by not filing the gift tax return.
In the case of the Maris chase, however, it would be quite a trick
for the fan who catches the ball to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRS looks at a transaction when we look at the tax
return,'' said Pyrek, the IRS spokesman. ``The returns are selected
for audit based on a mathematical formula, not on what we see on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't the fan and the player make a deal to have the player
pay the gift tax?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the player pays your gift tax for you, then you'll have to
pay income tax on the gift tax you received,'' said Lawrence A.
Frolik, who teaches tax law at the University of Pittsburgh School
of Law.
</P>
<P>
   If the fan gives the ball to a spouse, no tax is due, because
the tax code allows unlimited gifts between spouses. Also not taxed
are the first $10,000 in gifts to anyone else during a calendar
year, gifts to charities or political organizations, or tuition or
medical expenses paid for someone.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire and Sosa have said they would not pay for a baseball.
``I'm a baseball player,'' Sosa said, ``not a baseball fan.''
McGwire has warned, ``I wouldn't pay a dime for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players, however, have said they would accept the ball if a
fan gave it to them. Deni Allen, 22, who caught McGwire's 60th home
run on Saturday in St. Louis, gave him the ball in exchange for a
round of batting practice and a few season tickets. Allen will have
to file Form 709 if the value of the 60th ball is determined to be
worth $10,000 more than the value of what he received.
</P>
<P>
   Many baseball fans would love to see the ball displayed at the
National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.,
where Maris' home run ball resides. Gifts to the Hall of Fame are
not taxed. And the Hall gives any donor a lifetime pass, a
certificate and a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A person who wants to give the ball to the player could ask the
IRS to view the gift as a charitable donation, especially if the
ball ended up in Cooperstown. Such a private-letter ruling was
granted in 1995 to the Kansas City Royals, when the team owner,
Ewing Kauffman, gave the entire team to a community foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar amounts are far beyond 1961, when 19-year-old Sal
Durante of Brooklyn caught Maris' 61st home run in the right-field
bleachers at Yankee Stadium. He offered it to Maris, who turned it
down. Durante sold the ball for a taxable $5,000 _ that's $27,200
in 1998 dollars _ to a restaurant owner, who eventually gave it to
Maris, who sent it to Cooperstown. It's not known if the restaurant
owner filed a gift tax return. Durante is now a bus driver and
grandfather living on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be Durantes are prepared. In the last row of the
left-field bleachers at Wednesday's game in Chicago while Sosa
batted, a fan held a scorecard in one hand and wore a baseball
glove on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already talked with my tax attorney,'' said the fan, who
did not give his name. ``He said to catch it and send it to
Cooperstown for the charitable deduction.''

CASHING IN ON A PROGRAMMING TREND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: Also moved in `f' category) 
(lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention HBO, and most people think adult thoughts. The pay-cable
network is best known for sophisticated movies, R-rated comedy and
big-time boxing, with the occasional provocative documentary thrown
in. The words ``family fare'' definitely do not come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   But having seen how rapidly the market for family programming is
expanding, HBO is now leaping into that world, too, with a 24-hour,
commercial-free supplementary cable channel called HBO Family,
which the company is busily preparing for a February debut.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which is owned by Time Warner, has done some family
programming in the past, ranging from serious documentaries like
``Smoke Alarm: The Unfiltered Truth About Cigarettes'' and ``Faces
of Addiction'' to quirky children's shows like ``Fraggle Rock'' and
``Little Lulu.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it was sporadic, and not perceived as a real attribute of
our service,'' said Sheila Nevins, HBO's senior vice president of
original programming. ``Now we've decided to go into family
programming in a big way.''
</P>
<P>
   In competitive terms, HBO may already be a little late. HBO
Family is being developed at the same time as several other new
family-oriented cable services, including the completely revamped
Fox Family Channel, begun last month; Noggin, a co-venture of
Nickelodeon and the Children's Television Workshop, due in January;
and a channel still in development by Hallmark Entertainment, Jim
Henson Co. and the Odyssey network.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Paxnet, a new broadcast network of 95 UHF stations,
started last Monday, with its schedule completely devoted to family
shows, mostly reruns of series like ``Touched by an Angel,''
``Eight Is Enough,'' ``Bonanza'' and the ``Father Dowling Mystery
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all of these start-ups, the new HBO effort is intended to
catch the wave of demand that has helped Nickelodeon become second
only to ESPN as the most profitable network in cable television and
has enabled the Disney Channel to raise its ratings 34 percent and
expand its subscriber base 56 percent _ to 41.8 million households
_ in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's an overcrowded marketplace,'' Ms. Nevins said.
``We will be distinctly different. We understand the competition,
and we think there's room for one more.''
</P>
<P>
   She also sees an opportunity for HBO to make money from this
venture. New programming that the network develops can be sold in
the international marketplace, where demand for well-produced
children's shows is high. She would not discuss financing, but an
HBO executive who spoke on condition of anonymity said HBO would
invest about $18 million in programming for the new channel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nevins said the new channel, like HBO itself, would be free
of commercials (unlike Nickelodeon, Fox Family Channel or the
broadcast networks) and of shows designed with the selling of toys
or other products in mind (like Fox's ``Power Rangers'' and
``Spiderman'' or WB's ``Men in Black'').
</P>
<P>
   ``And it will have the HBO edge,'' she said, describing it as
``slightly sarcastic but not anti-parent, like Nickelodeon,'' and
``educational but not as heavy-handed as some shows on PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan promoting it, matching the network's initials, is
``Honest, Brainy, Outrageous.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The channel will have a combination of original programming
(some for very young children, some for older children), some shows
based on traditional children's books, like ``Babar,'' and PG-rated
movies from HBO's vaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to differentiate ourselves as not just being a
kiddie channel,'' said Ms. Nevins' colleague, David Baldwin, senior
vice president of program planning. ``And many of our subscribers
still perceive HBO to be a movie network, and we want to use that
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the channel would have preschool programming in the
morning, movies or children's specials from noon until 4 p.m.,
educational game shows for older children in the later afternoon,
and family movies at night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nevins said she hoped the children's shows would set HBO
Family apart from the competition. For preschoolers, she said: ``We
wanted something that wasn't furry animals getting all
snuggly-wuggly and saying `Let's all cooperate' or `What can we do
on this nice rainy day?' We thought the best thing is to go back to
pots and pans and all those ordinary things that kids really love
to play with _ a mop or a pail or a pencil.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is ``A Little Curious,'' a preschool show co-produced
by John Hoffman of HBO and Curious Pictures, creators of
``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Characters named Bob the Ball, Mr. String, Mop, Doris the Door
and Pad and Pencil (a sultry pair of lovebirds who sound like
Morticia and Gomez in ``The Addams Family'') all cavort in three
different video forms _ traditional hand-drawn animation, computer
animation and puppets. Each show teaches two or three basic
concepts, like the difference between ``slippery'' and ``sticky''
or ``near'' and ``far.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the other series for younger children are being
developed with one of three top children's production studios
(Nelvana, Cinar and Hit Entertainment), and include ``George and
Martha,'' ``The Adventures of Paddington Bear,'' ``Anthony Ant,''
``Pippi Longstocking'' and ``The Country Mouse and the City Mouse
Adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   The older children's offerings include a program called
``Crashbox,'' which will feature game shows about historical
figures, math, vocabulary, animals and ecological topics, all
linked to World Wide Web sites where viewers can actually play the
games and get responses.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Morris, the HBO Family vice president supervising the
older children's programs, is especially proud of ``30x30: Kid
Flicks,'' which is a half-hour series featuring films or ``video
diaries'' made by children, ages 8 to 18, and discovered in various
school, museum or community-center film programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say we're putting the edge back in education,'' Ms.
Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   HBO subscribers will be able to get HBO Family at no additional
charge _ if their cable systems have enough capacity to carry it
and choose to offer it.

<P>
   Among the congressional and gubernatorial races to watch in
November's midterm elections:
</P>
<P>
   Senate:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 55, Democrats 45.
</P>
<P>
   Seats at stake: 16 Republican; 18 Democrats; 5 open (three are
Democrats and two are Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   To invoke cloture you need three-fifths of the Senate
membership, or 60 votes.
</P>
<P>
   California - Barbara Boxer (D), incumbent, vs. state Treasurer
Matt Fong (R):
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Boxer is a prodigious fund raiser, she finds herself
in an unexpectedly tight race against Fong, whose moderate stands
on most issues and ties to the Asian-American community could make
him formidable. Ms. Boxer is seeking her second term.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina - Ernest Hollings (D), incumbent. vs. Rep. Bob
Inglis (R):
</P>
<P>
   After five terms Hollings is facing a vigorous challenge in what
has become a solid Republican state.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois - Carol Moseley-Braun (D), incumbent, vs. state Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald (R):
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moseley-Braun has tried to deflect her personal
controversies by underscoring Fitzgerald's staunchly conservative
record. But he is wealthy and has launched a massive advertising
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada - Harry Reid (D), incumbent, vs. Rep. John Ensign (R):
</P>
<P>
   Reid's advantage as the incumbent may not be as valuable because
of a huge influx of new voters into the state and because Ensign is
grabbing some of the senator's support from casino interests.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky - Democrat Wendell Ford is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Scotty Baesler (D) vs. Rep. Jim Bunning (R):
</P>
<P>
   This promises to be a bruising contest and Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee,
has staked his reputation on electing Bunning from his home state.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina - Lauch Faircloth, (R) incumbent, vs. John
Edwards (D):
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth is considered one of the Senate's most vulnerable
incumbents and he faces a tough fight from Edwards, a wealthy
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   New York - Alphonse D'Amato (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary:
</P>
<P>
   National Democrats would love to oust D'Amato, and a hard-fought
battle is expected from whoever wins the primary: Geraldine
Ferraro, Rep. Charles Schumer or Mark Green, the New York City
public advocate.
</P>
<P>
   House:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 228, Democrats 206, 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   All seats are up for re-election
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are 34 departures _ 24 retirements and 10 running
for other office.
</P>
<P>
   Governors:
</P>
<P>
   Current Lineup: Republicans 32, Democrats 17, 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Seats at stake: 24 Republicans; 11 Democrats; 1 Independent.
</P>
<P>
   There are 18 incumbent Republican governors seeking re-election;
six are retiring. Six incumbent Democratic governors are seeking
re-election, and five are retiring or are barred by state law from
seeking another term.
</P>
<P>
   California - Republican Gov. Pete Wilson is barred from seeking
a third term. Attorney General Dan Lungren (R) faces Lt. Gov. Gray
Davis (D).
</P>
<P>
   While neither candidate is known as a scintillating campaigner,
this is the marquee race of them all because of the state's size
and political importance.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia - Democratic Gov. Zell Miller is retiring. State Rep.
Roy Barnes (D) faces Guy Millner (R).
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is a conservative, anti-abortion Democrat and Millner is
expected to make education a top issue and to far outspend the
Democrats even though both candidates are wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama - Fob James (R), incumbent, vs. Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman
(D):
</P>
<P>
   After a bruising primary where he was painted as a candidate of
the far right, James has to repair his image and is expected to
portray the moderate Siegelman as too liberal for the state.
</P>
<P>
   New Mexico - Gary Johnson, (R), incumbent, vs. Martin Chavez
(D):
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say this represents one of their best chances to knock
off a Republican; Johnson is a relative newcomer to politics and
Chavez is considered a dynamic moderate Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois - Republican Gov. Jim Edgar is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glenn Poshard (D) vs. Secretary of State George Ryan (R):
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are worried because Poshard is so conservative that he
has alienated many in his party, and because Ryan is expected to
far outspend him.
</P>
<P>
   Other important races where there is still a primary:
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii - Benjamin Cayetano (D), incumbent, vs. the winner of the
Sept. 19 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland - Parris Glendening (D), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island - Lincoln Almond, (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts - Paul Cellucci (R), incumbent, vs. the winner of
the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota - Republican Gov. Arne Carlson is retiring. Both
parties have their primary on Sept. 15. The Democratic candidates
include Ted Mondale, Attorney General Hubert Humphrey III, Mike
Freeman, Mark Dayton and Doug Johnson. The Republican nominee is
likely to be St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman.

   BOSTON _ As they take to the trail this Labor Day for the
traditional opening of the fall campaigns, Republican and
Democratic candidates say the Lewinsky matter, a jittery stock
market and tumult abroad have thrust them into the most unsettled,
and unpredictable, election season in years.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty has already altered the calculations of
Republicans, who say they have the most to gain, particularly from
President Clinton's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Newly emboldened, Republican officials have revised their
earlier predictions of modest gains and now say the party could
capture more than a dozen additional seats in the House and,
perhaps, even pick up five seats in the Senate. That would hand
Republicans the magic 60 votes needed to cut off a filibuster when
Democrats try to block a vote.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Democrats find themselves on the defensive, and
party leaders are lowering their expectations; most have stopped
brazenly forecasting that they will retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so much better than a couple months ago,'' said Brent
Siegrist, the Republican leader of the Iowa House. ``I do think
Clinton's troubles help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans now have the slimmest House majority held
by any party in the last half century, few Democratic leaders are
upbeat about their party's prospects for retaking the House, and
some party candidates are distancing themselves from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running my own race _ and I don't plan on running any
events with him,'' said Ken Lucas, a Democrat who is locked in a
tight House race in Kentucky. The latest Democrat to spurn Clinton
is Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, who said he ``will not pursue
the attendance of the president'' as planned for a fund-raising
event next month.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Boston, at the annual meeting of the American Political
Science Association, the corridor chatter among academics was not
about political theory but fresh gossip about the Lewinsky
investigation and how it would play out on Election Day. Perhaps a
telling piece of evidence was that among the hundreds of academic
papers presented, the association ran out of copies for one in
particular demand: ``Compassion, Political Trust and Public
Opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said the ``formless uncertainty''
in the electorate may be welcome news for Republicans trying to
maintain their 11-seat majority in the House. He suggested that
voters may want to keep GOP control of Congress as a check on the
turbulence in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, what people want is stability in our government,
which I think bodes well for incumbents,'' McDermott said. ``I wish
they wanted to throw out the Republican majority and bring in
Democrats, but I think the uncertainty fosters the stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter participation in the statewide primaries this year has
been the lowest on record, which suggests that turnout in November
could be the lowest in history, according to a study by Curtis
Gans, director of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate. He and other experts said that could bode well for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Their hope is that while Democrats will be uninterested,
Republicans will be energized by Clinton's troubles and will
eagerly head to the polls to vote against his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like '94, where we had a bump up out of
anger,'' Gans said. ``What you have at this point is disengagement
but not profound anger _ except on the Republican right.'' If
conservative voters are motivated by their anger at Clinton, he
said, that would give Republicans an edge in close contests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the theories about depressed Democratic turnout and
an excited Republican electorate, polls thus far have not shown any
major upheaval in how people expect to vote or broad disaffection
with the Democratic Party. Despite signs that Clinton's personal
approval is eroding, his job approval rating remains impressive.
And despite Democrats' complaints that the Lewinsky debacle is
crowding out their attempts to talk about issues, there is no
statistical evidence that Clinton is dragging down Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the sense of a changed electoral landscape in
both the Republican and Democratic parties is founded on anecdotal
evidence. Two weeks ago, Stuart Rothenberg, an independent
political analyst, predicted that the Democrats would pick up two
or three seats in the House. Now, he says, the Republicans could
capture 10 or 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his change of heart, Rothenberg said: ``I don't
have micro or macro data that shows either a national move or a
move in individual races. We're going on gut here. You don't
discount gut. But you don't go too far.''

</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of this year, politicians in both parties,
noting that voters seemed relatively content and disengaged from
politics, had forecast a status-quo election, where incumbents
would be safe and Republicans would cling to control Congress by
roughly the existing margins.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the buoyed spirits among Republicans, there are
still two months before Election Day. Politicians around the
country say they are bracing for a political hurricane with untold
consequences: They know it will hit but they do not know when _ or
with what force.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a massive, dramatic shift in the makeup of Congress
would be a surprise because far fewer than 100 House seats are
considered hotly competitive. That is because there are fewer open
seats than is traditional and many incumbents face particularly
weak rivals this year. A surging economy through much of the year
and unusually high approval ratings for Congress discouraged many
challengers from running.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates said the biggest wild card will be the report
by Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which may be
issued this month. This is the first time since Watergate was
unfolding in 1974 that a general election campaign has occurred
amid a full-scale presidential scandal. But by Labor Day of 1974 it
was already clear to most strategists that Republicans would take a
huge hit that November. (Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and
five in the Senate.) This year, it is not as clear what the
reverberations could be for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also said that the dramatic downturn _ and partial
rebound _ of the stock market this week and the economic and
political crisis in Russia starkly reminded them how outside forces
could intrude on their carefully laid campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments have changed what was a very placid
election season to one that has a lot more uncertainty,'' said
Chris Bayley, a Republican running for Senate from Washington
state. ``Six months ago everyone assumed that since the economy was
good, incumbents would be favored and it would be harder for
challengers.'' Citing the financial crisis in Asia, he said,
``Everybody is much more nervous now.''
</P>
<P>
   William Carrick, a veteran Democratic strategist in Los Angeles,
put it this way: ``I've never seen anything like this _ it's a
very, very strange season. We're all analytically groping for what
is this election about: Is it a referendum on the president? It
doesn't appear to be so. But it's clearly not a referendum on
Congress. Then you add in this enormous reluctance by the American
public to even get engaged in following the politics of any of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Republican candidates said they were uncertain
whether to make the Lewinsky matter an issue, several said they now
planned to raise the broader topic of trust. The scandal also seems
to have brought a broader overlay of moral scrutiny to the
campaign, and on Friday led Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., one of the
president's most persistent critics, to acknowledge that he is the
father of a child born out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every one of us is going to have to run on
integrity,'' said Fay Boozman, a Republican running for the Senate
from Arkansas. ``I think there is a strong sense of the lack of
integrity of elected officials, and the breaking of the public
trust by elected officials. Bill Clinton is the headliner of that
because he is the President, but it crosses party lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats, spurred, perhaps, by the strong rebuke of
Clinton last week by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said Clinton's
problems would force them to discuss issues like morality. ``Here
in this particular race, integrity and taking responsibility for
your actions and honesty are big factors,'' said Lucas, the
Democrat running in Kentucky. ``And I think the recent events in
Washington are highlighting that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet some Democrats said they feared that all the talk of trust
would drown out the discourse about their party's marquee issues
such as education, health care reform and preserving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will distract from the ability of candidates to articulate
the issues we think are important,'' said Jay Inslee, a Democrat
seeking a House seat in Washington. ``It's kind of like a wreck on
the freeway. The traffic going the other way is watching the wreck
instead of paying attention to where we're going. It's a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many candidates in both parties have felt somewhat
neglected as the press focuses its energies less on electoral
politics and more on scandal in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even the high-profile contests such as for governor of
California and senator from New York have drawn relatively little
attention. Contributing to the dilemma for candidates is that,
judging by the polls and by interviews with strategists, no single
issue seems to be gripping voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask about anything under the sun,'' said Rep. Adam Smith,
D-Wash. ``But no real issue is grabbing folks.''
</P>
<P>
   David Osterberg, a Democrat who is taking on Sen. Charles
Grassley of Iowa, is so frustrated by his failure to draw attention
that he is trying a new stunt: paddling across the state in a
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rath, a longtime Republican strategist in New Hampshire,
predicted that rather than energize voters, the Lewinsky matter
would make voters even less engaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think people want this whole process to go away,'' he
said. ``There's a tiredness in the electorate. They don't have the
stomach for a highly contested election season.''

BEYOND POLITICS, INDONESIA'S CRISIS IS ABOUT AFFORDABLE FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ It has become a ritual whenever a delivery
truck arrives at the Cipinang rice market here. Young men clamber
onto the truck to unload the sacks of rice, while women and
children huddle next to the loading dock with crude brooms and
dustpans.
</P>
<P>
   As the sacks are hauled into a dimly lighted warehouse, the
women and children swiftly sweep up any grains that spill out. They
methodically sift out gravel, sand and cigarette butts, pour the
brown rice into plastic bags, then scurry out of sight to wait for
the next delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't do this, I wouldn't have any rice,'' said Satinah,
60, from west Java. Her skin has turned a dark bronze from
squatting seven hours a day under a searing sun with her dustpan
and broom.
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of Indonesians, Mrs. Satinah can no longer
afford to buy rice at her local market. The price of rice, the
country's basic food, has skyrocketed as poor harvests, a devalued
currency and a badly frayed distribution system have combined to
create a dire shortage.
</P>
<P>
   As Indonesia struggles to regain its political and economic
footing, experts are warning that rice _ not ethnic tension, anger
toward the government or the restive military _ is the biggest
threat to stability.
</P>
<P>
   Food riots have already erupted in eastern Java, and soldiers
are guarding Cipinang and other markets to prevent looting. Unless
the price of rice comes down, rioting could spread to major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rice issue is now the No. 1 problem here,'' said Rizal
Ramli, a prominent economist. ``This is socially very explosive. It
could have a more damaging impact than when the government pulled
gasoline subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   After the government eliminated subsidies on gasoline and
kerosene early last May, it set off protests across the country
that mutated into vast rioting and eventually forced the
resignation of President Suharto on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the political threat, several experts worry that a
sizable percentage of Indonesia's 200 million people could face
malnutrition. H.S. Dillon, the executive director of the Center for
Agricultural Policy Studies, a private research center in Jakarta,
explained the dismal arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Rice currently sells at the market for 17 cents a pound, more
than double the government's target price. For a family of five to
buy 22 pounds of rice per capita each month, it would cost $18.70.
About 40 percent of Indonesia's families earn less than that,
meaning that nearly half the population cannot afford even a
minimum supply of rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand: these are really hard times,'' Dillon
said. ``Unless this changes soon, we are going to be in deep
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon and other food experts are not predicting that Indonesia
faces a famine. The government has been heavily importing rice from
Thailand and Vietnam and says it has stockpiled 2.2 million tons.
But Indonesians consume about 30 million tons of rice a year. And
the government acknowledges there is a shortfall of 4.5 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, the government cannot flood the market with
enough imported rice to offset the upward price spiral of domestic
rice sold by private traders. On Tuesday the minister of
cooperatives accused traders of hoarding stocks to drive the price
up even further.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have abundant supply while the market is short of stock,
what do you think has happened?'' asked the minister, Adi Sasono.
</P>
<P>
   But experts said the reasons were more complicated than mere
profiteering. They said the crisis stems from an extraordinarily
unlucky convergence of bad weather, poor agricultural policy,
economic devastation and a deterioration in Indonesia's
distribution network caused by last May's riots.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   First came El Nino, which changed the country's weather patterns
and resulted in an 18-month drought. Huge forest fires blanketed
the islands of Sumatra, Kalimantan and Irian Jaya with smoke, which
further depressed crop yields. The Agriculture Ministry estimated
that rice production declined 3.6 percent in 1997, and will drop
another 6.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Next came the Asian economic crisis, which drove down the value
of Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, by 80 percent. That prompted
many farmers to switch from low-margin domestic crops like rice to
higher-margin export crops like palm oil and cocoa. And it led some
farmers who still harvested rice to smuggle some of it out of the
country for higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia could have muddled through were it not for the riots
in May. The ethnic Chinese, who dominate the food distribution
business, were the main targets of the three-day spree of looting
and arson. In Jakarta, hundreds of Chinese-owned shops were
ransacked and torched.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Chinese fled the country, and some have not
returned. To replace the missing traders, the government has begun
giving licenses to hundreds of indigenous Indonesians, known as
pribumi. But instead of making the system more competitive, some
experts say, the new traders are bogging it down and increasing
hoarding and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic dimension is the least discussed part of Indonesia's
food crisis, and perhaps most intractable. Partly, this is because
Indonesians still harbor deeply ambivalent feelings toward the
Chinese, who constitute less than 5 percent of the population but
control vast chunks of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, has encouraged
ethnic Chinese to return, he has offered no guarantees about their
future, and some experts say the drive to replace Chinese traders
with pribumis was part of a broader effort to erode Chinese
influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This policy will basically fleece the Chinese traders, and
they are the only people with a track record in this area,'' said
one critic of the government's policy, who spoke on condition that
he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cipinang market, ethnic Chinese traders complain bitterly
that the new traders are driving up the price of rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst I can ever remember,'' said H. Zulkifli, a
20-year veteran of the rice trade, as he gestured toward a knot of
new traders haggling over sacks of rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in survival mode,'' said Jim Jeffery, the general
manager of logistics at Indonesia's largest supermarket chain,
Hero. ``They're not interested in buying designer jeans. They're
interested in buying the next kilo of rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is trying to stem the crisis by distributing
subsidized rice (at 5 cents a pound) to poor people. But the
government concedes it is failing because the number of people
classified as poor keeps rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem identifying the poor people,'' said the
finance minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita. ``Who are they?''
</P>
<P>
   According to a new report by the International Labor
Organization, 95.8 million people, or 48 percent of Indonesia's
population, will be under the poverty line by the end of this year.
If the economy does not rebound, that could rise to 140 million
people, or 66 percent of the population, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the government's strained finances, it is probably
impossible for Indonesia to provide poor people across this vast
archipelago with subsidized rice. But with Jakarta still bearing
the scars of the riots, Ginandjar said the government had no choice
but to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other option is to allow for social unrest to build up,''
he said.

 &HT;    Before debut, `ER' appeared to be DOA
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let us consider the ways in which ``ER'' could have been a
failure, a bleeder that died on the TV table.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour script for the pilot had been written several years
before by Michael Crichton as a feature film and had been bouncing
around Hollywood, unmade and unwanted, despite Crichton's track
record.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was full of unknowns and barely knowns. Anthony
Edwards, the balding, slightly nerdy lead, had been one of the
flyboys killed off in ``Top Gun'' and appeared in a few episodes of
``Northern Exposure'' as an extremely allergic, irritating
character. George Clooney, second billed, had a string of failures;
his career high point had been playing Roseanne's boss the first
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' had the unenviable task of replacing the well-liked
``L.A. Law.'' Its lead-in when it debuted in 1994 was ``Madman of
the People,'' a wretched sitcom starring Dabney Coleman that was
canceled after a few months.
</P>
<P>
   It was packed with dense medical jargon shouted at
incomprehensible speed with no explanations for viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Another medical drama, and a darned good one at first _ CBS'
``Chicago Hope'' _ was going head to head against ``ER'' at 10 p.m.
Thursdays. Someone was going to have to blink.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a bit of a jinx. Another show, a comedy called
``E/R,'' also set in an emergency room in Chicago (the difference
was the slash and, ultimately, a bunch of Emmys and millions of
viewers) had lasted one season in 1984; coincidentally, Clooney had
a small role.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment that first gurney crashed through the
swinging doors at Cook County General Hospital, ``ER'' was one of
those series that defines its era. Critics loved it. Audiences
rearranged their schedules to watch it. Advertisers clamored to be
on it. At the end of its premiere season, it ranked second among
all TV series, behind only ``Seinfeld,'' the hit it would
eventually surpass in audience.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after its debut, ``ER'' is joining TNT with repeats
in chronological order, running at 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.
The two-hour pilot aired Sunday but repeats at 5 p.m. today
(597533). As tonight's first hourly episode unfolds (7 o'clock
(907674)), Carol Hathaway (Julianna Margulies) is recovering from
her suicide attempt. (In Crichton's original script, Hathaway died,
but her fate was changed for TV.)
</P>
<P>
   As the week progresses, the guest stars start visiting. Rosemary
Clooney (George's aunt and still a pretty fair singer) popped in on
the second episode, which airs Tuesday. Ving Rhames is the father
of a hit-and-run victim Wednesday, and Alan Rosenberg is a man
dying while awaiting a heart transplant Thursday. The entire first
season will end Oct. 8, at which point Season 2 starts right in.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of ``ER's'' adrenalin pace, its multiple
subplots and its realism. But the reason for its success with
viewers is simple: It's the characters, stupid. We know them
better, in some ways, than our friends and some family members,
their nobilities and foibles, their struggles and triumphs, their
utter humanness. Greene's attempts to quit smoking, Carter's growth
from callow med student to brassy confidence, Weaver's isolation
that makes her meaner, Ross' floundering stabs at establishing
himself, Jeanie Boulet's sad-eyed tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, if you're not up for the reruns, new episodes of
Season 5 start Sept. 24 on NBC.

 &HT;    What about the kids?
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When stumped by child raising, Terry Maple, director of Zoo
Atlanta, goes back to the basics: ``What,'' he thinks, ``would a
gorilla do?''
</P>
<P>
   Maple is the father of three girls: 11, 16 and 18. And from the
very beginning, he believed the best way to care for babies _
whether humans, apes or lions _ is to keep them close to their
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Maple rejects the theory that it takes a village to raise a
child. Instead, he says, it takes just one set of attentive, loving
parents _ and he thinks work trends that separate children from
their mothers and fathers for longer and longer stretches cause
many of society's woes.
</P>
<P>
   But are parents' work schedules really to blame for so many of
today's problems? And if all women suddenly quit their jobs _ and
it usually is the woman who quits, statistics show _ and returned
to the home, would our children be better off?
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is more complicated than that,'' said Jay Belsky, a
professor of human development at Pennsylvania State University.
Belsky, who wrote a 1986 study that criticized day care, has since
softened his position. ``Child care _ relative to what else is
going on in a family _ has only a modest impact at best.'' A better
indicator, he said, is the financial and emotional stability of a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Many social workers and child advocates agree. They say parents
and society should look at other trends that have fundamentally
changed traditional family life, such as:
</P>
<P>
   Almost one in every three children now lives in a single-parent
home, according to the Census Bureau, an indicator that can
determine how much attention and supervision a child gets and the
amount of financial resources available.
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods are no longer the rock of community standards.
Neighbors who once could band together to support and discipline
children don't know one another and certainly don't trust one
another with such responsibilities. That means there are fewer eyes
and ears to keep children on the right path.
</P>
<P>
   One in five children is impoverished, which often contributes to
a snowball effect of other ills, including inferior day care, bad
schools, lack of supervision and broken families.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is, middle-class suburban kids are doing
better than ever. Their prospects have never been brighter,'' said
Bill O'Hare, coordinator of Kids Count at the Annie E. Casey
Foundation, a private charitable organization for children in
Baltimore. ``But on the other hand, we have huge pockets of
inner-city minority kids who are falling further and further from
the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Shifting responsibility?
</P>
<P>
   For many, however, day care remains an easy target. Even
advocates admit that standards for child care are lacking. At this
summer's White House Child Care Conference, for example, experts
reported that less than 20 percent of day care is of high 70
percent is mediocre and another 15 percent is actually harmful.
</P>
<P>
   And day care remains the most volatile symbol of the
uncomfortable reality that many parents are paying others to care
for their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the boom in day care and after-school programs in
the past three decades, no matter how wonderful the center or solid
the curriculum, opened the door for a fundamental shift _ and in
some cases, abdication _ of parental responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk in our society about how important children are,''
said Janet Scott, 62, a Gainesville social worker who has done
family counseling for more than 30 years. ``But we're killing them
(psychologically) through neglect and abuse pretty damn fast, so
maybe they're not as important as we say they are.''
</P>
<P>
   And the results are bleak. From just plain snottiness to
pregnancy and juvenile violence, the seeds of neglect in the early
years are bearing fruit of teenage rebellion and adult discontent,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Public Agenda, a nonprofit public opinion
agency, found only 37 percent of Americans thought today's children
_ once adults _ would make the country a better place. And less
than 15 percent of respondents thought it was common for children
to treat people with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is the surprise?'' said Laura Schlessinger, a critic of
child care and a nationally syndicated talk show host with more
than 20 million listeners. ``If you don't take responsibility for
your children, if you don't make sure you're there when they need
you, why would you expect that everything is going to turn out
OK?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kids Count, the 1995 teen birthrate was 36 per
1,000 nationally; up from 31 per 1,000 in 1985. Violent crime by
juveniles has almost doubled in 10 years. In 1995, law enforcement
agencies reported a rate of 507 per 100,000 arrests. In 1985, that
rate was 305 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Those two areas are important because researchers and family
advocates are increasingly tying such problems to a lack of
supervision. Public Agenda found in a 1997 survey that one in three
teens reported there was no adult at home when they arrived from
school.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys have reported teen mothers saying they most
probably got pregnant between the hours of 3 and 6 p.m. And
researchers have reported most crime committed by kids occurs after
school, not after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The peak hours for juvenile crime were 2 to 8 p.m., according to
a report sponsored by Fight Crime _ Invest in Kids, a national
anti-crime group composed of police chiefs, prosecutors and crime
victims. And two-thirds of all juvenile crime occurred between 2
and 11 p.m., according to the group.
</P>
<P>
   A question of interest
</P>
<P>
   But working parents and day care operators say it's ludicrous to
compare using day care to neglecting your child.
</P>
<P>
   The longest-running and largest study of child care, conducted
by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,
found most children who attended were no more likely to have
attachment or behavioral problems than those who stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
   (That study was done after Belsky announced in 1986 that
children who spent more than 20 hours a week in day care failed to
attach to their mothers as well as children who stayed at home.
Since working on the NICHH study, Belsky has revised his stance.)
</P>
<P>
   And advocates say, if used in balance, day care can be a great
influence on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is ever going to love a child as much as the parents.
We are not substitutes for that and don't want to be,'' said Jody
Martin, who develops the curriculum for Children's World, a Golden,
Colo., corporation that runs 575 day care centers. ``But warm and
nurturing people are a plus in any child's life. And when you
combine that with a developmentally appropriate learning
environment, day care _ when you get past the stigma _ can be a
huge plus in a child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Patti Truslow, a kindergarten teacher at Mary Lin Elementary
School in Candler Park, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Truslow said she would be unable to distinguish children merely
on the basis of whether they were at home or at a center before
they began kindergarten, because the best predictor of success is
far more subtle.
</P>
<P>
   It's not where the child spent time, but how he or she spent
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only common denominator I have seen is, you can definitely
tell which children have had someone read to them,'' said Truslow,
who has taught kindergarten for 12 years. ``They know more about
the world and they're much more eager to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumming resident Connie Williard said her 17-year-old son,
Derek, is an example of how child care can have a positive effect
on a child. Williard went back to work shortly after he was born,
and Derek stayed in day care until he started school. Once he
reached school age, he was in after-school programs for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had stayed home with him, he would not have had any other
children to play with _ especially with so many other moms
working,'' said Williard, 39. ``He would have been stuck at home
watching television.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he learned how to share and negotiate with other
children, she said. He also learned how to organize his day, with
workers telling him when it was time to do homework and when he
could play.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Montgomery, 35, also has used day care for her children,
Joshua, now 7, and Joel, 4. Both sons attend a Children's World
child care center in Smyrna, which provides a classroom for Joel
and an after-school program for Joshua.
</P>
<P>
   Like Derek, Montgomery's sons have grown through the experience,
learning to be more independent, outgoing and polite, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But both mothers say child care has worked for their families
over the years because they hold the ultimate responsibility. ``How
a kid turns out has nothing to do with whether you use day care or
whether you're working,'' said Williard. ``It all comes down to
whether an individual is interested in their child. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   A time to teach values
</P>
<P>
   Yet, too often, the balance seems precarious and doubts remain.
</P>
<P>
   Lanita Collins, 16, was adopted at 13 months old and is one of
three children of a divorced mother. From 13 months to 3 years, she
went to day care. From ages 3 to 9, she was home with her mom. When
her mother, Cassandra, returned to work, she was enrolled in
after-school programs until she was old enough to watch her
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Campbell High School student goes home after school and
starts chores, from making dinner to doing laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said her experiences have been good, making her more
independent and responsible. She is a B student, attends church and
baby-sits.
</P>
<P>
   She is fiercely proud of her mother and the decisions her mother
has made.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when asked about how she would handle her own children,
Lanita said she would like to stay home with them for several
years, if possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to stay out until kindergarten,'' she said.
``Maybe I would go part time. But you know, I think it makes it
easier to make sure children are respectful, to make sure they have
the values you want them to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Montgomery, who said she is pleased with her day care
situation, also pines occasionally to be home like her mother had
been. ``As a child, I probably did not think of it as a gift, but
it was a given: Mom would always be around.'' That, Montgomery
said, gave her and her two brothers a security that sticks for
life.
</P>
<P>
   And security, Maple said, whether it be for kids or cubs, is one
of the keys to happiness.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that animals were raised in nurseries in the '70s
before a widespread movement to leave babies and young animals in
their family groups. The nursery experiment was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bunch of little anti-social tigers, anti-social apes,
anti-social bears, who didn't know how to mate, function or live,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, humans believe they, too, can tear bonds without
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much stress and strain on the modern family _
trying to do too much in too little time,'' Maple said. ``Why do we
think the results will be any different?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time Michael Jackson rumors start to swirl, word
spreads of a Hollywood murder-suicide or Matt Damon changes his
hair style, E! Entertainment will probably dispatch not one but two
teams of Hollywood news hounds.
</P>
<P>
   One will come from the cable channel, the other from its sister
Web site, E! Online, and company executives will not mind seeing
the hounds race to get the exclusive. ``They're trying to scoop
each other all the time,'' said Lee Masters, president and chief
executive of E! Entertainment. ``It keeps everybody on their
toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Masters said he did not intend the E! site (www.eonline.com) to
compete with the network so much as to complement it, but he does
intend the online entity to have its own identity. Unlike some
Internet sites that are linked to television programs or even
entire networks, Masters wants E! Online to be something more.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas E! Entertainment has sought to build its television
programming on a shoestring budget, the company has spent more
freely to build up the Web site, Masters said, though he declined
to discuss specific figures. Companies that want to stake a claim
on the Internet need to do so aggressively, and immediately, he
said, and that costs money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have mouth-watering content and you have to have
an incredibly seductive environment,'' Masters said. ``You have to
stake out that territory now.''
</P>
<P>
   He is less effusive about E! Online's revenue, which he declined
to disclose, though he concedes that like most Internet companies,
it is losing money.
</P>
<P>
   E! went on the Web in August 1996 in a partnership with Cnet, a
new-media company based in San Francisco. The partnership ended a
year later, when E! paid a reported $10 million for Cnet's 50
percent of the venture. At the time, Cnet said it wanted to focus
on its core businesses and E! decided it wanted to own its brand on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 55 full-time E! employees work on the site, 40 of whom
are producing the content _ a daily helping of Hollywood, including
updated news, gossip, Webcasts of movie premieres, and features
like ``Stalkers,'' a three-part article on fans who stalk
celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not all the Hollywood scoops are exactly the stuff
of the Lehrer Newshour. ``We identified that Matt Damon was hot
back in 1996,'' one staffer said, touting the site's
accomplishments. ``We broke the fact that Blues Traveler was
leaving the Horde Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   The site appears to be getting heavy traffic, with roughly 2
million visitors a month, according to (AT)plan, a Gallup
Organization unit that tracks online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   And a June 1998 survey by Relevant Knowledge Inc. ranked E!
Online as the 23rd most heavily trafficked news and entertainment
site overall, placing it above ABC.com and MTV.com, and ahead of
its direct competitors, which include Entertainment Weekly
(www.pathfinder.com/ew), News Corp.'s TVgen.com site, and
Entertainment Asylum (www.asylum.com).
</P>
<P>
   E! Online is also one of the anchor entertainment tenants on
America Online and offers entertainment programming for broadband
Internet services that provide access and content over television
cable lines, including At Home Network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mark Mooradian, a group director at the Internet research firm
Jupiter Communications, said one of E! Online's strengths was its
ability to complement the E! Entertainment cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   E! Entertainment cites figures from (AT)plan indicating that
nearly two-thirds of the visitors to its Web site also watch its TV
programs. That gives Masters confidence in his long-term plan to
make E! a player in the industry's oft-predicted convergence of
television and cyberspace. ``We want to get our grubby little paws
on every aspect of this business that we can,'' he said.

<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Divers found the flight data recorder of
Swissair Flight 111 Sunday on a rocky stretch of sea bottom
littered with debris and at least three major pieces of wreckage of
the MD-11. The discovery raised hopes that investigators would soon
know why the plane crashed offshore here on Wednesday night,
killing everyone aboard, after a pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   No additional remains of the 229 victims were identified on
Sunday _ the body of one passenger, a French woman, was identified
Friday and taken home _ nor were large numbers of victims found.
But officials were clearly relieved that the Navy diving tender,
the Sechelt, had found one of the plane's two ``black boxes.'' The
box, which is actually orange, was brought ashore late on Sunday
afternoon, where technicians immersed it in fresh water and sealed
it for immediate shipment to a Transportation Safety Board
laboratory in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Work there will begin immediately on arrival, said Vic Gerden,
the board's chief investigator, but a key question was whether the
device, which stores data in computer chips, would have to be
repaired before data could be examined. Another question was
whether an electric power failure, which investigators suspect
occurred on the plane about six minutes before impact, had disabled
the data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerden said in a briefing on Sunday evening, ``I would
say that the recovery of the flight data recorder is a very
important step in the progression of this investigation.'' Gerden
entered the briefing room knowing only that one of the boxes had
been recovered; an aide later crept on stage to whisper which one.
</P>
<P>
   (Investigators and searchers say they believe that the other
box, the cockpit voice recorder, was nearby, and a submarine, the
Okanagan, was still searching for it.)
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, the medical examiner here said that the victims'
remains were simply in too many pieces to perform DNA analysis on
all of them, and that some of the smaller pieces would be put in
plastic bags and frozen until lawyers and ethicists could decide
what to do. The medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said he had
conferred with his counterpart in Suffolk County, on Long Island,
who handled the remains of the passengers and crew from Trans World
Airlines Flight 800 two years ago, and concluded that the bodies
here were in much worse condition.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered wreckage field is about five nautical miles
southwest of Peggy's Cove, just outside the area in which searchers
had been conducting sonar mapping of the bottom. They found three
major pieces of the plane, at least one of which shows metal ribs
that divers believe are part of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site is about 180 feet beneath the surface, in an area
with only about 10 feet visibility and the divers' ``bottom time''
is limited to 6 to 10 minutes, officials said. Weather conditions
on Sunday were near the lower limit of those in which divers can be
dropped, officials said.

LOOKING TO DOONESBURY AS AN ECONOMIC INDICATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TECH-STOCK-STARTUPS) 
(lb) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has Doonesbury, the political comic strip by Garry Trudeau,
become the latest sell signal?
</P>
<P>
   The most recent story line, which began on Aug. 24, features
Mike Doonesbury and his fledgling Internet company, Mikim Inc. Like
most of its peers, it is losing money _ lots of it. But as Mike
explains to his daughter, Internet companies are supposed to lose
money. That's why they go public.
</P>
<P>
   As easy as Internet companies are to lampoon, the sight of them
in the comics may be the clearest indication yet that their stocks
have reached a top. Since peaking in July, when valuations were the
most elevated, these stocks have dropped sharply. Yahoo is down 27
percent, for example, and Amazon.com has fallen 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the mainstream press and humorists start to pick up on
something, it does send something of a message,'' said Edward
Mathias, managing director at the Carlyle Group in Washington, who
has spent more than 15 years collecting various clippings,
including editorial cartoons, on business and the stock market in
the popular press.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonists and others ``are very topical about what they do,''
Mathias said. While they may not be a leading indicator, they
affirm that a particular topic has penetrated the public
consciousness. And whenever something becomes as well known as
that, an investor should assume that its popularity is reflected in
the price of any assets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What makes many Internet companies easy targets, for Trudeau's
satire or for worried investors wondering what to unload from their
portfolios, is their lack of profits. While investors typically
value public companies by some multiple of what they earn, many
Internet companies are measured by anything but.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in future profits,'' said Paul Cook, who
manages the Munder Netnet Fund. He argues that Internet companies
need to spend today to build market share tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these companies could be profitable today if they
were satisfied with their current station,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some investors' willingness to ignore profits creates an
atmosphere ripe for ridicule. As a result, Mike Doonesbury is proud
of his company's burn rate, the amount of money he spends over
whatever he takes in as revenues. His daughter scolds him for being
``braggy'' when she overhears him tell someone the company could
lose $2 million this year _ easy.
</P>
<P>
   The same atmosphere was the subject of Michael Wolff's ``Burn
Rate,'' a tongue-in-cheek look at Wolff's own Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors seem to have dispensed with even the pretense of
profitability. How else do you explain the ability of Broadcast.com
Inc., which went public in July, to report increasing quarterly
losses and still see its stock jump by nearly 7 percent the same
day?
</P>
<P>
   This overreliance on growth in revenue and market share at the
expense of profitability, a cornerstone of any successful business,
makes other investors scornful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the silliest thing I've ever heard,'' Susan
Byrne, the president of Westwood Management, said. While she is
enthusiastic about the vast potential of the Internet, calling it
``the rails of the new millennium,'' she remains convinced that a
company must have a business plan if it is to profit from the
Internet's popularity. Market share does no good if the business
model does not explain how a company can make money.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Michael Murphy, a money manager and
technology-stock analyst who recommends selling short some of the
Internet stocks, is that ``a good chunk of the Internet companies
will never be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Mike Doonesbury may now be too late. With the overall
market, and especially small stocks, down, the opportunity to win a
favorable reception from investors is shrinking. ``In markets like
this, people get religion,'' said John Fitzgibbon, the editor of
The IPO Reporter, a weekly newsletter in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last week, newspaper readers knew that
Doonesbury's Mikim was faced with the abrupt withdrawal of its
principal financial backer. But Mike himself still wanted to press
ahead with a stock sale, in the hope that gullible investors would
believe the appearance of success is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A luxury car might help,'' Mike ventured.

 &HT;    Mississippi fight brewing over voters' right to decide
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUPORA, Miss. _ She's from a two-stoplight town west of
Starkville and east of Winona. She wears demure church dresses,
plays the piano and works for a state legislator when she's not
taking care of her two children.
</P>
<P>
   And this summer, Elizabeth Stoner has become a household name in
Mississippi. Stoner has a bee in her bonnet about voting rights and
specifically about the right to vote for or against gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos were legalized in river and Gulf Coast counties in 1991
by the state Legislature, but Stoner thinks regular Mississippians
should have their say. So she filed an initiative in June that
would put the issue to a statewide vote, giving Mississippians a
chance to kick the casinos out.
</P>
<P>
   If they vote to ban gambling, the 30 riverboats docked in eight
counties along the Mississippi River and the Gulf Coast would have
two years to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``My issue isn't really gambling, it's the right to vote,'' said
Stoner, who refuses to say whether she personally is for or against
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Although individual counties voted on whether to allow gambling
once it was legal, the law prohibited those counties from later
changing their minds and voting gambling out. Stoner's boss, state
Rep. Charlie Smith, last year unsuccessfully tried to change that
law and allow the counties to re-vote on gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stoner has poked her stick into the cage of the gaming
industry, which has brought 50,000 jobs and $250 million a year in
state and local taxes to the poorest state in the country. And the
gaming industry is roaring.
</P>
<P>
   So big is gambling in Mississippi that the National Gambling
Impact Study Commission plans to hold one of its national hearings
in Biloxi on Thursday at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. The day
before, pro-gaming forces plan to hold a rally on the Biloxi Town
Green to honor what Gov. Kirk Fordice has called ``the Mississippi
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaming officials filed an appeal challenging Stoner's
initiative, and a Hinds County judge in late July ruled against
Stoner, saying that the wording of her initiative made it invalid.
Stoner plans to re-word her initiative and try again.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi is a referendum state, which means any voter can
file an initiative to change the state's Constitution. That's what
Stoner is trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have come out on both sides of the issue, but Gov.
Kirk Fordice and Lt. Gov. Ronnie Musgrove, both gambling opponents,
have spoken against the initiative, saying it would cause more
trouble than it would solve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invited people from all over the country to invest
literally hundreds of millions of dollars to build hotels, barges,
infrastructure, so we can't now say, `Oh, we changed our minds, you
have to leave, we're now not going to allow gambling,''' said state
Rep. Danny Guice, a Republican from the coast. ``I have no doubt it
will be struck down one way or another, but in the meantime, it has
had a chilling effect on the growth of gaming in the state. The
bigger casinos are going to stop and take a wait-and-see
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Stebbins, executive director the Mississippi Gaming
Association, said he was surprised by the initiative, but he thinks
Mississippians are too tied to casinos to let them disappear. He
disputed Guice's statement that casinos are now afraid to expand,
pointing to a new merger between the Hilton hotels and the Grand
Casino chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are comfortable with the political and economic climate
in Mississippi,'' he said. ``And I think a lot of residents feel
gaming is a big part of the tourism business here and it will never
go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative has a long way to go before being placed on the
ballot. Even if Stoner gets the language right and it receives the
blessing of the courts, she must then collect almost 100,000
signatures to have the question placed on the ballot. She is hoping
it will be on the 1999 or 2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   But some people believe if the initiative makes it that far, it
has a good chance of passing. After all, only eight of the state's
82 counties allow gambling. The rest of the counties don't stand to
lose as much if gambling is banned, and therefore might vote it out
for moral reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Sen. Ollie Mohamed, a Democrat from the Delta, said
that although he voted for gambling in 1991, he now wishes he
hadn't, and he thinks other people who initially wanted casinos are
regretting them.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling's economic benefits do not outweigh its social costs,
he said, and although thousands of jobs have been created, most of
them are low-paying service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as a state (were) grasping for revenue no matter how we
derived it, or what the cost might be to our people and state in
the future,'' he said. ``And it has caused many bankruptcies and
foreclosures. I've seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoner, who won't reveal much about herself because, she says,
she feels she might be in danger, says she is not affiliated with
any group, but many groups have come out in support of her
initiative. Attorneys with the American Family Association, a
conservative Christian group, have agreed to represent her. And
many churches have voiced support.

 &HT;    Politicians no longer need to labor on this day
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Labor Day is traditionally considered the startup of the fall
political season, but for some of Georgia's top political
candidates this weekend that could be a misnomer.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few small-town parades, Georgia's gubernatorial
candidates will use the last holiday of the summer to catch some
much-needed rest before the final two months of a campaign season
that never showed signs of a late summer slow-down.
</P>
<P>
   Warm-weather holidays once marked by old-fashioned barbecues and
rallies on courthouse squares have given way to media-driven races
and carefully crafted 30-second scripts that keep campaigns in
perpetual motion throughout the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor Day as a watershed has gone by the wayside,'' said Steve
Anthony, the state Democratic Party's executive director. ``There
was no break.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for gubernatorial candidates, who, following the
evolving political script in the '90s, have been at it for more
than a year. Down-ballot contests, where TV advertising is still a
rarity or where tight budgets won't allow protracted media buys,
still will kickstart after this weekend. But they'll be
overshadowed by races that have come to rely more and more on a
media-honed message to reach more than 4.1 million voters scattered
over Georgia, one of the largest Eastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hear(ing) these guys speak from the stump is less important
than it was 25 years ago,'' state GOP Chairman Rusty Paul said.
``You don't have to be able to talk at all as long as you've got a
good, solid message and you get it on the air as much as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly how political scientists expect the race to
continue into the homestretch, since Republican nominee Guy Millner
and Democratic nominee Roy Barnes set the tone early. Other
ballot-topping contests for lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate are
expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Millner dipped into his own personal fortune to launch a TV
blitz against Barnes within days of the July 21 primary, and kept a
steady string of attack ads running during what conventional wisdom
considered the dead days of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes countered with ads of his own, as well as media-driven
events like an eight-city fly around with leaders of the National
Rifle Association, even as most voters were thinking more about
back-to-school shopping and end-of-summer get-aways .
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shooting at each other over long Labor Day weekend,
most candidates will take some time off for season-opening dove
hunts. Both Millner and Barnes have scheduled hunting excursions,
and Barnes will be the grand marshal of a parade in south Cobb.
Millner's immediate calendar revolves around opening a half-dozen
campaign offices around the state later next week, two in Cobb
County, Barnes' home turf.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Senate candidates also plan to attend dove shoots on
Saturday. Incumbent Republican Sen. Paul Coverdell will travel to a
dove-hunting event in Dooly County, while Democratic challenger
Michael Coles will got to a hunt in Cartersville. On Labor Day,
Coverdell will attend the Catfish Festival Parade in Camden County,
as Coles visits the Communications Workers of America picnic in
Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   In the race lieutenant governor, Democrat Mark Taylor will
attend dove shoots in Cartersville and Hancock County. He may also
attend a parade. Republican Mitch Skandalakis will participate in
parades in Acworth and Douglasville.

 &HT;    As campaigns heat up, so do races to steal signs
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's as American as doctoring the baseball, fudging on your
taxes or rolling through a stop sign when nobody's looking.
</P>
<P>
   It's the time-honored campaign strategy of deep-sixing an
opponent's yard signs.
</P>
<P>
   Lies and distortions will irk a candidate. But to really send
him to a frenzy, steal his signs.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Bart Ladd (R-Atlanta), a Republican candidate for the
state senate seat representing Dunwoody, says he was inflamed when
supporters of primary opponent Gerald Bartels stole his signs and
replaced them with their own. He finally retaliated.
</P>
<P>
   They ``put up their sign in my supporter's yard,'' said Ladd,
who outpolled Bartels in the July 21 primary and was well on his
way to a 2-1 runoff victory. ``I'll be darned if they'll put up
their signs in my supporter's yard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladd said that on the day of the Aug. 11 runoff, as he yanked
the offending sign, a Bartels supporter jumped from the bushes with
a camera and caught him on film. In all, Ladd admits to yanking
only a couple of signs that day.
</P>
<P>
   The Bartels side, not surprisingly, tells it differently.
</P>
<P>
   Bartels campaign worker Randall Reusche, who snapped the photos,
said Ladd, who flies for Delta Airlines, spent election day
piloting his van through neighborhoods and plucking his opponent's
signs.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the incredible luck of capturing Ladd on film if he had
only torn down a couple of signs, Reusche says. The photos show
Ladd nabbing a Bartels' sign from the right-of-way on Winters
Chapel Road and next to a Ladd yard sign which remained untouched.
Signs on right-of-ways are all illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even saw him run over a sign,'' said Reusche. `` I can
understand a dirty tricks committee doing that. But the candidate
himself?'' Reusche admitted taking some Ladd signs, but only those
that stood where Bartels signs had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   As the November elections approach, campaign signs _ and the
incessant complaints about their disappearance _ will soon blanket
the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they have put up signs; they have been torn down,''
says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor who wrote
``Dirty Little Secrets,'' a book detailing the nefarious side of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   He found when asked about dirty tricks, the top gripe of
politicos was sign stealing. ``Of course, they were all victims and
never done it themselves,'' said Sabato. ``It's stealing; it's
vandalism. The whole thing is silly and petty and I can't imagine
it affects 10 votes. I guess it's an emotional release for the
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``release'' was seen in 1985, when then-Atlanta City
Councilman Mayor Bill Campbell had 60 signs stolen by family
members of Grace Davis, his opponent. Davis explained that her
signs had disappeared and her people must have ``gotten overanxious
and retaliated.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's 1997 mayoral opponent, Marvin Arrington, groused that
city sanitation workers continually yanked down his signs, even
when on private property.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Robert Collins, husband of Annie Collins, a candidate
for DeKalb County chief executive officer, was arrested at 4:40
a.m. after allegedly stealing now-CEO Liane Levetan's signs.
Levetan dropped charges but complained that signs cost $2 to $3
each.
</P>
<P>
   On August 10, three men were arrested in Cherokee County and
charged with with tearing down signs of slow-growth candidate Emily
Lemcke, who defeated County Chairman Hollis Lathem. The men said a
developer paid them to do so.
</P>
<P>
   More cases seem to surface as candidates now hide in bushes and
patrol the night in their vehicles, attempting to catch the
sign-stealin' varmints red-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Rep. Vinson Wall of Gwinnett County, admits that
opponent Mike Coan ``got me good'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Wall says he was frustrated by his signs disappearing, ``And I
took it upon myself to tear down, no, to remove one of his signs.
Just then, he comes running out of the bushes. It was a setup. He
got me good.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall lost the election to Coan and was beaten by him again in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all sorts of calls (from political people) and they
said, `You screwed up, you got caught,''' said Wall. ``It's an
accepted practice in politics. You get the other guy's signs if you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Mark Burkhalter (R-Alpharetta) has often dreamed of
catching a sign pilferer and claims his fantasy recently came true.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhalter said he was driving home late at night and noticed
his signs missing. He said he drove around and saw a van stop, the
driver get out, chuck a large sign into his van and speed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``He then started driving in the parking lots of a shopping
center at a high rate of speed and I kept following,'' said
Burkhalter, who admits the chase gave him an adrenaline rush. ``I
then cut him off and he was stuffing things away. He came out,
swore at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhalter claims it was his Democratic opponent, John Paul
Pritchard, whom he faces in the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baloney,'' says Pritchard, who denies stealing signs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was followed four nights in a row, including once
where Burkhalter turned off his lights while driving. Finally,
tired of the antics, Pritchard said he entered a parking lot and
jumped out of his van, only to find it was Burkhalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he has nothing better to do at midnight than
drive around and watch his signs,'' said Pritchard. ``It all seems
strange to me.''

COMPUTER WHOLESALER IN DEAL WITH TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By LAURIE J. FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ingram Micro Inc., the United States' largest wholesale
distributor of computers, has signed a deal with PC Order.com Inc.,
a provider of electronic commerce technology, to create an online
transaction system intended to let Ingram Micro deliver
custom-built computers more efficiently to corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   For PC Order, a 2-year-old company that plans to go public soon,
the deal will expand its market share to more than three-quarters
of all electronic commerce transactions in the corporate PC sales
market. PC Order, based in Austin, Texas, is already the
transaction-technology supplier to Compaq Computer, Hewlett-Packard
and IBM, among others.
</P>
<P>
   For Ingram, which already had a small online sales operation,
the 5-year deal involves linking the company's PC customers more
directly to Ingram's suppliers and assemblers, which company
executives said should lead to lower costs and faster delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Computer companies have been moving ever faster toward
build-to-order systems, which require quick access to component
data that is possible only through sophisticated electronic
commerce systems like PC Order's, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   PC Order, whose system involves Internet hardware and software
for automating sales transactions and specifying the configuration
of custom-made PCs, also maintains a continuously updated database
on pricing and availability of more than 600,000 computer products
from more than 1,000 manufacturers. It is this information that
Ingram or its subcontractors would use in ordering the components
that go into the PCs.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Tuesday's announcement, Ingram also plans to describe
a new online ordering service, called Prime Access, for companies
that resell machines that Ingram distributes.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, PC Order filed a registration with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to issue up to $35 million in stock. Because PC
Order is in the so-called quiet period that precedes an initial
public offering, neither it nor Ingram would discuss the financial
details of their deal.
</P>
<P>
   PC Order grew out of Trilogy Systems, a business software
company founded in 1989 by Christina Jones, now PC Order's
president.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Micro, based in Santa Ana, Calif., has evolved from
simply distributing computers to actually manufacturing them on
behalf of Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple Computer and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram's sales were $16.6 billion last year, nearly triple their
1994 level from 1994.

BASEBALL COLUMN: 3 WEEKS TO JUDGMENT ON METS' SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There were 40,311 fans at Shea Stadium on a
sun-drenched afternoon, 40,311 people who could have been
frolicking in pools, relaxing on beaches or sitting in
air-conditioned living rooms watching football. Actually, they
might as well have been doing something else Sunday because John
Smoltz emphatically brought the Mets back to reality in steering
the Atlanta Braves to a 4-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz reinforced why the Braves are the superior team and why
they might be the best team in the National League if Bobby Cox
never has to use the bullpen phone. What the loss did to the Mets
was remind them how difficult their path to a wild-card berth will
be and, most important, how their season will be judged in the next
three weeks. For better or worse, richer or poorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have been a feisty team with a strong starting
rotation, a usually reliable defense, a Jekyll and Hyde lineup, an
always intriguing bullpen and a marquee player and soap opera
candidate in Mike Piazza. The Mets do the little things correctly
for Manager Bobby Valentine and have always been gritty and often
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   This season is very much alive for the Mets even after Smoltz
was awesome with a three-hitter supported by 12 strikeouts. The
Braves also supplied a power show with four homers. But it will be
a failure for the Mets unless they are still breathing in three
weeks. If the regular season concludes on Sept. 27 in Atlanta and
the Mets do not qualify for a 163rd game, as in the post-season, it
will be a disappointing journey. This might sound harsh for a club
on pace to win 89 games, but it is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see,'' Valentine said. ``We'll have to see how
it turns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Not when a team is this close to its first
post-season berth since 1988 and might have more talent than the
Chicago Cubs, who lead the wild-card race by one game. Not when
there are no guarantees that Al Leiter and especially Piazza will
be re-signed for 1999. Not when the Yankees could be the story of
October again, the Yankees who work in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I've been spoiled with some of the teams I've played on,
but when you're in this with two other teams and there's no obvious
favorite, you'd like to think we would seize the moment and take
it,'' said Leiter, who has played for two World Series winners.
``Every team thinks about this in spring training. Now we're right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz revealed that he could sense the Mets were a desperate
team as he tossed crisp fastballs and curveballs and widened the
strike zone by a few inches because umpire Larry Vanover allowed
him to. It took Smoltz five pitches to zoom through the fifth and
seven more to handle the seventh. He whiffed Tony Phillips and John
Olerud three times apiece and was privately smiling when Piazza did
not play because of a bruised finger on his left hand. It is
stunning how naked the batting order looks without Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with a sense of urgency because they can't let
games slip away,'' Smoltz said. ``That's what I think is happening
over there. They don't think they're out of any game. They feel
like they have to win every game.''
</P>
<P>
   With the way Smoltz pitched, the Mets had no chance. Because the
Pittsburgh Pirates edged the Cubs, 4-3, in 10 innings, optimistic
fans would reason that the Mets did not lose anything because they
remained a game behind Chicago. But the Mets lost twice. They lost
a chance to tie the Cubs and to win a game when Rick Reed, who
leads them with 16 victories, started. Every lost opportunity is
critical with 19 games left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate goal is to get to the playoffs,'' General Manager
Steve Phillips said. ``If we fall short and don't have total
success, there will be small successes to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   Too small. Phillips said it ``would be an interesting case study
for a sociologist to study the fans' perception of the team and
their reaction to the team over the course of a season.''
Obviously, Phillips was referring to how Piazza has been loathed
and now lauded by the fans. It would also be worthwhile to analyze
how the Mets would feel if they did not snatch the wild card, an
appetizing post-season spot that was inches from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won 91 or 92 games and the Cubs won 93, I don't think
that would be a failure,'' Leiter said. ``The Marlins won 92 last
year and won the World Series. Gosh, I hope we wouldn't be
considered failures for winning 92 games. We're close. You hope
that we can do what it takes to get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else the season is not a success.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Divers found the flight data recorder of
Swissair Flight 111 Sunday on a rocky stretch of sea bottom
littered with debris and at least three major pieces of wreckage of
the MD-11. The discovery raised hopes that investigators would soon
know why the plane crashed offshore here on Wednesday night,
killing everyone aboard, after a pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   No additional remains of the 229 victims were identified on
Sunday _ the body of one passenger, a French woman, was identified
Friday and taken home _ nor were large numbers of victims found.
But officials were clearly relieved that the Navy diving tender,
the Sechelt, had found one of the plane's two ``black boxes.'' The
box, which is actually orange, was brought ashore late on Sunday
afternoon, where technicians immersed it in fresh water and sealed
it for immediate shipment to a Transportation Safety Board
laboratory in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Work there will begin immediately on arrival, said Vic Gerden,
the board's chief investigator, but a key question was whether the
device, which stores data in computer chips, would have to be
repaired before data could be examined. Another question was
whether an electric power failure, which investigators suspect
occurred on the plane about six minutes before impact, had disabled
the data recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gerden said in a briefing on Sunday evening, ``I would
say that the recovery of the flight data recorder is a very
important step in the progression of this investigation.'' Gerden
entered the briefing room knowing only that one of the boxes had
been recovered; an aide later crept on stage to whisper which one.
</P>
<P>
   (Investigators and searchers say they believe that the other
box, the cockpit voice recorder, was nearby, and a submarine, the
Okanagan, was still searching for it.)
</P>
<P>
   Also on Sunday, the medical examiner here said that the victims'
remains were simply in too many pieces to perform DNA analysis on
all of them, and that some of the smaller pieces would be put in
plastic bags and frozen until lawyers and ethicists could decide
what to do. The medical examiner, Dr. John Butt, said he had
conferred with his counterpart in Suffolk County, on Long Island,
who handled the remains of the passengers and crew from Trans World
Airlines Flight 800 two years ago, and concluded that the bodies
here were in much worse condition.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered wreckage field is about five nautical miles
southwest of Peggy's Cove, just outside the area in which searchers
had been conducting sonar mapping of the bottom. They found three
major pieces of the plane, at least one of which shows metal ribs
that divers believe are part of the fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site is about 180 feet beneath the surface, in an area
with only about 10 feet visibility and the divers' ``bottom time''
is limited to 6 to 10 minutes, officials said. Weather conditions
on Sunday were near the lower limit of those in which divers can be
dropped, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The field is 2,000 to 4,000 yards east of a broken buoy that
searchers originally believed had been sheared off by the plane in
the last seconds of its flight. But they said on Sunday that
metallurgists had found rust at the break and were not sure that
the jet had ever touched it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, medical teams continued work on human remains around
the clock, processing a backlog. ``The issue of data processing is
enormous,'' said Butt, speaking to reporters via a video link from
the military base where a temporary mortuary has been set up.
``This is an issue involving, regrettably, fragmented remains,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would be able to view these and find a point of
identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 150 and 170 families have responded to requests for
medical records, or given blood samples to be used for DNA testing,
he said; Canadian consulates are tracking down other families.
</P>
<P>
   Butt said that once the pilots' remains had been identified by
DNA, they would be tested for carbon monoxide poisoning, to seek if
they died from smoke inhalation. So far, he said, no human remains
show signs of burns.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was meeting daily with the families to try to help
them understand the situation. ``I think that in my own heart is a
need to help that process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN START HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Among other details announced on Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   _ The captain of the plane, Urs Zimmerman, 50, was hired by
Swissair in 1971 and had been a captain since 1987. He was
qualified as a flight instructor and had accumulated about 9,300
hours of flying time, including 900 in the MD-11. .
</P>
<P>
   _ Weather at the time of the crash was good, with a broken cloud
ceiling at 13,000 feet and an overcast ceiling at 24,000 feet.
Under the clouds, visibility was 15 miles, with no rain or fog; a
mild easterly wind was blowing.
</P>
<P>
   _ None of the cargo on board was listed on the manifests as
hazardous, except for 75 pounds of dry ice, which cannot cause
fires. Investigators are going back to shippers for more detail on
what they sent on the plane.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM CAN END HERE)
</P>
<P>
   For the families who are still here waiting for answers about
their loved ones, the mourning continued. More than 300 relatives
traveled to Peggy's Cove, one of the nearest points of land to the
crash site. For the second day, the village's lighthouse and the
rocks around it became a site for prayers and a repository for
flowers and mementos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so brave,'' said Murielle Provost, a Red Cross
official who has been counseling families. ``You see them trying so
hard to control their emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, many families seemed to feel a need to leave
something at the water's edge and to take something back with them.
Coast Guard and Navy recovery workers began to bring back bottles
of sea water from the area near the crash to give to families. At
Peggy's Cove, safety workers gathered rocks along the shore because
the waves on Sunday were too treacherous for families to wander
down to collect them.
</P>
<P>
   In dozens of churches along St. Margaret's Bay and in Halifax,
the crash was the focus of sermons and prayers. At St. Mary's
Basilica, a soaring Roman Catholic cathedral in Halifax, Monsignor
Martin Currie addressed a small group of victims' families who
gathered to celebrate the Eucharist with the church's parishioners.
</P>
<P>
   Currie compared the crash to a blackout, in which the families
were suddenly left in the dark and are now trying to find a way to
turn the lights on again. But he reassured them that they would
find a way _ through faith and by caring for one another _ to
continue their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting Robert Frost, he said: ``In three words I can tell you
all that I have learned about life: It goes on.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democratic and Republican leaders this week
will try to resolve an increasingly contentious debate over
exempting the Judiciary Committee from many House rules as the
panel reviews President Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee, headed by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., is
seeking sweeping powers never granted to a House panel as it
prepares to accept the report from the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   For example, House officials say, the committee is seeking the
authority to cite witnesses for contempt without first having the
approval of the full House. This option was first reported in The
Washington Post over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Any exemptions in rules for handling the report would be subject
to the approval of the full House.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, led by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, have
complained that Republicans are laying the framework for handling
Starr's report outlining possible impeachable offenses without
consulting Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In response to these complaints and fears that a floor fight
over the issue could hurt Republican credibility in the inquiry and
perhaps in the November elections, Speaker Newt Gingrich agreed
last week in a 10-minute telephone call with Gephardt to hold an
unusual meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Hyde and Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the
Judiciary Committee's ranking Democrat, will brief Gingrich,
Gephardt and Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader, on how
the panel intends to handle Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been concerned about what we've read lately on the
committee setting up procedures to receive the report,'' said Laura
Nichols, a spokeswoman for Gephardt. ``But the speaker pledged that
Democrats would be full partners.''
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said, ``The speaker said he wanted the issue to remain
bipartisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides emphasized that Hyde would lead the review, and
that House leaders would get an update on Wednesday. But Democrats
aim to use the meeting to press their views.
</P>
<P>
   Another important actor in this drama is Rep. Gerald Solomon,
R-N.Y., who heads the House Rules Committee, which is writing the
resolution governing how the House treats Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, an outspoken former Marine who zealously guards his
committee's jurisdiction, has voiced support for some of Hyde's
requests, but along with other Republicans, may be wary of others.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Solomon issued a news release ``clarifying'' his
position on the proposed resolution covering the procedures the
House would follow in receiving Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Under the resolution, Solomon said, Starr's full report would go
to the Judiciary Committee, with an executive summary made
available to all House members. If the committee finds sufficient
evidence to go forward with impeachment proceedings, Solomon said,
he would recommend the full report be made available to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   This approach would be a setback for the Judiciary Committee,
whose members initially favored blocking the release any of Starr's
findings to reduce the chance of disclosure to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile congressional investigations in recent
years, including the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee's inquiry into campaign finance abuses, have been exempt
from longstanding House rules.
</P>
<P>
   The House has waived rules requiring that a lawmaker be present
for all depositions of witnesses, allowing aides to conduct the
interviews. Committee leaders have been granted unusual subpoena
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is expected to ask for these powers and more, House
Republican aides say, largely to speed the review of Starr's
report.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several weeks, House aides say, Hyde and his top
aides, including Thomas Mooney, the committee's chief counsel, and
David Schippers, the chief investigative counsel, and, to some
extent, their Democratic counterparts, Abbe Lowell and Julian
Epstein, have been developing options to give the panel as much
flexibility and authority as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Besides exempting the panel from House rules on seeking contempt
citations, the panel is considering creating a subcommittee to
conduct the inquiry. This would allow the Judiciary Committee's
counsel, not the House counsel, to decide any legal questions from
the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone has drawn lines in the sand,'' said one
House Republican aide, describing these options. ``I wouldn't
characterize any previous positions as hard and fast.''

NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT MEETS, OUT OF THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Meanwhile, 6,200 miles to the south
...
</P>
<P>
   While President Clinton, representative of the world's lone
superpower, was in Moscow last week bear-hugging Boris Yeltsin,
master of a former superpower, delegates from 113 countries were
holding another summit meeting in the South African coastal city of
Durban.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 12th meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, which was
founded in 1961, largely at the urging of India, Indonesia and
Yugoslavia, as a forum for nations that were neither pro-U.S. nor
pro-Soviet and considered themselves the blades of grass that
suffer whenever elephants got together in Moscow and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, with the Cold War past, the week began with reporters
pestering them with the same question: ``Nonaligned to what?''
</P>
<P>
   The summit's diplomats had a ready answer: Nonaligned to a world
that still reflects post-World War II and colonialist priorities.
Nonaligned to a global economy in which small countries lose their
shirts overnight when speculators dump their currency. Nonaligned
to a United Nations where the Big Five still have the veto and will
risk their soldiers' lives in Bosnia but not in Congo or Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   As the week went on, the summit's official agenda was eclipsed
by talks about the Congo war. As they ended with no cease-fire and
talks about further talks, the focus shifted back to the main
nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   The chief issues the delegates were said to be discussing were
not those topping the Clinton-Yeltsin agenda in Moscow. They
included Congo, U.S. cruise missile attacks on sites in Afghanistan
and Sudan, the switch by India and Pakistan from nonnuclear to
nuclear states and Libya's hesitation to send suspects in the
Lockerbie plane bombing to the Netherlands for trial.
</P>
<P>
   But one had to take the word of leakers. Since most of the
Non-Aligned Movement's countries are less than open, reporters were
barred from the hall where they were meeting. Instead, reporters
sat in rows at a cavernous exhibit hall nearby, watching BBC TV on
big monitors and trying to arrange interviews with delegates by
calling their South African military escorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would get better credentials if you were from your
government's press,'' a young woman at the accreditation booth told
frustrated reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from a few nations deigned to cross the street to
speak to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Buyoya, the president of Burundi, who came to power in a
1996 coup, appeared to plug his new autobiography, ``Mission
Possible.'' A Thai diplomat came to endorse a candidate. A
Congolese delegation got into a scuffle with a self-proclaimed
transition government of Congolese exiles who had sneaked in past
security.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting's 514-paragraph final communique was not issued
until the midnight after it ended. By then, nearly everyone had
gone home. ``We made 300 copies,'' said Awie Marais, the chief
spokesman. ``There weren't 30 people left to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were some serious moments.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat came to reiterate his intention to declare an
independent Palestinian state next May.
</P>
<P>
   And the foreign minister of Sudan came early to outline his
request that the summit meeting demand a U.N. inspection of the
factory destroyed by U.S. cruise missiles on Aug. 20 to determine
whether it produced chemical weapons or pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister, Mustafa Ismail, had wanted to show slides
of the destruction, but the news conference room had been adorned
with potted palms and ficuses, blocking its screens. As Ismail
tried to leave, he was so mobbed by journalists desperate for
quotes that he stepped off the dais into the scenery, crushing a
pot of chrysanthemums.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the Non-Aligned Movement's history, a U.S.
team was present to keep an eye on charges such as Sudan's. They
were granted ``guest'' status, one rung down from ``observer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other delegations have been very receptive to our
presence,'' said Princeton Lyman, a former U.S. ambassador to South
Africa who headed the team. ``They seem pleased we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said the
Americans lobbied in the halls to temper the communique on some
issues, such as preventing Iraq from inserting language saying it
had fully complied with U.N. weapons inspectors, and asking that
Libya give up the Lockerbie suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also took part in a delicate debate troubling many
delegates. The Non-Aligned Movement has long opposed nuclear
weaponry, and now two of its leaders, Pakistan and India, have set
off bombs. Diplomats said the two wanted language creating a
``second tier'' of nuclear states, separate from the long-villified
bomb-owners, the United States, Russia, France, Britain and China.
Other states didn't want to condemn India and Pakistan, but wanted
to urge them not to ``weaponize.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final document, many hairs were split.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan were not mentioned. Instead the conferees
``noted the complexities arising from nuclear tests in South Asia,
which underlined the need to work even harder to achieve their
disarmament objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States' attack on the factory in Sudan was condemned
as ``unilateral and unwarranted,'' but no mention was made of
inspections, and no judgment made about what was in the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain were urged to keep negotiating
with Libya over details of the Lockerbie trial. The two, in
conceding to a trial in the Netherlands, had refused to discuss
other concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The no-flight zones over Iraq, enforced by the United States and
its allies, were ``deplored'' and member states were urged to help
lift the sanctions, but Iraq was not judged to have earned an end
to the sanctions by complying with weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the summit endorsed clauses championing the
Palestinians over Israel and Cuba over the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The summit did slip off the course along which its South African
hosts wanted to steer. They wanted a new focus on money,
particularly the widening of the gap between rich and poor, the
domination of small debtor nations by the International Monetary
Fund and the vulnerability of small countries to raids on their
currencies by speculators. The final document mentioned such
issues, but did not shift the focus away from politics to
economics.
</P>
<P>
   And the most sought-after character at the summit was definitely
a political figure. President Laurent Kabila of Congo arrived
unexpectedly on Wednesday, avoiding a welcome from South African
President Nelson Mandela. He was reported to have demanded the
first speaking slot of the 86 reserved for national leaders. Denied
it, he borrowed an early slot from an ally, Namibia's president,
and spoke about his military problems.
</P>
<P>
   His aides said he would hold a news conference ``somewhere on
the street'' because the Congolese-exile incident proved the
pressroom was unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Later, word slipped out that he would talk at a nearby Hilton
Hotel. He kept reporters waiting for five hours, then tried to slip
past them to an elevator. Cornered, he promised elections in six
months and left. He departed on a plane at 4 a.m., skipping a
breakfast meeting about the war and leaving the summit meeting to
muddle on without him.

<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ A citizens movement to protest the high price
of gasoline has become the hottest political issue in El Paso,
drawing in Texas officials and entangling itself in a contentious
proposal to open a pipeline from the Gulf Coast _ a kind of cavalry
charging to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas oil consortium that hopes to run gasoline through the
dormant pipeline, which once carried West Texas crude oil to
Houston, has fastened itself to the El Paso protest movement,
hoping to override the objections of officials in Austin and
central Texas who say they are worried about potential leaks into
crucial waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The squabble reveals not only the image that many El Paso
residents have of themselves as beleaguered victims of a
``continual and unrelenting fleecing at the hands of an
out-of-control industry,'' as Ken Haverfield, head of the consumer
group that is leading the movement, put it, but what has in recent
years become an endless tug-of-war of economic, political and
environmental interests in the nation's second largest state.
</P>
<P>
   Haverfield first heard about the consumer group he heads,
Make-a-Difference, or MAD, when he was turning the radio dial. The
group had just been formed and was having one of its first
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices in El Paso are higher than just about anyplace,''
said Haverfield, a substitute teacher. ``Rent, milk, you name it,
but especially gas. So I went to their meeting several months ago
and kind of got caught up in it.'' Two meetings later, he was
chairman. Not long after, he was president. And last Thursday,
Haverfield found himself sitting before a microphone in the El Paso
Civic Center, testifying to a pair of reassuring congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Haverfield and his supporters say that until recently gasoline
prices for most of the last 20 years have been 10 to 20 cents a
gallon higher in El Paso than in Houston. They believe it is the
result of a conspiracy by producers to artificially inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is not so sure. John Cook, director of
the oil and gas division of the Federal Energy Information
Administration, said that while his agency did find a history of
high gasoline prices in El Paso _ 10 to 15 cents a gallon higher
than in Houston _ the differential is not unusual. There are many
such regional differentials in the United States, he said, caused
by variations in taxes, geography, competition and the laws of
supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of El Paso's gasoline problem is geographic. The city
is more than 700 miles from the Gulf of Mexico, where gasoline is
cheaper to produce; residents often note they are about as close to
Los Angeles, three states away, as they are to Houston. And while
there are many refineries on the Gulf Coast, drawing crude oil from
all over the world, there is only one in El Paso, a relatively
small Chevron plant that draws its crude solely from the more
expensive West Texas fields. The rest of El Paso's gasoline is from
fields and refineries farther west, where gasoline is more
expensive to produce than it is on the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's geography or not, I don't know, but we're like a
lot of people wondering why it is that gas is so expensive in El
Paso,'' said David Morales, spokesman for the Cab Association of El
Paso, another proponent of lower gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the consortium, Longhorn Partners Pipeline, took over
an 18-inch-wide, 430-mile-long Exxon pipeline that had been
carrying crude from the West Texas fields into Houston and the Gulf
Coast refineries. The plan was to clean out the pipe, test its
structural integrity, build a 250-mile extension west into El Paso
and ship gasoline, diesel and jet fuel through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started to go out to El Paso three or four years ago,'' said
Carter Montgomery, president of Longhorn, which includes Amoco and
Exxon among its investors. ``The attitude out there has always
been, bring on the pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of several
ranchers charges that the pipeline project violates environmental
restrictions. The suit is being underwritten by the Navajo Refining
Co., a leading distributor of gasoline to El Paso, Montgomery said,
and a potential competitor of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   So last month, Longhorn filed suit against Navajo, charging it
with violating antitrust laws ``in an attempt to maintain
artificially high gas prices'' in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The suit against Longhorn, though, attracted the attention of
politicians and water officials in central Texas. Both the city of
Austin and the Lower Colorado River Authority joined in the suit,
demanding that Longhorn conduct an environmental impact study
before using the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a U.S. District judge in Austin agreed and ordered
the study, which Montgomery said would delay the project up to two
years. It is unnecessary, Montgomery said, since the pipeline
consortium has already conducted sufficient tests.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rose, general manager of the Lower Colorado River
Authority, said his group's concern was one of safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our issue is that they are reconverting a 50-year-old pipeline
that once carried West Texas crude to now carry gasoline, diesel
and jet fuel,'' Rose said. ``The goal to get gasoline to El Paso is
a noble one. We just hope it doesn't turn out to be tragically bad
for everyone in central Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery said that Longhorn was continuing to build the
pipeline and appealing the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices in El Paso, which has a per capita income well
below that of other major Texas cities, remain a staple of the
talk-radio shows. But Wayne Ederer, regional marketing director for
Chevron, cannot see why. ``I feel there is a lot of
misunderstanding out there among the citizens,'' he said. ``They
see a refinery here and refineries in Houston and wonder why prices
are higher here. They don't understand the cost situation that we
have, using more expensive West Texas crude.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Haverfield said that the producers have no one to blame but
themselves for the widespread distrust. ``We've tried to get
answers from them,'' he said. ``If you can get them on the phone,
all you end up with is scrambled eggs. You can't figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   A dip in the price of gasoline here since March has further
muddied the situation. Chevron and other distributors say it is a
result of an increase in the local supply. Haverfield and others
believe it has something to do with the pressure applied by his
organization and by local politicians, including Mayor Carlos
Ramirez and Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did notice that the price of gasoline here this morning was
competitive with what it was when I left Houston,'' said Rep. Gene
Green, a Houston Democrat who joined Reyes at the public hearing in
the civic center last week. ``If it'll help keep the prices down,
I'll be glad to come out here every couple of weeks for a public
hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery says it has become a pleasure for Longhorn officials
to visit El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a 5-K road race a while back that we agreed to help
sponsor,'' he said. ``At the end, when they read the list of
sponsors and they got to our name, everybody in the audience stood
up and applauded. I mean, we had 2,500 people standing up,
applauding us.''
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, does not happen every day in the pipeline
business.

IRABU IS SPINNING OUT OF YANKS' ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Hideki Irabu was a Cy Young award candidate in May, a
possible All-Star in June. Now he is in jeopardy of being dropped
from the Yankees' rotation and, eventually, from their playoff
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Warned before he took the mound Sunday that he needed to
improve, Irabu regressed, giving up six runs in two and one-third
innings to the Chicago White Sox, with George Steinbrenner in
attendance. The Yankees never recovered from the hole Irabu dug for
them, losing, 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost 10 of their last 18 games, their chances
of breaking the single-season record for victories waning; they
must win 17 of their last 22 to pass the mark of 116, set by the
1906 Chicago Cubs. But their focus seems to have shifted, from
winning every game possible to preparing for the playoffs that
begin Sept. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre is operating his team as he might in spring
training, resting at least one regular player daily, placing
relievers in situations they may face in October. These are war
games, not the real thing. But Irabu (11-8) has been terrible in
his last four starts, compiling a 16.07 ERA, his composite ERA
climbing to more than four runs per game _ it is now at 4.28 _ for
the first time all season.
</P>
<P>
   Torre indicated after the game that Irabu would make his next
scheduled start, against Toronto on Friday in Yankee Stadium.
Immediate shifts are always possible with the Yankees, however;
asked about Irabu, Steinbrenner said, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre left open the possibility that Irabu may be switched to
the bullpen if he does not get better, and Irabu knows he is
pitching on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not entirely sure what my position is going to be, going
forward,'' Irabu said, through an interpreter, in an even tone.
When his teammate Derek Jeter tried getting Irabu's attention and
making a joke to get a smile from Irabu, the pitcher barely
responded. He spoke more expressively Sunday, more analytically
than he has in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to be speaking to my pitching coach and my
manager about what they want me to do,'' he said. ``They're going
to decide, and I'm going to leave it up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu had a league-leading 1.59 ERA on June 10, his record 6-1,
winning with an erratic array of pitches. Some days only his
fastball would be effective, but he would change locations,
sometimes throw it low and sometimes high and always hard. Some
days he had a good split-finger fastball, getting ahead in the
count and then luring opposing hitters into swinging at the
splitter in the dirt. He mixed in a curveball in a couple of
starts.
</P>
<P>
   As catcher Jorge Posada explained after Sunday's game, Irabu now
is throwing his fastball in one spot, on one plane and throwing his
splitter high as well. He walked the first two hitters he faced
Sunday before repeatedly throwing fastballs and splitters
thigh-high, and the White Sox rocketed hits from foul line to foul
line, all line drives.

<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, who was removed from the rotation when Orlando
Hernandez was promoted in June, relieved Irabu and pitched four and
two-thirds strong innings. Torre mentioned that in picking his
post-season starters, reliability will be important, because the
margin for error in a three-of-five or four-of-seven-game series is
greatly reduced. In three of Irabu's last four starts, he was
knocked out in the first four innings. Mendoza is unspectacular and
does not produce strikeouts, but he was reliable as a starting
pitcher before being supplanted by Hernandez in June.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting Mendoza to the rotation protects the Yankees in two
ways. First, he is a better pitcher than Irabu is now, and second,
if Jeff Nelson's back fails and Hernandez is shifted to the bullpen
to replace Nelson, Mendoza would be one of the Yankees' four
post-season starters. If Nelson's back holds up, then Hernandez
would probably be one of the Yankees' four starters, with Mendoza
moving to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Torre intends to keep 10 pitchers on his post-season roster, and
barring injury, at least nine of those spots are clinched: David
Cone, David Wells, Andy Pettitte, Hernandez, Mendoza, Mariano
Rivera, Graeme Lloyd, Mike Stanton and Jeff Nelson. Mike Buddie,
Darren Holmes and Irabu are vying for that last spot.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he was pleased with Irabu's effort Sunday, but in
recent starts, Irabu has appeared frustrated on the mound,
discouraged and passive. Pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre would like
to see that change; he wants to see Irabu fight on the mound,
attack hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I wish he'd get a little bit more fire,'' Stottlemyre
said. ``I know he's upset and he gets mad when he comes in here'' _
the clubhouse _ ``but I wish he'd just get more aggressive with
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Irabu may have one more start to be aggressive. Or maybe he does
not.

CLINTON'S FATE ON MANY MINDS AS CONGRESS RETURNS TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-HYDE, MIDTERM-POLITICS) 
(sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democratic hand-wringing over President
Clinton's personal behavior is intensifying as Congress returns to
Washington this week for its final month of business.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a full agenda of appropriations bills and a now-likely
showdown in the Senate on campaign finance, the president's fate
remains Topic A since he admitted three weeks ago to having had an
inappropriate relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White
House intern, and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Moran, D-Va., and strong political ally of the
president, said on Sunday that Clinton would be lucky to get away
with only a censure by Congress. More likely, he said, the
president would face impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now don't think that that is really an option,'' Moran said
of censure, speaking on Fox News Sunday. ``I think we're bound to
go through with impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, one of the leading
Democrats in the Senate, said that there was ``a crisis in the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot have this kind of conduct as normal and acceptable
and easily dismissed unless there is a great effort to do so,''
said Moynihan, speaking on the ABC News program ``This Week.''
``And if, in addition to what we know, there are things we don't
know, that will make it worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said that Congress, which is planning to adjourn early
next month so members can campaign for re-election, should stay in
session as long as it takes to resolve the president's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is anxiously waiting for Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, to send a report of his investigation of
Clinton to the House Judiciary Committee. Only then can it set a
course of action.
</P>
<P>
   Discouraging words are coming, too, for the president from two
Democratic strongholds, New York and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Some New York Democrats have begun quietly suggesting that the
president delay a major fund-raising event for the Democratic Party
in New York set for Sept. 14, the night before the primary, saying
that it could create an awkward moment for the Democratic Senate
candidates. But Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of
the Senate Democrats' campaign committee, said Sunday on the CBS
News program ``Face The Nation'' that the New York fund-raiser,
expected to be the biggest in the party's history, was on track.
</P>
<P>
   And Parris Glendening, the Democratic governor of Maryland, has
canceled an October fund-raising appearance with Clinton, fearing
it could backfire on his tenuous bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The moves and comments follow a severe dressing-down of Clinton
on Thursday by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who appears to have
opened the way for more Democrats to express their concern about
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties said on Sunday that they perceive
Clinton as severely weakened politically and are openly discussing
the effect of his continuing crisis in confidence on the fate of
legislation and on world events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis of the regime,'' Moynihan said. ``We have
nothing more important to do in the nation's interest,'' he said of
getting the Starr report and a quick congressional response. ``This
is a distraction which is doubly dangerous because of the world
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Moran: ``His credibility is obviously severely diminished.
I don't know how he can ever recover the strength of the bully
pulpit that he needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., said that the president would be
hard-pressed to veto tax cuts that he has rebuffed in the past as
unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have a chance to put through a tax bill that
would get rid of the marriage tax penalty, that will lighten up
death taxes somewhat,'' Cox said on Fox News Sunday. ``And this is
something that wouldn't have been possible if the president were
stronger.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, promised
Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' that the Senate
would take up campaign finance legislation, perhaps as early as
this week. Lott and other Republican leaders had resisted bringing
up the measure, but they faced more pressure to do so once the
House, in a surprise vote, passed the overhaul last month.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said under conditions of anonymity on Sunday that
Lott had two motivations in bringing up the dicey issue: to avoid
an internal Republican split with senators who supported
overhauling the campaign finance laws, and to give more credence to
Republican calls for Janet Reno, the attorney general, to appoint
an independent counsel to investigate Clinton and Vice President Al
Gore for possible campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he was uncertain whether the campaign finance measure
would pass, but it is clear he wants to avoid an internal spat that
would, even temporarily, divert the spotlight from Clinton's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bill expected to be under consideration would ban the
unregulated ``soft money'' that goes indirectly to political
campaigns. The bill's sponsors, Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., had threatened to attach it to other
legislation headed for the floor, which could severely disrupt
Senate action.

 COMMENTARY: AN INSULT TO HARLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-YOUTH-MARCH)  
(js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the end the ordinary people of Harlem proved to be
smarter and far more responsible than either Khallid Muhammad or
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are provocateurs and both were spoiling for a fight on
Saturday. Muhammad did his usual number on whites and Jews. And he
wrapped up his ugly speech by urging his listeners, if attacked, to
retaliate by treating the police the way some officers in Brooklyn
treated Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant whom prosecutors say was
tortured while in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who is supposed to be the mayor of the entire city,
abused the power of his office by turning a large section of Harlem
into a police encampment. By doing that he humiliated thousands of
perfectly peaceful and law-abiding residents whose only offense was
that they are black.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to the riot. The people
kept their heads. They never bought into the hateful rhetoric
spewed by a succession of clowns from the speakers' platform. And
they refused, despite feeling bitter and hurt, to lash out at the
police officers who showed up by the thousands on Saturday morning
and locked down the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The cops came ready for war. Residents who emerged from their
apartments and brownstones at the start of a beautiful holiday
weekend were greeted by an army of police officers who had arrived
with helicopters, horses, tractor-trailer trucks, buses, cars, vans
and motorcycles. Police barricades seemed to go up everywhere.
Subway stations were shut down, their entrances blocked by yellow
tape that read, ``Police line _ do not cross.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrible,'' said Debra Morrison, who belongs to a
community group called the Harlem Gateway Committee. ``It's like
they want trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of blocks surrounding the site of the afternoon rally
were closed off. People attempting to go to the rally were treated
perversely. The police would tell them they could approach the site
from, say, 123rd Street. The people would walk to 123rd, only to be
told they would have to go down to 119th. There they would find
that 119th was closed, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are they doing this?'' a woman asked me. She was on the
verge of tears.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman said, ``I'm trying to get to my church, but they
won't let me.'' A woman beside her said, ``I'm trying to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   A man who walked away from one of the barricades said, in
obvious frustration: ``I can't let it get the best of me. They
treat us like we're all criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people were upset. But they did not hassle the officers
posted at the barricades. And the officers, for the most part,
treated the people respectfully. A cop, who asked that his name not
be used, said to me: ``You know where the orders are coming from.
The people are fine. Not one problem. But I have to follow my
orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Giuliani would never, but never, treat an entire
neighborhood of white people the way he treated the people in the
vicinity of Lenox Avenue on Saturday. The so-called Million Youth
March was a failure in the sense that only a few thousand people
showed up, and very few of them were teen-agers. Muhammad's message
of hate was soundly rejected by young black people.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani, by deploying his police as if all black people
were a mortal threat, succeeded in intensifying the opposition
among blacks toward him and his policy of police overkill. The
anti-Giuliani feeling among black people in this city is
overwhelming and growing.
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to have helicopters swooping down and buzzing
the rooftops on Lenox Avenue on Saturday. This was Harlem, not
Vietnam. There was no need for cops in riot gear to storm a rally
that was ending. The rally had certainly been repugnant, but it was
neither violent nor illegal. The threat to the peace came from
Giuliani's police.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is playing with fire. He may feel that it is in his
political interest to keep beating up on black people. It may help
him as he does his little dance in front of Republican groups
around the country that had no use for black people to begin with.
But it is not in the city's interest. Black New Yorkers are fed up
with Giuliani's abuse and contempt. He seems not to care, which
insures that a bad situation will only get worse.

COMMENTARY: WHEN A RACE BECOMES A RIDDLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is the sound of three hands clapping?
</P>
<P>
   New York's 1998 Democratic Senate primary was supposed to be
brutal. It was supposed to be filled with vicious attack ads, ugly
slurs and deliberately circulated innuendoes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, to the mystification of voters and the immense
disappointment of journalists, the race is shaping up more as an
enigma than as a blood bath. What is it about? No one can quite
agree. This includes the candidates themselves, who, rather than
campaign against one another would prefer, it seems, to play
make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City public advocate, Mark Green, is pretending
that the race is a two-man contest between him and Rep. Charles
Schumer. By Green's account, the key issue is a series of votes
that Schumer cast, starting in the mid-1980s, that when properly
interpreted, reveal him to be a crypto-middle-of-the-roader. That
Geraldine Ferraro is also running is a fact Green has simply chosen
not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, meanwhile, has chosen just as pointedly not to notice
Green. Shrugging off the criticisms of his votes, he has devoted
himself to spending his sizable war chest on upbeat television ads.
The race, he often states, is about who has the strongest record of
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro has, for her part, feigned indifference toward both
Green and Schumer, acting as if they were not so much her rivals as
mere extras in her own life drama. To the extent that she has
defined the race at all, she has cast it as a referendum on star
power: Who among the candidates is famous enough to play in the big
leagues?
</P>
<P>
   The lack of direct engagement has given the race a
disconcertingly Pirandello-like quality. One could call it ``Three
Candidates in Search of an Issue,'' except that would imply they
were actually trying to find one.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the preternatural calm of this year's
primary is a matter of consensus, of candidates so similar in
outlook that they have nothing much to debate. But that was
precisely the marvel of Democratic primaries in the past: watching
candidates destroy each other over the subtlest shades of
ideological difference.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate primary race, there is a great deal of common
ground, especially between Schumer and Ferraro. But the
contestants, by disposition, background and belief, are hardly soul
mates. If they wanted to find something to argue about, there is
more than enough material to work with. It is rather that they
have, quite deliberately, elected not to.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democratic leaders seem greatly relieved that the race
is as lifeless as it is. They happily compare it with the
all-too-dramatic Senate primary of six years ago, when Ferraro ran
against Elizabeth Holtzman, then the city comptroller; Robert
Abrams, then state attorney general; and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams carried the day but went on to lose the general election
to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. The margin was small enough that Democrats
widely blamed his defeat on the destructive nature of the primary
that had preceded it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the campaign has been positive,'' said John Marino,
the former head of the state Democratic Party, referring to this
year's Senate contest. ``It's definitely not 1992; since I was the
chairman then, I can tell you that. And I think that's bad news for
Al D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   In the remaining week of the race, this year's Democratic
hopefuls could, of course, still lose their reserve and revert to
more confrontational tactics. Not infrequently, campaigns do turn
bitter in the final days, when the contenders feel themselves
running out of alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, at least, the lesson of 1992 seems to be sticking.
Just as the Senate race is eerily becalmed, so, too, is the
gubernatorial primary, despite the provocative presence of Lt. Gov.
Betsy McCaughey Ross.
</P>
<P>
   During a debate last week, just before Wilbur Ross officially
cut back his wife's allowance, all four Democratic candidates for
governor made a point of crediting one another with good ideas and
underscoring their agreement on everything from education to health
care.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend keeps up, it will soon no longer be possible to
make fun of the Democrats for their fratricidal antics. But if that
happens, it isn't clear that voters or reporters will be paying
enough attention to notice.
</P>

 &HT;    On Deck: New York Mets
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South; 750 AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (14-11, 3.69 ERA;
5-3, 4.05 lifetime vs. Mets) vs. RHP Masato Yoshii (5-8, 3.91; 0-2,
8.39 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Neagle makes his 31st start, in search of his fourth
straight win. Since losing 1-0 at Los Angeles Aug. 16, he's beaten
the Dodgers, Cards and, most recently, the Astros last Tuesday in
Atlanta. Neagle gave up 10 hits and four earned runs that night in
the Braves' 6-4 victory. Part of his recent success: While Neagle
has been tagged for a team-high 25 homers, he has allowed just one
in his last three starts. He's 1-0 in two starts this year against
the Mets; he went seven no-decision innings in an 11-inning, 3-2
win July 5 at Turner Field, then easily beat Yoshii at Shea 12-1 on
July 15 (six innings, four hits, one run). The Mets' Butch Huskey
and Brian McRae have each homered twice off Neagle in the past,
while John Olerud (4-for-10, 1 HR) and Mike Piazza (9-for-24)
usually hit him well. In losing his two starts against Atlanta,
Yoshii gave up 16 hits and 11 runs (nine earned) in just 9 2/3
innings. On July 15 at Shea, he lasted just 3 2/3 innings,
surrendering seven earned runs on nine hits, including homers to
Andres Galarraga and Ryan Klesko. Collectively, the Braves are
batting .400 (16-for-40) against Yoshii.

 &HT;    Lighthouse: New life for coast landmark
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAPELO ISLAND, GA _ One of the most enduring symbols of
Georgia's maritime heritage was given new life Sunday night: For
the first time in nearly a century, the Sapelo Island lighthouse is
once again guiding ship captains and fishermen through Georgia's
coastal waters.
</P>
<P>
   With red stripes accenting its gleaming white tower, the
80-foot-tall lighthouse has been restored, making it the third
working lighthouse on the Georgia coast. The other two are on Tybee
and St. Simons islands.
</P>
<P>
   With the flick of a switch, Gov. Zell Miller turned on the
light, flashing in the original sequence used more than a century
ago to guide sailing vessels through the treacherous coastal
waters. The beam can be seen 12 miles out to sea and in the
surrounding sounds and estuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this week, three-hour tours of the lighthouse and the
island will be offered on Saturdays by the state Department of
Natural Resources. Visitors will be able to climb the spiral
staircase and enjoy spectacular vistas of the island, Doboy Sound
and the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from a clump of red cedars, wax myrtles and pines on a
marshy spit of the remote island, the Sapelo lighthouse stood
weather-beaten, forlorn and darkened until lighthouse aficionados
undertook an eight-month, $500,000 effort to save it. The makeover
shored up the lighthouse's crumbling, 65-foot-tall brick tower _
originally built in 1820 _ and added a stucco exterior that was
painted with the distinctive red and white bands. New glass and the
new light were installed in the 15-foot-tall, cast-iron cupola at
the top of the tower, and the termite-infested wooden staircase was
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a lighthouse that looks much as it did more than a
century ago when its beacon guided lumber-laden schooners from the
bustling port of nearby Darien. ``It's a true monument to Georgia's
rich maritime heritage,'' said Lonice Barrett, commissioner of the
Department of Natural Resources who helped lead the restoration
effort. The Sapelo lighthouse was one of 15 that once stood along
Georgia's 100 miles of coastline. Sapelo's light was darkened in
1898 when a hurricane severely damaged its tower. It was replaced
in 1905 by a 100-foot steel lighthouse, which was active for nearly
30 years until it was dismantled and shipped to Fox Island in Lake
Michigan.

 &HT;    Malloy's amazing vs. Mets
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the land of the unlikeliest Atlanta longballs,
where Rafael Belliard went once-in-a-decade deep last September,
what Marty Malloy did Sunday rendered Raffy's homer a relatively
sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' said a stunned Malloy, who was
called up from Class AAA Richmond in the middle of the night,
arrived here 2 1/2 hours before Sunday's first pitch and, in his
second big-league at-bat, hit one of Atlanta's four solo homers to
help propel John Smoltz to a 4-0 win over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no words that can de- scribe today,'' said Malloy, who
started at second base on 90 minutes sleep and batted second, ``and
just getting called up, and a guy who doesn't hit many home runs in
the minor leagues, and my first hit in the big leagues is a home
run.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven seasons in the minors, from Idaho Falls to Richmond,
Malloy had hit just 33 homers in 2,906 at-bats. In his second
major-league at-bat, on the ninth pitch he saw from Rick Reed
(who'd caught Malloy looking in the first inning), Malloy drilled a
2-2 inside fastball into the Mets bullpen. Then he used the word
Casey Stengel once used to describe the original Mets: ``Amazing.
That made it 2-0, Ryan Klesko having hit his 17th home run in the
second inning. Andruw Jones' 27th homer (and fifth in 11 games) was
nice, but unnecessary. So, too, was No. 43 by Andres Galarraga,
back in the lineup after a three-game suspension. The way Smoltz
threw Sunday, Klesko's first homer in nearly a month was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if I throw like that, there's a lot of lineups I'm
going to have success against,'' said Smoltz (14-3), who struck out
a season-high 12, walked none and allowed just three singles for
his second shutout of the season and 13th of his career. ``I had my
fastball today. Because I was banging strikes, they had to come out
and swing at the most hittable pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just got good (stuff),'' said Tony Phillips, who, like
John Olerud, struck out three times in his first look at Smoltz.
``He's just good.''

 &HT;    Solid Falcons on the right track
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charlotte, NC -- This franchise has taken so many wrong turns
that even a glimpse of the Right Way seems disquieting. How can we
be sure that this isn't just another false clue, another buildup
destined to spawn only deeper disappointment?
</P>
<P>
   Because this time looks different, feels different, is
different. That's how.
</P>
<P>
   A Falcon since 1987, Jessie Tuggle had never opened a season on
the road and gone home a winner, never until Sunday. A Falcon for
11 of the darkest seasons any player has known, Tuggle had absorbed
every sort of galling defeat known to man. And it was possible,
even on the final snap, that this day would bring another. But you
know what? Even Tuggle didn't believe that an end-zone tip would
undo his team. Not this time. This time felt ... different.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in the same situation so many times and one little
thing has gone against us,'' Tuggle said. ``But this time we got a
break. We finally got a break.''
</P>
<P>
   A batted ball, there for Carolina's catching, hit the turf. The
Falcons won. They won by being both good and lucky, two things they
absolutely haven't been for most of their existence. They won not
just because they survived the last play but because they prevailed
on the majority of those preceding it did. They outfought and
outskilled an opponent that spent a record $27 million on free
agents. They were the more solid team in a test of solidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying it the last five years,'' said Chuck Smith,
the assertive defensive end. ``This is exactly how you win. Morten
(Andersen) made the kicks. We stopped them when we had to.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing fancy, nothing to inspire awe on the part of any
witness. At the same time, there was never a moment when the
Falcons seemed anything less than the stronger side. ``Physically
we dominated this football game,'' said defensive tackle Travis
Hall, correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chandler made enough precise throws. The offensive line
and Jamal Anderson killed off five vital minutes near the end. The
Falcons made no turnovers. This was good, basic football, the brand
Dan Reeves promised upon taking this job.
</P>
<P>
   With free agency and the salary cap, the day of the overpowering
NFL team is gone. Every club has similar resources. The teams that
win are those that maximize theirs. You maximize not by dazzling
gimmickry but by boring old repetition. ``Consistency,'' said
running back Anderson, ``that's the thing Dan Reeves preaches.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that's what separates Reeves from Glanville and
Henning and June Jones. The Reeves Method isn't going to erode over
time. The fundamental endures. Said Tuggle: ``It's about solid
techniques, about playing good football on offense and defense.
It's not like we're out there tricking people or playing some crazy
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to suggest that the Falcons are bound for the Super
Bowl, even a measly wild card. This is Year 2 of a process. But
having beheld so much bleakness with this team, it is possible to
look upon these Falcons and see only promise. ``So many times we've
thought we were on the right track,'' Tuggle said, and this time
they are.

 &HT;    Dwight catching on
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his final game at Iowa last year, Tim Dwight broke free on a
post pattern, setting up a dream finish to his sparkling college
career. But a bad thing happened on the way to a long touchdown. He
dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to Sunday at Ericsson Stadium for the rookie's
first regular-season NFL game. Dwight ran past the Panthers'
secondary in the third quarter, just like he did in his last
collegiate home game. The ball, from quarterback Chris Chandler,
floated toward Dwight. ``It seemed like it took a year to get
there,'' Dwight said.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough time for Dwight to recall his gaffe at Iowa. ``My
heart stopped beating while the ball was up there,'' he said. ``It
took a long time to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ball arrived, Dwight cradled it and sprinted into the
end zone to complete a 44-yard touchdown that was significant in
the Falcons' 19-14 victory over Carolina. He ran as fast to the
bench after the score as he did in getting open. And he had a
souvenir to mark the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe I caught an NFL touchdown,'' he said. ``But
I sure as heck was going to keep that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, nobody wanted to take it from him. Dwight has been a
eager student under veterans Terance Mathis and Tony Martin, and
his efforts Sunday confirmed their preseason thoughts of the
5-foot-8, 184-pound return specialist drafted in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about Randy Moss (the receiver taken by
Minnesota in the first round),'' Mathis said. ``Our guy returns
punts, kickoffs and scores on offense. I don't know. I think
everyone's looking at the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Moss showed his brilliance in his first pro game
Sunday with two touchdowns in the Vikings' demolition of Tampa Bay.
The point really was that Dwight brings to the Falcons elements the
team sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, who led the NCAA in punt returns last season with a
19.3-yard average, got only one chance Sunday _ and that was a fair
catch. But he did amass 70 yards on three kickoff returns to go
with the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's explosive on punts,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``A guy
breaks free, and he makes him miss. He has speed, great vision. And
he's a tough, hard-nosed receiver. He doesn't shy away from blocks.
And he's a big target because he uses his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight played only four offensive plays in the game. In the
first three, he was not involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a long way to go,'' Dwight said. ``I did some things
right and some things wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``More right than wrong,'' Mathis told him.

 &HT;    Anderson's carries eat precious time
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, NC _ The hope in Suwanee all summer was that the
Falcons' opening day performance would bare some resemblance to a
team that won six of eight games down the stretch. Instead, for two
quarters, the offense resembled the biggest reason most fans
stopped watching after a 1-7 start.
</P>
<P>
   Stunts and blitzes confused Atlanta's defensive front. Jamal
Anderson was averaging 1.9 yards per carry. Chris Chandler was
sacked three times on 19 pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Falcons did something unusual. They kept trying to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we kept pounding the ball, eventually it would pay
off,'' center Robbie Tobeck said. ``That hasn't been the case in
the past, but it hasn't been the philosophy of our coaching staff
in the past to keep running. We started to make the transition last
year, but it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's post run-and-shoot efforts to establish a rushing
attack paid dividends in the second half against Carolina. Anderson
rushed for 67 yards in the second half (88 in the game), enabling
the Falcons to consume time, keep Carolina's weary defense on the
field and pull out a 19-14 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into this game knowing we had to run to win,'' Anderson
said. ``You don't come here just thinking you're going to smash
Kevin Greene and Sean Gilbert. But you need to get the running game
going to win. I think the Denver Broncos proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, already a starter, saw his role become even more
important after the season-ending knee injury to Byron Hanspard,
who figured to get about 10 carries per game. Harold Green was the
team's second-leading rusher with just 4 yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lost Byron, I knew we wouldn't have that one-two
punch,'' said Anderson, who ran for 23 yards his first two carries
of the second half. ``Since I've been here, it was by (Erric)
Pegram or me and Ironhead (Heyward) or me and Hanspard.''
</P>
<P>
   The 28 carries in the late-summer heat took it's toll on
Anderson, who said, ``It's hot and I'm not skinny.'' But Carolina's
front seven wore down faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we talked about doing all training camp,'' guard
Calvin Collins said. ``You could tell they were getting tired in
the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tobeck: ``You play football because you love to be
physical. There's no better feeling than when you win a game like
this.''

BRADLEY, IN HIS OWN METHODICAL WAY, PREPARING 2000 PRESIDENTIAL
RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURF CITY, N.J. _ In his Hall of Fame career with the New York
Knicks, Bill Bradley lacked the insouciant grace of a natural
athlete. Instead, his were the precise rhythms of a workaholic who
had practiced every move, from his signature pull-up jumpers to his
scoop shots and reverse dribbles, hundreds of thousands of times.
</P>
<P>
   So it is these days with Bill Bradley the politician. In his
methodical way, Bradley, 55, has begun building the architecture
for a presidential campaign in 2000, piece by tiny piece. Though he
says he has not decided whether to run, he is talking more
seriously about it with close advisers, and taking more concrete
steps to prepare for it, than at any other time since 1988, when he
was first mentioned as a possible presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's advisers say that his goal is to have a shadow
campaign in place so that if he does run, he will be able to
quickly assemble a powerful political and fund-raising network. He
will need one to compete with other likely Democratic candidates
who have been building campaign machines for years, particularly
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just him flirting with the idea'' of running for
president, said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., a friend of Bradley.
``This is someone who has steadfastly plodded along toward that
goal. He is just doing it in his Bradleyesque way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has hired two full-time aides, one of whom, Ed
Turlington, is a seasoned campaign operative who most recently
worked for North Carolina Gov. James Hunt. He has revived his
political action committee, Time Future Inc., and begun
contributing money to candidates across the country who could play
important local roles in a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has asked contributors and politicians around the country not
to commit to other candidates until he makes up his mind _ by the
end of this year, he said. He has recruited politicians to help run
local operations, including the minority leader of the New Jersey
state Senate, Richard Codey, who has agreed to help manage a New
Jersey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He has even begun some street campaigning: Sunday he shook hands
in seven towns along the Jersey Shore, reviving a Labor Day
tradition from his three terms in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and people close to him say that there are some very
personal reasons he is considering a presidential run more
seriously than ever before. Most important, they say, is the
improved health of his wife, Ernestine, who was found to have
breast cancer in 1992. The disease has been in remission, Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said that he felt better prepared mentally to be
president than he has in the past, having gained foreign policy
experience in the Senate and extensively traveled the country as a
speaker, television commentator and visiting professor at Stanford
and Notre Dame universities. He is also about to launch a national
promotional tour for his third book, ``Values of the Game,'' about
the life lessons learned from playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters say there is another reason they are strongly
urging Bradley to run in 2000: At a time that President Clinton's
problems with the Monica Lewinsky matter and campaign finance
practices may have begun to tarnish Gore, Bradley is perfectly
positioned to run as the un-Clinton, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that people are going to be looking for someone
who is not just Mr. Clean, but that has character and integrity,
after the debacle of the last six years,'' said Herbert Allen, an
investment banker who has contributed to Bradley for years. ``There
is an underlying current that this is one of the most corrupt
administrations in history, and Bill is the antithesis of that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore is facing a preliminary investigation by the Justice
Department of possible campaign finance abuses _ an investigation
that could lead to the appointment of an independent prosecutor _
Bradley can point to speeches he made as a senator warning against
the corrosive influence of money on politics and advocating an
overhaul of campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley denies that the Clinton administration's problems, or
Gore's perceived weaknesses, will have any affect on his decision.
``You don't make this kind of life decision on a tactical basis,''
he said in an interview between beach stops Sunday as he munched on
baby carrots.
</P>
<P>
   But sunbathers along the hazy New Jersey shore, many of whom had
hearty greetings for Bradley, seemed to have President Clinton's
problems vividly on their minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some moral character, and from what I know of Bill
Bradley, he's got that,'' Brad Henson, a municipal prosecutor from
Surf City, said after shaking Bradley's hand.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley asked another man, Jeffrey Rosen from West Orange,
whether he should run for president, Rosen replied: ``I think it's
a wonderful idea. We need the best of our people to run,
particularly given what's going on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his lectures at Stanford and Notre Dame, Bradley has clearly
been trying out broad themes that he believes could resonate with
voters. These include helping Americans adjust to the globalization
of markets, assisting single-parent families and families with two
working parents, and giving people a greater sense of community.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most tellingly, his lectures include a call for reviving
America's battered political soul with a new kind of unheroic
leadership that sounds suspiciously like a description of, well,
Bill Bradley: laconic and undramatic. As he put it, ``An orchestra
leader rather than a white knight.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say Bradley faces several major obstacles if
he does choose to run, including a relatively late start in
fund-raising. Some Democrats also say Bradley must mend fences with
Democrats who feel that he denigrated the party by saying American
politics was ``broken'' when he retired from the Senate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats say that his anti-politician style _ he has
spent much of the last two years railing against special interest
politics and poll-driven policy making _ will strike many voters as
quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some say Jerry Brown was a breath of fresh air,'' said Rep.
Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. ``But others called him Governor Moonbeam. The
same might be said of Bill Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley, a fiercely private man, seems to be grappling with
more personal concerns as he ponders whether to run: the loss of
freedom and the intense public scrutiny that accompany national
campaigns today.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what were his main concerns about running, he said that
the first was whether he was the best person to run the country at
this moment in history. The second, he continued, was whether ``my
wife and family and I want to jump off a 50-story building with no
idea whether there is a net at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I've never done it.''

MORE FRIENDLY EXCHANGES IN GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is standard practice in politics to gang up on the
front-runner. But for the second time in four days, the Democrats
running for governor held a televised debate Sunday and the
candidate recognized by his rivals as the leader, Peter Vallone,
emerged largely unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   The only criticism of Vallone, the New York City Council
speaker, was aimed at his fund-raising success, as his rivals
claimed to be the true champions of campaign finance reform and
pleaded virtue in their relative poverty. For much of the hour, the
candidates continued the friendly tone that marked a debate
Wednesday night in Troy, N.Y., referring to their foes by first
names and even praising one another's arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates, District Attorney Charles Hynes of Brooklyn and
James Larocca, a former state transportation commissioner, said
going into the session at the WABC television studios in Manhattan
that they would begin to turn their sights on Vallone. But the
zingers never materialized. Instead, they saved their sharpest
barbs for another rival, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross. The event
was broadcast live Sunday morning and again Sunday night on WABC,
and was carried on other ABC affiliates around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a week before the Sept. 15 primary, with polls showing
Vallone ahead, his rivals are running out of time to draw interest
to their ill-financed candidacies in a race that has hardly
galvanized public attention. As the candidates themselves have
often noted, there is little that separates them on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins will have a difficult time against the popular
Republican incumbent, Gov. George Pataki, in no small measure
because Pataki is expected to spend as much as $20 million on this
race. With two months to go until the general election, Vallone has
been the top Democratic fund-raiser, collecting $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   All four Democrats railed Sunday against the current system,
which they said favored wealthy donors and the politicians who did
their bidding. Vallone boasted, as he often does, of the New York
City rules he helped create that limit political contributions,
provide public financing of campaigns and restrict ``soft money,''
the unlimited contributions to political parties. But Hynes noted
that Vallone had taken contributions from business interests that
seek contracts or zoning decisions from the city. He asserted that
the need for reform would be an issue in the general election, and
that the Democratic nominee would need to be able to tar Pataki as
a captive of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make that case credibly,'' he said. ``Peter Vallone
cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Larocca noted that he was the only candidate who was not an
elected official. ``The real problem we have here is that money is
washing over our political system,'' he said. ``I'm the only member
of this panel who is not part of that system.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Vallone called the criticism inaccurate,
saying, ``I have something like 3,500 contributors, many of whom
have contributed under $100.'' He said that Larocca's and Hynes'
stances amounted to advocating that the Democrats unilaterally
disarm in the face of the Republicans' fund-raising advantage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. McCaughey Ross, who switched from the Republican Party last
year, was considered a leading contender for the nomination for
much of this year, but her campaign has stumbled badly. Last week,
her husband, Wilbur Ross Jr., a wealthy investment banker, withdrew
more than half of the $4 million he had committed to her effort.
There has also been turnover and dissension within the campaign,
and after campaigning energetically for months, she has made few
public appearances of late.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's debate, the lieutenant governor seemed oddly
detached. She sometimes wandered so far from the questions that she
was chided by the moderator, Robb Hanrahan, a WABC reporter. She
also refrained from attacking Vallone, a tactic that she later said
was a conscious decision.
</P>
<P>
   As she has throughout the campaign, Ms. McCaughey Ross, who was
Pataki's running mate in 1994, was questioned about the sincerity
of her party conversion. But on Sunday, she seemed unable to muster
much of a response.
</P>
<P>
   When a question came up about health care, the policy area of
Ms. McCaughey Ross' expertise, Larocca mentioned her rise to
national fame as the author of an article attacking President
Clinton's health care plan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Though she has persuasively defended that article to Democratic
audiences in the past, she did not even try on Sunday; she
reiterated instead her support for universal health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   She was asked by a reporter to justify her switch to progressive
Democrat from conservative Republican and supporter of Newt
Gingrich. ``You know, I've taken a lot of hits lately, including
unfair ones like this, because I have never supported Newt
Gingrich's right-wing agenda,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes responded, ``The lieutenant governor, for two-and-a-half,
almost three years, supported the governor with laudatory
comments.''
</P>
<P>
   And Larocca said: ``To suggest the question is not fair is to
suggest again that you're being victimized. You're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Vallone, adhering to the classic front-runner's strategy,
refrained from saying anything negative about anyone. But just a
few minutes after the debate ended, his aides were handing
reporters a sheet of paper juxtaposing Ms. McCaughey Ross'
disavowal of Gingrich Sunday with a statement she made four years
ago, saying that she supported most of Gingrich's ``Contract With
America.''

SOSA GOES 2-FOR-5, BUT NO HOME RUN

<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The McGwire-Sosa confrontation in St. Louis on
Monday and Tuesday is being so eagerly awaited that even the
players are having trouble finding tickets.
</P>
<P>
   This memo went out to the Chicago Cubs Sunday from the team's
traveling secretary, Jimmy Bank: ``Players and coaches will get
only six tickets each game. No exceptions! Especially you.''
</P>
<P>
   This memo came back: ``Traveling secretaries are allowed to go
through the post-game spread one time. No grazing or takeouts. No
exceptions! Especially you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs lost a game Sunday in extra innings in Pittsburgh, and
Sammy Sosa stayed at 58 home runs, but the players and coaches are
having a great time playing games that matter _ in September. This
is the first Cubs team since 1989 to have a meaningful game after
Sept. 1. The Cubs remain one game ahead of the New York Mets, who
also lost Sunday, in the National League wild-card race. And Sosa
remains two home runs behind Mark McGwire of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Staying focused on the playoffs will be a chore in St. Louis, as
the dueling home run derbies (and their news media packs) collide
for games Monday afternoon and Tuesday evening at Busch Stadium.
Everyone seems to expect Roger Maris' record of 61 home runs to
fall any minute. The record shows, however, that McGwire has gone
as long as nine games without a home run this season, and Sosa 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation will be a little bit out of control tomorrow,''
Sosa said after Sunday's game. ``Tomorrow is going to be like the
World Series. I don't want to get out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would go to bed Sunday night thinking of questions to
ask McGwire if they meet at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs players are at a high point on a roller-coaster season.
Each winning stretch this year has been followed by a bad streak.
Now they have won six out of seven, and eight out of 10. The Cubs
have their best record since 1989, when they won the National
League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home run thing is of great interest, but it's secondary,''
said Jim Riggleman, the Cubs' manager. ``Tomorrow will definitely
be a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   On a blistering day on the carpet at Three Rivers Stadium, the
Cubs lost in the 10th inning, 4-3, on a home run by Jason Kendall,
the Pirate catcher. The Pirates broke an eight-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who drew applause from Pirates fans all weekend, faced a
left-handed pitcher, Chris Peters. Only nine of the 58 home runs by
Sosa, a right-hander, have come against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa went 2-for-5, but never got enough loft on a ball to
threaten a home run.
</P>
<P>
   With the two home run combatants playing each other, the
question arises whether the pitchers will throw strikes. Would a
Cub pitcher allow McGwire to break the record ahead of Sosa? Would
the Cardinals allow Sosa to pull even with McGwire?
</P>
<P>
   ''It will depend on the game situation,'' Riggleman said. ``We'd
certainly like to see Sammy do it, but I think both guys will get
their pitches, and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   As for those tickets, don't expect to get them from the Cubs
secretary. ``They still ask,'' Bank said.

SPORTS COLUMN: A NEW PERSPECTIVE SPURS SELES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also TEN-USOPEN) 
(mk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wind swirled Sunday and blew her tennis shots
this way and that. She broke four rackets _ count `em, four rackets
_ during her match. And Monica Seles, in white baseball cap and
short, white dress, seeded sixth in the U.S. Open, was forced into
a third set with unseeded Kimberly Po, the winner going into the
quarterfinals. It was not a terribly good day for Monica Seles,
but, as she would be the first to admit, she has dealt with worse.
</P>
<P>
   It was not necessary for the large, enthusiastic crowd, shading
their eyes from the brilliant noonday sun in the steep,
multilayered center-court stands of Arthur Ashe Stadium in Flushing
Meadows, to be reminded of the dark days of her young life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And sometimes,'' she said after Sunday's 6-2, 4-6, 6-3
victory, ``sometimes my mind would wander out there.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke about losing concentration after going ahead by 6-2 in
the first set. ``I just started serving with no thought process
where I'm going to serve,'' she said, ``or what shots I'm going to
do.'' At such times her mind always goes back to the tragedies in
her life: when she was stabbed in the back in 1993 while seated
during a change-over in a tournament in Hamburg, Germany, when she
was 19 years old and the greatest woman tennis player in the world;
and the death of her father, her coach and dear friend, from cancer
last May; and at around the same time came another death, that of
her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   During the French Open, which began in late May, about two weeks
after her father's death, Seles wore his wedding ring around her
neck. ``I don't wear it anymore,'' she said. ``It's too much of a
constant reminder. It's too tough. There's too much of a void that
he left in me.''
</P>
<P>
   When things are not going well, on the court or off, she still
draws strength from the memory of her father, a professional
cartoonist. ``He could make a lot of even the most disastrous
things,'' she said. ``There came a point when he could, with just a
stroke or two of his pen, draw something _ even about the stabbing
_ that made me laugh to the floor. It was dark humor, but he just
had a certain knack. He could make you relax, and stop feeling
sorry for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Po drew even with a 6-4 second set. In the third set, after four
games, they were tied, 2-2. There were cheers to encourage Seles,
and, sitting in the stands, it seemed that that's where the fans'
hearts were. But Po had her supporters, too. ``Let's go, Kim,''
shouted someone as Po set to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Po happened to be the first person to play Seles, in a
tournament in Toronto in 1995, after Seles had stayed out of
competition for a little over two years, until her heart and psyche
were mended enough to try tennis again. The response to Seles'
entrance then was unforgettable. ``I walked out on that court and
the response for her was unbelievable,'' Po said. ``It was great. I
got chills.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday? ``Well, when you play Monica _ when you play any of
the great players _ you just think you have to do more, you have to
hit better, you have to hit lines.''
</P>
<P>
   But no, now she didn't think during play about being sympathetic
to her because of her personal problems. Now she just wants to beat
her, and advance in the tournament. Monica had similar ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Looking across the court at Seles, Po sees a different
individual. ``She is just a bigger person than before,'' Po said.
``She grew in every way. Before, she was a small girl. And now
she's grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, 24, has gotten physically bigger, and while her game
remains one of power, she still covers the court with grace, though
perhapsnot as well as she once did. But she has grown in other
ways, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to think, `Why me?''' she said. ``But then I learned
that so many people can relate to some of the things that have
happened to me, that they've suffered tragedy at some point in
their lives. And I think the feeling to me has changed from when I
was a child. I did so well so suddenly, that maybe some people
resented that I got to the top so quickly. But sure, the man that
stabbed me took a lot away from me, some great years, some Grand
Slam wins. It was a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to be the same, but I think, `I'm still lucky
to be playing tennis, to still play a sport.' Like my dad said, if
the knife had plunged a half-millimeter to the left, I'd be
paralyzed and in a wheelchair today.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I see the world from that point of view,'' she continued.
``And when I see a 10-year-old boy who is terminally ill with
cancer, I understand how fortunate I've been, and appreciate how
good it feels to hit a backhand crosscourt winner, the feeling that
goes right through your body.'' She hit just such a shot to break
Po's serve and go ahead by 3-2 in the final set.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can still be a little girl,'' she said. ``I still love
going into FAO Schwarz and picking out stuffed animals. I have a
stuffed animal collection _ and they have everything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles took the final two games to win the set and the match. She
had survived the wind, the sun, the brittle rackets and a
determined and worthy foe. Po congratulated her across the net. The
crowd applauded warmly, and Monica Seles smiled and waved back,
and, with her good rackets and bad in possession, disappeared under
the stands.

SMOLTZ DOMINATES AS STRIKE ZONE FOOLS METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Few hitters have a better idea of their strike zone
than John Olerud. To see Olerud, the New York Mets' first baseman,
argue a called strike is rare enough. To watch him toss his bat
away and begin running to first base thinking he has walked, only
to be called back, is rarer still.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at Shea Stadium, when the Mets faced the Atlanta Braves'
John Smoltz, Olerud did both. And when Olerud began running toward
first in the bottom of the ninth inning, just before the plate
umpire, Larry Vanover, called a pitch strike two, it epitomized the
Mets' day against Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz went on to fan Olerud for the last of his 12 strikeouts,
putting the finishing touch on a 4-0 victory over the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 2 hours 15 minutes for Smoltz (14-3) to complete
his three-hit shutout. (All three hits were singles.) The Mets
(79-64), who were without Mike Piazza because of a bruised left
index finger, remained a game behind the Chicago Cubs in the
National League wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Of Smoltz's 106 pitches, 75 were strikes. And of the 30 Mets
batters, only Olerud was able to work a three-ball count, which he
did twice.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, who was second in the league in hitting when the day
began and leads the Mets with 80 walks, had a first-inning
conversation with Vanover after he was called out on strikes for
the first of three times. Asked later what he had said, Olerud
paraphrased it as, ``Is it me?''
</P>
<P>
   Mets right fielder Lenny Harris, who went 0-for-3 with a
strikeout, said of Vanover's strike zone: ``It was big enough that
the leading hitter in baseball couldn't make contact. I'm not
taking anything away from Smoltz. But he's the type of guy that
doesn't need that help.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanover was consistent: there were no walks on either side. Rick
Reed (16-9) had the benefit of a large strike zone, too, as 79 of
his 120 pitches were strikes. But of the seven hits Reed allowed in
his seven and two-thirds innings, three were solo home runs: to
Ryan Klesko in the second, to Marty Malloy (his first major-league
hit) in the third and to Andruw Jones in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that only one of them came on a mistake, a hanging
change-up to Jones. But that was one too many against Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he made one mistake,'' Reed said. ``But you can
look at the scoreboard and get that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reed had one of the three singles off Smoltz; Edgardo Alfonzo
and Brian McRae had the others. Olerud said he did something he
almost never does: he moved closer to the plate in an effort to
reach Smoltz's pitches in the area that Vanover had deemed the
outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``John moved up a foot on the plate, Lenny even further, and
they still couldn't touch his pitches,'' Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine said, adding that the Mets had just won three consecutive
games against three of the better pitchers in the league, San
Diego's Andy Ashby and Atlanta's Tom Glavine and Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then today we faced a real good guy who kept throwing
where we couldn't hit it,'' Valentine said. ``A couple of them were
strikes, too. I've never seen John Olerud take three called third
strikes, and that's only because he never has in his career. But
Smoltz was doing a great job of hitting spots. Give him credit for
that. Our left-handers couldn't hit the pitches he was throwing.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, the Mets gave in and began swinging at anything
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very aggressive,'' said Smoltz, who said both his
fastball and his curve were working well. ``I knew that going in.
They're playing for the playoffs. So they're playing with a lot of
character. At the same time, we're playing to get the best
record.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hundley went 3-for-4 with a two-run home run and five runs
batted in for Class AAA Norfolk in a 9-4 victory at Richmond
Sunday. In seven games in his second rehabilitation stint with the
Tides this season, Hundley, who played left field Sunday, is
10-for-20 with three homers and 11 RBIs. Hundley homered from the
right side of the plate on Saturday and from the left side of the
plate in the first inning Sunday. ... Marty Malloy went 2-for-4 for
the Braves in his major-league debut after his contract was
purchased from Class AAA Richmond Sunday. To make room on their
roster, the Braves transferred struggling reliever Mark Wohlers to
the 60-day disabled list. ... Atlanta's final run came on a mammoth
home run estimated at 447 feet by Andres Galarraga off Jeff Tam in
the top of the ninth. Galarraga had been suspended for the first
two games of the series, both Mets victories.

NEW YORK ON FOOT _ THE EROTIC, THE EXOTIC AND THE DEAD SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Va., Conn., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Kabac, walking-tour guide, gestured in the
general direction of the bikers lounging across the street on St.
Marks Place, then addressed the curious, and quite probably
nervous, group of nine tourgoers before him. ``These are really
neat people, you know?'' he said loudly, not that the bikers
noticed. ``But they have more hair than you do. And as you can see
_ they're out tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Out, yes. It was 7 p.m., kickoff time for the ``Bizarre and
Eccentric Tour of the East Village,'' an evening expose of tattoo
parlors, body-piercing emporia, sex shops and vampire haunts in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   That was far from the leisurely itinerary of ``Greenwich Village
at Twilight,'' a literary and historical walking tour of the West
Village led by Thorin Tritter from Big Onion Walking Tours.
Nevertheless, in Washington Square Park, his tour had its own
macabre moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area was a potter's field, and 20,000 people are buried
under your feet,'' said Tritter to 27 tourgoers.
</P>
<P>
   There were nervous titters. Kathy Crowley, a Manhattanite on her
first city walking tour, studied the tranquil-looking lawn and
said, ``Who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   And who knew that so many guides are traipsing through the
boroughs with so many eager knots of explorers. No agency keeps
statistics on the fragmented walking-tour universe, and the
Department of Consumer Affairs does not regulate it. But the
department's current number of sightseeing licensees, including
bus, boat, building and walking guides, is 1,158, the highest ever,
compared with 897 five years ago. Veteran guides estimate that more
than 100,000 people took walking tours in the five boroughs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   They range from native New Yorkers to empty-nest suburbanites
reconnecting with the city to out-of-towners of every description.
The people leading the tours include historians, entrepreneurs,
nonprofit institutions, licensed guides, unlicensed guides and rank
amateurs who are pretty much talking through their hats.
</P>
<P>
   And the offerings are ever more diverse. Excursions range from
``The Fifth Avenue Gold Coast,'' a historical walk by Joyce Gold
Tours, to ``Ghosts on Broadway'' by Street Smarts N.Y. and the
``Hell's Kitchen Hike'' by Adventure on a Shoestring. There is
``Princess Diana's New York'' by NYC Discovery Tours, and a walk by
Radical Walking Tours sampling gay rights and antiwar sites called
``Central Park: Trees, Grass and the Working Class.''
</P>
<P>
   There are John Lennon walks, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis
itineraries, pub crawls, celebrity and movie-location jaunts and
``gourmet'' visits to neighborhood restaurants. There are
self-guided tours providing rented compact disk players. And there
are now two ``Seinfeld'' tours: a ride-and-walk effort led by Kenny
Kramer, the real-life inspiration for Cosmo Kramer, and an upstart
tour by Gotham Walk.
</P>
<P>
   The tours venture into Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Coney Island,
Brighton Beach and neighborhoods in the Bronx, Queens and Staten
Island. Guides conduct tours in English, French, Hebrew, Japanese,
Russian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Walks are available through tour companies, through institutions
like the Museum of the City of New York and from a growing number
of freelancers like Kabac. The best guides blend the skills of
historian, teacher, showman and safety guard as they shepherd their
charges through streets teeming with traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But they are attracting a growing number of customers because
suddenly history is, well, cool, many say. ``American society has
always been forward-looking,'' said Dean Yabuki, a historian and
city planner from Oakland, Calif., who was taking the ``Twilight''
tour of Greenwich Village. ``But beyond PBS and the History
Channel, people are now discovering their own history and culture.
They seem fascinated with their past.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``The word is out: New York is a safer city,'' said
Ginny Matish, a tourist from Chesapeake, Va., who was ambling on
the ``Twilight'' tour with her husband, John, and daughter,
Elizabeth, a Columbia University administrator. She invited her
parents to take the tour after reading about it on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, guides say that the swelling hordes of history
seekers are a function of the peak number of visitors these days:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani recently announced that New York City
attracted a record number of travelers in 1997, 33 million, up 3.9
million from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many tourgoers are repeaters. ``These days, I seem
to be on a first-name basis with two or three repeaters on every
tour I lead,'' said Seth Kamil, who founded Big Onion Walking Tours
in 1991 and now gives 1,200 tours a year for a total of 40,000
people. The company focuses on New York history and employs 16
graduate-student tour guides with degrees in history.
</P>
<P>
   Competition on the bread-and-butter tours has led Joyce Gold _
for two decades the doyenne of city walking guides _ to do more
private tours for business and institutional clients, while she
continues her public tours in 20 neighborhoods. Ms. Gold has led
private excursions for academics and school groups, as well as for
the Prime Minister of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more tours the better,'' said Kabac, 56, the ``Bizarre and
Eccentric'' tour's leader. ``It's building the market, the
expectation for more of them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Free-lancers keep whatever they collect; generally they can make
$500 a week or more, depending on the number of walks and the
crowds. Big Onion's graduate historians are paid $50 a tour and say
they find the occupation flexible enough to accommodate their
academic schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike bus tours, walking excursions allow for greater
interaction with people in the neighborhoods. This is great when
residents spontaneously invite 30 touring strangers into their
homes, a sometime occurrence; it is not so great when walkers are
confronted by panhandlers and harassers who see in a tour group a
potential audience for the attention they crave.
</P>
<P>
   True, most tours go off without a hitch. But things happen. On
the Lower East Side, a gnarled curmudgeon interrupted one tour
guide's talk by shouting: ``That's a load a bunk! You aren't old
enough to know nothing!'' The unflappable guide continued.
</P>
<P>
   On a Bowery walk, an inebriated bystander dropped his pants and
loudly asked a pretty tourgoer if she would be the mother of his
children. She was amused. Her husband was not.
</P>
<P>
   Kabac is a strong advocate of tourgoing interaction. On the
``Bizarre and Eccentric'' walk, Michael Addonisio, a dreadlocked
body-piercer at Andromeda Body Jewelry on St. Marks Place, was
explaining to the tour group that ``you can get everything
pierced.'' The evidence was plain on the wall behind him: huge
color pictures of pierced ears, noses, navels and yes, sexual
organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone want piercing?'' Kabac asked the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe next reincarnation,'' said Malachi Sheahan, a tourgoer
from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Many who take the tours are inveterate learners. ``I like to
think I know a lot about New York, but you can always find out
more,'' said Albert Zani, a management consultant from Lynbrook,
N.Y., who was taking the ``Bizarre and Eccentric'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   Others give walking tours as family gifts. On the ``Twilight''
tour, Ms. Crowley and her husband, John Murphy, presented the
excursion as a birthday present to John's brother, Rich, from
Connecticut. Sharing the tour were two other relatives and a
friend. ``The after-tour restaurant, that's going to be the big
surprise,'' John Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility of tour-glut, guides scoff at the idea
that there is any limit to walking the five boroughs. ``New York is
a city of small villages, and there is an infinite number of
possible tours because New York is endlessly fascinating,'' said
Ms. Gold, who has a library of 600 books on New York and has read
500 more. ``Right at the corner of Wall Street and Broadway, you
could talk for three hours and you wouldn't need to take a single
step.''

NORTHWEST STRIKE MEDIATOR SENDS THE NEGOTIATORS HOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mich., Ill., Tenn., N.D., Fla.)   (jw) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After shuttling between negotiators for Northwest Airlines and
its striking pilots for two days, a federal mediator sent the two
sides home Sunday and asked them to try harder to bring an end to
the nine-day strike, which has grounded Northwest's nearly 1,700
daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement, the National Mediation Board, which has
been supervising negotiations between the airline and its 6,200
pilots since June, said that further meetings would be held in
Minneapolis on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   People briefed on the discussions said that little progress was
made at the weekend session, which was called by the board last
week at the behest of Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to see
if resuming negotiations would be productive. The meeting took
place at a hotel near Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. The
two sides met separately with the mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The board's statement said the weekend meetings ``involved the
parameters of a settlement,'' but it did not elaborate. The
statement pointed to the substantive differences between the two
sides and asked them to reconsider their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest is the country's fourth-largest airline. It dominates
air service in the upper Midwest and middle South, normally flying
80 percent of the flights out of Detroit and Minneapolis, and more
than half the flights out of Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The governors of several states, including Minnesota, Michigan
and North Dakota, have called on President Clinton to halt the
strike. Last year, Clinton ordered pilots at American Airlines back
to work minutes after they struck, saying that a strike would cause
too much disruption to the economy. The White House, while
following the situation closely, has resisted intervening in the
Northwest strike, a move the company would welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Pay and job security are the main issues in the strike, which is
the longest in the industry since Eastern Airlines machinists
walked out in 1989. Analysts say that the hard line taken by each
side overshadows the narrow differences between the positions. The
pilots say their demands would cost the company only $70 million a
year; Northwest says the figure is closer to $170 million. The
strike has already cost Northwest an estimated $300 million in
expenses and lost revenue.
</P>

   Pilots are angry that Northwest has resisted giving them a
substantial raise after they and other unions made wage concessions
in 1993 to save the airline from bankruptcy. Since then, Northwest
has posted four years of record profits and its executives have
cashed in stock options worth millions.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, which is also in contract negotiations with unions
representing its flights attendants, customer service
representatives and machinists, says that it cannot afford to give
the pilots what they demand.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether Tuesday's meeting would lead to a
resumption of negotiations, which were last held on Aug. 28, hours
before the pilots walked out.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the board declined to comment on the talks, as
did representatives of Northwest and the Air Line Pilots
Association. The two side were asked by the board not to make
public statements.
</P>
<P>
   Another airline, Airtran, narrowly averted disruption over the
weekend when it reached agreement on a new four-year contract with
its flight attendants. The tentative agreement would give 500
flight attendants an immediate 10 percent raise plus 4 percent
annual raises.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first tentative contract for the Association of
Flight Attendants at Airtran, which is based in Orlando, Fla., and
was formerly called Valujet. The flight attendants had been without
a contract since they organized three years ago and had threatened
random walkouts that would have disrupted flights over the holiday
weekend.

   Men and women feast, war and woo. Fanciful animals frolic. The
time is the millennium from 800 B.C. to A.D. 200, and a new exhibit
that reveals the era's creativity, ``Ancient West Mexico: Art of
the Unknown Past,'' is at the Art Institute of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The show has more than 225 works, mostly terra-cotta sculptures,
and is trumpeted as the most comprehensive exploration of the
artistic and cultural traditions of those who once inhabited parts
of what are now the Mexican states of Jalisco, Colima and Nayarit.
The show runs through Nov. 22. Information: (312) 443-3600.

   Two Worlds
</P>
<P>
   The landscape traditions of two emergent nations, Australia and
the United States, will be explored beginning on Friday in an
exhibition at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn. With more
than 100 paintings, roughly half from each country, the show, ``New
Worlds From Old: 19th-Century Australian and American Landscapes,''
draws on the collections of 32 American, 11 Australian and two
European museums and galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 37 American artists represented by major works are
Thomas Cole, Frederic Edwin Church, Albert Bierstadt and Winslow
Homer. Nearly all the historical landscapes by the 23 Australian
artists, including Eugene von Guerard, Arthur Streeton and Tom
Roberts, have never been shown outside that country. The exhibition
continues through Jan. 3. Information: (860) 278-2670.

   Chinese officials may have seen to it that the epic 16th-century
opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' never played at Lincoln Center
Festival '98 this summer, but a chance to see ``Peony Pavilion''
arises this week at BITE:98, the Barbican International Theater
Event in London.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Peony Pavilion,'' directed by Peter Sellars, is not the
19-hour version that was to have been seen in New York, but a
roughly 3-hour avant-garde interpretation of the opera's central
love story that had its world premiere at this year's Vienna
Festival. This 400th-anniversary production of Tang Xianxu's
classic includes specially written music by Tan Dun and a cast that
features Hua Wenyi, a leading Kun opera exponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peony Pavilion'' opens on Thursday for a nine-performance run
through Sept. 20 at the Barbican Theater. Information:

   A Latin Beat
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As far back as turn-of-the century New Orleans, Jelly
Roll Morton was proclaiming the importance of a ``Spanish tinge''
to jazz, and Latin idioms have long been a component of the music.
So when Jazz at Lincoln Center opens its 1998-99 season beginning
at 8 p.m. Thursday at Alice Tully Hall, its three-night series will
be titled ``Con Alma: The Latin Tinge in Big Band Jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   The event explores the interaction between Afro-Cuban rhythms
and rich big-band textures through works by Machito, Chico
O'Farrill, Duke Ellington, Tito Puente and Dizzy Gillespie.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE UNDERSTUDY OUT THERE ON THE `ISLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ As the Giants' right cornerback, Conrad
Hamilton was not only out there on what is known in pro football as
``the island,'' he was also out there as an understudy to the star.
With Jason Sehorn awaiting knee surgery on Sept. 22, it was as if
Hamilton had suddenly replaced Tom Hanks or Tom Cruise in a feature
film.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Redskins burned the 5-foot-10-inch cornerback with
a 17-yard touchdown pass from Gus Frerotte to Leslie Shepherd early
in the first quarter, the understudy appeared to be flubbing his
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But early in the second half, Hamilton stole what turned out to
be the crucial scene in the Giants' 31-24 victory in their season
opener. On a pass from Frerotte to Shepherd that popped out of
cornerback Phillippi Sparks' hands, the understudy snatched it out
of the air at the Redskins' 19-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've scored,'' Hamilton said later.
</P>
<P>
   He was stopped at the 2-yard line, but his interception return
positioned Charles Way's touchdown burst for a 17-10 lead. On the
Redskins' next possession, defensive end Michael Strahan rumbled 24
yards with another interception of a Frerotte pass for a 24-10
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed Conrad Hamilton how to get in the end zone,'' the
6-4, 280-pound Strahan said later, joking. ``I looked pretty good
when I turned my face mask up.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the Giants hung on to win, Hamilton could have joked
too, but he didn't. He's too serious for that, too quietly
confident that he can do what Sehorn did. Maybe not quite so
smoothly, but effectively enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know,'' Hamilton said of his coaches and teammates,
``what kind of a football player I am. I'm a pretty decent football
player. I'm a good tackler, a very good tackler.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins apparently knew, too. With a chance for the tying
touchdown on their last two possessions, their backup quarterback
Trent Green (who had replaced the groggy Frerotte) didn't throw
into Hamilton's area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted them to come at me at the end,'' Hamilton said. ``In
the first half, too. I wanted to make a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Fassel said Hamilton did make a statement with his
interception. ``You saw how he reacted,'' the Giants' coach said,
alluding to Hamilton's comeback after the Redskins' early
touchdown. ``He kept fighting. He kept playing. He knocked some
balls down. That was a great play when that ball was tipped and he
picked it off and almost ran it in. That's him, and that's how I
want the attitude of this football team to be. No matter how the
game goes, you keep coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel remembered how the other Giants had reacted to Hamilton
after Shepherd's early touchdown. ``When he came to the sideline,''
the coach said, ``no one was saying anything to him but `stay in
there,' `stay right on top of it' and `play aggressively.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn was on the sideline too, but he purposely stayed away
from Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to Conrad about the Redskins during the week
either,'' Sehorn said. ``He's got enough coaches, and I'm not a
coach. I'd probably confuse him anyway. He didn't need me to talk
to him. He did a great job. After he had some adversity, he bounced
back and made a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   He also led the Giants in tackles with eight, plus an assist on
another tackle. But according to the play-by-play sheet, the
Redskins completed 6-of-7 passes in his area for 88 yards. Oddly,
the Redskins rarely threw to Michael Westbrook in his area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I'd be matched up against Westbrook more, but they
usually had Shepherd on me,'' Hamilton said. ``They tried to pick
on me a little bit; if you were the Redskins, wouldn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   Except for one start as a nickel back as a rookie two seasons
ago, this was Hamilton's first appearance in the starting lineup
since he was a Little all-America defensive back at Eastern New
Mexico before becoming the Giants' seventh-round choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely a little pressure,'' he said. ``But not
because of who I was replacing, not because I was starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was presumably referring to the normal pressure that
surrounds any cornerback out on that ``island'' _ all by himself.
And he'll be out there again next Sunday at Oakland, especially
whenever Tim Brown, the Pro Bowl wide receiver, lines up against
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing I can't accomplish, but it's definitely a
challenge,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   And with the confidence that every cornerback needs, Hamilton
sounded as if he would enjoy the challenge. Even as an understudy.

 By ENID NEMY with RON ALEXANDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A weekly column featuring readers' reports on life in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emily Gioseffi and two friends were waiting in line
in front of the Public Theater for tickets to ``Cymbeline.'' The
woman ahead of them was growing increasingly frustrated, glancing
toward the front of the line every few minutes. Turning to the
group, she asked if the line always took so long. One of the women
informed her that tickets to the event were not distributed until 1
o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is everything in New York so inefficient?'' the woman
retorted, with an accent that indicated she was a foreigner. She
then whipped out her Metrocard and added: ``Besides, I shouldn't
have to wait, I've already got my ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The three realized that the woman had been waiting for an uptown
bus to Madison Avenue and had mistakenly thought the theatergoers'
line had something to do with the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to help, Ms. Gioseffi went to check the bus schedule
posted nearby, but the tourist frantically instructed her to get
away from the bus stop, explaining ``You're not allowed to stand
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The conscientious visitor then read the sign aloud, slowly and
deliberately, ``No standing any time.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The three directed the woman to the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Rachel Schultz are still wondering if a seafood bar in
Montauk on Long Island ever succeeded in filling the job with the
description ``Wanted: piano player who knows how to open clams.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   ``You're having a Senior Moment,'' my friend told me when I said
I sometimes look for something in another room and then forget what
I came for.
</P>
<P>
   When my cousin came for a visit and said she had forgotten her
house keys, I told her she was having a Senior Moment. She laughed,
and when the occasion arose, and it did, kept repeating it
throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The second day we went shopping _ she for gifts, I just
browsing. Suddenly I heard her say: ``Who am I buying this gift
for? I guess I'm having .... What am I having?'' We cracked up.
</P>
<P>
   _ DIDA PORECKI
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Dalldorf overheard this exchange at an elevator in the
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``What are you doing this weekend?''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``We're taking David out to North Shore Animal
League to get a puppy.''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Why are you going all the way out there? You have
a wonderful shelter near you in Mount Vernon.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman: ``I know, but they have a better class of animals
at North Shore.''
</P>
<P>
   Another overheard exchange, this one reported by Florence K.
Peate about two elegant elderly women chatting as they waited for
an elevator at Bergdorf Goodman:
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``When I die, I've told everyone I want to be
buried in a shroud with a closed coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Woman, sounding puzzled: ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   First Woman: ``Because if I were laid out, you would look at me
and say `My God _ she's wearing last year's dress!'''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Columbus Avenue at 85th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Time: Late Sunday afternoon brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Players: A young man and woman, obviously a couple, sitting at
separate small outdoor tables and deeply engaged in conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Observer: Leslie J. Gersing who, on closer inspection, realizes
that the couple are eating at different cafes. He's sipping coffee
and smoking at the French-inspired Avenue. She's eating pizza at
the adjacent Firehouse sports bar.
</P>
<P>
   Who says love requires compromise?
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel Kahn can't forget this conversation, and small wonder.
He wanted a compact disc by Johann Sebastian Bach, so he telephoned
a classical-record music club and asked for the recording. After a
short interval, the operator said that she couldn't find this
artist. Kahn spelled the name and she replied that perhaps the
artist was too new and wasn't listed yet.
</P>
<P>
   J.S. Bach died a few hundred years ago, Kahn said, and he had
previously bought recordings by ``this artist.'' Please check
again.
</P>
<P>
   She came back on the line. ``We don't have anything by this
artist,'' she said. ``He never signed a contract with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Honesty Is Not Always the Best Policy Department:
</P>
<P>
   The salesclerk at the bakery counter of the supermarket looked
at Elaine Green and said, ``Yes, young lady, what can I do for
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Green said, ``First of all, thank you for calling me `young
lady,' and second, I'll have a plain rye bread.''
</P>
<P>
   The clerk replied, ``Oh, I call all my elderly customers `young
lady' or `young man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the bread felt a little heavier to Ms. Green as she
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Scene: Vera Institute of Justice Ombudservice booth at New
York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The Ombudservice listens to
juror concerns and handles individual juror problems.
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``You gotta get me out of jury service. It's
against my principles to judge my fellow man. It's against my
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Juror (interrupting): ``Hey, buddy! How much do we get
paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Maxey, the Ombudservice law intern: ``$40.''
</P>
<P>
   First Juror: ``A day?'' Muses a moment. ``Well, for $40, maybe I
could judge my fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   Public primping isn't unusual in New York but it's usually done
on a subway or bus, and it isn't often as all-encompassing as that
recently witnessed by Erika Boyd and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   They were standing at a bus stop on 49th Street awaiting a
Waterway Ferry bus when a young woman standing next to them began
her elaborate toilette. She opened her oversize black bag and
pulled out a mirrored compact, lipstick, eye liner, eye shadow and
mascara, and carefully made up her face. She then dabbed complexion
makeup to cover blemishes on her bare legs.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage was brushing out her complicated hairdo, twisting
it into a knot and securing the new coiffure with two long black
plastic hair sticks, placed to form an X. This was followed by the
placement of long dangly earrings and a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Finally she stepped in front of her full-length mirror _ in this
case, a storefront window _ and inspected the length of her skirt
and her overall appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared satisfied. The Boyds were, too. It was a Manhattan
experience. She went on her way _ to a job interview? a date? a
photo shoot? _ and they boarded the bus en route to the ferry and
their home in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. OPEN (AND SHUT) CASE
</P>

EDITORIAL: HELPING KOSOVO'S DISPLACED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The temperature in the Kosovo hills at night is now down to 40
degrees, and that means death is coming. Despite Slobodan
Milosevic's repeated denials that Serbian forces are carrying out
ethnic cleansing, many villages in Kosovo look like the worst parts
of Bosnia, with shelled carcasses of houses and eerily empty
streets. So far, relief groups say, some 200,000 to 400,000 people,
almost all women, children and the elderly, have fled their homes
and about a quarter of them have no homes to go back to. Some are
with relatives in other parts of Kosovo and a few have gone to
Montenegro, Albania and even Bosnia, but between 50,000 and 150,000
are living in the forests.
</P>
<P>
   The world must keep them alive, but the U.S. government has made
a mistake in agreeing to a new ``humanitarian'' proposal from
Milosevic. It is apt to fail at feeding the displaced, but even
success would come at a cost of making the United States
Milosevic's partner and thus blocking long-term solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is creating the same dilemmas for the outside world
that he created in Bosnia. There, extensive international efforts
to keep Bosnians from starving inadvertently got in the way of
ending the war. The Serbs held humanitarian aid hostage,
threatening to end it if the West displeased them. Despite its
promises, the United Nations was not able to protect Bosnians.
Supposed safe havens, such as Srebrenica, became killing fields.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Milosevic is doing it again. He has denied visas for
relief workers and his forces have killed and arrested local
workers bringing in foreign food. The shelling by his forces
continues. Now he is proposing the establishment of 11
``humanitarian centers'' to feed people who have been displaced.
The United States agreed last Wednesday to provide food to each of
the centers.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is unrealistic. Kosovo Albanians, who remember
Srebrenica and do not trust Serbian leaders, are not likely to risk
gathering in places where ``security,'' according to the Serbian
government, would be provided by Serbian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would allow the Serbs to claim Western support in
encouraging people to come down from the woods into
Milosevic-controlled centers. Since Belgrade is not promising to
stop the shelling, the centers may be luring people to their death.
A mission scheduled for last week by American and U.N. officials to
see if the humanitarian centers are feasible had to be postponed
due to shelling, which eloquently answers the question.
</P>
<P>
   Making a partner of Milosevic is not an acceptable way to help
the displaced. American and other relief groups are drastically
increasing the food they provide through local Kosovo
organizations, which is important. Most crucial, however, is to get
Milosevic to stop shooting. Both steps will require intense
pressure on Belgrade, with the credible threat of military force if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The use of force is probably what the United States was trying
to avoid when it agreed to support the Serbian idea. But it cannot
allow Milosevic, who specializes in extorting rewards from the West
for cleaning up problems he created, to hold humanitarian relief
hostage. A policy of treating Milosevic as a partner, as the West
did for so long in Bosnia, will limit the West's options in dealing
with him and encourage him to continue killing Kosovo's Albanians.
At bottom Kosovo is a political crisis, not a humanitarian crisis.
It will continue until Milosevic is forced to reform, or is no
longer running Serbia. &QL;

VIEWS MIXED ON A CLINTON RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, a Connecticut
Democrat, said Sunday that publicly chastising President Clinton
for ``immoral'' conduct was ``the hardest thing I've ever done in
my political career,'' and that he hoped Clinton could now rebuild
his presidency and finish his term with punishment no more severe
than a congressional censure.
</P>
<P>
   But Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, appearing after
Lieberman on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said that the president
probably had committed impeachable offenses in denying his affair
with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and that it
was unlikely Congress would be content with votes to censure or
rebuke him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying'' censure ``is not a possibility,'' said Lott,
a Mississippi Republican, ``but right now I'd say that's not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that he signed a petition to censure President
Nixon in 1974, Lott said he knows more about censure now and has
concluded it is a meaningless sanction. ``I don't think the
circumstances now call for something that would be interpreted by
anyone as nothing,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Lieberman stood alone on the Senate floor and
delivered a stinging rebuke of Clinton, saying he had diminished
his office, undermined his moral authority, set a terrible example
for children, and inadequately apologized or explained his behavior
to Americans. A moderate and longtime friend of Clinton's,
Lieberman was the first Democrat to speak out so forcefully in
public, but he stopped short of calling for Congress to censure
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Lieberman said he hoped a censure vote would ``be the
maximum we will want to do to end this chapter in our history.'' He
said that he believed ``very, very few Democrats or Republicans
want a presidential impeachment or resignation,'' and that any talk
about either must wait until the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, sends Congress his report, which is expected this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, congressional Democrats, who are anxious about the
contents of that report and still very unhappy with the president's
conduct and apologies, expressed serious doubts about the
president's ability to survive the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Representative James Moran, a Virginia Democrat and Clinton
supporter, said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that the president now would
be ``fortunate'' to get censured, and that he believed the Congress
was ``bound to go through with &UR;  &LR; impeachment proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this is the most serious crisis'' the president
``has ever faced, and I don't really see any way out of it,'' Moran
said. ``His credibility is obviously severely diminished. I don't
know how he can ever recover the strength of the bully pulpit he
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran said he was ``profoundly disappointed'' that the president
had tried to talk his way out of his troubles with ``a twisted
logic that uses the legal system to subvert what we know to be the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Sunday they could not speculate on the
possibility of impeachment until Starr delivered his report and
catalogued Clinton's alleged offenses, which could include perjury,
obstruction of justice, and abuse of power. Lott said that while it
would be up to the House to decide when, and if, to hold
impeachment hearings, he would prefer any proceeding be delayed
until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me that we should not rush to judgment and
that to try to do it in the middle of a campaign or even in a
lame-duck session, I'd want to think very carefully about doing
that,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat, said
both a ``crisis in the regime'' and a host of dangerous, looming
international situations requires the Congress to take up an
impeachment procedure as soon as it receives the Starr report and
stay in Washington until it completes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing more important to do in the nation's
interest,'' said Moynihan, who appeared on ABC's ``This Week with
Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts.'' ``The president is not going to
resign. He is going to see how an impeachment proceeding goes or
does not go.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he believed the president could reestablish the
public trust he has lost, and Lieberman said Clinton's apology
Friday in Ireland was ``heartening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one better than Bill Clinton at communicating with
people, and this in the days ahead may be the greatest test he's
ever had,'' Lieberman said. ``But I'm confident he can restore the
full moral authority of his presidency and go on to finish ...
honorably.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he had not spoken to the president since his
remarks Thursday, though he did talk with him twice before publicly
rebuking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did tell him I was going to make a public statement ... and
though I knew parts of it would be very uncomfortable for him to
hear, I honestly felt it was the best thing to do for him and his
presidency,'' Lieberman said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Having never before faced the stare and sting of
Steffi Graf across the net, Patty Schnyder, a 19-year-old power
hitter who is a virtual unknown outside Switzerland, had no cause
to fear her. On Sunday night at the U.S. Open, ignorance proved to
be bliss for the 11th-seeded Schnyder as she blasted her way to a
6-3, 6-4 upset of the eighth-seeded Graf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to see her like anyone else,'' said Schnyder,
who confessed that she hadn't a clue how she kept her jitters _
about facing Graf in a main event match in Arthur Ashe Stadium _
completely under control.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, a five-time Open champion who missed this Grand Slam event
last year while recuperating from career-threatening knee surgery,
made her earliest exit from this major championship in 14 years.
Not since she was a rank rookie of 15 had Graf failed to secure a
berth in the Open's quarterfinal round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I made a lot of mistakes, easy mistakes,'' said
Graf, who plopped out 33 unforced errors and was constantly in
trouble trying to counter the left-handed Schnyder's bold
cross-court forehands with her backhand slice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just never found my game. I couldn't get any depth in my
shots, so it was difficult to get a positive attitude,'' said Graf,
who had hoped her victories against second-ranked Lindsay Davenport
and third-ranked Jana Novotna en route to the New Haven title a
week ago would bring her Open campaign together on an invincible
note.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Graf found herself making an Open exit on a very
vulnerable note, as the first marquee name on the women's side to
drop out of the chase for the 1998 title.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Carlos Moya was once again obliged to
impersonate Houdini. First he reversed a two-sets-to-none deficit
under the spotlights at the U.S. Open against Michael Chang, a
second-round ordeal that lasted nearly four hours. That left Moya,
the defending French Open champion, wasting away on the trainer's
table in the wee hours on Saturday morning. But it left him
relieved to be in contention at the year's last major championship
as he beat Chang, the battler who wrote the book on surviving five
set marathon hauls. If the Spaniard could beat Chang at his forte,
who else could hurt him here?
</P>
<P>
   But then, almost before Moya was ready, his first-ever visit to
the Open's third round beckoned. Moya was nursing aches and pains
beyond his 22 years. And darned if the American challenger in this
round didn't look like a strapping specter straight out of an
exercise video. Jan-Michael Gambill and his baseline calisthenics
were definitely not a sight for Moya's sore eyes as he shuffled off
to do his duty in Round 3.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there he was back in action Sunday, taking his lumps in
yet another five-set march to the far side of exhaustion and, for
the second consecutive match, living to tell a victorious tale.
This time the 10th-seeded Moya toiled for 2 hours 58 minutes in a
topspin-spoiling wind. He needed a sudden-death tie breaker before
sneaking past Gambill, 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-4) after Gambill
buried a two-fisted forehand into the net on Moya's third match
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the match, basically,'' Gambill said. ``Moya is one
of the toughest competitors on the Tour, so I don't have to give
him credit _ he's earned that credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill praised Moya and berated himself for his shot selection
in the tie breaker, where a double fault left him 2-0 in arrears
right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a good tie breaker, but he didn't do anything
special,'' said Gambill, a 21-year-old Star Trek fan from Spokane,
Wash., after making his best-ever major-championship showing in his
first full season on the main circuit. Despite his inexperience,
Gambill is expected to be named to play singles for the U.S. Davis
Cup team in its semifinal against Italy in Milwaukee later this
month owing to the no-show status of Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi,
Jim Courier and Chang.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loss is never the end of the world to me,'' said Gambill,
who established his credentials as an upset artist when he stunned
Agassi in the quarterfinals at Indian Wells. ``I'm going to learn
from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill's arduous exit left just two American men, Sampras and
Agassi, afloat in the Round of 16, an open-era low.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the hot, gusty breeze seemed to emanate from a
steam kettle and yanked everybody's favorite shots skyward like
kites, Moya wasn't the only seeded player to receive a rough ride.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion, who was seeded
fifth here, dropped out of his third-round match against Sweden's
Thomas Johansson at 7-6 (7-5), 4-5 due to a flare-up of the chronic
tendinitis in his left knee. And 13th-seeded Tim Henman of Britain
was so befuddled by the wind and glare that he needed four sets to
fight off 149th-ranked Michael Kohlmann, a German qualifier who was
the lowest-ranked man left in the event, 6-3, 7-5, 1-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a real glare on the court, and the wind's just
coming from all directions,'' Henman complained. ``I think I got
the job done, (a) in difficult conditions, and (b) playing pretty
ordinary, pretty ugly tennis at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Henman's complaints were echoed by sixth-seeded Monica Seles,
who called the playing conditions ``unrealistic'' and unkind. Seles
dropped her first set of the tournament, squandering a 4-1
second-set lead, before righting herself against Kimberly Po and
advancing 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 to a quarterfinal meeting with top-seeded
Martina Hingis, the Open's defending champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more than wind,'' said Seles, whose composure was
further tested by the four racquets that cracked in the hot
sunshine after making the transition from the overly
air-conditioned players' lounge to the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seles, Hingis was not overly pleased with the Round of 16
victory, a mistake-marred 6-4, 6-4 ouster of Nathalie Dechy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just kind of escaping every day,'' Hingis said of the
errors that seem to be compromising her attempt, at 17, to become
the youngest Open champion to mount a successful title defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was motivated when I came here to do well again,'' she said.
``Instead of getting better, I'm getting worse, is what I have the
feeling of right now. If I'm going to continue playing like this,
I'm not going to go anywhere. I definitely have to raise my
level.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped up his defense Sunday
of police officers who stormed the stage at a youth rally in Harlem
on Saturday, saying that they had decided to move in only after the
keynote speaker began urging the crowd to ``riot and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Tensions about the rally's abrupt ending mounted Sunday, with
the organizers and community leaders in Harlem accusing the city of
using excessive force to shut down what had been a peaceful event.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to sue the city, saying the police had defied a
court order permitting the rally and had violated the civil rights
of thousands of participants.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has given several explanations for the police action.
Early Sunday, he said at a news conference that organizers had
flouted a ``sacred'' court order by going past a 4 p.m. deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know why the police came in at 4:01, go read
the court order,'' Giuliani said. ``This is all about creating a
respectful society. The court said they had between 12 and 4; it
meant exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, just before the rally, the mayor had said that
the police would allow ``some reasonable flexibility'' in ending
the rally at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And in a call to a reporter Sunday night, he said that the
police would indeed have allowed the event to run late, if the
chief organizer, Khallidun Abdul Muhammad, had not begun inveighing
against the officers in a speech laced with obscenity and
anti-Semitic slurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite prepared to be more flexible, but when the
speech turned to incitement to riot and murder, they closed down
the event,'' Giuliani said. ``I had given them the discretion to
make that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday, as dozens of officers in riot
gear assembled behind the stage, Muhammad told the crowd to gird
themselves for possible attacks by the police. If attacked by
officers, he said, members of the crowd should ``take their guns
away and use their guns in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Muhammad was finishing his five-minute speech, a police
helicopter swooped low over a section of Lenox Avenue known as
Malcolm X Boulevard, where a crowd estimated by the police at 6,000
had assembled for the rally. Officers climbed onto the stage,
ducking thrown bottles and chairs as they shut down the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   One civilian was injured as the crowd was dispersed, but not
seriously. About 15 police officers also received minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said after the
rally that they wanted Muhammad to be charged with inciting to
riot. Although they said so again Sunday, no charges had been
pressed by Sunday night. Muhammad seemed to have disappeared from
the city, and neither his aides nor his son, Farrakhan, who
attended an afternoon news conference held by some of the rally
organizers, would disclose his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But at that news conference, several organizers said they hoped
to sue the city for violating their constitutional rights to gather
in public, and for holding their event to a different standard from
that of the hundreds of other rallies that take place on city
streets each year. And in Harlem, several elected officials said
they would call for an investigation of whether police officers at
the rally had complied with the city's rules for dispersing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody should be prosecuted, it should be Mayor Giuliani
and the police officers who engaged in criminal conduct,'' Michael
Warren, a lawyer for the rally organizers, said at a news
conference in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. ``We must go back to
court to challenge the propriety and the manner in which the police
dealt with our people in Harlem yesterday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rally on Saturday culminated a monthslong battle between
organizers and the city. The city had denied the organizers'
request for a rally in Harlem on Labor Day weekend, saying the
neighborhood could not safely accommodate the one million people
that the organizers originally predicted would attend. It offered
an alternative time and location.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor repeatedly condemned the rally as a ``hate march,''
while the organizers complained that he was violating their
constitutional rights to free speech and used increasingly
strident, antiwhite invective against him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a three-judge panel for 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals found last week that the organizers had a right to hold a
rally but not to dictate the terms of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawyer for the organizers acknowledged that they
expected only 50,000 people, the panel narrowed the rally, from 12
hours and 29 blocks to just four hours and six blocks. Community
leaders, who in recent weeks have walked a fine line between
denouncing Muhammad's racist statements and acknowledging his right
to free speech, said Sunday that they were disgusted by his remarks
at the rally, in which he called Jews ``bloodsuckers'' and
encouraged the crowd to beat police officers with wooden barricades
if the officers assaulted anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But State Sen. David Paterson and several other elected
officials from Harlem said they found the actions of the police on
Saturday even more appalling. ``We've been calling the organizers
irresponsible for the last month,'' Paterson said. ``We wouldn't
expect anything different from Mr. Muhammad. The shocking thing was
the fact that the police stormed the tranquil crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton also lashed out at Giuliani and the police
Sunday, questioning why the police had not allowed a ``grace
period'' of several minutes before shutting the rally down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total irresponsible, juvenile action to allow someone
to move to that level of escalation at that stage of the game,''
Sharpton said. ``The march was over, Khallid Muhammad was walking
off the stage, there was no longer a threat of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Other community leaders said the aggressive police action had
the unfortunate effect of making Harlem residents more angry at the
city than at Muhammad and others who spewed invective at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had ended in peace, maybe the focus would have been
totally on the language,'' said Bill Perkins, a City Councilman
from Harlem. ``Since the day ended in violence, the violence is the
focus. The police are the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone was one of the only public
officials who made a point of defending the police force Sunday. A
Democrat who is running for governor, Vallone said during a debate
Sunday that the police ``handled themselves very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he could have and should have been arrested on
the spot,'' Vallone said of Muhammad. ``Calling for violence like
that is absolutely outrageous.''

SWISSAIR FLIGHT-DATA RECORDER IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Divers recovered the flight-data recorder
of Swissair 111 Saturday, providing investigators with potentially
mystery-solving evidence about the trans-Atlantic flight that ended
with the deaths of 229 people Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Working 190 feet below the ocean's surface, military divers with
as few as 6 minutes apiece to scour the murky, rocky bottom found
the so-called black box among three large pieces of debris that may
be part of the MD-11's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in a pail of seawater for protection, the recorder was
hand-carried to waiting investigators who flew the evidence to the
Canadian Transportation Safety Board's engineering lab in Ottawa
last night for days of round-the-clock analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder monitored about 100 systems aboard the aircraft. If
the titanium-protected box is in good condition _ and if its power
was not cut off before impact _ the data should pinpoint what
malfunctioned aboard the seven-year-old aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boxes are pretty robust,'' said Jim Harris, an
investigator with the Canadian safety board. ``This could go a long
way to explaining the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that the recorder must be cleaned and decontaminated
before a multinational team of analysts can begin its work at what
the investigator called a ``very sophisticated lab.'' The
preliminary work will take several days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder was retrieved after divers returned to an area 5
nautical miles off Peggy's Cove where pinging from a transponder
had been heard Saturday. Rough weather forced divers to call off
that effort, but their return Saturday yielded what one Canadian
Navy commander called ``the honeypot'' of the search.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made despite 10 feet of visibility and
football-size rocks that are constantly moving because of tide and
weather, Navy Captain Paul Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Three pieces of wreckage were found around the recorder that
officials are ``relatively sure'' are part of the fuselage, said
Vic Gerden, the chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces will be retrieved and brought to the Shearwater
military base near here, where other remnants of the aircraft have
been stored for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The base is also where collected human remains have been placed
in refrigerated containers while victims' relatives supply DNA
samples to help with the painstaking identification process. The US
Defense Department has been asked to assist in the DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   By late Saturday, only one body had been found intact, that of a
French woman. The partially intact body of an infant has also been
retrieved. Officials have said it is possible that no more complete
bodies will be found.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Butt, the provincial medical examiner, Saturday
described in emotional words Saturday how he and his staff have
tried to both console and inform the many relatives and friends of
the victims who have come to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experience that we can only imagine,'' he said of
the relatives' grief.
</P>
<P>
   The search and recovery effort, which is being aided by the
United States and Switzerland, will now focus on finding the
cockpit voice recorder, the other black box, that may give
investigators a picture of what the pilots knew, and when.
</P>
<P>
   The pinging from that box's transponder has not been picked up,
but Webster of the Canadian Navy said that the flight-data
recorder's signal may have been stronger and obscured it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, help is on the way from the US Navy, which has
dispatched the salvage ship USS Grapple to the scene. The ship,
which aided in the TWA Flight 800 crash investigation off Long
Island, sailed from Philadelphia Saturday and is expected off Nova
Scotia by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cause of the Swissair tragedy is a mystery. Part of
the puzzle is what prompted the pilots to issue a distress call 70
miles southwest of Halifax. They reported smoke in the cabin to
air-traffic controllers in New Brunswick, and British Airways
pilots who overheard the transmission told investigators they felt
certain that the Swissair crew had donned oxygen masks.
</P>
<P>
   The British pilots have said they discerned ``no panic'' by
their Swissair counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator of the crash said Saturday that the
debris retrieved so far gives no indication of the origin of the
smoke. No evidence of a fire has been found on the wreckage, Gerden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is why the Swissair crew, told by air traffic
controllers that they were 30 miles from Halifax International
Airport, suddenly realized they were too high to make an emergency
landing. The pilots requested permission to break off their
approach and circle back out over the ocean to dump fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the pilots declared they needed to land
immediately. Radio contact was soon lost, and within six minutes
the aircraft had plunged violently into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the aircraft should have begun dumping fuel 70 miles
from Halifax, and thus saved itself some precious time, is among
``the questions we are asking ourselves now,'' said Harris.

the court order,'' Giuliani said. ``This is all about creating a
respectful society. The court said they had between 12 and 4; it
meant exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, just before the rally, the mayor had said that
the police would allow ``some reasonable flexibility'' in ending
the rally at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   And in a call to a reporter Sunday night, he said that the
police would indeed have allowed the event to run late, if the
chief organizer, Khallidun Abdul Muhammad, had not begun inveighing
against the officers in a speech laced with obscenity and
anti-Semitic slurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were quite prepared to be more flexible, but when the
speech turned to incitement to riot and murder, they closed down
the event,'' Giuliani said. ``I had given them the discretion to
make that determination.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 4 p.m. on Saturday, as dozens of officers in riot
gear assembled behind the stage, Muhammad told the crowd to gird
themselves for possible attacks by the police. If attacked by
officers, he said, members of the crowd should ``take their guns
away and use their guns in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Muhammad was finishing his five-minute speech, a police
helicopter swooped low over a section of Lenox Avenue known as
Malcolm X Boulevard, where a crowd estimated by the police at 6,000
had assembled for the rally. Officers climbed onto the stage,
ducking thrown bottles and chairs as they shut down the sound
system.
</P>
<P>
   One civilian was injured as the crowd was dispersed, but not
seriously. About 15 police officers also received minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said after the
rally that they wanted Muhammad to be charged with inciting to
riot. Although they said so again Sunday, no charges had been
pressed by Sunday night. Muhammad seemed to have disappeared from
the city, and neither his aides nor his son, Farrakhan, who
attended an afternoon news conference held by some of the rally
organizers, would disclose his whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But at that news conference, several organizers said they hoped
to sue the city for violating their constitutional rights to gather
in public, and for holding their event to a different standard from
that of the hundreds of other rallies that take place on city
streets each year. And in Harlem, several elected officials said
they would call for an investigation of whether police officers at
the rally had complied with the city's rules for dispersing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody should be prosecuted, it should be Mayor Giuliani
and the police officers who engaged in criminal conduct,'' Michael
Warren, a lawyer for the rally organizers, said at a news
conference in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn. ``We must go back to
court to challenge the propriety and the manner in which the police
dealt with our people in Harlem yesterday.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The rally on Saturday culminated a monthslong battle between
organizers and the city. The city had denied the organizers'
request for a rally in Harlem on Labor Day weekend, saying the
neighborhood could not safely accommodate the one million people
that the organizers originally predicted would attend. It offered
an alternative time and location.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor repeatedly condemned the rally as a ``hate march,''
while the organizers complained that he was violating their
constitutional rights to free speech and used increasingly
strident, antiwhite invective against him.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a three-judge panel for 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals found last week that the organizers had a right to hold a
rally but not to dictate the terms of the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   After a lawyer for the organizers acknowledged that they
expected only 50,000 people, the panel narrowed the rally, from 12
hours and 29 blocks to just four hours and six blocks. Community
leaders, who in recent weeks have walked a fine line between
denouncing Muhammad's racist statements and acknowledging his right
to free speech, said Sunday that they were disgusted by his remarks
at the rally, in which he called Jews ``bloodsuckers'' and
encouraged the crowd to beat police officers with wooden barricades
if the officers assaulted anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But State Sen. David Paterson and several other elected
officials from Harlem said they found the actions of the police on
Saturday even more appalling. ``We've been calling the organizers
irresponsible for the last month,'' Paterson said. ``We wouldn't
expect anything different from Mr. Muhammad. The shocking thing was
the fact that the police stormed the tranquil crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton also lashed out at Giuliani and the police
Sunday, questioning why the police had not allowed a ``grace
period'' of several minutes before shutting the rally down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total irresponsible, juvenile action to allow someone
to move to that level of escalation at that stage of the game,''
Sharpton said. ``The march was over, Khallid Muhammad was walking
off the stage, there was no longer a threat of danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Other community leaders said the aggressive police action had
the unfortunate effect of making Harlem residents more angry at the
city than at Muhammad and others who spewed invective at the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had ended in peace, maybe the focus would have been
totally on the language,'' said Bill Perkins, a City Councilman
from Harlem. ``Since the day ended in violence, the violence is the
focus. The police are the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   City Council Speaker Peter Vallone was one of the only public
officials who made a point of defending the police force Sunday. A
Democrat who is running for governor, Vallone said during a debate
Sunday that the police ``handled themselves very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that he could have and should have been arrested on
the spot,'' Vallone said of Muhammad. ``Calling for violence like
that is absolutely outrageous.''

IN SENATE RACE, THREE CITY CANDIDATES ACCENTUATE UPSTATE TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERTOWN, N.Y. _ Before a dinner of pizza and beer in a back
room at Pete's, an Italian restaurant and bar here in the
northernmost reaches of New York state, Mark Green on Friday
offered what has become his trademark serenade to voters outside of
New York City as he pursues the Democratic nomination for U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Brooklyn, raised in Nassau,'' Green said. ``My
wife grew up in Westchester.'' He added that he attended Cornell
University in Tompkins County and hastened to introduce his
19-year-old daughter, Jenya, who is a sophomore at the school in
Ithaca and had accompanied her father to underscore the point.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Geraldine Ferraro, the former vice
presidential nominee who is also seeking the nomination, made a
point of reminding voters in Middletown, her first stop on a
three-day upstate campaign swing, that she was born in Orange
County and spent her earliest childhood years there.
</P>
<P>
   And on his visits north, Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn, the
third major Democratic contender, sometimes tells people that his
father was born in Utica. And for good measure, he tries to
demonstrate his local affinity by traveling with congressional
colleagues or other area officials who support his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the upper corridors of New York state, these final days
before the Sept. 15 primary are treating Democratic voters to the
spectacle of three quintessential New York City politicians
striving for votes by grasping for ties that stretch beyond the
five boroughs and their suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who is New York City's public advocate, lives on the
Upper East Side of Manhattan, and dresses it. Schumer, the
nine-term congressman, lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and sounds
it. And Ms. Ferraro, who is a former representative from Queens,
still has a home in Forest Hills Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   So, running for statewide office presents a beguiling challenge:
how to connect to the voters of western, central and northern New
York, who are generally skeptical and often feel as shunted to the
margins politically as they are geographically.
</P>
<P>
   That obstacle can be even greater in a Democratic primary
because rural voters, even registered Democrats, tend to be more
conservative and because the conventional wisdom suggests that
their votes matter little. Typically, more than 70 percent of
primary ballots are cast in New York City and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling up here sometimes among Democrats that we're
ignored,'' said Mike Schell, the former Democratic chairman of
Jefferson County who now heads the Democratic Rural Conference, a
coalition of party leaders from the state's 41 smallest counties.
</P>
<P>
   But with Ms. Ferraro, Green and Schumer all extremely well-known
in New York City, the candidates and their aides say that votes
north and west of Rockland County could prove crucial in the
primary.
</P>
<P>
   At her campaign stop in Middletown, Ms. Ferraro said that she
expects the major candidates ``will split the city a third each.''
She said that to lift her to victory this year, she is ``banking
on'' the city's suburbs and upstate, where she scored well in her
unsuccessful bid for the nomination in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who was the Democratic nominee in 1986 but lost to
Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican who still holds the seat, has also
put higher stakes in his upstate campaign. He began courting the
Democratic Rural Conference when it was first created two years ago
and won the group's endorsement in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of room to grow upstate because I'm less
well-known there,'' said Green, whose campaign began airing two
television advertisements in upstate media markets within the last
week. ``I gain more and more rapidly once they know I'm not just
some downstate stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has declined to characterize any region of the state as
more or less important to his campaign strategy. But he has made a
point of emphasizing particular local issues whenever he travels
north and has enlisted many upstate elected officials to boost his
candidacy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Any candidate from anywhere in the state can become well-known
upstate if they do one of two things _ visit frequently or appear
in the media frequently,'' said Robert Cook, the Monroe County
Democratic chairman. ``Schumer has been pretty generous with media
buys. People know him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook has not endorsed any of the candidates but many county
chairmen have. Of the state's 62 counties, Green claims 31 as his
supporters, Ms. Ferraro says she has the backing of 13 and Schumer
has six behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the candidates has taken a different approach to
practical campaigning upstate. Green has campaign offices in
Buffalo and Rochester. Ms. Ferraro, who had a highly organized
upstate effort in 1992, has more loosely organized support this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who has raised far more money than either Green or Ms.
Ferraro, has made quick trips upstate by airplane to hold news
conferences or attend events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had Chuck on a cycle,'' said G. Steven Pigeon, the Erie
County chairman, who is supporting Schumer. ``He's campaigning like
he's running for county executive, hitting all the public events,''
Pigeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Schell, of Jefferson County and the Rural Democratic Conference,
said Green's manner appealed to northern voters. ``He is able to
bridge whatever differences there are in personalities upstate and
downstate,'' he said. ``That probably comes from his being educated
up here and growing up in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Glavin, the Rensselaer chairman, who is supporting Ms.
Ferraro, said, ``You have got to have someone on the line who can
generate the enthusiasm. She's the only one who can beat D'Amato.
It's important to have someone who can appeal to the whole state,
especially upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's northern and western tiers are far more crucial in a
general election than in a primary. D'Amato proved that in 1986
when Green fared better in New York City but D'Amato retained his
seat by trouncing Green in the suburbs and upstate.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the candidates gently tailor their messages to the
upstate crowds. Green, for instance, speaking to aides, described
his support by the Democratic chairmen of the seven most
northeastern counties as a ``yarmulke on New York State.'' But in
the speech later at Pete's restaurant, he said they ``formed a cap
on the north country.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of issues, all three candidates put more emphasis on
the upstate economy, which has not kept pace with the growth
downstate. On the campaign trail, the candidates often face
questions ranging from their views on the dairy industry to the
Russian economy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their efforts, voters say the New York City
candidates still have work to do. At The Crystal Restaurant in
Watertown _ which opened in 1919 and still has an ``All Legal
Beverages'' sign dating from Prohibition _ Jim Walsh, a life-long
Democrat, said he felt little attachment to any of the primary
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Ferraro, I used to watch her on Crossfire,'' said
Walsh, who is 67. ``But I don't like her husband and his antics.
Mark Green doesn't mean much to me because he's never been brought
to the forefront here. He's pretty much a city boy. Schumer, he's
another. He's a House of Representatives guy. That's all I know
about him.''

BIG MARKETERS JOIN TO UPGRADE INTERNET ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven top marketers are joining At Home Corp., which operates
the At Home Network Internet service, to create and test the
larger, more elaborate types of online advertising that were the
subject of a meeting last month on interactive marketing sponsored
by Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Bratton, advertising director for the At Home Network in
Redwood City, Calif., identified the marketers as AT&AMP;T Corp., the
Bank of America unit of BankAmerica Corp., First USA, Intel Corp.,
Johnson &AMP; Johnson, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. and Toys ``R'' Us.
</P>
<P>
   The marketers will run ads that use so-called rich media
techniques, which take advantage of the large bandwidth, or network
carrying capacity, of At Home. Such ads are bigger than those now
usually associated with the Internet and can offer animation, sound
and full video.
</P>
<P>
   The test, to be conducted by IPSOS-ASI, a market research
company in Stamford, Conn., and co-sponsored by Intel, will
evaluate the effectiveness of the ads using traditional
measurements like recall, awareness and intent to purchase the
products advertised. Results are to be made available in December.

FEUD HAMPERS EFFORT TO RESOLVE BANKRUPTCY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the sort of fight usually found on a playground, complete
with glares, name-calling and a tussle over strawberry Twizzlers.
</P>
<P>
   But this dispute is going on in a courtroom in upstate New York,
where two men who are supposed to be unraveling an enormous
financial mess are fighting each other instead.
</P>
<P>
   Their battle is just the latest twist in the case of Bennett
Funding Group, a Syracuse, N.Y., operation that the authorities
call the biggest pyramid scheme in American history. When the
concern, which financed equipment leases, collapsed in 1996, about
10,000 people _ many of them retirees from New York, New Jersey and
Florida _ lost as much as $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, is responsible for trying to get their money back. As
trustee of the Bennett companies' bankruptcy, he has already had
unusual success, recently mailing checks to investors totaling $50
million. While that amounts to only about 6 cents for every dollar
lost, most victims of pyramid schemes are lucky to get even a penny
back.
</P>
<P>
   And Breeden promises more to come, including $125 million from
an insurance settlement.
</P>
<P>
   But in the course of his efforts, he has run afoul of Guy Van
Baalen, a Justice Department official based in Utica, N.Y., whose
job is to supervise bankruptcies in northern New York.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Van Baalen accuses Breeden, whose pay as
trustee amounts to $600,000 a year, of overbilling for his work
(and for personal expenses like candy), and with creating conflicts
of interest so serious that he should be removed from the case.
Among other things, Van Baalen criticizes Breeden for serving as
chairman of Equivest Finance Inc., a company invested in by the
Bennett group, whose ownership stake has been taken over by the
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Breeden contends that Van Baalen is a petty bureaucrat who has
willfully misunderstood his efforts to help the investors. ``I
control the company because it's the creditors', and I want to be
damn sure how their money is spent,'' Breeden said of his role at
Equivest, which finances consumers' purchases of time-share
resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has delayed _ and may ultimately derail _ Breeden's
efforts to sell stock in Equivet, which he describes as the only
valuable asset Bennett has. But even if the sale occurs, Wall
Street's sharp decline has cut into the value of the stock, which
was trading for almost $175 million in late July but today is worth
less than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Van Baalen opposes the sale, saying Breeden has not given the
court enough information about it. But he says he understands that
it is the foundation of Breeden's efforts to recover money for the
investors. ``The trustee has put so much into this sale of stock as
really crucial, that if it doesn't go ... oh, my God,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All of which has some people involved in the case rolling their
eyes in exasperation. Indeed, a creditors' committee that
represents almost all the individual investors in the case asked
the bankruptcy judge in the case to put off any discussion on the
conflict-of-interest allegations until after he rules on the
Equivest sale, which he may do this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee has criticized Breeden's fees _ and what it
calls his high-handed ways _ it wants the stock sale to go through,
said Daniel Stolz, a lawyer for the creditors.
</P>
<P>
   How this dispute is resolved has enormous implications for the
reputations of the men involved and for the thousands of investors
who are awaiting more cash.
</P>
<P>
   It may also affect the criminal trial of Patrick Bennett, who
ran the Bennett companies and has been charged with 37 counts
related to securities fraud. His trial is to begin in November in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute may ultimately have implications for Syracuse, the
struggling upstate city of 164,000 where the whole mess began.
Though the city's economy is starting to show signs of growth after
years of stagnation, the pace is slow _ the city added just 200 new
jobs in the year ended in June, according to the state Department
of Labor, an increase of 0.1 percent (in New York City, by
contrast, jobs increased by 2.3 percent in the same period).
</P>
<P>
   So Syracuse is still a place where every job counts. At its
peak, the Bennett group employed 250 people, the bulk of whom still
work there but could become unemployed as the bankruptcy winds
down. Breeden hopes Equivest will be able to hire some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Bennett companies were founded in 1977 by Edmund Bennett,
known as Bud, and his wife, Kathleen. The bulk of their business
came from financing leases on office equipment, like copiers and
fax machines, which are often rented by state and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The company appeared to be extremely successful. From 1985 to
1987, it made Inc. magazine's list of the 500 fastest-growing
private companies in America. The elder Bennetts, and their two
sons, Patrick and Michael, became important figures and
philanthropists in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, according to court documents, the Bennetts began
selling the leases, and pools of leases, to investors. Most of the
sales were done through small brokerage firms, which described the
leases to clients as very conservative investments.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators were not so sure. In 1994, the Securities and
Exchange Commission began looking into the Bennett empire.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, the SEC sued the company and Patrick Bennett,
accusing him of selling $570 million of unregistered securities and
of running a giant Ponzi scheme, in which early ``investors'' were
paid off with the money put in by later ``investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leases had been sold to more than one investor, and some
were made up out of whole cloth, Breeden said. All the money that
came in as lease payments, and all the money paid out to investors,
came from a general fund that he calls ``the honey pot.'' The
Bennetts themselves used money from the pot to buy various things,
but seemed to specialize in unprofitable gambling properties,
including an unfinished riverboat, a defunct casino and a failing
race track.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The day after the SEC filed suit, the Bennett companies filed
for bankruptcy protection. The following month, Breeden, with the
support of his old agency, was appointed trustee by the Justice
Department. It was a decision made over the head of Van Baalen's
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been the start of Breeden's problems, although the
life of a trustee is almost never a happy one. The trustee often
becomes a focus for the anger of all the people affected by the
bankruptcy, who resent the trustee for making money off their
misery.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly true when, as in Breeden's case, he is
making quite a lot of money. He stands to make millions of dollars,
depending on how much he recovers for creditors, in addition to his
annual $600,000 salary, which, he asserts, is not too much for
someone who is running an enormous, complex operation.
</P>
<P>
   But it sure looks like a lot in Syracuse, where the average
worker makes less than $28,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   And Breeden has taken some very unpopular steps, including suing
the defrauded investors to adjust the amounts of their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors continue to believe in the Bennetts, noting that
the allegations of fraud have never been proved in court. The elder
Bennetts have never been charged; according to court documents,
Michael Bennett, who was charged with one count each of conspiracy
and obstruction of justice, is expected to reach a plea agreement
with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bennett denies that there was any scheme to defraud
investors. ``In his opinion, there were enough assets there to pay
the creditors, and if they were short, it was only 5 percent or 10
percent,'' said Richard Croak, an Albany lawyer who represents
Bennett in the bankruptcy case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat is just an ordinary guy from Syracuse who got involved in
this thing,'' Croak said. ``He's not a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Breeden has won some skirmishes in his battles over the
bankruptcy, and lost others. Last month, for instance, Judge
Stephen Gerling of federal bankruptcy court in Utica ruled that
Croak could not depose Breeden about some of the potential
conflicts raised by Van Baalen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, Gerling ruled that Breeden must either resign
as trustee or give up another of his jobs, as consultant to the
accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche. The problem, the judge said, is
that Deloitte will not reveal all of its clients, some of whom may
be involved in the bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's underlying complaint, and one of Van Baalen's as
well, is that Breeden was slow to tell them about the consulting
job, and provided little information when he did tell them. ``The
trustee appears to believe that the court and the parties should
simply rely on him as a fiduciary to make an independent
determination that he remains disinterested,'' Gerling wrote
disapprovingly.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Breeden says. Saying that he is doing what
is best for the defrauded investors, he interprets Van Baalen's
queries as attacks on his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a trustee more honest or who has worked
any harder than I have,'' Breeden said. ``This is not a game _ it
is a system that needs to insure the best results'' for creditors.
</P>
<P>
   And results, he added, ``speak louder than words.''

CHURCH SERVICE HONORS CRASH VISTIMS

<P>
   CHESTER, Nova Scotia _ Never has the small church on the hill
that has stood here in the ocean wind for 223 years held a service
such as the one at 3 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ecumenical service of witness and remembrance for the
victims of Swissair Flight 111'' at St. Stephen's Anglican Church
was the idea of a cherub-faced pastor named Daniel Greene, who
works at the nearby Chester United Baptist Church. Greene said the
suffering among people on the south shore here has been tremendous.
</P>
<P>
   While private memorial services have been held for relatives of
the victims, the St. Stephen's liturgy was one of at least five
public services scheduled for this area.
</P>
<P>
   As an organ played softly from the balcony, about 300 people,
most of them elderly, filled the wooden pews. But it was the
entrance of six uniformed Air Canada pilots that caused the
greatest commotion, moments before the opening hymn: ``O God, our
Help in ages past, our Hope for years to come, our Shelter from the
stormy blast, and our eternal Home!''
</P>
<P>
   Captain Joe Gallagher, a pilot based in Toronto, listened from
the third row, and struggled to hold back the tears. He did not
know the pilots of Swissair 111, he said, but at the same time said
he felt he did know them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been any one of us,'' he said. ``We came to pay
our respects, in uniform, especially to the families of Urs
Zimmermann and Stefan Lowe. We came because it happened in our own
backyard.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Brian Murphy of St. Augustine's Roman Catholic parish read
Psalm 27, which holds the following words: ``For he will shelter me
in his day of trouble. He will conceal me under the cover of his
tent, he will set me high upon a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two days, families of the victims have been brought
to green army tents on the rocks in Peggy's Cove, 5 1/2 miles from
where the plane crashed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Anne Palmeter of Geneva came to the service, she said,
because she knew the parents and grandparents of two of the
victims. She did not say who they were, but said the relatives had
spoken to her on the phone from Europe earlier in the day, said
Palmeter, who was visiting Nova Scotia when the accident occured.
</P>
<P>
   As Pastor Phillip Williams of Tancook Island sang a religious
folk song called ``Higher Ways,'' Grant Richardson, a retired
fisherman from Mill Cove, could not stop himself from crying. His
wife, Beverley, said the tears were unusual, but justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened right over our cottage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear those poor people must have felt,'' said Richardson.
``We felt we had to come here today. It's all we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   And the song went on: ``If I could only fly I'd go up and look
down from the sky. ... There's so much going on down here that I
must confess I don't understand.''

BROWN, TATA MAKE COMEBACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two of UCLA's most inspirational stories are unfolding at
defensive end, where seniors Jayson Brown and Vae Tata celebrate
every step they take.
</P>
<P>
   Tata missed the 1996 with a knee injury and the 1997 season with
multiple injuries resulting from a serious off-season car accident.
He has lost size and speed and is currently third on the depth
chart behind Pete Holland and Travor Turner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the same as he was,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown is expected to contribute _ probably as Kenyon
Coleman's backup on the other end _ and that is a testament to hard
work and modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Brown played in just five games the past two seasons because of
a dislocated left kneecap that required three surgeries. In the
most recent operation, last October, his patella was detached,
moved an inch to the right, and reattached. He petitioned the NCAA
and in April received a rare sixth year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   What he lacks in size (260 pounds) and speed, he makes up for in
experience and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal last year was to play against USC _ meaning I'd
have gone through the whole season,'' he said. ``At this point, I
can't take anything for granted. I feel as good as I'm going to
get. I just hope I make it until the USC game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tata, No. 90, and Brown, No. 91, have adjoining lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas update: The Longhorns scored 66 points _ sound familiar? _
in a season-opening victory over lowly New Mexico State. Tailback
Ricky Williams, the top returning Heisman Trophy vote getter,
scored six touchdowns and rushed for 215 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was disappointed at halftime when he saw he had 101
yards,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns weren't perfect in their first game under
Brown, who replaced John Mackovic. New Mexico State gained 483
total yards (233 rushing) and scored 33 points in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play defense (against UCLA) like we did in the second
half, they'll get 66 points again,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is ranked 23rd in the latest Associated Press poll, its
first ranking since the 66-3 loss to UCLA last year.
</P>
<P>
   Off and on: While Texas thrashed New Mexico State, the Bruins
had the weekend off. Advantage, Longhorns?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge advantage,'' Toledo said. ``You probably
improve the most from the first to the second game. They've had a
chance to iron out the wrinkles. We'll go through the growing pains
(Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   Texas tickets: A crowd of 80,000 is expected for the 12:30 p.m.
kickoff. The first 10,000 fans entering through tunnels on the east
(sun) side will receive a visor and bottle of water.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to arrive early: the Arroyo Seco is not a model
for traffic flow, as the Washington game (86,000 spectators) proved
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Parking is available outside the Arroyo at the Parsons
Engineering Building in Pasadena (shuttle service to the stadium)
and inside the Arroyo at the Brookside Golf Course.

MEMORIES OF SILVER DEFIES HER MEDICAL CHART AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ They were two of the finest
grass-racing fillies in the country, Memories of Silver and Auntie
Mame, and they tangled in Saratoga's prestigious Diana Handicap on
Sunday and toughed it out down the homestretch. But at the wire,
with the long shot B.A. Valentine tucked in between them, Memories
of Silver streaked home with her third straight victory and a
perfect postsurgical record for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's far in front of her division,'' said Jimmy
Toner, who trains Memories of Silver for Joan and John Phillips.
``Our ultimate goal is to get an Eclipse Award.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a certain air of drama surrounding Memories of
Silver. At the age of 2 and again at 4, she sustained hind-leg
fractures, and last winter even underwent surgery to repair the
damage from a stress fracture. Now, at the age of 5, she runs with
metal screws in one of her legs, but she wins.
</P>
<P>
   She won the Diana after Jerry Bailey steered her through traffic
to overtake B.A. Valentine in the stretch, and then prevailed in a
three-horse drive to the finish. She got there first by a length
and three-quarters over B.A. Valentine, who also ran second in the
Diana last year and who had three-quarters of a length on Auntie
Mame, with Witchful Thinking fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was optimistic,'' Bailey said, ``because with her courage, I
knew she would be able to overcome the nature of the injury she
sustained last winter. Now she's probably as good as she ever was.
This horse would run through the eye of a needle, and that's all
she needs. All we needed was a crack to shoot through, and that's
what we got.''
</P>
<P>
   John Velazquez, who also had a lot of steering to do aboard
Auntie Mame, said: ``When I got to the first turn, I found myself
running up behind horses, so I had to take back a bit. At the
three-quarters pole, I pulled her out, and she really responded.
The only thing was that I had no choice but to go wide.''
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Silver ran the mile and an eighth in 1:46, returned
$4.60 for a $2 bet and earned $180,000, raising her bankroll to
$1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the race before the Diana, an allowance with a purse of
$52,000, the favored Richter Scale surrendered his lead to
Victoriously as the field turned for home. Victoriously won by more
than three lengths, with Richter Scale second and Golden Larch
third.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, trained by Jimmy Jerkens, ran the mile and an eighth
under Jorge Chavez in 1:49 4/5 and paid $12.60. Richter Scale,
trained by Bill Mott with Bailey riding, has won six of 12 starts
but lost his last three.

SPORTS COLUMN: CUBS VS. CARDS _ THE ULTIMATE RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They have played each other 2,060 times since 1892,
in places like South Side Park in Chicago and Robison Field in St.
Louis, and once they even played a game in Association Park in
Kansas City, Mo., in circumstances not explained in the record
book.
</P>
<P>
   They have played each other in the springtime when swollen
rivers imperiled the Midwest, and they have played each other in
the summer when the corn was as high as an elephant's eye, and they
have played each other in the fall, when the fans' toes grew numb.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the old contentiousness will have a new meaning,
because Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa are going for Roger Maris'
record in the same old baseball town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be electrifying, it's going to be exciting,''
said McGwire, who will team up with his buddy in a news conference
before Monday's game between the Cardinals and the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't be looking forward to these two games, then your
heart isn't beating,'' McGwire added.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McGwire nor Sosa managed a home run Sunday, which means
they are stuck at 60 and 58, respectively. Now the Cubs come here
to play the Cardinals in Busch Stadium, with the nine World Series
flags and the eight retired Cardinals' numbers, the statue of Stan
the Man in the plaza, real-life Stan the Man demonstrating his
swing and his smile, and good old Red Schoendienst still smacking
grounders during infield practice, wearing No. 2 on his 75-year-old
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always thought this was the best baseball town of
all,'' said Bud Selig, a Milwaukee man who became commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs are trying to hold their lead for the National League
wild-card berth in the playoffs, a situation that never existed
when Hack Wilson clouted home runs with his stumpy little body for
the Cubbies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, more people are going to be watching Sammy and
Mark,'' said Tony La Russa, who has managed in both towns, albeit
with the White Sox in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a tremendous atmosphere between these two
teams,'' La Russa said with the enthusiasm of a true believer.
``Now you have both teams in the same ball park, and you know the
fans would knock the roof off the ball park _ if there were a
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Cubs have won 1,064 games, and the Cardinals
have won 996 going back to the last century, or 1003-957 in the
20th century alone. The Cubs dominated the early decades, the
Cardinals rolled from the '20s to the '40s, and both teams were
slogging along in September 1961 when the Cubs brought up a
prospect named Louis Clark Brock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most shocking experience I've ever had,'' Brock
said Sunday. ``I walked on the field, and I heard a huge cheer and
I thought one of my teammates had played a practical joke on me, so
I went back inside. I looked in the mirror, my uniform was all
right, so I got up my courage and I went back out, and they started
cheering all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked one of my teammates what was going on, and he said:
`This is a Cardinals-Cubs series. It's a war in which no prisoners
are taken.' From that day, I realized it couldn't get any more
intense than that. Now you throw in Sammy and Mark.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, the Cubs traded Brock to the Cardinals, who promptly
won the World Series that year, won another in 1967 and nearly won
in 1968. His No. 20 is now retired by the Cardinals, for whom he
makes occasional speaking engagements, venturing up into central
Illinois, the dangerous fault line between Cardinals and Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly where the border is, but I do know there
is one house right on the border,'' Brock said. ``The Cubs' fans
stay in the kitchen and the Cardinals' fans stay in the den.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry touches fans in other parts of the Midwest. Growing
up in Milwaukee, then a minor-league city, Selig rooted for the
Yankees and the Cubs, and his brother rooted for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would drive down to Wrigley Field when those two teams
met,'' Selig said Sunday. ``You can talk about the Packers and the
Bears, the Red Sox and the Yankees; I think this is the best
rivalry in sports. When I saw the schedule, and saw Cubs and
Cardinals on Labor Day, I knew I had to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   He will stay on for Games 2,061 and 2,062 in an old rivalry, now
infused with the energy of two sluggers who like each other,
despite being a Cardinal and a Cub.

SPECTACULAR FINISH DOOMS JETS IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For four quarters on Sunday, for one game, for
one season opener, the New York Jets showed they were equal to the
National Football League's best.
</P>
<P>
   And they might have escaped from San Francisco with a tie or
victory. But in a game of shifting fortunes, high drama and quirky
plays, the 49ers defeated the Jets in sudden-death overtime, 36-30.
</P>
<P>
   The winning score was beautiful, if you are a 49ers fan: a
96-yard touchdown run by Garrison Hearst, who stiff-armed the
rookie safety Kevin Williams at the San Francisco 20, and who
eluded clutches and grabs in a 17-second run to the wind-swept end
zone, right where home plate is. The time of sudden-death was 4
minutes 8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be more disappointed than I am right now,'' said Jets
coach Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the way Parcells looks at football, it came down to a
mistake _ ``To just being able to concentrate long enough to win
one of these.''
</P>
<P>
   The crushing run was a fullback trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to my side,'' said defensive lineman Rick Lyle. ``He
came and trapped me.'' Hearst's dash was the longest run in team
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a great game,'' Lyle said, ``and it came down to one
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were many plays in the game that the Jets tied
as time expired on John Hall's 31-yard field goal. The drive to tie
the game featured Glenn Foley connecting on third- and fourth-down
passes.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Jets' offense seemed to have come of age against a
team they could not run effectively against. Curtis Martin
generated only 58 yards on 22 carries in his Jets debut. Foley
tossed for three touchdowns, including a pair to Keyshawn Johnson.
Johnson is such a fan of Jerry Rice's that his original contract
called for extra money if he was able to amass many of the
statistics that Rice has.
</P>
<P>
   Foley _ 30 of 58 for 416 yards, three touchdowns and one
interception _ is still looking for his first complete-game
victory. This was his sixth career start.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young was 26 of 46 for 363 yards, three touchdowns and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Martin and his outstanding running ability that made
a difference in the first half for the Jets, as they unveiled an
overhauled starting lineup. Instead, it was the passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Foley tossed a pair of first-half touchdowns _ a 41-yarder to
Johnson, who split the defense, and a 6-yard lob to Wayne Chrebet _
as the Jets took a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But it was far from perfect. The offensive line committed three
of the Jets' four penalties in the opening half. And Hall's
kickoffs continued to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Young did what he usually does. He froze the defense
as he spotted players on exquisite timing routes. It was Young's
third touchdown pass of the game, late in the fourth quarter that
seemed to put the Jets away. His 31-yard pass to J.J. Stokes, who
leaped in front of Williams, gave the 49ers a 30-27 lead. The Jets,
though, tied it on Hall's field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets scored first on a Hall field goal as they got the ball
on a turnover. It was the first time the Jets had intercepted Young
in his third appearance against them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams grabbed the ball as it bounced off Irv Smith's fingers.
Williams, the only rookie starter on defense, returned the ball 34
yards to the 49ers' 27. Hall soon connected on a 24-yard field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the crowd was watching Rice, who is coming back from
two serious knee injuries last season, on every play. The first two
passes to him fell incomplete. The third was a 16-yard slant that
led to the 49ers' first score.
</P>
<P>
   Rice snared six passes for 86 yards. But Johnson did better,
with nine catches for 126 yards, producing his first two-touchdown,
100-yard receiving game.
</P>
<P>
   Young led an 84-yard march that culminated with Hearst's 5-yard
run up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, a Foley interception did no damage when
Wade Richey missed on a 47-yard field-goal attempt. Foley threw
high to Johnson over the middle and it spurted toward cornerback
Antonio Langham, who snared it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's 41-yard touchdown catch propelled the Jets to a 10-7
lead, but the 49ers soon retaliated with a 63-yard drive, with
Young connecting with Stokes on a 6-yard score. On the series, a
penalty on Ray Mickens kept the San Francisco drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   That 14-10 lead withered on the Jets' final drive of the half,
though, helped by Leon Johnson's 33-yard kickoff return. Langham
interfered with Johnson on the San Francisco 7, and Foley found
Chrebet for the 6-yard scoring pass and a 17-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49ers' first drive of the third quarter, Richey produced
a 22-yard field goal to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets showed resilience, and their next drive culminated
in Johnson's 21-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Rice's turn. He caught a 21-yarder from Young. And,
on a fourth-and-6, Rice took Young's short pass and converted it
into a 14-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Ferguson blocked Richey's extra-point attempt and the
Jets held a 24-23 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, though, responded with a 32-yard field goal by Hall
with 3:46 remaining to increase their lead to 27-23.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary game, or an ordinary moment, and Young
directed the 49ers back, hitting Stokes on a 31-yard touchdown as
the big receiver leaped in front of Williams. &QL;

 &HT;    Call-up, then HR shock Malloy
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Seven long years. From Idaho to Macon, Durham to
Richmond. After 774 games, 2,906 at-bats and untold moments of
doubt and frustration, Marty Malloy finally made it to the major
leagues Sunday. And then the most wonderful thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit the ball,'' Malloy said, ``and it just happened to go
out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a homer that later left him momentarily speechless on a
day he later called ``Joyous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just getting here finally, after what seems forever,'' Malloy
said, ``and hitting that ball and it going out, I can't describe
it. And just all the people who believed in me over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   People like his parents, Tommy and Beverly, back home in
Trenton, Fla. His wife, Lacy. Bobby Dews, now the Braves' third
base coach, who worked with Malloy throughout the Braves' farm
system. And Paul Hemphill, the Atlanta novelist who chronicled
Malloy's 1994 season with Class A Durham in his book, ``The Heart
of the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Marty wasn't gonna go quietly,'' Hemphill said by phone
from his home. No, Marty arrived with a bang.
</P>
<P>
   With Keith Lockhart still out with a strained right hamstring
and Tony Graffanino in a 3-for-37 slump and hitting .204, manager
Bobby Cox wanted Malloy. Reliever Mark Wohlers, already on the
15-day disabled list, agreed Saturday to go on the 60-day DL to
make room on the 40-man roster for Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Richmond Braves arrived home at 1 a.m. Sunday from a
series in Norfolk, Malloy got off the bus. ``I was fixin' to get in
my car and go to my apartment,'' he said. Instead, Richmond
pitching coach Bill Fischer called Malloy into manager Max
Venable's office, where he learned of his call-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock,'' said Malloy, caught completely unaware. ``I
didn't know what to do. It was probably the happiest day of my
life, something you hope for from the day you start playing. Not
being on the (40-man) roster, I didn't think I had a chance at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Malloy's car was already packed with his belongings. He and Lacy
were planning to drive back home to Chiefland, Fla., after
Richmond's season finale today. Instead, Malloy returned to their
Richmond apartment, got to sleep at 5 a.m. and awoke at 6:30 for an
8 a.m. flight to Philadelphia. He changed planes for a flight to
LaGuardia Airport, caught a taxi to Shea Stadium, walked into the
clubhouse at 11:15 and shook hands with assistant general manager
Dean Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, Marty,'' Taylor said. ``You're batting
second.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good story, Marty,'' said Cox. ``A hard-nosed guy.
Maybe he'll give us a spark. He certainly deserved a chance to
play. There comes a time when you owe it to guys in the
organization to give 'em a crack. Marty's one of those guys. He's a
tough little kid. He doesn't have all the ability in the world
probably, but he's a good player. He's a dirt guy, like Lemke.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malloy was given Mark Lemke's old No. 20 uniform. In his
first at-bat, Malloy took three straight called strikes from Rick
Reed, the last two on the inside corner. ``My second at-bat,
Lockhart and Chipper (Jones) told me he was gonna come in until I
proved I could hit it,'' said Malloy.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after singling and making a nice play afield, Malloy
said, ``I didn't feel any pressure. But I felt I had to go out and
get something done. It just happened to be a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back, Cat
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling strong,''said a smiling Andres Galarraga, who
returned from his three-game suspension Sunday and smoked his 43rd
homer in the ninth inning off Mets reliever Jeff Tam.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out twice in his first three at-bats, Galarraga
homered beyond the visitors bullpen in deep left, but was more
delighted with Malloy's homer. ``Oh man,'' he said, ``I'm so happy
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   On hold
</P>
<P>
   With one hit in his last 22 at-bats, and sitting upon Malloy's
arrival, Tony Graffanino is befuddled by the worst slump of his
young career. ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I felt fine all day
(Saturday, when he went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts). Thought I
saw the ball well, had good swings at it, thought I was on the ball
a few times. I don't feel like I'm looking hideous up there, not
swinging at garbage pitches and having no idea. The only thing I
can do is keep playing defense.

 &HT;    Falcons survive Carolina opener
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Fans who saw the Atlanta Falcons play Sunday
probably will agree that their performance against Carolina was no
work of art. Then again, given a hideous historical perspective
from which to view the 19-14 victory over the Panthers, it was
perhaps as aesthetically pleasing to the Falcons as is possible for
a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons had not won a road opener since 12 years ago. They
were 0-for-3 in the home of Carolina, their closest NFC West rival.
And maybe the 65,129 fans at Ericsson Stadium witnessed a
masterpiece after all.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it was in the eyes of the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was huge,'' said middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, a
participant in road-opening losses each of his 11 previous seasons.
``We wanted to set the tempo for the season, and get rid of a lot
of ghosts, and we did. Huge win, man!''
</P>
<P>
   Credit quarterback Chris Chandler, who took a beating while
suffering through six sacks. Chandler passed for 268 yards,
including scoring passes of 11 yards to Terance Mathis (six
catches, 74 yards), and 44 yards to rookie Tim Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   And throw a bouquet to the Panthers' punt team.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a bad snap that sailed over the head of Carolina
punter Ken Walter and resulted in a safety in the third quarter,
and a blocked punt in the fourth quarter (leading to a 43-yard
field goal by Morten Andersen), these teams might have played into
the night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Falcons won after surviving a King Kong-sized scare
at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers' last possession began at their own 12 with no
timeouts and 1:02 remaining. Passes by Kerry Collins of 9, 16 and
22 yards, and an encroachment penalty against Atlanta moved the
ball to the Falcons' 36. The clock stopped with five seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Collins threw high and deep. Atlanta safety Eugene Robinson may
have gotten a hand on the ball, but so too did Carolina receiver
Muhsin Muhammad. It also caromed off the helmet of the Falcons'
Juran Bolden and began falling to earth _ very near Panthers
receiver Raghib Ismail, who was on his back in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   When the ball hit the ground, there was instant relief felt by
the Falcons, who are in position to go for their first 2-0 start
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. Wow. Wow,'' Falcons general manager Harold Richardson
muttered in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought hard on the road against a lot of crowd noise, a lot
of heat,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``There were a lot of things we
had to overcome mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons started first-half drives at their 7-, 5-, 2- and
10-yard lines. Penalties didn't help; Atlanta had seven of its 11
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But on their third possession, the Falcons went 98 yards on 11
plays, taking a 7-0 lead on a pass to a wide-open Mathis with 7:54
left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina responded when Collins (21-of-37, 270 yards, two TDs,
one interception) hit Rae Carruth for a 47-yard gain, then found
Wesley Walls alone in the end zone for a 6-yard touchdown and a 7-7
tie at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons caught a break in the middle of the third quarter,
when Walter couldn't handle a high snap, and fell on the ball in
the end zone for a safety. Atlanta's 9-7 lead grew to 16-7 when
Chandler hit Dwight down the middle with 2:07 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina's Michael Bates raced 45 yards down the left
sideline with the kickoff. On the next play, Atlanta cornerback Ray
Buchanan stumbled, and Ismail was alone on the left sideline for a
56-yard touchdown, cutting Atlanta's lead to 16-14 with 1:46 left
in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons made their own break on Carolina's next possession.
Walter was about to punt when he saw Bolden bearing down from his
left. He dropped the ball to kick it, but changed his mind _
stopping his leg swing _ at the same time Bolden arrived. Bolden
was credited with a blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got the ball at the Carolina 42, and Morten Anderson
added a field goal with 8:46 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got production from its running game down the stretch,
with Jamal Anderson getting 61 of his 88 yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many times we had (Atlanta) in third-and-long situations,
and they were able to convert many of those,'' said Carolina coach
Dom Capers. ``We can't afford to give up five points in the kicking
game. The margin was the safety, and the field position we gave
them on the punt in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was especially happy about a run defense that held
Carolina to 54 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long ways to go,'' he said, ``but we're on the
right road.''

 &HT;    Home run showdown in St. Louis
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It's the sixth inning Sunday afternoon, Cardinals
first baseman Mark McGwire at the plate, Brett Tomko on the mound
for the Reds. Tomko lets go a fastball, McGwire uncoils his big
swing and rips the ball down the left field line.
</P>
<P>
   No. 61?
</P>
<P>
   Nope, just the most memorable foul ball in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every times he steps to the plate it's mind-boggling,'' said
commissioner Bud Selig, who was sitting right behind the plate.
``You just feel like you're suffocating. When he hit that ball I
thought, `Oh, here it ...'''
</P>
<P>
   So McGwire's bid to tie Roger Maris goes on another day and sets
up a two-game series matching the two hitters trying to bang away
at history.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and the Cubs will be in town for a Labor Day matinee
and another game Tuesday night. Sosa, who didn't go deep Sunday in
Pittsburgh, remained at 58. McGwire is at 60. What drama. What
excitement. Can anyone sleep?
</P>
<P>
   ``These two men,'' Selig said, ``have captured this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cardinals outfielder Brian Jordan, ``It's going to be
pandimonium here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sosa, ``It's will be like the World Series in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   The first pitch is at 2:10 p.m., and Steve Trachsel (14-7) will
pitch for the Cubs against former Brave Kent Mercker (9-11).
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a group of reporters how he would pitch Sosa, Mercker
laughed and said, ``I'm not going to tell you. You'd fax the
interview to Sammy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago's 4-3 extra inning loss to the Pirates Sunday, Sosa
was 2-for-5, but didn't homer for the first time in four games.
McGwire, meanwhile, was 0-for-3 with a walk. On his first at-bat,
he lined the ball to short. On the second at-bat, McGwire was
walked on four pitches. Then came the foul ball on his third trip
to the plate, missing the foul pole by about seven feet. He would
then strike out. On his final at-bat, McGwire lined a ball up the
middle, but the Reds had shifted their infield and second baseman
Brett Boone threw him out.
</P>
<P>
   Maris' family, except his widow Patricia, was in attendance. She
was in satisfactory condition after being admitted to Barnes-Jewish
Hospital with an irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't appear anything is going to put a damper on what
is taking place here at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so good, it's hard to believe,'' Selig said. ``There is
no way we could have orchestrated this, especially these next two
days with the Cubs coming here.''

 &HT;    Seles-Hinges showdown set
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Martina Hingis says her game's getting worse, and she
wasn't smitten with Monica Seles' play either after the two former
women's champions won ugly matches Sunday at the U.S. Open to set
up a quarterfinal showdown Tuesday in Arthur Ashe Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, the defending champ and No. 1-ranked player on the WTA
Tour, defeated French teenager Nathalie Dechy 6-4, 6-4 and was
among the many confounded by swift and capricious winds in the
stadium court. She thought she'd double-faulted 20 times and was
startled to hear it was only nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just kind of escaping every day,'' said Hingis, who needed
three sets in the third round to beat another French teenager,
Amelie Mauresmo. ``Instead of getting better, I'm getting worse.
... If I continue playing like this, I'm not going to go
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, a two-time champion, was leading American Kimberly Po
6-2, 4-1 before surrendering five straight games and the second
set. She played defensively in the third and let Po beat herself,
6-2, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mind just wandered off,'' said Seles, who also had
choice words for the wind. ``I never felt in control of where the
ball was going. ... Wind is wind, but this is more than wind. I
mean, you hit the ball and it goes here instead of there. By two
meters it can vary. I never played in conditions like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles has beaten Hingis in their only two meetings this year,
but Hingis, whose candor is often confused with disrespect, didn't
agree Seles is playing her best tennis since the 1995 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like today, I don't think it was one of her best matches,''
Hingis said. ``She always is saying her back's bothering her or
something. She also lost to Lindsay (Davenport) the last two times.
So I don't think she's on her best, but me neither. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna beat last year's U.S. Open
runner-up, Irina Spirlea 6-3, 6-3. Novotna is 6-0 in her career
against Sprilea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just getting more and more devastated (mentally),''
Novotna said. ``I know how that feels when you play somebody and
you can't beat them for a while. Basically, all she can do is hope
I have a bad match.''
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, fifth-seeded Richard Krajicek retired with a
knee injury against Thomas Johasson, and Americans Jan-Michael
Gambill and Geoff Grant lost five-setters. Gambill went down to
10th-seeded Carlos Moya 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4). Grant, a
former Duke player who quit the tour three years ago, fell to
Germany's Oliver Gross 7-5, 6-7, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov and No. 13 Tim Henman advanced easily
to the round of 16.

THE DAY AFTER: HARLEM RESIDENTS ANGRY WITH GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also: NY-YOUTH-MARCH, NY-YOUTH-POLICE) 
(nk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A home health care aide who works in Harlem spent two
hours on Saturday trying to get home to the South Bronx. A woman
trapped in front of her apartment on Malcolm X Boulevard was an
hour late getting to work. And a Harlem woman trying to visit a
shoe-repair shop was directed by police through a circuitous maze
of blue barricades, only to find the shop closed for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Harlem found their neighborhood turned upside down
by the war of wills between City Hall and the organizers of a rally
billed as the Million Youth March. All day Saturday, the police
were posted atop apartment buildings. Block after block was
cordoned off, making it impossible for many residents to venture
beyond their stoops. And subway service was suspended in and out of
the heart of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, even as normality returned to the neighborhood, many
people remained furious. And even those who, like Yvonne Bacott,
denounced the rally's chief organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad,
accused Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of turning what could have been a
quiet, uneventful affair into an unnecessarily tense afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bacott, a Harlem resident, had no desire to join the rally.
But the rally and the police presence that it inspired made it
impossible to run a simple errand _ to pick up her daughter's shoes
from a repair shop around the corner. She circled several blocks
lined with officers, passed neighbors who shook their heads in
disbelief and discovered that she could not even board the subway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this a village,'' said Ms. Bacott. ``This village was
disenfranchised from the rest of the world. How dare he!''
</P>
<P>
   Like Ms. Bacott, many of the men and women who poured out of the
Canaan Baptist Church on 116th Street on Sunday said they did not
hold Muhammad in high regard. And some were especially disturbed
that he had urged young people at the rally to defend themselves by
seizing police officers' guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a mission statement for unity and harmony,'' she
said. ``That's a mission statement for destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   But in their eyes, Giuliani also acted improperly. A heavy
police presence, said Dorothea Caldwell-Brown, a lawyer from Crown
Heights, Brooklyn, only seemed to encourage Muhammad in his
message. And when officers in riot gear assembled behind the stage
minutes before the rally was scheduled to close, she said, they
only reinforced the belief that many black New Yorkers hold _ that
neither the police nor City Hall respects them, and particularly
their young.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actions of this Giuliani feed these young people to
Khallid,'' Ms. Caldwell-Brown, 47, said. ``He stands up and says,
`Look at how they treat you,' and here they come rushing in doing
exactly what he says. Giuliani and Khallid are in concert, in my
opinion. They need one another.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For some, the rally was not only about Muhammad. Sunday, there
were those who said they knew little about him, only that they were
drawn to the Million Youth March because they thought it could keep
young people out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's his name Muhammad, he's got his beliefs or whatever,''
said Maurice Barrett, 30, who saw the rally from in front of his
apartment on Malcolm X Boulevard, a section of Lenox Avenue. ``He's
against Jews, whites, even blacks half the time, but a lot of
people didn't come for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Giuliani administration officials renewed their calls
for the arrest of Muhammad on charges of inciting to riot.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Canaan Baptist Church, the Rev. Wyatt Tee Walker shook
his head at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then Giuliani should be indicted for the police riot on the
Brooklyn Bridge of which he was a part a few years ago,'' he said,
referring to a rowdy demonstration by police officers in 1992,
which Giuliani joined before becoming mayor.

 &HT;    Sosa satisfied out of spotlight
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa doesn't hold a special press conference before every
series. ``Writers,'' he said, ``can talk to me whenever they want.
Well, not when I'm hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have a security guard walking him through the crowds.
``I like being around the fans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't take muscle-building supplements. ``Just those little
Flintstone vitamins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the other hitter in the chase to catch Roger Maris. Sosa,
who continues to yield the spotlight to St. Louis first baseman
Mark McGwire, arguably has had the better season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is leading the home-run chase, 60-58, and everyone
expects him to break the record en route to baseball's Hall of
Fame. But with his team out of the playoff race, McGwire has been
able to swing for the fences on every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa can't take that approach. His Cubs are in the middle of
heated wild-card race with the New York Mets and San Francisco
Giants. He is playing team ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of there being a more valuable player in
baseball,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``He has meant so much
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has been marvelous on and off the field. He continually has
pushed the attention of the chase to McGwire. ``I want Mark to
break the record,'' he said. ``To me, I'm a winner already. I've
gone so far this year, and a lot more (home runs) are going to
come. To me, just being behind Mark McGwire is being a winner. I'm
enjoying every moment of this. We have a chance to go to the
playoffs, and I'm taking over.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, McGwire and Sosa continue the chase at Busch Stadium in
an historic two-game series between the Cubs and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been waiting for this moment,'' Sosa said. ``It's
going to be tremendous. I'm sure they'd like to see Mark and I
together for the last time this year. I'm willing to have a good
time, like always.''
</P>
<P>
   That is prototype Sosa, a free-swinging, free-talking player
liked by everyone in the Cubs clubhouse. While McGwire has been
inaccessible except for preseries press conferences, Sosa spends
much of his pregame time fielding questions.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't hurt him. Many of his offensive numbers are better
than McGwire's _ batting average (.314 to .296), RBIs (140 to 127)
and average with runners in scoring percentage (.323 to .275).
</P>
<P>
   In short, it has been a breakthrough season. Sosa hit 38 homers
last season and struck out a league-leading 174 times. The scouting
report said Sosa was a great talent, but an undisciplined hitter
who couldn't hit in clutch situations.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa started in the Texas organization, was traded to the White
Sox in 1989 and then to the Cubs in the winter of 1991. The Cubs
began understanding what they had in 1993, when Sosa hit 33 homers
and drove in 93 runs. He improved his average by 39 points to reach
.300. But he continued to strike out. From 1995-97, he averaged 147
strikeouts a season. He also hit only .246 with runners in scoring
position last year and .159 on two-strike counts.
</P>
<P>
   So during the spring, the Cubs decided to rework his swing.
Bench coach Billy Williams and hitting coach Jeff Pentland pulled
videos of other hitters, including Atlanta's Chipper Jones, and
showed Sosa how to work the strike zone and quit swinging wildly at
balls outside. They shortened his swing and stressed patience. The
result? Sosa is down from one strikeout every 3.68 at-bats last
season to one every 3.93 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he knew he was maybe a half step behind some of the
other guys,'' Pentland said. ``I think inside he felt he was as
good, had the same amount of tools as the (Ken) Griffeys, and
(Barry) Bonds and McGwires and (Gary) Sheffields.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa started slow this season, hitting 13 homers in the first
two months. But he hit an amazing 17 homers in the first 21 days in
June and was back in the chase. He led the race once _ for 45
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Sosa, from the Dominican Republic, is thankful
for these good times. His father died when he was 7, so Sosa shined
shoes for 25 cents and sold oranges for a dime to help put food on
the table. As a child, he used milk cartons for baseball gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the best time of my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa admits that breaking the record would be great, but he
would rather see his club make it to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose between the record and the playoffs, I'll
take the playoffs,'' he said. ``That is something that everyone (in
Chicago) is looking for. That doesn't happen every day, and I want
that.''

 &HT;    Manning shows promise in defeat
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Surveying the sea of fans dressed in royal blue
shirts and those in burnt orange uniform jerseys which co-mingled
in the RCA Dome for Sunday's season-opener, someone noted to Jim
Irsay that he might consider renaming his franchise to satisfy
loyalists from both the Colts and the Vols.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about the Volts, huh?'' responded the witty Indianapolis
owner, referring to the unusual alliance forged by Peyton Manning
admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, with the Colts having demonstrated a dearth
of offensive firepower in a 24-15 loss to the Miami Dolphins, that
suggestion seemed incredibly incongruous.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, so did the notion quarterback Peyton
Manning won't immediately be a force in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell the truth, he played even better than I thought he
would, and you're talking to a guy who thinks the world of him,''
assessed Colts coach Jim Mora of his prized rookie's uneven debut.
``There were two things that impressed me: He made a lot of big
plays for us. And he came back from adversity when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning hit 21 of 37 passes for 302 yards, and had six
completions of 16 yards or more. But the former Tennessee star
didn't get his club into the end zone until the final play of the
game and threw three costly interceptions which led to two Miami
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Forget those familiar strains of ``Rocky Top'' he grew
accustomed to hearing during four seasons in Knoxville. The
Dolphins defense, arguably the quickest unit in the NFL, made it
rocky, period, for Manning much of the day, sacking him four times.
</P>
<P>
   Like most rookies, Manning exhibited a habit of going to often
to one receiver _ in this case, wideout Marvin Harrison _ and the
tunnel vision was costly. Dolphins cornerback Terrell Buckley
intercepted two passes intended for Harrison and returned one of
them 21 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rookies tend to adopt' certain receivers, get a little cozy
with them, you know?'' said Buckley. ``We knew (Manning) would go
to Harrison about a dozen times.'' Actually 16 of Manning's 37
throws were for Harrison, who finished with five catches for 102
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as damaging to Manning as his interceptions was
Indianapolis' unproductive running game, which netted only 64 yards
on 26 rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Still the Colts had an outside chance to force overtime when
they gained possession at their 4, trailing 17-9 with 1:32
remaining. On first down, Manning had slot receiver Torrance Small
streaking deep down the right seam on a pattern the two had
modified on the sideline. The pass was barely tipped, though, by
Miami free safety Brock Marion. On the next play, Buckley snatched
an underthrown pass and scored.

 &HT;    U.S. underdogs lose heartbreakers
 &HT;    By TODD HOLCOMB
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- Only two Americans _ Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi _
are in the men's round of 16 at the U.S. Open, but two others _
underdogs Jan-Michael Gambill and Geoff Grant _ nearly joined them
Sunday before losing heart-breaking five-set matches.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, ranked No. 57, was up a service break in the fifth set
against French Open champion Carlos Moya but mishandled a 40-15
lead at 4-3 and lost 6-2, 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (4).
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him the match, basically,'' said Gambill, who has
improved his ranking more than 100 spots this year but is now 0-4
against top-10 players. ``He should never have broken me in the
fifth set. He didn't do anything special.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill, 21, is the youngest American in the top 100 and figures
to make the U.S. Davis Cup team that will play Italy later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   More unexpected was the run of Grant, a wild-card entry who quit
tennis for nine months in 1995 and found work as a teaching pro, a
part-time model and a radio sales telemarketer for his father's
company. The former Duke All-American was beaten 7-5, 6-7, 5-7,
6-3, 7-5 by Oliver Gross, a German journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, 28, said the U.S. Tennis Association, which granted him
the wild card, is only now beginning to support former college
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were considered to have no chance (on the tour) if you
went to college and graduated,'' Grant said. ``I think their
philosophy has changed. Thank God they recognized what I've been
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's highlights
</P>
<P>
   There's no TV today for the afternoon matches, when Andre Agassi
and Venus Williams are endangered by potential upsets. Agassi plays
underrated ninth seed Karol Kucera, who hasn't dropped a set in
three matches. Williams faces Mary Pierce. USA Network will
televise live tonight beginning with Lindsay Davenport vs. Nathalie
Tauziat at 7:30, followed by the tournament's best matchup thus
far, defending men's champ Patrick Rafter vs. Goran Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for Cinderella
</P>
<P>
   The men's semifinals will include at least one player not seeded
among the top 10. That was assured Sunday when fifth-seeded Richard
Krajicek retired with recurring tendinitis in his knee while
trailing Thomas Johansson 7-6, 4-5. Remaining in that quarter of
the draw are No. 11 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 13 Tim Henman and Mark
Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
   Locals at the Open
</P>
<P>
   The only Atlanta players left playing are Luke and Murphy Jensen
and a pair of junior girls. The Jensens have won two rounds and
face seventh-seeded Martin Damm and Jim Grabb today. In the junior
girls draw, Ansley Cargill, a junior at Westminster, plays Uzma
Kahn of Italy in today's first round. Scaringe, a senior at
Lassiter, plays sixth-seeded Nadejda Petrova of Russia.

INGE AICHER-SCHOLL, 81, A GERMAN WRITER WHO INSPIRED PACIFISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Inge Aicher-Scholl, who inspired a
generation of pacifists in post-World War II Germany by writing
about an anti-Nazi youth movement and the killing of her brother
and sister, died on Friday. She was 81, and suffered from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aicher-Scholl moved millions of Germans toward nonviolence
by chronicling the activities of the White Rose, a student movement
whose leaders included her younger brother and sister, Hans and
Sophie Scholl.
</P>
<P>
   Both siblings were killed by Nazis on Feb. 22, 1943, and their
parents were imprisoned by Nazi authorities for several months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl published a book describing White
Rose's nonviolent resistance to the Third Reich and its brutal
repression by the Nazis. Written in spare and dispassionate prose,
the slim volume became a classic work of literature about the Third
Reich.
</P>
<P>
   Hans and Sophie Scholl ``came to represent not just the small
band of youthful dissenters but all the pacifist sympathizers who
were tracked by the Gestapo and the innumerable anonymous victims
who were forced to pay the price for believing that human rights
were more important than obedience to arbitrary laws,'' wrote
Albert von Schirndung, a cultural critic for the Munich daily
Suddeutsche Zeitung.
</P>
<P>
   The book's lack of pretension and its description of ordinary
Germans lent it power. ``It would have been wrong to create new
heroes,'' Schirndung wrote. ``One had already had enough of heroes.
The characters in `White Rose' were people one could identify
with.''
</P>
<P>
   The book and subsequent writing by Mrs. Aicher-Scholl influenced
many Germans who grew up after the war, reinforcing what was
already a deep revulsion against the militarism that had brought
the country to catastrophe and moral disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl and several friends founded a school
for adult education and art in Ulm. One of the co-founders was her
future husband, designer Otl Aicher. Mrs. Aicher-Scholl headed the
school from 1946 to 1974, and remained active in Germany's peace
movement throughout her life.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, she was a prominent figure in anti-military
movements that bitterly but unsuccessfully opposed plans by the
German government and NATO to station nuclear missiles in West
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985 she was arrested for taking part in a sit-in at the U.S.
Pershing II missile base at the southern town of Mutlangen. She and
other protesters were charged with disrupting public order and
given suspended fines.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aicher-Scholl, who died at home in Leutkirch, in southern
Germany, is survived by four of her five children, Eva, Florian,
Julian and Manuel; another child, Pia, died in a car accident in
1975, and her husband died in 1991.

SWISSAIR FLIGHT-DATA RECORDER IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs throughout to correct ``Sunday'' sted ``Saturday'')   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia _ Divers recovered the flight-data recorder
of Swissair 111 Sunday, providing investigators with potentially
mystery-solving evidence about the trans-Atlantic flight that ended
with the deaths of 229 people Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Working 190 feet below the ocean's surface, military divers with
as few as 6 minutes apiece to scour the murky, rocky bottom found
the so-called black box among three large pieces of debris that may
be part of the MD-11's fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Placed in a pail of seawater for protection, the recorder was
hand-carried to waiting investigators who flew the evidence to the
Canadian Transportation Safety Board's engineering lab in Ottawa
last night for days of round-the-clock analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder monitored about 100 systems aboard the aircraft. If
the titanium-protected box is in good condition _ and if its power
was not cut off before impact _ the data should pinpoint what
malfunctioned aboard the seven-year-old aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boxes are pretty robust,'' said Jim Harris, an
investigator with the Canadian safety board. ``This could go a long
way to explaining the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said that the recorder must be cleaned and decontaminated
before a multinational team of analysts can begin its work at what
the investigator called a ``very sophisticated lab.'' The
preliminary work will take several days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recorder was retrieved after divers returned to an area 5
nautical miles off Peggy's Cove where pinging from a transponder
had been heard. Rough weather forced divers to call off that
effort, but their return Sunday yielded what one Canadian Navy
commander called ``the honeypot'' of the search.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery was made despite 10 feet of visibility and
football-size rocks that are constantly moving because of tide and
weather, Navy Captain Paul Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Three pieces of wreckage were found around the recorder that
officials are ``relatively sure'' are part of the fuselage, said
Vic Gerden, the chief investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces will be retrieved and brought to the Shearwater
military base near here, where other remnants of the aircraft have
been stored for reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The base is also where collected human remains have been placed
in refrigerated containers while victims' relatives supply DNA
samples to help with the painstaking identification process. The US
Defense Department has been asked to assist in the DNA analysis.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday, only one body had been found intact, that of a
French woman. The partially intact body of an infant has also been
retrieved. Officials have said it is possible that no more complete
bodies will be found.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Butt, the provincial medical examiner, described in
emotional words Sunday how he and his staff have tried to both
console and inform the many relatives and friends of the victims
who have come to Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an experience that we can only imagine,'' he said of
the relatives' grief.
</P>
<P>
   The search and recovery effort, which is being aided by the
United States and Switzerland, will now focus on finding the
cockpit voice recorder, the other black box, that may give
investigators a picture of what the pilots knew, and when.
</P>
<P>
   The pinging from that box's transponder has not been picked up,
but Webster of the Canadian Navy said that the flight-data
recorder's signal may have been stronger and obscured it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, help is on the way from the US Navy, which has
dispatched the salvage ship USS Grapple to the scene. The ship,
which aided in the TWA Flight 800 crash investigation off Long
Island, sailed from Philadelphia Sunday and is expected off Nova
Scotia by Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the cause of the Swissair tragedy is a mystery. Part of
the puzzle is what prompted the pilots to issue a distress call 70
miles southwest of Halifax. They reported smoke in the cabin to
air-traffic controllers in New Brunswick, and British Airways
pilots who overheard the transmission told investigators they felt
certain that the Swissair crew had donned oxygen masks.
</P>
<P>
   The British pilots have said they discerned ``no panic'' by
their Swissair counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The chief investigator of the crash said Sunday that the debris
retrieved so far gives no indication of the origin of the smoke. No
evidence of a fire has been found on the wreckage, Gerden said.
</P>
<P>
   Another question is why the Swissair crew, told by air traffic
controllers that they were 30 miles from Halifax International
Airport, suddenly realized they were too high to make an emergency
landing. The pilots requested permission to break off their
approach and circle back out over the ocean to dump fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the pilots declared they needed to land
immediately. Radio contact was soon lost, and within six minutes
the aircraft had plunged violently into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the aircraft should have begun dumping fuel 70 miles
from Halifax, and thus saved itself some precious time, is among
``the questions we are asking ourselves now,'' said Harris.

MCGWIRE REMAINS AT 60 IN A QUIET DAY AT THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Two members of the St. Louis Cardinals smacked home
runs in the eighth inning of their game against the Cincinnati Reds
Sunday, and even though Mark McGwire batted against John Hudek in
that inning, he was not one of them. Fernando Tatis was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people don't want to see me hit a home run,'' said Tatis,
who has eight home runs this season to McGwire's 60. ``The people
want to see him hit a home run. I want to see him hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Cardinals victory was the next best thing, albeit a poor
consolation prize, to a McGwire home run for the 47,904 fans at
Busch Stadium, and the home runs by Ray Lankford and Tatis
following McGwire's out gave the Cardinals a 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's inability to tie Roger Maris' single-season home run
record, or even break it, Sunday set the stage for a marvelous
scenario the next two days because Sammy Sosa is coming to town
with the Chicago Cubs. Sosa also failed to hit a home run Sunday in
Pittsburgh, and he will go into the Monday afternoon Cardinals-Cubs
game with 58 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis, the Cardinals' young third baseman, was among those who
was looking forward to the face-to-face confrontation with great
anticipation. He has more than the average rooting interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McGwire does it, I'm going to be happy,'' Tatis said. ``If
Sammy does it, I'll be happy for him. McGwire is on my team, Sammy
is my friend. I hope they both do it. I want them both to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatis and Sosa are friends from the Dominican Republic; Tatis
became a teammate of McGwire's when the Cardinals acquired him from
the Texas Rangers in July.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit three balls wickedly hard Sunday, but got two outs
and a foul ball for his trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, with Brett Tomko pitching, he hit a line
drive between shortstrop and third base that Barry Larkin speared
with a lunging grab, his body parallel to the ground. Tomko walked
McGwire on four pitches in the fourth inning, then got him on a
called third strike in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   On the first pitch of that sixth-inning at-bat McGwire drove the
ball into the left-field stands, but it landed in the first section
on the wrong side of the foul pole. Did McGwire think the ball had
a chance to become No. 61?
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, on contact, yes,'' he said. ``But as it got into the
outfield, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomko had recently talked in a television interview about
grooving a pitch for McGwire, but he said his comments had been
taken incorrectly. He said he didn't let the perceptions of others
affect the way he pitched to McGwire Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he said. ``The way it was said was I was going
to be aggressive. I think Mark knows that I went after him
aggressively, so I don't think there's even an issue. Now I can say
I struck him out with history on the line.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hudek, who struck out McGwire on Saturday, faced him again
Sunday in the eighth inning and almost paid for his efforts. After
swinging at and missing two pitches between taking two other
pitches for balls, McGwire drilled a line drive near Hudek's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize any ball that he hits in fair territory and is
coming in your direction has to be very, very hard,'' Hudek said.
``I was moving as quick as possible to make sure I got out of the
way, or something on the ball, like my glove, rather than my
body.''
</P>
<P>
   The reliever said he didn't know how close the ball came to his
head, but said: ``It looked like it was coming right at me. It had
to go right over my head. Did it bounce? It did? I guess that means
it was closer than I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball hit the ground after it whizzed past Hudek. Bret Boone,
the Reds' second baseman, who was playing on the shortstop side of
second in the Reds' McGwire shift, snared it with a diving stop and
from his knees threw out McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But then Lankford and Tatis hit home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who hurt me today weren't the big guns,'' Hudek said.
``How does that happen? Today it happened because I pitched lousy.
I got lucky with the pitch, the breaking ball, I threw to McGwire
that he hit up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a good one. I think what I did was I fooled him on
speed. He was looking fastball possibly, and I threw a breaking
ball. It wasn't a real good one, and he got a piece of it. If I
threw a fastball, who knows where it would have ended up?''

FRANCES HAMERSTROM IS DEAD; AUTHOR AND BIOLOGIST WAS 90 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frances Hamerstrom, who discovered a passion for observing
nature as a young girl in Boston and pursued that passion
throughout a life spent mostly in Wisconsin, died on Aug. 29 at
Edgewater Haven, a nursing home in Port Edwards, Wis. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   An author, conservationist and wildlife biologist, she died
three days after her last foray into the grassy fields near her
rural home in Plainfield, Wis., which she shared with a great
horned owl that assisted her in attracting hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Bought and preserved through her fund-raising campaigns, the
grasslands near Mrs. Hamerstrom's home shelter some 2,000 greater
prairie chickens. The species, similar to the grouse, was
stabilized largely through Mrs. Hamerstrom's efforts after farming
and other human activities had shrunk its native prairie habitat.
</P>
<P>
   There on the prairie, she informally taught hundreds of
visitors. Sometimes she would lead them to the nest of a kestrel, a
type of falcon, where she would keep a baby bird warm inside her
shirt until it was measured and banded. Then she would often load a
mouse into a trap to toss it onto the road in hopes of catching an
adult kestrel for banding.
</P>
<P>
   Each April and May, her assistants, from Boy Scouts to
businessmen, would sit inside a canvas blind before dawn, often in
freezing weather, to watch the ritual spring displays of male
prairie chickens, who emit a hearty booming sound like a kettledrum
that is heard for miles in the still air.
</P>
<P>
   At age 86, on a field trip in Peru to watch the black-collared
hawk feed on fish, she broke a hip trying to reach a hunting area
while traveling with a guide up a tributary of the Amazon. She was
evacuated by canoe. Then, at 87, she went back to Peru and traveled
up another river in an effort to observe indigenous hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Among her 12 books was ``Harrier Hawk of the Marshes: The Hawk
That Is Ruled by a Mouse,'' the result of her 25-year study of the
relationship between the harrier and the vole. It was published by
the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hamerstrom and her husband, Frederick, met and married on
the East Coast and then both attended the University of Iowa, where
Mrs. Hamerstrom, always proud that she had flunked out of Smith
College, received a bachelor's degree in 1935. They also both went
to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where they studied with
the conservationist Aldo Leopold, the author of ``Sand County
Almanac.'' Mrs. Hamerstrom received a master's degree there in
1940.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, Frances Hamerstrom was one of the first women to
``crash the barrier into the all-male wildlife research
profession,'' said Dr. Ray Anderson, a retired professor at the
University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. She also became a crack
wing-shot with a Parker 20-gauge shotgun and wrote a book called
``Is She Coming, Too?'' about the hunting trips she had taken at
her husband's side. Both of them worked for the Wisconsin
Department of Natural Resources. Her husband died in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hamerstrom, who was born in Needham, Mass., is survived by
two children, Elva Hamerstrom Paulson of Roseburg, Ore., and Alan
Hamerstrom of Arnold, Md.; two granddaughters, and a brother,
Putnam Flint of Weston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   To allocate her time, Mrs. Hamerstrom applied the ``Hamerstrom
Rule of Thirds'': a third for the worthless red tape that your boss
requires; a third for doing what is wanted of you; a third for
doing exactly what you please.
</P>
<P>
   She lived for 50 years in a house with no running water that had
not been painted since the Civil War and had no heat aside from a
few cast-iron wood-burning stoves. She only occasionally swept
around the piles of turtle shells, snowshoes, wildlife gear, books
and files, all of which served as evidence of what it was that
pleased her.

 GIANTS' DEFENSE WASHES AWAY BITTER TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The New York Giants returned to Giants
Stadium on Sunday, hosts again to a pivotal game, before a sellout
crowd, with the ghosts of all that had gone wrong in their last
game in the building an uninvited but insuppressible companion.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game of the 1998 season, the Giants sought
redemption for their inglorious playoff exit late last year. After
a little more than three hours, what they had found in themselves
was a ball-hawking defense and a mostly mistake-free offense.
</P>
<P>
   And with that came liberation from the haunting memories of the
last disappointing day of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   The victory within the 31-24 victory over the Washington
Redskins on Sunday was a Giants team playing in the same manner
that brought unexpected prosperity to a slumping franchise a year
ago. And in the end, the Giants believed that was the best way
possible to launch a new season.
</P>
<P>
   The daring Giants defense, which produced an improbable
interception and end-zone dash by the 285-pound defensive end
Michael Strahan, again saved an uncertain offense. And when the
Redskins threatened to spoil it all with a late rally, the Giants
defense and offense combined to play just well enough to assure the
Giants of their second consecutive season-opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our last game last year was in the back of everybody's mind
today,'' quarterback Danny Kanell said of the Giants' 23-22 playoff
loss to the Minnesota Vikings, a game the Giants led by nine points
with 90 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show we could finish off a team when we led late.
It was important that we put that game to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout a cheery, giddy Giants locker room Sunday afternoon,
there was relief that the Redskins had not gained revenge for the
Giants' 20-point, division-clinching victory here nine months ago,
and satisfaction that the Giants had vanquished the memory of their
implosion against the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That we didn't always play well today, but still won and held
on, that shows we've matured,'' said defensive tackle Robert
Harris. ``We had to hear that we fall apart in the fourth quarter
for a long time. It was brought up amongst ourselves and by our
coaches. It became a motivation for this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we didn't let the things that brought us down last year
bring us down this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, with new starters in Conrad Hamilton at
cornerback and Marcus Buckley at strongside linebacker, appeared
disorganized and surprisingly overpowered at times.
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressive design of the defensive coordinator John Fox
is to seek the turnover despite the potential risk of a big play.
On Sunday, while the Redskins outgained the Giants in yards by
331-235, the Giants' two second-half interceptions and a fumble
caused by a sack turned the game in the Giants' favor.
</P>
<P>
   The action-packed second half followed a plodding, uneven first
half that ended in a 10-10 tie. Redskins quarterback Gus Frerotte
played well and successfully picked on Hamilton early, especially
on the game's first score, a 17-yard touchdown pass to Leslie
Shepherd.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell, who finished with a typical game for him (15 for 28
passing for 159 yards), and the Giants' offense started slowly, as
usual. Late in the second quarter, though, after an interception by
Washington cornerback Cris Dishman was nullified by a penalty,
Kanell found wide receiver Chris Calloway in the end zone for a
game-tying 5-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   In their first possession of the second half, the Giants did not
pick up a first down and again looked listless, but a well-placed
pooch punt by Brad Maynard put the Redskins on their own 5-yard
line.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's first-down play from this dangerous part of the
field was a pass into the flat that cornerback Phillippi Sparks
deflected and bobbled. Hamilton, charging over on the play,
eventually grabbed the ball as it came off Sparks' hands. Hamilton
returned the interception to the Redskins' 2-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Charles Way scored on the next play for a 17-10 Giants
lead. It was a minor highlight for the feeble Giants running
attack; Way, Tiki Barber and Gary Brown combined to rush for just
82 yards on 30 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays after Way's touchdown, Frerotte looked to his left for
tight end Jamie Asher, who had raced across the field from the
right side of the Redskins' formation.
</P>
<P>
   Fox had called a zone blitz, which meant that a group of Giants
defenders on the right side tried to overload the blockers. To make
up for those Giants who are blitzing, Strahan is forced into
coverage; his responsibility is whatever receiver comes off the
line near him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a scary call,'' Fox said. ``Because Strahan can
match up on a wide receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   But the athletic Strahan sprinted just in Asher's wake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see the quarterback over the offensive line, so I
knew the quarterback couldn't see me,'' Strahan said. ``I moved up,
and then I saw the ball. I would have had the whole city of New
York mad at me if I dropped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan caught the pass at the Redskins' 24-yard line. ``I put
my head back between my shoulder blades and ran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a two-touchdown lead following Strahan's score, the Giants'
defense swarmed over Frerotte, who left the game one series later
groggy from a sack and with an injured shoulder. The backup
quarterback, Trent Green, who played in one of 1,028 Washington
plays last season, came on and rallied Washington to within a
touchdown. At one point, Green completed nine straight passes.
</P>
<P>
   But late in the third quarter, Giants defensive tackle Christian
Peter sacked Green, causing a fumble that led to a Kanell-to-Amani
Toomer touchdown pass that extended the Giants' lead to 31-17.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Green again cut the Redskins' deficit to
7 points.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Redskins had a last chance in the final minutes, they
were forced to begin from their own 20-yard line and never
threatened inside Giants territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at this as the biggest game of the season,'' Strahan
said. ``We're in first place in the division again, and we've
brought some joy back to New York. This should give the fans some
reason to believe that this is going to be a good season. Today, I
know that's how we feel.''

A DEFENSE TO LEAN ON KEEPS GIANTS STANDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., N.J.)  (js) 
 BY WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Big Blue defense bailed out the offense
again Sunday. Like big brother or big sister who keeps the bully at
bay, the Giants' bruising defense swatted Washington back whenever
it got a bit too close and the Giants escaped with a pleasant,
season-opening victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't pretty, but we'll take it,'' offensive tackle Roman
Oben said
</P>
<P>
   What do you take away from a 31-24 victory like this? So early
in the season yet so crucial a game for a team that has such high
hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell said, ``I think we got off on the right
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But if they want to go any distance, the Giants better get some
of those offensive feet churning _ and choreographed for long,
bone-crunching drives. That's the only thing defenses seem to fear.
Nobody is afraid of the Giants' running game, which generated only
82 yards Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Big Blue defense bailed the Giants out. Not that defensive gifts
are anything to scoff at.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the defense plays great all year and does that, it'll be
great for us, but we don't expect that all the time,'' Oben said.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Giants' four touchdowns were scored or set up by
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were in a 10-10 tie early in the second half when
Conrad Hamilton made a circus interception and ran to the
Washington 2-yard line. A play later, fullback Charles Way scored.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, defensive end Michael Strahan intercepted a pass
and scored to make it 24-10 and the Giants' young offense faced its
first test of the new season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are only eight months removed from a dismal, painful
playoff loss to Minnesota in swirling snow and rain _ right here.
The Giants blew a 9-point lead and lost to the Vikings, 23-22.
</P>
<P>
   The big story that day was a last-gasp Minnesota touchdown pass.
The real story was the Giants' offense's inability to convert two
critical series when the Giants had an opportunity to break that
game open after Minnesota fumbled on consecutive series in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The question Sunday was whether the young Giants offense could
squeeze the hope out of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. After the Giants' defense held on to the Redskins'
next possession, the Giants' offense took over on the 40, huffed
and puffed up to midfield, then slid back down: a penalty; two
incomplete passes, a punt.
</P>
<P>
   Washington started coming back under the guidance of Trent
Green, an obscure, third-string quarterback who was pressed into
action when Gus Frerotte was knocked out of the game. Green was in
on only one of Washington's 1,028 plays last season, but he looked
like an All-Pro Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Green completed five of five passes on his first drive and
pulled Washington to within 24-17 with a 4-yard touchdown pass to
Larry Bowie. The Giants seemed headed for a familiar finish.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to the Vikings had been remarkable not only for its
suddenness, but for it's resonance. Days later _ weeks later _ the
staff was still stunned. ``It's a very bitter pill to swallow,''
Coach Jim Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   This all seemed like ancient history until the Giants faced
third-and-2 with 2 minutes left to play, clinging to a 7-point
lead, and failed to convert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 'em blocked right up nicely, and one guy slipped off
and made the tackle,'' Fassel explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to grind and get first downs and massage the clock,''
he said. ``You can't have breakdowns. When you start getting into
packages where you're protecting a lead, you've got to block 'em
all up with nobody slipping off.''
</P>
<P>
   Way put the challenge of securing one and two yards in simpler
terms: ``We've got to start getting that,'' he said. Indeed they
do.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants want to get to that next level: and they'll have to
run to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Things worked out on Sunday, the Big Blue defense made sure of
it. But sooner or later, a team that wants to cross that River
Jordan must have an offense that can drive from end to end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored 31 points but the defense put us in opportune spots
a lot of times and it was still a close game,'' Oben said. ``We
need to pick it up and start making some long drives, but it'll
take time.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics showed the Giants' shortcomings. The Giants came
up short in time of possession by four and a half minutes (32
minutes 10 seconds for Washington, 27:50 for the Giants) and number
of offensive plays (68 for the Redskins to 59 for the Giants).
</P>
<P>
   The good news, the bottom line in a money game, is that the
Giants are 1-0 and defeated a division rival. The Giants have not
come close to establishing this kind of dominance, though some may
feel it's too early to begin fretting.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Cross, the 10-year veteran tight end was optimistic and
realistic after Sunday's game: ``We'll be OK right now, guys are
still feeling their way through things. We expect everything to
happen all at once, but it doesn't always work like that. It's all
a process.''
</P>
<P>
   This may only be September, but December will be here before you
know it. No one wants to go through those tears again.

SOME EXPERTS SAY NYPD IGNORED RULES ON RALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: NY-YOUTH-MARCH, NY-YOUTH-HARLEM) 
(nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Authorities on riot control said Sunday that the
Police Department appeared to have moved too swiftly to end a rally
of black youths in Harlem on Saturday, and seemed to have forgotten
some of the lessons learned from disturbances over the last 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Though one expert defended the police action as a way to prevent
matters from getting out of hand, others said the haste in shutting
down the rally, known as the Million Youth March, was a sharp break
from the past practice of the department, which is known for its
smooth handling of massive demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   As Saturday's ralliers began to disband, a police helicopter
began making passes over the crowd and officers in riot helmets
stormed the stage from behind. Soon bottles, barricades and trash
baskets were flying, leaving one person in the crowd and about 15
officers injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, it seemed clear the mayor and police
wanted to make a point,'' said David Bayley, dean of the School of
Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany.
``This looks more like politics than tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Bouza, who was the department's commander in Harlem in
the early 1970s, said he was shocked by the swift police surge and
believes that the police ``owe the black community an apology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with people _ not terrorists,'' said Bouza, who
is retired and lives on Cape Cod, Mass. ``This confirms the black
community's sense that the police are an army of occupation in the
ghetto. It's nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouza recalled that as a police intelligence officer, he spent
nearly every Saturday afternoon from 1957 to 1965 listening to
Malcolm X and other black nationalists speak on 125th Street. ``The
one thing that we learned from all the riots of the 1960s was the
need to negotiate, to mediate, to be patient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the police had acted commendably
at what ``promised to be a much worse event, a really violent
event.'' He said the rally's chief organizer, Khallid Abdul
Muhammad, deliberately began his speech just before the rally's
court-ordered ending at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to create a disturbance,'' the mayor said. ``The
police kept that to a minimum, and they did something for which we
should be very proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor had repeatedly vowed that at 4, the police would begin
treating the gathering as an illegal demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:03, the blue police helicopter swooped low over the crowd,
estimated by the police at 6,000. The crowd roared back at the
buzzing chopper, with hundreds of people shaking their fists at the
show of force. Then officers in riot gear moved onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   When the choppers and billy clubs flew, many participants said
their anger at the establishment had been vindicated. ``The mayor
of New York City is making the same mistake Bull Connor made,''
said James Anthony Barr, 30, a telemarketer from Trenton, N.J.,
referring to the police commissioner in Birmingham, Ala., whose
bullying helped galvanize civil rights demonstrators in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Louden, director of the Criminal Justice Center at
the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, said he
viewed the police action as a pre-emptive effort to ``blitz them
before they did anything worse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had gotten out of hand, it could have been more
disastrous, with gunfire, injury and death,'' he said. ``A point
has to be made: `We, the police, will abide by the orders of the
court.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two former department officials said none of the provocations
cited by police officials justified the action.
</P>
<P>
   One former commander who requested anonymity, saying he feared
that Giuliani would retaliate against friends who are still in the
department, said he had ``never heard of a protest being stopped
right on a dime.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We always said, `OK, folks, we're going to wrap it up now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the department had learned during
disturbances at Columbia University in 1968 that a massive show of
force can be counterproductive. Waves of officers kicked and
punched student protesters, who retaliated by flinging rocks and
smashing windows, according to news accounts at the time. After
those disturbances and the Stonewall Inn riot by gay rights
advocates in 1969, the police began intensive training in crowd
control and sensitivity. Former department officials also said the
department had concluded after a riot in Tompkins Square Park in
1988 that the use of a helicopter tends to alarm crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Sherman, chairman of the department of criminology at
the University of Maryland in College Park and a former civilian
research analyst for the New York Police Department, said the show
of force indicated that Giuliani was extending his ``zero
tolerance'' philosophy of crime fighting to cover crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the 1970s into the early 90s, the philosophy of the New
York Police Department was to negotiate itself out of
confrontations,'' Sherman said. ``To have this happen on a hot
summer afternoon in Harlem is a real sea change from the
riot-prevention philosophy of earlier decades.''

DOUGLAS C. JONES, 73, CONJURER OF ALTERNATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas C. Jones, a writer who chronicled the mythology of the
American West through fictional accounts of historic events, died
last Sunday at his home in Fayetteville, Ark. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, after 25 years in the Army, Jones retired with the rank
of lieutenant colonel. He then embarked on a second career as a
writer, having already published a nonfiction work, ``The Treaty of
Medicine Lodge,'' in 1966, his master's degree thesis at the
University of Wisconsin, Madison, where he taught journalism from
1968 to 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took his cue as a writer from his memories of growing up
in Fort Smith, Ark., close to what had once been Indian territory.
``I was captured by the idea of the Indian frontier then _ and I
still am today,'' he said in an interview in The New York Times in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   It was an intriguing parlor game of ``what if'' that he played
with his friend Benjamin Rush III that led him to first imagine the
consequences General Custer would have faced had he survived the
Battle of Little Bighorn. The outcome was ``The Court-Martial of
George Armstrong Custer,'' a 1976 fictional reconstruction that
wove much of its substance from fact. The book was illustrated with
pen-and-ink drawings by Jones, who eventually showed his artwork
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Jones continued to conjure alternative histories in works like
``Arrest Sitting Bull'' in 1977, ``A Creek Called Wounded Knee'' in
1978 _ which, with ``Court-Martial'' formed a de facto trilogy _
and ``The Barefoot Brigade,'' about the dirt-farm infantry of the
Confederate Army.

   He is survived by his wife, Mary; a son, D. Eben Jones, both of
Fayetteville; three daughters, K.G. Martino, also of Fayetteville;
Martha Lunsford of Greenland, Ark., and Meg Butler of Rochester;
two sisters, Gayle Phillips of Fayetteville and Jackey Ivey of
Denver, and 10 grandchildren. &QL;

TIME TO SET THE MILLENNIUM CLOCK  
 SEEKING COMPROMISES ON INTERNET DOMAIN

   Budd Goldman, an inventor in Mineola, N.Y., has earned his
living for two decades making doo-dads. ``Toilet paper holders that
look like the back of cars, masks over shower heads that looked
like celebrities, a little black box that you pushed it and it
cursed,'' Goldman said, describing a few of his greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes, at the end of the 20th century, what Goldman
considers his crowning achievement: the Millennium Clock. ``I've
been practicing to get to this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The desktop clock is a relentless reminder of the remaining
days, hours, minutes and seconds until the arrival of Jan. 1, 2000
_ as determined by the time zone of the person who sets it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said the idea came to him in 1986, as he walked down a
street in Seoul, South Korea. ``There were billboards counting down
to the Olympics,'' he said. ``The idea germinated, and I decided to
make a small version of a countdown clock,'' which would use an LCD
display to count the days until an impending milestone, like a
birthday or an anniversary. But the idea flopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sell any,'' he said. ``Zippo.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward a decade to 1996, just as millennium fever was
starting to infuse the country. ``I was on the corner of 34th and
Seventh and there was this billboard from a restaurant saying,
`We'll be feeding customers into the new millennium.''' he said.
``The light bulb went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman said he has already sold a million millennium clocks,
mostly to department stores and to corporate clients who put their
own logos on the clock's face and give them away as premiums. The
clocks can be ordered through the Countdown Clock International
Inc. Web site (http://www.countdownclock.com) for $24.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole emotionality going on, counting down to the
future,'' he said. ``I'm a lucky guy to have been able to give this
to the world _ and to make a couple of bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Once New Year's Day 2000 arrives, the devices will still have a
function, because they can double at any time as a regular clock.
And Goldman hopes his business, Countdown Clocks International
Inc., will still have a purpose, too. He is about to announce
countdown models for wedding days and pregnancy due dates.

   Seeking Compromises On Internet Domain
</P>
<P>
   With the Clinton administration planning to end federal
financing for the management of Internet domain names on Sept. 30,
the disparate forces struggling to constitute the global network's
first legitimate governing body remain divided on issues trivial
and profound.
</P>
<P>
   As negotiations continue behind the scenes, the Berkman Center
for Internet and Society at Harvard University has canceled a
planned compromise session for next weekend that had been set at
the behest of one coalition that has sponsored a series of
international meetings on the subject this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not convinced it's a productive thing to do,'' said Joe
Sims, a lawyer who is advising Jon Postel, the man who has handled
the administrative end of the Internet's address system for the
last 30 years under the auspices of the federally financed Internet
Assigned Numbers Authority, or IANA.
</P>
<P>
   To replace IANA, Postel has proposed a new administrative body
that would balance the interests of trademark holders, domain name
registrars, national governments and individual Internet users _
and still allow engineers to keep the addresses straight. His
approach has been embraced by the Internet's technical community.
</P>
<P>
   But Network Solutions Inc., the company based in Herndon, Va.,
that currently holds an exclusive contract with the U.S. government
to allocate the most popular domains _ including addresses ending
in ``.com'' _ has declined to sign on. So has the International
Trademark Association.
</P>
<P>
   Among the points of dispute are whether the new group would be
likely to favor adding many more domain names, which trademark
holders oppose, or to impose regulations on registrars _ something
Network Solutions opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ira Magaziner, the senior White House adviser on Internet
issues, said he was optimistic that a compromise would be reached
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any negotiation,'' he said, ``if you get things down to two
factions you can lock them in a room and push them to have an
agreement.''

PERHAPS OLD JERRY RICE MET THE NEW JERRY RICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 BY MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Right before halftime of Sunday's spectacular
game between the Jets and the 49ers, San Francisco wide receiver
Jerry Rice got into a scuffle with a New York Jets player. The two
started pushing and shoving, and Rice was not about to back down.
Later, Rice could not remember what started the argument, but he
did remember who broke it up. It was Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Jerry, Jerry, just relax,''' Rice said of the Jets'
wide receiver. ``He was trying to calm me down.''
</P>
<P>
   It was revealing that Johnson, considered a trash-talking,
smart-mouthed player by many in the National Football League, was
trying to calm down Rice, considered an even-tempered, class act.
The revelations didn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the excitement of the 49ers' 36-30 overtime victory was
something not as obvious as the great game, but in a way just as
powerful. It was the spectacular performance by Johnson, which
propelled the wide receiver to the level of other great young
receivers in the game. In a way, Johnson made a solid argument that
he is the next Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is a future Hall of Famer, and despite missing most of last
season with devastating knee injuries, he still had a dazzling
14-yard touchdown catch Sunday, showing that there is still
something left. The play he scored on was called ``sprint left
option'' and it was the 38th time Rice had scored a touchdown on
it. Despite being double-teamed often, especially near the end
zone, Rice still managed six catches for 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson made a statement of his own, exploding for two
striking touchdown catches of 41 and 21 yards. What Johnson did
with his nine catches for 126 yards _ his most productive day as a
pro _ was elevate himself to the level of a top-10 receiver, maybe
even top five. He has always had a Pro Bowl mouth, but this day put
him on the level of the new crop of young receivers in the league,
players like Minnesota's Randy Moss. The next generation of great
receivers is coming into focus, and now Johnson is among the top
players on that list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Keyshawn is very talented and he proved that today,''
Rice said. ``The thing about Keyshawn now, as opposed to before, is
that he does his talking on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson, the Jets are assured of being a contender this
season, not simply for the division title but for a Super Bowl
berth. Johnson is now that good. He provides the explosiveness that
teams need to make a serious playoff run. Seeing the Jets in the
playoffs after such a horrible loss may seem ridiculous, but
remember, many thought there was no way the Jets could win this
game. Not only did they come close, but they beat up a 49ers team
some are picking to win the National Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rice is still great, but it is noticeable that receivers like
Johnson and Moss are beginning to pass him by. These are hard words
to write, of course, and Rice should be given a break. This was his
first game back, so you can expect his performance to improve
dramatically as the season goes on. And once anyone even raises the
question of whether or not Rice is being surpassed, Rice will use
that as motivation the way the sun uses hydrogen as fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically want to take it slow right now and slowly work my
way back into it,'' Rice said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yet it was hard not to compare the way Johnson looked to the way
Rice did. Rice always had incredible explosion after a catch; so
does Johnson. Rice always scared teams; now Johnson does. Rice can
still cause nightmares, but Johnson is the now the one wearing the
ski mask. Johnson is now even better at doing what Rice has always
been great at, pushing off the defender to get separation while the
officials have their heads turned. Johnson did it several times,
and it worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Jets have done with Johnson since Bill Parcells
became coach has worked. Johnson has evolved from a receiver with
potential to a player with talent and moves and a killer instinct.
On both touchdown passes, he so badly faked out the safeties and
cornerbacks covering him that he had at least 5 yards of space. It
was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Now what Johnson needs to develop are his leadership skills.
That does not mean writing books ripping teammates, coaches and
members of the news media, or talking about how good you are. It
means running hills until you drop in the off-season, or getting up
at 5 a.m. and lifting weights until noon, like Rice has done almost
every day in his career. Like Rice said, Johnson now lets his
performance do the talking. Let's hope it stays that way.
</P>
<P>
   Rice won't pass the torch; he's too much of a competitor.
Someone will have to take it from him. Johnson is so good right
now, he might just do it, sooner than anyone thinks.

STEELERS' POISE THWARTS RAVENS' POTENTIAL
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ It was like a shiny new penny, glistening from end
to end. The Baltimore Ravens' new $223 million stadium (no name
yet) was packed with 68,847 people Sunday afternoon and it was hot
(91 degrees). Loud jets flew overhead and louder fireworks popped
and the band played on. The Ravens were ready to do something big
to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   But the Steelers had that look in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens hustled from the start, popping Pittsburgh, holding
Jerome Bettis to 9 rushing yards in the first half. They stymied
Pittsburgh quarterback Kordell Stewart _ he had no touchdown passes
and was intercepted twice in the half. It was tied, 3-3, at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Steelers returned with that look in their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The look of champions. The look of a team that had won the last
five American Football Conference Central crowns. The look of a
team ready for the moment, ready for the challenge of an improved
team, a team unbeaten in the preseason, a team intent on setting a
new standard in the division. What Pittsburgh has done, Baltimore
wants to do. But the Ravens are not quite ready.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have that look.
</P>
<P>
   They played hard. They did not play smart.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers won this '98 debut for both teams, 20-13, because
they recognize success and how to play hard and fight through tough
times. They know how to let a team choke itself and then bury that
team in its own panic and chaos. And, in part, that is what
happened Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Steelers back Fred McAfee: ``There was a lot of pomp and
circumstance here. A lot of hoopla. We just went out and did what
we do. We smash-mouth. They are a talented squad. They had a lot of
opportunities. They could have won. But they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   It went this way:
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers scored a field goal on their first drive. On their
second drive, Rod Woodson _ now a Raven, formerly a Steeler _
dropped a potential interception near the Pittsburgh 37. The Ravens
scored on a field goal. The Ravens got an interception, but Matt
Stover missed a 42-yard field goal right. With nine minutes left
before halftime, Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh left the game for
good with a broken ring finger on his right (passing) hand. He is
questionable next week for the Jets game. Then, after a shaky snap,
Stover missed a 42-yard field goal left.
</P>
<P>
   On the opening drive of the third quarter, Stover missed a
45-yard field goal left. Pittsburgh scored a field goal to take a
6-3 lead, and on the next possession, the Ravens botched a snap on
a punt, the Steelers recovered at the Ravens' 5 and scored a
touchdown to make it 13-3. The Ravens never got back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens jumped offside three times on third-and-short plays.
Receivers dropped passes, one an apparent easy touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh built its lead to 20-3 early in the fourth quarter on
a spiffy Stewart-to-Charles-Johnson play-fake pass for 20 yards.
The Ravens fought valiantly, though, with Stover finally making a
25-yard field goal with 6 minutes 56 seconds remaining and on a
64-yard score from Eric Zeier to receiver Jermaine Lewis with 2:48
left. The Ravens got the ball once more, after the Steelers' last
possession, but even that didn't work out. Steelers punter Josh
Miller booted the ball 68 yards to the Ravens' 4-yard line with 27
seconds and no Ravens timeouts left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts a great deal,'' Ravens Coach Ted Marchibroda said.

MEMORIES, MONEY AND ANOTHER LOSS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Geoff Grant walked out of the locker room and toward
the light Sunday, his coach and manager, Terry London, filming him
from behind. Grant was heading for Stadium 3 and a third-round date
with another tall tennis player with a low profile, and London
wanted this walk for Grant's video archives.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a record of the atmosphere: the encroaching crowds,
the U.S. Open operating at full throttle on this first Sunday. But
when Grant trudged back to the locker room nearly four hours later,
London's camera was no longer rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a 28-year-old tennis player in a hurry to make up for
missed Grand Slams, had come tantalizingly close to reaching the
Round of 16 at his nation's most important tournament. He had led
two sets to one and had been 2 points from victory in the fifth set
on Oliver Gross' serve. But in spite of the cramps that Gross said
he began feeling early in the fourth set and in spite of the
subjective crowd that had taken Grant to heart on this dry,
daunting afternoon, the unlikely German, not the unlikely American,
would end up the winner by 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little painful,'' Grant said of his 3 hour 38 minute
adventure. ``But that's what this sport is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis has delivered some body blows to Grant as he has
struggled to carve out a career. Until recently, there has been a
shortage of money, a shortage of recognition and a shortage of
encouraging words from the people who control the purse strings and
keys to tennis in the United States. Grant has been playing almost
exclusively in the minor leagues of tennis _ satellite and
challenger events _ since he graduated from Duke with a degree in
political science.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished college, which is somewhat rare in professional
tennis, and I was kind of penalized in a way for doing that back in
the early '90s,'' he said. ``I think you were considered to have no
chance if you went to college and graduated. You were considered
old at like 22 or 23. They neglected to give support to guys like
myself, but now I think their philosophy has changed quite a bit.
They're helping out a lot of guys who have gone to college and
rightly so. I think we can be a good asset to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant quit for 10 months in late 1994, only to return because he
realized that the workaday world was not going to quell the nagging
voice in his head. ``They're both the real world,'' he said. ``I'd
rather be in the tennis world. I look forward to the business world
when I'm done, but I hope that time isn't for a little bit longer:
at least five or six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are sanguine words from a man whose serve is not big
enough to win many easy points, but Grant was in a mood to
emphasize the positive after his match Sunday. He had requested to
play on Stadium 3, the most intimate and boisterous of the three
show courts at the National Tennis Center, and for a man who has
played in front of many empty seats, the shrieks and the shouts and
the stomping of feet were an elixir.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember it forever,'' he said. ``I hope that can get me
a little bit more recognition. It's tough to get recognition in
this country unless you're Top 10 in the world or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant is 133rd, and with his blue bandanna, wavy red hair and
rope necklace, he looks like the sort of athlete who might feel the
pull of ultimate Frisbee or climbing a sheer face at Yosemite
instead of tennis. But his flat, two-handed ground strokes, speed
and ability to finish off points at the net make him a dangerous
hardcourt player. And the two matches he won here, beating Javier
Sanchez and Andrei Medvedev, gave him his first Grand Slam
victories and the best payday of his career: $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally out of debt,'' he said. ``I'll probably do a little
bit of shopping tomorrow.'' &QL;

TWO MORE TV STATIONS DROP HOWARD STERN'S SHOW  
 HIGH-PROFILE AUTHORS TURN TO MUCH YOUNGER READERS  
 HOLLYWOOD TAKES BREAK OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND

<P>
   Two more television stations, in Phoenix and in San Diego,
dropped Howard Stern's late-night show from their schedules last
week, joining a station in Lubbock, Texas, which did so last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: Why now? Didn't station executives know the
content of ``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' as the television show
is titled, before they bought it?
</P>
<P>
   Evidently hearing is not believing. Even those familiar with
Stern's daily radio show, from which the TV show's segments are
culled, find it a different matter to experience the same jokes
visually.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Schwartz, the vice president for programming at KTVK, an
independent station in Phoenix, who made the decision to drop
Stern's show, said on Friday: ``As popular as he is and as funny as
he is on the radio _ and on the radio he really does funny bits _
it seems that when you add pictures to that humor, as he has done
with his television show, it ceases to be funny.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which had its debut Aug. 22 and is distributed by
Eyemark Entertainment, a syndication company owned by CBS, is still
begin carried by 76 stations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schwartz said she had bought the show because she knew how
popular Stern was with men, especially young men, and wanted to
attract more male viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the cruelty was what we just couldn't handle,'' Ms.
Schwartz said, citing segments in which mentally disabled people
entered a ``Frankenstein beauty contest'' and played a dating game.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McKinnon, vice president for broadcast operations and
programming at KUSI, an independent station in San Diego, could not
be reached for comment, but the station confirmed that McKinnon had
dropped the show.

   High-Profile Authors Turn to Much Younger Readers
</P>
<P>
   Several high-profile authors have recently written or agreed to
write children's books, and Hyperion Books for Children has created
a new imprint, Jump at the Sun. It will produce children's books
with an African-American emphasis by authors like Toni Morrison and
Bell Hooks.
</P>
<P>
   This trend has the potential to bolster the flat sales of
children's hardcover books, but publishers said the string of
titles by highly marketable authors was coincidental and reflected
the desire of many authors to write children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Carol Oates' first book for children, ``Come Meet
Muffin!,'' a story about a cat, is scheduled to come out on Sept.
21 with a first printing of 10,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone warned me to make sure the book wasn't seen as a
famous fiction writer taking the day off to write a children's
book, slumming it, so we promoted it as an important book,'' said
Dan Halpern, editor in chief of the publisher, Ecco Press. ``I'd be
surprised if it's a trend, because kids' books are very hard to
sell. Just having a big name writing a children's book doesn't help
unless the book is really good and the illustrations are great.''
</P>
<P>
   Next spring, Patricia Cornwell will move from murder to magic
realism for children with ``Life's Little Fable,'' published by
Penguin Putnam Books for Young Readers, a unit of Pearson PLC.
</P>
<P>
   And Louise Erdrich's second children's book, a novel called
``The Birchbark House,'' set to be released in April 1999 from
Hyperion Books for Children, part of Walt Disney Co., will be the
first in a proposed series about an American Indian family in the
mid-1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Jump at the Sun will release the first children's books by Ms.
Morrison and Ms. Hooks in fall 1999. This month, ``Marisol and
Magdalena,'' a young-adult novel by Veronica Chambers, a culture
writer for Newsweek, will be in stores.

   Hollywood Takes Break Over Labor Day Weekend
</P>
<P>
   Movie addicts who were eager for a hot new film over the Labor
Day weekend found slim pickings. But that was intentional on
Hollywood's part. For filmmakers, the good news about Labor Day is
the lack of competition; the bad news is the dearth of potential
moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the only major new release _ defined as opening at
more than 1,200 screens nationwide _ was Sony's ``Knock Off,''
starring the martial artist Jean-Claude Van Damme. With little
competition, the film has free sailing for the next couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Long holiday weekends, with their extra day of leisure, are
typically a popular time to introduce films. But movie companies
tend to shy away from Labor Day, when many families are distracted
by the back-to-school drill, and studios do not want to compete
against entrenched films that have been playing throughout August
and have already built up audience demand.
</P>
<P>
   The next big bumper crop of movies does not arrive until
Thanksgiving weekend, a prime movie-watching period when at least
six high-profile films are scheduled to open _ including ``A Bug's
Life'' and ``Enemy of the State'' from Walt Disney, Columbia's ``I
Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' and Paramount's ``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Sony choose Labor Day to open the Van Damme vehicle?

 Flap Over Friendliness at Safeway Gives Unions a Bad Name   &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
In honor of Labor Day, I would like to weigh in on the
labor-management flap between Safeway and a couple of the
supermarket chain's local unions in the East Bay.
<P>
   The issues raised by United Food &AMP; Commercial Workers Union
Locals 1179 and 373 are asinine, unenlightened and
counterproductive. And the media coverage, especially on talk
radio, has been nothing less than moronic.
</P>
<P>
   Don't we, as an allegedly civilized people, have something
better to debate other than whether supermarket clerks should be
asked by their employer to be friendly to their customers?
</P>
<P>
   Before I go any further, I would like to make clear that I'm not
an anti-union, pro-management lackey. I currently am a dues-paying
member of the Communications Workers of America and have been a
unionized employee at two previous jobs. In addition, I've come to
appreciate the importance of union representation while covering
companies whose employees were represented by the United Auto
Workers and the International Association of Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   But recent accusations made by a couple of UFCW Locals give
unions a bad name. And more important, they don't even represent
the majority sentiment of their own union nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rub: Five years ago, Safeway of Oakland implemented a
customer service policy intended on making its supermarkets better
places to shop.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Safeway spokeswoman, the ``broad'' initiative
asked employees to greet and smile at customers whenever possible,
to offer help or directions to customers without them asking and to
offer every customer help with their packages as they leave the
store. Pretty heinous, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Now, a union local president who is up for re-election this fall
held a news conference proclaiming that these policies promote
sexual harassment and place her union brethren under additional
danger. The allegation: that some customers have mistaken the
friendly service for sexual come-ons, provoking accostings outside
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   UFCW Local President Barbara Carpenter did not return telephone
calls. Nor did Sean Harrigan, the western regional vice president
of the UFCW.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, any such incidents should be taken seriously and
prosecuted if criminal. But the facts, according to Safeway, are
that sexual harassment complaints by employees have not increased,
but declined since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; VEVERKA:Page B2 Col. 1 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VEVERKA: Service Is Key to Keeping Customers &QL; 
From Page B1 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR; The other fallacy flaunted by the locals' leadership is that
customers don't like the friendly service. Now is that flat-out
idiotic or what?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there may be a vocal minority that don't want to be
bothered by an overly friendly stock person. And admittedly, having
clerks greet customers by name after reading a computer printout or
personal check may cross the line of privacy and seem creepy to
some.
</P>
<P>
   But do you know what? Successful retailers such as Safeway spend
thousands of dollars a year on research to determine if customers
like this stuff. If their customers hated it, why would the
retailers continue to do it? (And if you're a customer who doesn't
like it, shop somewhere else. That will get Safeway's attention.)
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have been rewarded by Safeway's emphasis on
service. During the past five years, Safeway's return on equity has
climbed 807 percent, with dividends reinvested in stock, compared
with 139 percent for the rest of the supermarket industry,
according to Standard and Poor's.
</P>
<P>
   Union discontent appears to be isolated to the East Bay.
According to the company, the national union, which represents
about 150,000 employees at 1,400 stores, has no problem with the
customer service policy.
</P>
<P>
   You know why?
</P>
<P>
   Because it makes sense. Retail chains, like Safeway, are
fighting to remain profitable and grow. These days, their profit
margins are razor-thin, and the best way to assure that customers
return to their stores is by providing better service than the
chain down the street. Just ask Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Nordstrom.
Each are tops in their segments and renowned for their motivated
and friendly workforces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service is absolutely one of the key differentiators,'' says
retail consultant Neil Stern of McMillan/ Doolittle in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do people like what Safeway is doing, but they
appreciate it,'' says Stern, who recently monitored California
focus groups for a retail client.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that strong, democratic unions are vital. And
they should stick to important issues, such as workplace safety and
job security.
</P>
<P>
   And the best way for workers to assure their future employment
is to help their employers compete and thrive. In its current
contract, Safeway granted its union workers 100 percent medical
benefits and a 12 percent raise spread over four years. That's not
shabby. And in return, chief executive Steven Burd would like them
to help harried Safeway shoppers find what they need.
</P>
<P>
   Is this really the makings of real labor-management strife?
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Weisel Watch '98: &LR;  With apologies to the defunct British rock
band The Clash, should Montgomery Securities head Thom Weisel stay
or should he go? Weisel met with top executives of NationsBank on
Thursday to discuss his future at Montgomery, according to a source
at Montgomery with knowledge of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Weisel threatened to quit or went so far as to tender
his resignation in unclear. Last week, Bloomberg News reported that
recent decisions by NationsBank would trigger an escape clause in
Weisel's contract, making it possible for Weisel and other key
executives to leave Montgomery early with their severance packages
intact.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank reportedly has changed its mind on who will report
to who when it comes to high-yield bonds, known as junk bonds. Only
six weeks ago, NationsBank declared that Montgomery would control
that part of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before NationsBank brass took a closer look at
their blueprint for meshing its operations with BankAmerica.
Insiders say the Charlotte brain trust realized that it made more
sense to have the high-yield bond business tied to commercial
lending, the traditional domains of NationsBank and BofA.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some pivotal Montgomery executives are being
stripped of their responsibilities, including Jerry Markowitz, the
senior Montgomery official who had been tapped to head high-yield
sales, trading and research.
</P>
<P>
   Also losing their titles are three Montgomery senior managing
directors: Ned Zachar, head of high-yield research; Ashley
Cooperman, head of high-yield sales; and Pete Wilson, head of
high-yield trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world changed with the acquisition of BankAmerica,'' said
one San Francisco investment banker. ``NationsBank paid for
(Montgomery), and they can paint the car whatever color they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank has acknowledged to Weisel and his top lieutenants
that their employment terms have been altered, unlocking their
golden handcuffs a year or two early. They are entitled to share
some of the $360 million in partner payments.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who stays and who goes, don't expect any formal
announcements for at least a couple of weeks, especially not before
Montgomery's annual high-tech conference at San Francisco's Ritz
Carlton, which begins on September 14.
</P>
<P>
   Good Point: An anonymous caller pointed out that last week, I
referred to BankAmerica as ``soon to be NationsBank.'' I didn't
presume to know what they will call the combined bank. That
decision hasn't been announced. Actually, speculation from BofA
employees is that the new, larger bank will be called BankAmerica,
just like the holding company. Considering the amount of brand
equity built into the BofA moniker, it would seem logical to choose
it over NationsBank.
</P>
<P>
   However, the same caller quibbled over my statement that
NationsBank is taking over BofA. Of course, the public relations
spin-meisters at both banks call the deal a merger of equals, but
in reality, there is no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   As long as NationsBank Chairman and CEO Hugh McColl is the chief
executive of the new entity and the corporate headquarters is in
Charlotte, the North Carolina bank-holding company is taking over
BofA. Get over it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _Correction: &LR;  In a column last Wednesday, the closing stock
price on the first day of trading for Broadcast.com of Dallas was
incorrectly stated. The first-day close was $62.75 a share.

STALLARD SPEAKS OUT: HE FEELS NO SHAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Tracy Stallard, who seemed to be ducking telephone
calls about his role in the home run record that the late Roger
Maris is on the verge of losing, welcomed a call Sunday to talk
about that very subject. It enabled him, he said, to clear up any
misimpression that might linger.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard, who turned 61 last Monday, has been revived in the
memories of baseball followers because Mark McGwire is on the verge
of tying and breaking Maris' record of 61, and Sammy Sosa is not
far behind. Neither hit a home run Sunday, leaving McGwire at 60
and Sosa at 58.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind talking about it,'' said Stallard, who threw the
pitch that Maris hit for the home run that broke Babe Ruth's
legendary record. ``It's something I've talked about for 30 years.
I still have the same answer. I'm glad you got me because it will
slow this stuff down.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``stuff'' Stallard referred to was the feeling that he was
always bothered by giving up Maris' 61st home run on the last day
of the 1961 season. His failure to return calls to discuss it
reinforced that belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any shame at all,'' he said from his home in
Virginia, where he had returned for the Labor Day weekend from the
construction job he is working in Cincinnati. ``I didn't have that
feeling. I never said that. I lost the game, 1-0, and I didn't feel
anything about it. People are always trying to read something into
it. But it has never bothered me to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallard, who was pitching for the Boston Red Sox, recalled that
he had two balls and no strikes on Maris and threw him a fastball,
``maybe a straight ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went one-on-one, just like these guys are doing with McGwire
and Sosa,'' said Stallard, who was watching the Cincinnati Reds-St.
Louis Cardinals game on television. ``That's all you can do. There
was not that much emphasis on it at that time. We didn't pay that
much attention to it. It's a lot different now with TV and all the
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   When Maris homered that memorable Oct. 1, Stallard said he
experienced no special feeling. ``It just put you behind, 1-0,'' he
said, ``and you're trying to win the ball game. I came up to hit
the next inning, and I wanted to hit a home run.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not, and he lost the game and went into baseball's memory
bank as the pitcher who gave up the home run. Some pitchers asked
in recent weeks said they would not mind giving up the 62nd home
run. A couple even remarked that giving up the home run was the
only way they might be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand why a pitcher would want to give up a home
run,'' said Stallard, who had a 30-57 record in seven major-league
seasons, two of which were spent with the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt for the pitchers facing McGwire and Sosa but
said, ``If they really try hard, why should they be ashamed if they
give it up?''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he wished McGwire and Sosa well. ``I'm happy
for whoever does it,'' he said. ``I think they're good athletes,
and good luck to them. I'm pulling for these guys. It would be
great. I'm happy for them, and I think it's good for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallard said he had talked baseball with people over the years
and not just about that pitch and the home run. ``My God,'' he
said, ``that was just one pitch. There's a lot of other things to
talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stallard described himself as ``sort of a fan,'' but he
obviously had not lost any of his baseball knowledge. Having
watched McGwire take a third strike a few minutes earlier, he said,
``It looks to me like McGwire guessed on the last pitch. They threw
him a good curveball, and he took it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching on television, Stallard also saw some members of the
Maris family at the game. Four of Maris' sons were at Busch
Stadium, and Pat Maris, their mother, was supposed to be with them,
but she became ill on the flight to St. Louis and was hospitalized
upon arrival for observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well acquainted with the Maris family,'' Stallard said.
``They're a great family.''
</P>
<P>
   The former pitcher said he also saw Commissioner Bud Selig on
television talking about the interest the record chase has
generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first thing I've heard him say that was positive in
two or three years,'' Stallard said.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard said he would return to work after the weekend, and the
record chase may come to him if it lasts beyond the series on
Monday and Tuesday between the Cardinals and Cubs. The Cardinals
play in Cincinnati on Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be at the game in Cincinnati Wednesday,'' he said.
``I'll be back then.''

$200,000 LOST AS AN INVESTMENT GOES BAD

   Sometimes it can be hard to have sympathy for the kinds of
people who fall for securities schemes: the greedy, the gullible,
the gamblers. But in the case of the Bennett Funding Group, lawyers
say, most victims were careful, conservative people who thought
they were putting their money somewhere safe.
</P>
<P>
   Victims included people like Richard Schiff, 77, a retired
businessman from Long Island, N.Y., who now lives in Boca Raton,
Fla. Schiff lost his $200,000 retirement account by investing in
Bennett. While he is not impoverished by the loss, Schiff said,
``That income would have been very useful.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Russian immigrant who ran a small lumberyard in
Brooklyn, N.Y., Schiff made a career selling plastic laminates,
like Formica, and, with his wife of 53 years, brought up two
children. Heart problems forced him to retire about 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When Schiff invested in the Bennett group, he thought he was
buying ``leases from the federal government for mail trucks,'' he
said, with an interest rate of 9 percent. In 1996, after having
invested $135,000 directly in Bennett leases, he agreed to put
$65,000 from his individual retirement account into what he thought
was a Bennett-sponsored fund; four days later, the Bennett
companies filed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Schiff is a supporter of Richard Breeden, the former chairman of
the Securities and Exchange Commission who is trustee of the
Bennett companies' bankruptcy and is responsible for trying to get
investors' money back. Schiff said he was happy to be finally
recouping money from his investment. But the status of the money in
the fund remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted by the fear that the Bennetts or their associates would
somehow get control of that money, Schiff has hired lawyers to
protect his interests and those of the other fund investors. And
despite his ill health, he has traveled to Utica, N.Y., to appear
in bankruptcy court in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only to recover my money _ I won't stand for somebody
getting away with stealing,'' he said. ``I'm angry the system
allowed this to happen.''

   PHILADELPHIA _ Little has been certain here in recent years as
the city's population and employment base dwindled. Still, people
could usually count on two things: that The Philadelphia Inquirer
was investigating a major local institution and that James E.
Beasley Sr., a malpractice lawyer, was suing a major local
institution _ often The Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   In two epic libel battles, Beasley won $40 million in jury
verdicts against the newspaper, although one of the judgments, for
$6 million, has been sent back for a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an Antichrist as far as The Inquirer is concerned,''
Beasley said.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine the reaction in The Inquirer's newsroom recently when
Ralph Cipriano, a reporter, filed a libel suit against the paper
after the editor, Robert Rosenthal, publicly questioned the
objectivity and value of his reporting on the Archdiocese of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer? Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, accustomed to libel suits from outsiders,
Cipriano's in-house action was heresy. But Cipriano, who filed his
suit on Aug. 7, said that Rosenthal's public criticism _ the editor
was quoted in The Washington Post as saying that the reporter ``has
a very strong personal point of view and an agenda'' and ``There
were things that Ralph wrote that we didn't think were truthful'' _
had given him no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have literally destroyed his professional status as a
responsible reporter,'' Beasley said in an interview here, ``to
satisfy the intemperate outburst of a frustrated editor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say what hit the newspaper's staff harder: that
the editors' disputes about coverage with a combative colleague had
escalated to public insults and a libel suit or that the colleague
had made common cause with a lawyer who, in the words of the media
editor, Beth Gillin, ``is very much despised'' in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   In the four weeks that have followed, tensions have escalated
further. Late last month, Cipriano, 44, was dismissed after he
refused to give editors his notes related to reporting on the
archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he had turned to the newspaper's longtime antagonist
for aid, Cipriano said he wanted the best possible representation.
``The only thing I did was file a lawsuit to exercise my
constitutional rights,'' he said. ``How was I going to function as
a reporter after Bob Rosenthal said that about me?''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Philadelphia see a logic in the continued clashes
between Beasley, the senior partner in a firm that uses
www.tortlaw.com as its World Wide Web address, and the newspaper,
which has won 18 Pulitzer Prizes in 23 years, many for documenting
abuse or mismanagement in mental hospitals, the city police
department, state courts and the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mindset of a plaintiff's personal injury attorney is that
your life's endeavor is righting wrongs,'' said Frederick L. Voigt,
the executive director of the Committee of 70, a Philadelphia civic
group. ``There's a great commonality with journalists in terms of
mentality,'' he added. ``Both are on a mission. And sometimes those
missions are going to come into conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   The words ``mission'' and ``conflict'' tend to crop up in
conversations about Cipriano as well _ though usually along with
the words ``good writer.'' Cipriano spent 11 years at The Inquirer,
covering the New Jersey suburbs, writing features and obituaries
and, last November, an article disclosing the eligibility problems
of a University of Pennsylvania football player _ disclosures that
led the school to forfeit the five games the team won in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he clashed often with Inquirer colleagues,
according to both Cipriano and some editors. When he arrived, he
objected to smoking in suburban bureaus. He argued about diversity
training sessions in the early 1990s. Cipriano _ who is of Italian
and Lebanese descent and says ``when I look in the mirror, I see
olive skin'' _ objected to being pigeonholed as a white male.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a strong sense of right and wrong,'' he said. ``I have
had it since I was a little kid. I know what's right and what's
wrong, and I stick to my principles. I have a tenacious character,
and I don't give up easily.''
</P>
<P>
   These were not qualities that endeared him to the hierarchy of
the Archdiocese of Philadelphia when Cipriano covered religion in
1992 and 1993. Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua was coping with the
thinning out of congregations that resulted from the city's
dwindling population.
</P>
<P>
   ``This archdiocese was looking for consolidation,'' recalled
Arlene Notoro Morgan, who is The Inquirer's assistant managing
editor for readership. ``And every time a church goes down, a part
of somebody's past goes with it, and they mourn it and get upset
about it. Some of those people found their way to Ralph.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano covered protests and Bevilacqua's spending decisions.
The public relations consultant to the archdiocese, Brian Tierney
of the Tierney Group, started raising objections to Inquirer
editors. In an interview last month, Tierney confirmed, ``We did
repeatedly say that we would not cooperate in any story in which
Ralph is the lead reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Cipriano's editors folded his reporting about the
church closings and simultaneous spending on accouterments for a
conference center into a longer profile that Cipriano was preparing
on Bevilacqua. He protested that decision, contending that the
reports should stand on their own. And when there were delays in
running the profile, Cipriano said, ``I stopped writing anything,
for maybe a month,'' to press his editors into running the critical
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the profile was published in February 1993, Cipriano
agreed to switch beats and began covering the neighborhoods of
south Philadelphia. None of his editors will speak on the record
about his work in the years that followed, but their attitudes can
be inferred from details offered by Cipriano. By 1997, he said, his
editors told him he was unreachable too often and required him to
carry a cellular phone and to write more articles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There had been many changes at the newspaper over those four
years. Maxwell King, the editor who had succeeded Eugene Roberts in
1990, was himself preparing to step down. There were disparaging
comments around the city that The Inquirer was not the paper it had
been when Roberts' staff won 17 Pulitzers in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had done some great stuff. but they really got soft,''
said Howard Altman, the news editor of The City Paper, an
alternative weekly. ``There was a move toward not offending
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is Cipriano's contention in his suit that The Inquirer
``did not wish to offend the archdiocese'' and risk losing readers
among the area's 1.4 million Catholics that particularly makes the
newspaper's editors bristle.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Editor William Ward said, ``I'm offended at the
accusation'' that the paper's staff was solely motivated ``by a
desire to raise circulation, or is caving to outside influences,
when I know these people have not done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, who has been on vacation, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the editor of The Inquirer's Sunday magazine, Avery
Rome, assigned Cipriano to write another profile of Bevilacqua. In
a sequence that in Cipriano's account was an eerie echo of the 1993
battles, he discovered what he described as damaging information
about the cardinal that his editors were reluctant to print.
Infuriated by their objections and sure he was being unfairly
singled out for punitive treatment, he sought help from union
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gillin, who is also a shop steward for Local 10 of the
Newspaper Guild, corroborated Cipriano's account of a two-page
warning about his work habits and productivity that a city desk
editor gave to him. Several editors said they would not comment on
personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, by the spring of this year, convinced the best of
his work would not make it into The Inquirer, Cipriano wrote a
10,000-word article on Bevilacqua for The National Catholic
Reporter, a weekly newspaper based in Kansas City, Mo. Among other
things, the article said the cardinal had authorized spending $5
million on renovations for three office buildings, his house, his
vacation home and improvements to a cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, Frank Lewis, a reporter for The City Paper,
wrote an article detailing Cipriano's battles with clerics and
editors. Cipriano was quoted as referring to the cardinal as ``a
Pharisee.''
</P>
<P>
   When Howard Kurtz, the media critic for The Washington Post,
asked Rosenthal about Cipriano's contention that, for The Inquirer,
the cardinal was ``a sacred cow,'' the editor responded with his
criticisms of Cipriano's work.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ms. Gillen, ``People think that it was a stupid
thing'' for Rosenthal to have publicly criticized his reporter. ``I
agree,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano, she said, called her at home the day The Post
published Rosenthal's remarks and asked, ``Can the union file a
libel suit?''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriano said that it was a union lawyer who encouraged him to
file the suit, which also names the paper's parents, Knight Ridder
and its Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. unit, as defendants. But it
was Cipriano who selected Beasley, the paper's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Both in the suit and in an interview, Beasley echoed Cipriano's
contention that the newspaper's fear of declining circulation _ now
433,489 on weekdays and 871,659 on Sundays, down from 545,000 daily
in 1983 and 1.01 million on Sundays in 1985 _ made it reluctant to
take on the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony not lost on the newspaper's current and former
editors that Beasley, who won libel judgments for a lawyer and a
judge whom he argued were tarred by aggressive reporting done to
bolster circulation, is now arguing that The Inquirer has gone soft
to raise circulation. They are reluctant to comment on the record
about the lawyer, however.
</P>
<P>
   But the deputy foreign editor, Marc Kaufman, expressed the
feelings of several colleagues in commenting on Cipriano's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the newsroom feel kind of awful for everyone
involved,'' he said. ``Ralph was generally liked, however much
people might have thought that he had kind of tunnel vision on this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   People also liked Rosenthal, Kaufman said, ``and feel the paper
is getting ready to take another major step up, not down. Everybody
feels a little let down that they weren't able to work it out.
Everyone feels a little knocked around.''

ON COLLEGE FOOTBALL: IRISH PROVIDE EARLY JOLT AS SEASON KICKS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their off-season conditioning encompassed sprints on the sands
of Lake Michigan, as well as pushing a broken-down van around the
circumference of the Notre Dame field. It built the kind of
strength that the Fighting Irish needed to wear down Michigan in
the second half on Saturday and record the college football
season's first major upset.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the polls at least, Notre Dame has momentum, too. The
Fighting Irish's biggest victory since a 1993 upset of Florida
State vaulted them 12 places to No. 10 in the Associated Press news
media poll and 13 places to No. 11 in the USA Today/ESPN coaches
poll. The 36-20 victory came at the expense of Lloyd Carr's
Wolverines, the defending national co-champions, who fell eight
places to No. 13 in the AP poll and nine places to No. 14 in the
coaches' vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big, big win,'' Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie said. ``It
jump starts our season.''
</P>
<P>
   On college football's first full weekend, rankings and title
hopes changed, and the cases of some Heisman hopefuls improved. In
addition to Notre Dame, which is in the national championship mix,
however briefly, others who secured better footing include:
</P>
<P>
   OHIO STATE: The Buckeyes walloped West Virginia, 34-17, in
Morgantown, W.Va., to demonstrate that they deserved both polls'
top ranking. ``They played like the No. 1 team,'' Mountaineer Coach
Don Nehlen said.
</P>
<P>
   BROCK HUARD AND WASHINGTON: Huard, a 6-foot-5-inch left-hander,
capped a 27-for-47, 318-yard, 4-touchdown day with a genuine
Heisman moment: a 63-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-17 with just
28 seconds left to upset Arizona State, 42-38, in a thrilling
finish and knocked the Sun Devils out of the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest game I've ever been a part of,'' said
Huard, who decided not to enter the National Football League draft
after last season. His heroics moved the Huskies up to No. 11 in
the news media poll and to No. 10 in the coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   JOE PATERNO AND PENN STATE: The Nittany Lions' 34-6 rout of No.
21 Southern Mississippi was remarkable because Paterno played two
quarterbacks and got 255 rushing yards, mostly from a trio of
backup running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, Paterno is certain to notch career victory No. 300
against Bowling Green, and a place in history alongside Bear
Bryant, Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo Stagg. Not only that, but his
young team moved up four spots to take the No. 9 position in both
polls, so Penn State can also be considered in the title hunt.
</P>
<P>
   As for those who lost ground over the opening weekend:
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN: Penn State's Big Ten rival heads the list. Four missed
field goals and an inability to score touchdowns against a Notre
Dame defense they moved at will dropped the Wolverines out of the
top 10 in both polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw the ball well, but we have a long way to go and a lot
of corrections to make,'' said Carr, whose quarterbacks, Tom Brady
and Drew Henson, threw for 322 yards against the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines can't be counted out of the championship picture,
but with one loss they now have to win their remaining games. It is
asking much of a team that plays Syracuse on Saturday and has games
with Penn State and Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   SYRACUSE AND DONOVAN McNABB: The Orangemen now go to Ann Arbor,
Mich., in a familiar hole after losing to Tennessee, 34-33. News
media voters dropped them two spots to No. 19, and the coaches
dropped them four to No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb didn't hurt himself, rallying his team within 1 minute 43
seconds of an upset with a 21-of-27, 298-yard, two-touchdown day.
But a loss at Michigan would eliminate him as a Heisman candidate
because winning the Big East is not the stuff of legend.
</P>
<P>
   WEST VIRGINIA AND AMOS ZEREOUE: The Mountaineers welcomed the
Buckeyes with talk of a national championship behind running back
Zereoue, who was 10th in the Heisman voting last year. Their poor
performance dropped them to No. 20 in both polls, and now, like
Syracuse, West Virginia must focus on the Big East. And Zereoue
hurt himself with a mediocre 77 yards on 20 carries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   North Carolina, Michigan State, Colorado State and Auburn all
lost and dropped from both polls after showing themselves to be
pretenders. The Tar Heels proved to be the worst offenders, losing
by 13-10 to Miami of Ohio, and now quarterback Oscar Davenport will
be out two to five weeks after surgery on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   The serious Heisman contenders turned in serious performances in
easier circumstances over the weekend.
</P>
<P>

EDITORIAL: MORE JOBS, LESS SECURITY
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 7:
</P>
<P>
   As America pauses for Labor Day, more people have jobs than ever
before and the unemployment rate is close to its lowest level in a
generation. At the same time, people are less likely to keep their
jobs for long periods, and the level of layoffs is considerably
higher than it was in earlier economic cycles. These facts are
indicative of a vibrant, competitive economy that provides less
security, for either workers or the companies that hire them, than
the American economy seemed to offer in decades past.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of security is reflected in numerous ways. Companies
are more likely to cut costs quickly in response to competitive
pressures than they once were, leading to more layoffs during the
current economic recovery, which has endured for eight years, than
in previous ones. Deregulation of many industries, from trucking to
telecommunications, has led to new patterns of competition in which
some companies must shed workers while competitors are hiring.
</P>
<P>
   The society has changed to cope with that movement. Pension
plans, for example, are more likely to be defined contribution
plans, such as 401(k)'s, which can move with a worker, rather than
defined benefit plans in which benefits are forfeited if a worker
does not stay with a company for at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   That mobility of workers _ sometimes voluntarily through getting
better jobs and sometimes involuntarily through layoffs and
downsizing _ reflects a worldwide trend. Countries that have
accepted it tend to do much better economically than those that
have not, although at a cost of increased worker anxiety. Japan is
only grudgingly moving away from the lifetime employment policy
that damaged the competitiveness of Japanese companies during this
decade. Neither Russia nor China has yet dealt adequately with the
large state enterprises that have provided employment _ and social
services _ for millions but that cannot profitably make products
that people want.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1980s and 1990s, economic statistics seemed to
show that real wages _ what workers make, adjusted for inflation _
had stagnated in this country. Some thought that reflected the
declining power of unions _ which now represent about 13 percent of
workers, down from a peak of 23 percent _ as well as fears of job
loss. The problem may have been overstated, however, because
inflation was actually lower than the consumer price index
indicated and recent figures show a better picture.
</P>
<P>
   The August unemployment report, released Friday, showed that
real wages had risen about 2 percent a year for the past two years.
That may not sound like a lot, but it is the largest such gain in a
quarter-century. Workers now are benefiting from the combination of
a tight domestic labor market and an Asian recession that is
holding down the prices of many things people buy.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE POLITICS OF REMEDIAL EDUCATION AT CUNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BRENT STAPLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Heavy-handed politics at the City University of New
York has demoralized both faculty and administrators and led to a
legal battle over an initiative that has made CUNY the first
university of such historic importance to forbid remedial education
on four-year campuses. A court ruling has blocked the plan,
scheduled to begin phasing in in 1999, pending a trial on whether
trustees adopted the policy at a session that violated open-meeting
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees controlled by Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani could conceivably get around the courts by approving the
plan again _ this time in a meeting that complied with the letter
of the law. But that would leave unanswered a second, more serious
challenge, from the state Board of Regents, which has jurisdiction
on educational policy throughout the state and has faulted CUNY for
rushing into this radical plan without examining its potential
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The new remedial rule would bar from four-year colleges all
entering students who fail any of three skills tests in reading,
writing and mathematics. These students would be funneled into
community colleges, where space is so short that some students are
already chosen by lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The community colleges are staffed mainly by part-timers and
offer anemic curriculums. Students who begin at these campuses are
far less likely to receive four-year degrees than those who go
straight to four-year colleges. Students who do not graduate from
four-year colleges are far less appealing in the job market.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study showed that more than 60 percent of CUNY's
graduates _ and 7-in-10 Asians _ started college with at least one
remedial course. Anything that discourages these students would be
a blow to the city's labor force.
</P>
<P>
   The CUNY trustees describe the remedial rule as a way of
boosting standards. But some regents see it as a strategy for
subverting open-admissions requirements that are etched in state
law. They also suspect a stealth plan for shrinking the university
at the expense of new immigrants and poor students who make up the
bulk of enrollment. Most CUNY managers who share this view are
keeping silent for fear of being fired.
</P>
<P>
   The regents' suspicions are spelled out in two letters written
to CUNY by the regents' representative, Deputy Education
Commissioner Gerald Patton. He asked CUNY to document how it would
shift staff, money, facilities and faculty contracts to meet the
new demand at the community colleges. He also pointed out that
students confined to remedial courses _ and barred from taking
college-level courses _ would be ineligible for state tuition aid,
meaning the poorest of them would be driven from school very
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The CUNY trustees will also need to explain why they wish to
make admissions decisions based on a skills test that has not been
nationally normed or statistically validated _ and is not a
reliable predictor of who will fail and who will succeed in
college. In fact, students who fail one, or even two tests often
recover to find themselves among the system's most distinguished
graduates.
</P>
<P>
   The open admissions policy at CUNY required explicit approval
from the regents when it was introduced. In addition, the
Democratic state Assembly took over funding for CUNY's
cash-strapped senior colleges only after extracting a detailed
commitment to provide broad access to the city's disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   Given its historical role, the state Assembly has been
perplexingly quiet during this fight. The black and Latino caucus,
whose constituents stand to suffer catastrophically, was recently
characterized by one state official as ``cowering in a corner.'' As
though to stiffen the Legislature's spine, the regents have cast
the remedial plan as an attempt by the CUNY trustees to rewrite
state education law.
</P>
<P>
   Some trustees controlled by Pataki and Giuliani see the regents
as a meddlesome bunch that have exceeded their mandate. But with
broad powers outlined in the state's constitution, the regents are
within their rights to intervene in university policy. Just last
year, for example, they berated CUNY's teaching schools for turning
out students who fail the teaching certification exams _ and ruled
that they would shut down teachers' colleges all across the state
unless 80 percent of graduates passed the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Political pressure from the governor and the mayor has forced
the regents to take a more conciliatory tone than Patton began
with. Even so, CUNY's trustees must answer the regents' questions
and submit to probing scrutiny. In the coming months, The regents
will extract an impact report and subject it to evaluations by
outside experts and full-dress public hearings. Even if the regents
fold under political pressure, they will have forced the debate
that should have occurred before this train left the station.

 &HT;    Jackson tells Atlanta audience to march on
 &HT;    By Chris Reinolds and Jennifer Brett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, in Atlanta to participate in today's
Million Youth Movement, Sunday night called on youths to ``march to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``March to complete Dr. Martin Luther King's business,'' he
shouted during a fiery and deafening speech from the pulpit at
Cathedral of Faith, Church of God in Christ in southwest Atlanta.
The march today _ scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. on Auburn Avenue _
is for equal opportunity, equal protection under the law, fair
share and equal access, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the youth are marching to keep young black people
out of jail and in schools. Without marches, Atlanta would not be
the cosmopolitan city it is today, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't have CNN, the Atlanta Braves or the Olympics in
Atlanta had our (civil rights) marches not succeeded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He encouraged young black people to register and use their right
to vote and use the march to fight a variety of social ills.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, the Rev. Menelik Kimathi hailed the sacrifices
of civil rights leaders of past decades and urged today's youth to
continue their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are standing on the shoulders of giants who did their part
before us, and now we have a part to play,'' Kimathi told the
congregation of the Shrine of the Black Madonna on Ralph David
Abernathy Boulevard. Today's scheduled speakers include NAACP
Executive Director Kweisi Mfume, Jackson, Southern Christian
Leadership Conference President Martin Luther King III and National
Council of Negro Women Chairman Emeritus Dorothy Height. Among the
youth expected to speak are Jean Ayinde-Baptiste, who addressed the
1995 Million Man March, the Rev. Jamal Bryant of the NAACP,
Kimberly Underdue of the NCNW and Ashaad Muhammad of the Nation of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley Mohammed, Western regional coordinator of the Million
Youth Movement, estimated thousands of young people have come to
Atlanta for the weekend's events. He said the movement's goals are
to emphasize economic development, spiritual awareness and
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through those three things, you can move ahead in any
society,'' he said. ``All three things work for the good of the
Lord. If it works good for the Lord, it works for the Lord's
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Conner, a Birmingham native who attends Morris Brown
College, said she plans to attend today's march.
</P>
<P>
   ``The youth of America is in a state of emergency,'' she said.
The Rev. Al Sharpton, an outspoken activist who attended the
Million Youth March in New York on Saturday, also spoke at the
Sunday night service with Jackson. He said many young people
participated in positive actions despite the reports of police
clashes in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a rally of hate,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the news media should focus on the march's message,
not the New York problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police rushed the stage and that was very provocative. That
would not happen in Atlanta,'' he said.

is seeking sweeping powers never granted to a House panel as it
prepares to accept the report from the Whitewater independent

filed a libel suit against the paper after the editor, Robert
Rosenthal, publicly questioned the objectivity and value of his
reporting on the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. Last month, Cipriano
was dismissed after he refused to give editors his notes relating
to the story. It is Cipriano's contention in his suit that The
Inquirer ``did not wish to offend the archdiocese'' and risk losing
readers among the area's 1.4 million Catholics. (Sal DiMarco

not want to appear with President Clinton, is one of the latest
Democrats to spurn Clinton while on the campaign trail. ``I'm

would have had to turn down the job, without a $1,200 loan to cover

``Just out of college, unless you come from a background where your
parents can afford to help you, you wouldn't be able to relocate,''
she says. ``It makes you feel they want you.'' (Marty Katz/New York

NASCAR STARS IN STREET RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Expect to see Winston Cup star Mark Martin roaring down the
streets of Los Angeles today, just not in his familiar No.6
Valvoline Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Martin is driving a newly built Ford Taurus in a rare
appearance in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Tour. Fellow Winston
Cup competitors Kenny Schrader and Chad Little are also racing in
the Kragen Z-One 200, the featured event of the Ford Los Angeles
Street Race, at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The three raced in the Winston Cup Southern 500 in Darlington,
S.C., Sunday. They made the overnight trip to compete in the
124.6-mile race along the 1.4-mile street circuit around Exposition
Park.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third race in three days for Martin, who is second to
Jeff Gordon in the Winston Cup standings. On Saturday, Martin
finished eighth in the Busch Grand National Duralube 200 in
Darlington.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing 40th in the Southern 500 on Sunday _ he had
engine problems that forced him out with 49 laps to go _ look for
Martin to try to redeem himself today. He had not seen or driven
his Roush-built Featherlite Southwest Tour car before arriving in
California on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing you can do physically in the short term to
prepare physically for this,'' said Martin, 39. ``It's more about
your lifestyle. If you eat right, get plenty of rest, exercise and
take care of yourself on a regular basis, a trip like this is not
quite as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kragen Z-One 200 marks several firsts for Martin. The race
is Martin's first Southwest Tour event and his first competition on
a street course. He is also making his debut on the television
series ``Baywatch,'' which will use footage for an upcoming episode
featuring Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be at a disadvantage, but a guy like that can jump in
about anything and win,'' Southwest Tour driver Keith Spangler of
Northridge said. ``He didn't get where he is by not being able to
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford L.A. Street Race organizers are banking on Martin, Schrader
and Little to add prestige and interest to the Featherlite
Southwest Series event.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become the most anticipated event for the
rookie-level drivers of the Southwest Series, one of the lowest
level NASCAR tours. In addition for an opportunity to rub bumpers
with the Winston Cup greats, the race features the largest purse in
series history, $153,300.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is talking about it,'' Southwest Tour driver Frank
Maronski of Quartz Hill said. ``It's the biggest event of the
series. It's like a Little Leaguer getting a chance to make three
pitches to Mark McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   It won't be that easy for Martin, Schrader and Little. NASCAR
prohibits them from starting higher than 26th in the 40-driver
field, because they missed Sunday's qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their bread and butter. We're not going to dominate the
race,'' Little said. ``I don't think we can win, but we can be
competitive. Top 10 is a possibility. I'm out there to have fun and
put on a show. I'm taking the race seriously, but not as seriously
as Sunday's race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Featherlite Southwest Series, a lower NASCAR touring
division, was established in 1986. The cars are similar in shape to
Winston Cup series vehicles but smaller and less powerful. Today's
race is the first street race in Los Angeles in the 50-year history
of NASCAR and the lone street competition in the 17-race Southwest
season.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader might have an edge among the Winston Cup drivers on the
challenging Exposition Park layout with narrow, tight turns and
bumpy streets. Schrader, who races in the Busch Grand National
Series in addition to the Winston Cup, drives in several Southwest
Series races each season. He has won for the third time at Phoenix
in February and has also triumphed at Sears Point on the Southwest
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're lighter, but there really isn't much of a difference.
It's a lot more fun to drive,'' Schrader said about the Featherlite
cars. ``It'll be a little more difficult on the streets, but it's
going to be the same for everybody.''
