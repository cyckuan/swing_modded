OFFICERS TESTIFY THEY DID NOT SEE A CHOKE HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City police sergeant and another police
officer testified Monday that they did not see Officer Francis
Livoti use a choke hold to subdue Anthony Baez in December 1994,
when Baez died after an arrest in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But during five hours of withering cross-examination by a
federal prosecutor, the sergeant, William Monahan, conceded that he
and Livoti had met with their lawyers in the offices of the police
union to hear Livoti's version of the incident before Monahan gave
statements to police investigators and the Bronx district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-examination of Monahan came on the first full day of
the defense case in the trial of Livoti in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. Livoti, who was acquitted in 1996 of criminally
negligent homicide in the death but was dismissed from the police
force after an administrative trial, is charged with one count of
depriving Baez of his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend that Livoti used a choke hold as he
attempted to arrest Baez after a confrontation sparked by a
late-night touch football game, in which a football repeatedly hit
a police cruiser outside the Baez family home. Livoti's lawyer
denies that his client ever used a choke hold, which is banned by
the Police Department, and contends that Baez died of a severe
asthma attack after resisting arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal prosecutors did not accuse Monahan directly of
a cover-up Monday, one prosecutor told the jury last week that it
might hear testimony from police officers ``who covered up what
happened on Cameron Place on Dec. 22 in order to protect a fellow
officer and in order to protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor who conducted the cross-examination, Andrew
Dember, told Judge Shira Scheindlin out of the jury's presence
Monday that the government believed Monahan had ``failed
miserably'' in supervising Livoti, and that his failures raised
questions about the credibility of his testimony absolving Livoti
in Baez's death.
</P>
<P>
   After court, Monahan declined comment about the day's
proceedings. ``I'm tired of talking,'' he said. ``I'm done for the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, said in a brief interview
afterward that he disagreed strongly with the prosecution's
assertion that Monahan had failed to properly supervise Livoti. ``I
don't see where that failure is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right there when Livoti needed assistance and came
right over to help,'' London said, referring to the sergeant's
testimony that when Livoti and Baez began to struggle, Monahan got
out of their patrol car and went to his fellow officer's
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   London said the government's use of the word failure is ``a
conclusion that's not supported by the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on direct examination, Monahan testified that after the
struggle in which prosecutors contend that Baez was choked, he saw
Baez, handcuffed, stand up and walk briefly, with assistance from
Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officer Livoti had his arm underneath Anthony Baez's armpit,
and they took two or three steps towards the curb,'' Monahan
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Baez's knees then buckled, Monahan said, and despite Livoti's
best efforts to support him, Baez ``went down to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Another officer, Anthony Farnan, testified Monday that he, too,
had seen Baez moving after he fell to the ground, that Baez was
``definitely not'' unconscious, and that Livoti had not used a
choke hold.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Monahan's testimony that prompted the government's
strongest attacks on the credibility of police. Dember elicited
testimony from the sergeant that he had met with Livoti in the
headquarters of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association about a week
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``During your meeting with the defendant that day, isn't it true
that he went through in your presence the complete story about what
he remembered happening?'' Dember asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through it together,'' Monahan said, adding that
Livoti gave him a demonstration of how he had held Baez before they
fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for our attorneys, who were present,'' Monahan said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Dember asked Monahan about earlier warnings that
Livoti had received from the commander of the 46th Precinct
regarding the use of excessive force against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan acknowledged that he was aware generally of his
responsibility to monitor Livoti's interactions with civilians, but
that he had not focused on them that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any point during that night,'' Dember asked, ``did the
instructions you received from the commanding officer of the 46th
Precinct ever cross your mind?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that I remember, no,'' Monahan replied.

JAFAR SHARIF-EMAMI, 87, AIDE TO SHAH AND PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jafar Sharif-Emami, the last of Shah Mohammed Riza
Pahlevi's prime ministers to make a political attempt to counter
the Islamic fundamentalism sweeping Iran 20 years ago, died on June
16 at New York Hospital. He was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif-Emami, one of the shah's close confidants, held many high
government and legislative positions. He was prime minister twice,
first in 1960-61 and in 1978, in a belated attempt to stem the
Shiite revolution through political and social changes.
</P>
<P>
   Through Sharif-Emami, the shah legalized political parties and
set elections for mid-1979. The prime minister began a campaign
against widespread corruption, released half of all political
prisoners, ended press censorship except for reports that
criticized the shah and the army and moved to redirect Iran's drive
toward modernization so as not to offend Islamic sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The changes met some of the important demands posed by
dissidents for many years. But the efforts failed to deflate the
growing crisis, as civil servants and industrial workers joined the
opposition and crippled public services and vital industries,
including oil production. And public anger began to spill into the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   After little more than two months in office, in November 1978,
Sharif-Emami handed his resignation to the shah, who then tried a
military approach with Gholam Riza Azhari, his final prime
minister, as the nation erupted in revolt. After the ailing shah's
flight and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's surge to power, a
revolutionary judge called for the assassinations of both prime
ministers, as well as that of Shahpur Bakhtiar, an agnostic foe of
both the shah and the Shiites who briefly headed the government
between those reigns. Bakhtiar was stabbed to death in 1991 in the
Paris suburb where he lived in exile, leading an Iranian resistance
group.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif-Emami escaped to New York, where he had been president of
the Pahlevi Foundation, an educational charity established by the
multibillion-dollar Pahlevi Foundation Endowment of Tehran. Critics
contended that the purpose of the New York foundation, from which
Sharif-Emami resigned, was less to help Iranian students than to
polish the shah's image.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif-Emami's own image was that of a hard-driving engineer who
liked to get things done, sometimes without reckoning the costs. He
was born in Tehran and studied railroading at technical institutes
in Germany and Sweden. He joined the Iranian state railways in
1931.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Sharif-Emami became undersecretary of roads and
communications. He was minister of industries and mines when the
shah first named him prime minister in the midst of one of Iran's
recurrent political crises.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are two daughters, Shirin Sharif-Emami of San Antonio
and Simin Moazami of Manhattan; a son, Ali, also of Manhattan; a
sister, Shariat Zahedi of Tehran, and six grandchildren. His wife,
Eshrat, died in November.

MURDOCH'S STYLE SHAPES DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If you're trying to figure out whose fingerprints
were on the shotgun that blasted Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Bill
Russell and Executive Vice President Fred Claire out of their jobs
Sunday, look 15 miles west of Dodgers Stadium to Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   That's where media mogul Rupert Murdoch's offices are on the
20th Century Fox lot and where he works when he's on the Left
Coast. It's most likely that's where Murdoch made the decision to
pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, team President Bob Graziano made the move late
Sunday after consulting with News Corp. President Peter Chernin and
Co-Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. But to conclude that
Murdoch, the self-made billionaire who built News Corp. into a
worldwide empire from scratch, had no influence in sacking Russell
and Claire would be naive, financial analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be surprising if this did not go all the way to
Murdoch,'' said analyst Steven Cesinger of investment bank Greif &AMP;
Co. ``He's obviously got to be concerned about how the team is
being run, given the dismal performance so far this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's management style, more than anything, reflects a
willingness to upset the status quo, even in a tradition-bound
enterprise like Major League Baseball. Consider that when Murdoch
completed the $311 million buyout of the Dodgers, Chernin and Carey
promised News Corp. would respect the team's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Dodgers have:
</P>
<P>
   --Gotten rid of free meals for the press and Dodgers executives.
</P>
<P>
   --Shaken up the cathedral-like atmosphere of Dodger Stadium by
bringing in between-innings rock music and plenty of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   --Traded two of the team's most popular players, Mike Piazza and
Hideo Nomo
</P>
<P>
   --And become the first team this season to fire the manager and
operations chief.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Murdoch, though, one of the big questions
about the summer house-cleaning was a simple one: What took so
long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Murdoch paid a hefty price for the team,'' Cesinger said.
``Above all, he's a performance-oriented owner, so if something's
not working and you've got a better idea, there's no time like the
present to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Russell and Claire argued that the team has
suffered through an unusually large amount of injuries and bad
luck. Other critics of the firings say that making a mid-season
switch amounts to throwing in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch trackers respond that those kind of concerns don't
matter in Rupert's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the track record of Russell and Claire had been
anything to write home about, and the team looks like it's been in
disarray,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that Murdoch's people were eventually going to
bring in their own people. He didn't buy the team to learn how to
run it. His people already know what's involved with undoing and
building up sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, whose empire is valued at more than $30 billion, has a
reputation as a workaholic and micromanager who promotes executives
who reflect his own bottom-line sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   So the firings don't necessarily mean that Murdoch has been
hanging out in the Dodger clubhouse with Tom Lasorda -- who became
Claire's replacement with the title interim general manager -- but
rather Graziano, Carey and Chernin have adopted the
go-for-the-jugular Murdoch style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carey and Chernin have a certain rough edge to them and
they're easy to picture as working in that kind of environment with
a rough and tumble approach to business,'' Rockwell said. ``These
are the sort of guys who have filtered up through the ranks and
gained Murdoch's confidence by doing things in his style.''
</P>
<P>
   The firings confirmed the fears of many longtime Dodgers fans.
Murdoch's ownership clearly means wrenching changes after four
decades of cautious operation by the O'Malley family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has always had this deep emotional attachment
to its heritage from the Brooklyn days, but this is a new era,''
said retail consultant Frederick Marx, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
``Murdoch has a willingness to part with convention. He's all about
the bottom line and giving the public what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Murdoch generally operates his far-flung
empire effectively because his strategies make sense on a long-term
global basis. ``It doesn't matter where the venue is,'' Marx said.
``He's kind of the Marco Polo of our age.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver sports consultant Dean Bonham said none of Murdoch's
actions have surprised him. ``News Corp. is doing exactly what I
expected them to do, which is making the moves that you make when a
sports team is part of a conglomerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Key among those goals is expanding the reach of the Fox
networks, Bonham said, citing Murdoch's stated goal of using the
Dodgers and sports assets as a ``battering ram'' to set up
pay-per-view and cable networks in new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidly, I would not be surprised to see the Dodgers lose $20
million a year for the next five years,'' Bonham said, noting that
News Corp. was willing to lose up to $150 million a year on pro
football broadcasts simply to elevate the status of the Fox
Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Dodgers have been doing doesn't make sense if they
were owned by an individual, but my gut instinct tells me that it
makes sense for News Corp., which owns 72 companies on five
continents,'' he said. ``The Dodgers are an important piece of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst said the firings are more a reflection of
the industry than Murdoch's management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``These firings may be more of a testament to the whole
direction of sports with the growing need to win immediately,''
said David Carter, a Los Angeles sports consultant.

 &HT;    Williamson land speculator at risk of losing securities license
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ State regulators are trying to revoke the
securities license of Pohl, Brown &AMP; Associates Inc., which controls
5,000 acres of commercial land in Williamson County, Texas. Company
officials refused to allow inspectors to freely examineadvertising
records, complaints from investors and other information during a
surprise inspection in December, said David A. Grauer, director of
enforcement for the State Securities Board.
</P>
<P>
   Gary F. Brown, vice president of Pohl, Brown said company
officials are willing to make the records available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not deny them access to anything,'' Brown said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Grauer would not say why the Securities Board was seeking the
records. He said enforcement officials inspect partnership records
as part of investigations and in routine checks for compliance with
state laws. Pohl, Brown manages more than 50 limited partnerships _
groups of investors who pool their money, in this case to buy land.
Pohl, Brown tries to sell the land at a profit. If the license were
revoked, the company would not be able to seek investors for such
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from a disagreement over how securities officials
are allowed to inspect partnership records, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   When three Securities Board investigators visited the company on
the morning of Dec. 10, Brown was overseas and Bill Pohl, the
company president, was meeting with investors in Houston, Texas. A
receptionist and real estate brokers for the company were in the
office on the 10th floor of the Tower of the Hills building, 13809
Research Blvd. in Northwest Austin, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say specifically what they wanted to see,'' Brown
said. ``They just said 'everything.' Well, everything's a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he and Pohl spoke with investigators by telephone and
told them they could return the next day, when Pohl was due back,
to review the appropriate records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to just open our file cabinets to whoever wants
to come in,'' Brown said. ``We thought they would come the next
day, and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has never faced an effort to revoke its license
before, Brown added.
</P>
<P>
   Though he wouldn't comment on specifics of the case, Grauer, the
enforcement director, said Pohl, Brown officials did not allow free
and unlimited access to partnership records, as is required by law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular allegation here . . . goes to the very
integrity of the inspections process,'' Grauer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities Board regulates limited partnerships, stock
offerings and other forms of securities statewide, Grauer said. The
agency's officers are allowed to make surprise visits to inspect
securities dealers' records, similar to the way health department
inspectors visit restaurants to test for cleanliness and food
quality, Grauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dealers should be aware that we will not tolerate obstructions
of agency investigations,'' Grauer said. ``If a dealer refuses to
permit our inspections, which are designed to protect investors, we
will seek swift and decisive sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings would take away the securities dealer license
held by Pohl, Brown and used by its agents, Pohl, Brown and Michael
T. Leggett. The Securities Board revoked 17 dealers' licenses in
the fiscal year ending August 1997, Grauer said.There are more than
100,000 securities agents statewide, many of whom work under one
dealer license, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A California company has a contract to buy 80 percent of Pohl,
Brown's holdings in Williamson County. Grauer said any action on
the securities license would not affect land sales.
</P>
<P>
   Making surprise inspections is crucial to the Securities Board's
investigations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the very essence of the inspections,'' Grauer said.
``There is no opportunity to sanitize or otherwise secrete any
documents.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if company officials promise to allow
investigators to see their files after the initial visit, Grauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Securities enforcement officials had hearings in February and
May before Ann Landeros, an administrative law judge with the Texas
Office of Administrative Hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Landeros will forward findings of the investigation and any
recommendations for action to Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt
Crawford. Crawford's decision can be appealed in state district
court, Grauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl, Brown attorney Dudley McCalla did not return phone calls
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Pohl, Brown's license is revoked, the company could apply for
a new one at any time, Grauer said. When reviewing an application
for a new license, Securities Board officials would consider
information from the license revocation hearings, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in some partnerships with Pohl, Brown have filed a
class-action suit alleging that company officials misled them into
buying shares of partnerships and didn't tell them about offers to
sell land the partnerships own.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Hemphill, an attorney representing the plaintiffs, said he
didn't know much about the Securities Board investigation but that
it doesn't appear the allegations will affect the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do allege that they didn't disclose some information to
investors that they should have,'' Hemphill said. ``I think that's
different than whatever they're alleged of doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Securities Board was seeking information at Pohl,
Brown's offices, officials with the Texas General Land Office were
trying to sell 446 acres in Northwest Austin to Madron Investments
Ltd. _ a major client of Pohl, Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Agency spokesman Ron Calhoun said land office officials did not
know about the Securities Board proceedings against Pohl, Brown.
But he said the proceedings probably were not relevant to the land
sale.

HOSPITALS FORGE AN ALLIANCE TO FIGHT ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT BACTERIA

</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jolted by the rapid spread of bacteria that resist
antibiotics, New York City's business community and six top
hospitals are forging a novel alliance to detect, identify, and, if
all goes well, reduce the bacteria's levels in the city's
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, health experts nationwide have been
cautiously worrying about the threat posed by the increasing
immunity of the bacteria, which can cause potentially fatal
diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia and serious infections
like strep or staph.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of death from resistant bacteria is relatively low,
most experts agree. But the new alliance recognizes a growing
concern about not only the bacteria, but also about a potential
side effect: that a public health issue may have economic
consequences as well. A major concern for the alliance is that
patients fearing infection will shun New York's otherwise respected
hospitals, harming an industry that is one of the city's economic
mainstays.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the initiative is the notion _ widely assumed
but scientifically unproven _ that New York City has more strains
of drug-resistant bacteria than most other parts of the country, or
at least that some strains appear in the city first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if New York has a bigger problem than other places,
it's going to affect the competitiveness of our hospitals,'' said
Willa Appel, president of the Policy Center of the New York City
Partnership, the city's leading business group, which is overseeing
the project.
</P>
<P>
   There are other cost concerns in a city where the health care
industry is the largest private employer. A recent study by the
Lewin Group, a Washington-based health care consultancy, estimated
that staph infections alone cost $435 million to treat in the New
York area in 1995. In general, patients with infections must be
hospitalized longer, erasing the savings associated with managed
care and other cost-cutting measures.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Kreiswirth, an infectious-disease expert who runs a
laboratory in Manhattan that identifies bacteria and is involved in
the project, said the issue of resistance to antibiotics also
raises questions about many medical procedures that are profitable
to hospitals, like triple-bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals which make money on these procedures will start
having major problems,'' Kreiswirth said, ``and I don't know how
the HMOs are going to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative focuses its efforts on hospitals, where the risk
of infections is far greater than in the general population.
Hospitals are by definition centers for sick people and, with so
many antibiotics in use, the bacteria most likely to survive are
those that have developed resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Appel said the project would cost more than $1 million for the
first two years, and she is seeking federal and state grants to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is at an early stage. The most concrete _ and
unusual _ accomplishment is the hospitals' agreement to share
information about infections that they are normally reluctant to
discuss with each other. To address that concern, the information
in the project would not be public, and in fact, the names of the
hospitals would be available to only a few people involved.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the project is to enable hospitals to detect
and identify new bacterial strains before they spread, Appel said.
To do that, the program would standardize the databases of the
hospitals, which would plug in information about their infections
and in return be able to find out about infections at other
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The project also calls for the hospitals to create uniform
methods of identifying various bacteria and to report the quantity
and types of antibiotics they dispense, to determine whether
greater use correlates with greater resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the rate at which people are developing infections
in hospitals rose 36 percent from 1975 to 1995, according to a
study released earlier this year. Of the 36 million hospital
admissions that year, there were 1.8 million infections contracted
in hospitals, according to the Federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. Infections contributed to the deaths of
88,100 of those patients, and experts say infection was the direct
cause of death in perhaps a quarter of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 70 percent of those 1.8 million infections were caused
by bacteria with some resistance to one or more antibiotics. It is
uncertain how many people die from bacteria that cannot be treated
with antibiotics, but experts say the number is surely rising.
</P>
<P>
   There are no comparative statistics for New York City or New
York State.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions the project seeks to answer is whether New
York indeed has more resistant bacteria than other regions do.
Experts have speculated that the city's role as a magnet for
business and worldwide immigration contributes to the problem,
especially because many immigrants come from nations where
antibiotic use is much more widespread than in the United States.

MURDOCH'S STYLE SHAPES DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- If you're trying to figure out whose fingerprints
were on the shotgun that blasted Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Bill
Russell and Executive Vice President Fred Claire out of their jobs
Sunday, look 15 miles west of Dodgers Stadium to Culver City.
</P>
<P>
   That's where media mogul Rupert Murdoch's offices are on the
20th Century Fox lot and where he works when he's on the Left
Coast. It's most likely that's where Murdoch made the decision to
pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, team President Bob Graziano made the move late
Sunday after consulting with News Corp. President Peter Chernin and
Co-Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey. But to conclude that
Murdoch, the self-made billionaire who built News Corp. into a
worldwide empire from scratch, had no influence in sacking Russell
and Claire would be naive, financial analysts said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be surprising if this did not go all the way to
Murdoch,'' said analyst Steven Cesinger of investment bank Greif &AMP;
Co. ``He's obviously got to be concerned about how the team is
being run, given the dismal performance so far this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's management style, more than anything, reflects a
willingness to upset the status quo, even in a tradition-bound
enterprise like Major League Baseball. Consider that when Murdoch
completed the $311 million buyout of the Dodgers, Chernin and Carey
promised News Corp. would respect the team's traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Dodgers have:
</P>
<P>
   --Gotten rid of free meals for the press and Dodgers executives.
</P>
<P>
   --Shaken up the cathedral-like atmosphere of Dodger Stadium by
bringing in between-innings rock music and plenty of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   --Traded two of the team's most popular players, Mike Piazza and
Hideo Nomo
</P>
<P>
   --And become the first team this season to fire the manager and
operations chief.
</P>
<P>
   For those who know Murdoch, though, one of the big questions
about the summer house-cleaning was a simple one: What took so
long?
</P>
<P>
   ``Murdoch paid a hefty price for the team,'' Cesinger said.
``Above all, he's a performance-oriented owner, so if something's
not working and you've got a better idea, there's no time like the
present to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Russell and Claire argued that the team has
suffered through an unusually large amount of injuries and bad
luck. Other critics of the firings say that making a mid-season
switch amounts to throwing in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch trackers respond that those kind of concerns don't
matter in Rupert's world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the track record of Russell and Claire had been
anything to write home about, and the team looks like it's been in
disarray,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knew that Murdoch's people were eventually going to
bring in their own people. He didn't buy the team to learn how to
run it. His people already know what's involved with undoing and
building up sports teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch, whose empire is valued at more than $30 billion, has a
reputation as a workaholic and micromanager who promotes executives
who reflect his own bottom-line sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   So the firings don't necessarily mean that Murdoch has been
hanging out in the Dodger clubhouse with Tom Lasorda -- who became
Claire's replacement with the title interim general manager -- but
rather Graziano, Carey and Chernin have adopted the
go-for-the-jugular Murdoch style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carey and Chernin have a certain rough edge to them and
they're easy to picture as working in that kind of environment with
a rough and tumble approach to business,'' Rockwell said. ``These
are the sort of guys who have filtered up through the ranks and
gained Murdoch's confidence by doing things in his style.''
</P>
<P>
   The firings confirmed the fears of many longtime Dodgers fans.
Murdoch's ownership clearly means wrenching changes after four
decades of cautious operation by the O'Malley family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization has always had this deep emotional attachment
to its heritage from the Brooklyn days, but this is a new era,''
said retail consultant Frederick Marx, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
``Murdoch has a willingness to part with convention. He's all about
the bottom line and giving the public what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Murdoch generally operates his far-flung
empire effectively because his strategies make sense on a long-term
global basis. ``It doesn't matter where the venue is,'' Marx said.
``He's kind of the Marco Polo of our age.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver sports consultant Dean Bonham said none of Murdoch's
actions have surprised him. ``News Corp. is doing exactly what I
expected them to do, which is making the moves that you make when a
sports team is part of a conglomerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Key among those goals is expanding the reach of the Fox
networks, Bonham said, citing Murdoch's stated goal of using the
Dodgers and sports assets as a ``battering ram'' to set up
pay-per-view and cable networks in new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidly, I would not be surprised to see the Dodgers lose $20
million a year for the next five years,'' Bonham said, noting that
News Corp. was willing to lose up to $150 million a year on pro
football broadcasts simply to elevate the status of the Fox
Broadcasting Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Dodgers have been doing doesn't make sense if they
were owned by an individual, but my gut instinct tells me that it
makes sense for News Corp., which owns 72 companies on five
continents,'' he said. ``The Dodgers are an important piece of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one analyst said the firings are more a reflection of
the industry than Murdoch's management style.
</P>
<P>
   ``These firings may be more of a testament to the whole
direction of sports with the growing need to win immediately,''
said David Carter, a Los Angeles sports consultant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks simple. The local thug is causing trouble again, this
time beating up his own people, not the neighbors. Last time, he
became cooperative only when the West, in the shape of NATO, showed
it meant business by carrying out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   All the dire consequences predicted by doubters failed to
happen. A peace treaty was signed, which has worked remarkably
well.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that if NATO had acted a lot earlier, Slobodan
Milosevic _ for the thug in question is the Serb nationalist who is
probably more to blame for the Balkans' wars than anyone else _
would have brought his Bosnian cousins to heel much sooner.
Thousands of lives would have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   So don't make the same mistake again: let the bombing begin.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow this week, Milosevic was persuaded by Boris Yeltsin
that it would be prudent to listen to his critics and at least talk
to the people in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. Yet no one
should assume that this better behavior will last long.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists have a special reverence for parts of Kosovo,
notably the Field of Blackbirds, where their forebears' defeat at
the hands of the Ottomans in 1389 cast the Serbs into 500 years of
Muslim subjugation.
</P>
<P>
   But this reverence for Kosovo does not extend to its people, 90
percent of whom are ethnically Albanian and mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it _ with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
</P>
<P>
   On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
</P>
<P>
   Is it really wise to start freelance intervention against such
relatively small-time bullies as Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing _ maybe cutting the throats of _
the 10 percent Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu &AMP; Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accompanied by a vow that the West would not support
the rebels seeking to split Kosovo from Serbia, nor recognize a
self-proclaimed ``independent'' Kosovo (to do so would make a
nonsense of the West's no-change-of-frontiers policy in Bosnia).
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the West should do what it could to stabilize
Macedonia (offer aid in return for decent treatment of the ethnic
Albanians). But even this would probably be too little if the
interveners were not ready to get involved on the ground, as well
as in the air, to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is the nastiest of all for NATO, but, without it,
attacks on Kosovars would probably continue, the pledge to uphold
Serbia's integrity would be disbelieved _ and the bombing would be
seen as yet another empty western gesture. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks simple. The local thug is causing trouble again, this
time beating up his own people, not the neighbors. Last time, he
became cooperative only when the West, in the shape of NATO, showed
it meant business by carrying out air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   All the dire consequences predicted by doubters failed to
happen. A peace treaty was signed, which has worked remarkably
well.
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that if NATO had acted a lot earlier, Slobodan
Milosevic _ for the thug in question is the Serb nationalist who is
probably more to blame for the Balkans' wars than anyone else _
would have brought his Bosnian cousins to heel much sooner.
Thousands of lives would have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   So don't make the same mistake again: let the bombing begin.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow this week, Milosevic was persuaded by Boris Yeltsin
that it would be prudent to listen to his critics and at least talk
to the people in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo. Yet no one
should assume that this better behavior will last long.
</P>
<P>
   Serb nationalists have a special reverence for parts of Kosovo,
notably the Field of Blackbirds, where their forebears' defeat at
the hands of the Ottomans in 1389 cast the Serbs into 500 years of
Muslim subjugation.
</P>
<P>
   But this reverence for Kosovo does not extend to its people, 90
percent of whom are ethnically Albanian and mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   In communist times, Kosovo was an autonomous province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, but since 1989, when its autonomy was
ended, repression has intensified.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovars want to secede. Some would prefer to negotiate
their independence; others, growing in number by the day, are ready
to fight for it _ with arms supplied by brethren across the border
in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement on the status of Kosovo, any lull in the
killing is likely to be just that, a lull. The question of whether
to intervene will then recur.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against armed intervention are far from trivial.
It would, if it happened, be an attack on a lawful government that
could claim to be doing no more than fighting to uphold the
principle of territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that what Abraham Lincoln was fighting for? And who gave
NATO the right to go around interfering in other countries'
internal affairs?
</P>
<P>
   On current form, Russia and China would veto any resolution in
the U.N. Security Council to authorize NATO air strikes. And
without the Security Council's approval, it is far from certain
that even a majority of NATO's members would give theirs.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, after all, has been assuring everyone that it is now a
defense-cum-peacekeeping outfit that threatens absolutely nobody,
least of all its old adversaries the Russians (among whose
fellow-Slavs are the Serbs). Action, if it is taken, could end up
as an American-British affair.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Serbs' repression in Kosovo, though terrible, is
by no means exceptionally terrible. Some 200-300 people have been
killed and perhaps 65,000 have abandoned their homes, 10,000 of
them fleeing abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The world, it may be remembered, never felt obliged to intervene
in Chechnya (50,000-100,000 dead), East Timor (100,000-200,000) or
Rwanda (800,000).
</P>
<P>
   Is it really wise to start freelance intervention against such
relatively small-time bullies as Milosevic?
</P>
<P>
   Innocents might get killed (always a possibility in military
actions). The Serbs might refuse to back down, leading to the
dangers of more intervention or the embarrassment of less. And the
Kosovars, emboldened by western help, might turn on their
oppressors, ethnically cleansing _ maybe cutting the throats of _
the 10 percent Serb minority.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day, it could be cited as an awful precedent: how
would NATO react were China, say, to carry out air strikes against
an Indian government that was fighting to prevent its
majority-Muslim province of Jammu &AMP; Kashmir from seceding?
</P>
<P>
   All this should make outsiders think hard before letting slip
their airborne dogs of war. Yet one consideration strengthens the
case, perhaps decisively, for intervention of the right kind.
</P>
<P>
   It is the likelihood that, if the turmoil in Kosovo is not
contained, it will spread to Macedonia, which has its own
discontented ethnic-Albanian minority. The ensuing civil war would
probably lead other Macedonians to take up arms, some of them eager
to break up their country and create a Greater Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to stretch to the Aegean, as some would like, Greece
would be drawn in, and surely also the Kosovars' friend, Turkey
(never mind Albania proper, which has already had one civil war
this decade). Cyprus too would almost certainly go up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   If all this could be stopped by a few bombs now, they would be
bombs well dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is unlikely that a few, or even many, bombs
would be enough. Armed intervention, if it were to work, would also
require specifying exactly what is wanted of the Serbs: an end to
repression in Kosovo and the restoration of its autonomy,
preferably with the handing over to Serbia of the Serbs' holy
places.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accompanied by a vow that the West would not support
the rebels seeking to split Kosovo from Serbia, nor recognize a
self-proclaimed ``independent'' Kosovo (to do so would make a

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the mighty fall, mere mortals get scared.
</P>
<P>
   After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Outright depression in Japan, further rounds of economic and
political turmoil in the rest of Asia, and a global slump to
follow: might this dismal scenario unfold after all?
</P>
<P>
   What, if anything, can be done to prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must _ and can _ act decisively to revive its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's plight has not caused the region's ills. But it affects
Asia in two ways. Lack of demand in its economy _ much the region's
biggest _ means that the crippled tigers cannot export their way to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan account for as much as 12 percent of Malaysia's
GDP, and 5-7 percent of GDP in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
Taiwan. In addition, the weak yen reduces the competitive advantage
that the Asian devaluations would otherwise have given the tigers'
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Asia needs both stronger demand in Japan and
a stronger yen. But arranging both is tricky, even supposing that
Japan can summon the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A loose monetary policy is essential if Japan is to spur
domestic demand; a loose monetary policy means, among other things,
a depreciated yen.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma has helped to fuel the recent mood of despair _ and
yet it can be resolved. In itself, the harm that a weak yen does to
Asia is not great. The yen has fallen over the past couple of
months, but it remains much stronger against the other East Asian
currencies than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though South Korea and Taiwan compete head-on with Japan,
other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia,
export quite different goods: their competitiveness in third
markets is not directly affected by the fall in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a cheap yen would be a small price for Asia to pay
for a speedier recovery in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the most resolute pessimists reply that neither a cheap
yen nor anything else will spur the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy has stopped working; the sickness of Japan's banks
makes any macroeconomic approach to the problem, fiscal or
monetary, irrelevant; the country's productive potential, not
merely its ability to mobilize demand, is collapsing. And so the
litany of despair goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad, all right, but nowhere near as bad as this.
Fiscal policy remains both usable and, if used, effective. The
problems in the banking system, once properly acknowledged, can be
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The ``supply side'' of Japan's economy needs further reform, but
it is hysterical to say that, regardless of demand in the economy,
Japan is henceforth condemned to little or no growth. These are
excuses for inaction _ the last thing Japanese politicians need.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose then that Japan does what it should _ spurring demand
with monetary and fiscal policy, cleaning up the banking mess and
vigorously pursuing reform elsewhere in the economy _ will that be
enough to make the world economy a safe place?
</P>
<P>
   No. Risk can be reduced but not eliminated. A devaluation of
China's yuan, for instance, would cause further real harm to the
region's other economies. The Hong Kong dollar's peg would probably
give way, too, leading to another round of competitive devaluations
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, China will continue to resist devaluation: the recent
fall in China's exports is mainly due to weak regional demand, not
an overvalued currency. But China may devalue anyway, and that
would be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is the delicate state of western stock markets,
especially Wall Street. If more bad news from Asia causes equity
prices in the United States and Europe to slide, the scene would be
set for a slowdown spreading far beyond Asia. This remains the
likeliest channel of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   America's exports to Japan account for a tiny 1 percent of its
GDP. All its exports to the whole of Asia amount to a relatively
modest 2.4 percent of GDP. Even if its sales to the region fell by
25 percent, this would reduce growth only by half a point.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the slump in Asia has so far had little effect in
the United States. Also, the faster-than-expected recovery in
continental Europe this year is helping to fill the hole in world
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the problems in Asia, the Fed would almost
certainly have raised America's interest rates by now. Indeed,
there is growing evidence that the American economy is overheating
despite the chilly breeze from across the Pacific: consumer
spending continues to boom, unemployment is at a 30-year low of 4.3
percent, and inflation is starting to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Asia notwithstanding, America needs to raise its interest rates
_ but to do so would hurt Asian debtors and, by drawing more
capital out of Asian markets, worsen the region's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   So here is another monetary-policy dilemma. Again, it is best
resolved by attending first to the needs of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs looser monetary policy, America needs tighter. Moves
in either case would act to weaken the yen _ which is a risk, but
on balance one that is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the mighty fall, mere mortals get scared.
</P>
<P>
   After clinging on desperately for years, Japan has finally
tumbled: output has fallen for two quarters in succession, so its
economy is no longer merely drifting but is officially in
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The news provoked another wave of worldwide economic alarm, as
the yen sank at the beginning of the week to an eight-year low.
Once the global exemplar, Japan's failing economy has come to be
seen as a potent risk to its neighbors and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Outright depression in Japan, further rounds of economic and
political turmoil in the rest of Asia, and a global slump to
follow: might this dismal scenario unfold after all?
</P>
<P>
   What, if anything, can be done to prevent it?
</P>
<P>
   On June 17 the governments of Japan and America made a show of
acting together to fend off the danger. They announced no new
policies, but did back their soothing words with determined
intervention in the foreign-exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
   The yen rallied impressively and global stock markets bounced.
The respite is likely to prove short-lived. Asia's nightmare, and
the West's anxieties about what it means for Europe and America,
are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   A coherent account of what went wrong in Asia, what should have
been done to stop it happening, and what should be done now to
restore stability in the region, is still lacking; for the time
being, damage control and crisis management remain the orders of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the latest events do allow one conclusion to be drawn and
acted upon. Japan must _ and can _ act decisively to revive its
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It has every reason in its own interests to do so, but the fate
of the region also hinges on whether it meets the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of East Asia is in a terrible fix. GDP fell by an
annualized 20 percent or more in South Korea, Malaysia and
Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, and new forecasts
suggest these economies will at best see no growth next year.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayhem continues, Europe and America can exhort, plead
and affect to intervene (in both senses), but for the most part
this is a sideshow. If Asia ever needed, or was entitled to expect,
Japanese leadership, now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's plight has not caused the region's ills. But it affects
Asia in two ways. Lack of demand in its economy _ much the region's
biggest _ means that the crippled tigers cannot export their way to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sales to Japan account for as much as 12 percent of Malaysia's
GDP, and 5-7 percent of GDP in Indonesia, Thailand, South Korea and
Taiwan. In addition, the weak yen reduces the competitive advantage
that the Asian devaluations would otherwise have given the tigers'
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Asia needs both stronger demand in Japan and
a stronger yen. But arranging both is tricky, even supposing that
Japan can summon the will to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A loose monetary policy is essential if Japan is to spur
domestic demand; a loose monetary policy means, among other things,
a depreciated yen.
</P>
<P>
   This dilemma has helped to fuel the recent mood of despair _ and
yet it can be resolved. In itself, the harm that a weak yen does to
Asia is not great. The yen has fallen over the past couple of
months, but it remains much stronger against the other East Asian
currencies than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though South Korea and Taiwan compete head-on with Japan,
other Asian countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia,
export quite different goods: their competitiveness in third
markets is not directly affected by the fall in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a cheap yen would be a small price for Asia to pay
for a speedier recovery in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   To this, the most resolute pessimists reply that neither a cheap
yen nor anything else will spur the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal policy has stopped working; the sickness of Japan's banks
makes any macroeconomic approach to the problem, fiscal or
monetary, irrelevant; the country's productive potential, not
merely its ability to mobilize demand, is collapsing. And so the
litany of despair goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Things are bad, all right, but nowhere near as bad as this.
Fiscal policy remains both usable and, if used, effective. The
problems in the banking system, once properly acknowledged, can be
dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   The ``supply side'' of Japan's economy needs further reform, but
it is hysterical to say that, regardless of demand in the economy,
Japan is henceforth condemned to little or no growth. These are
excuses for inaction _ the last thing Japanese politicians need.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose then that Japan does what it should _ spurring demand
with monetary and fiscal policy, cleaning up the banking mess and
vigorously pursuing reform elsewhere in the economy _ will that be
enough to make the world economy a safe place?
</P>
<P>
   No. Risk can be reduced but not eliminated. A devaluation of
China's yuan, for instance, would cause further real harm to the
region's other economies. The Hong Kong dollar's peg would probably
give way, too, leading to another round of competitive devaluations
across the region.
</P>
<P>
   With luck, China will continue to resist devaluation: the recent
fall in China's exports is mainly due to weak regional demand, not
an overvalued currency. But China may devalue anyway, and that
would be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk is the delicate state of western stock markets,
especially Wall Street. If more bad news from Asia causes equity
prices in the United States and Europe to slide, the scene would be
set for a slowdown spreading far beyond Asia. This remains the
likeliest channel of contagion.
</P>
<P>
   America's exports to Japan account for a tiny 1 percent of its
GDP. All its exports to the whole of Asia amount to a relatively
modest 2.4 percent of GDP. Even if its sales to the region fell by
25 percent, this would reduce growth only by half a point.
</P>
<P>
   This is why the slump in Asia has so far had little effect in
the United States. Also, the faster-than-expected recovery in
continental Europe this year is helping to fill the hole in world
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the problems in Asia, the Fed would almost
certainly have raised America's interest rates by now. Indeed,
there is growing evidence that the American economy is overheating
despite the chilly breeze from across the Pacific: consumer
spending continues to boom, unemployment is at a 30-year low of 4.3
percent, and inflation is starting to creep up.
</P>
<P>
   Asia notwithstanding, America needs to raise its interest rates
_ but to do so would hurt Asian debtors and, by drawing more
capital out of Asian markets, worsen the region's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   So here is another monetary-policy dilemma. Again, it is best
resolved by attending first to the needs of the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan needs looser monetary policy, America needs tighter. Moves
in either case would act to weaken the yen _ which is a risk, but
on balance one that is worth taking.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Asia's interests are better served by stronger demand in
Japan than by a policy to defend the yen, so they are better served
by economic stability in the United States than by a concern to
keep American interest rates low.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation in America continues to rise, the Fed will have to
raise rates abruptly, and by more than if it acts now. That would
deal Asia a worse blow.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Japan faced pressure from the United States to
keep its interest rates down. America was worried about the
tumbling dollar and slow growth. Japan obliged, despite signs that
its economy was overheating and a financial bubble was developing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's current mess has much to do with that mistake. It is a
lesson worth pondering. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
</P>
<P>
   Some are much worse off: unemployment has more than doubled
since 1990 and personal bankruptcies have increased fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   While other states bicker over how to spend their growing budget
surpluses, Hawaii may face a $140 million deficit by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha State thinks of itself as on Asia's doorstep. These
days, that is no advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The property was unloaded by a Japanese bank in 1993 for $55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiians sometimes feel they cannot win. ``We don't control
the forces on the outside. We're just a little dot on the
Pacific,'' says Hawaii's governor, Ben Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
   True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
</P>
<P>
   Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the collective-bargaining agreement gives the
public-workers' union virtual veto power over any government
decision that changes ``conditions of work,'' even if no union jobs
are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
</P>
<P>
   And things have got worse. Last year, the Hawaii Supreme Court
essentially ruled privatization unconstitutional by finding that
the state's Civil-Service Act forbids moving to the private sector
any jobs that have ``traditionally and historically'' been
performed by public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets
from Asia. A longer runway would bring more tourists, and would
also help business.

   The floundering economy sets the stage for a political showdown.
Hawaii is a Democratic bastion; the state has not had a Republican
governor since 1962. That may change in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano is being challenged by Linda Lingle, the mayor of Maui.
Lingle is not exactly what a political consultant would prescribe:
she is a white Jewish Republican, born in St. Louis. But she has
gained notice on Maui for getting things done and for drawing
business people into the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Her finance director, Travis Thompson, is a former Boeing
employee who thought he was retiring to Maui. Lingle points out
that, while the rest of the state struggles to grow, Maui has added
jobs in five of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Can she win? Lingle has been twice reelected as mayor, even
though registered Democrats in Maui County outnumber Republicans by
about 30 to one.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful union leaders remain staunch Democrats; the rank
and file are not so sure. A recent poll put Lingle solidly ahead of
Cayetano, 49 percent to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The better question is whether she can really change things if
she does win. For all the angst over the economy, there is
tremendous grass-roots resistance to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Cayetano and legislative leaders convened an Economic
Revitalization Task Force made up of government officials, business
leaders and organized labor. Months later, the group returned with
proposals for reducing the cost of doing business, streamlining the
regulatory process, boosting tourism and improving the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But even with organized labour on board, the package could not
be sold to legislators, some of whom had branded the task-force
members as ``avaricious jackals,''
</P>
<P>
   Some changes were made, including a big cut in the personal
income tax, but much of the package was torn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a legislature that was pounded on for a year to do
something, and they did diddly,'' says Paul Baldwin, a prominent
Maui rancher. Baldwin is one of five investors who have built a
high-tech research park on Maui in hopes of luring
information-technology firms to the state. &QL;

   The Hawaiian economy has not fallen off the cliff. But it has,
after climbing for decades, reached a long plateau. The state grew
at an average rate of 4.4 percent between 1959 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not growing when you're used to it is really painful,'' says
an official at the Bank of Hawaii. Yet plainly not painful enough
to jolt Hawaii out of its love of the status quo. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ As America basks in what may soon become the longest
economic expansion in its history, one state continues to struggle
with economic adversity. It is, curiously, the state that most
Americans naturally associate with luxurious good times and
unclouded skies: Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian economy has been stagnant for most of the decade.
It has averaged only 0.5 percent growth per year since 1990; the
Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In an opinion poll last month, 34 percent of those asked said
they were worse off financially than a year ago, compared with only
15 percent who felt better off.
</P>
<P>
   Some are much worse off: unemployment has more than doubled
since 1990 and personal bankruptcies have increased fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   While other states bicker over how to spend their growing budget
surpluses, Hawaii may face a $140 million deficit by June next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha State thinks of itself as on Asia's doorstep. These
days, that is no advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese tourists, who account for more than a third of all
Hawaii's tourism, are still coming in record numbers, but they are
spending less and going home sooner. Their money, they find, does
not go far; the yen has depreciated 40 percent against the dollar
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans, eager to spend some of their stock market
gains on a Hawaiian vacation, have taken up part of the slack. But
that is not much help. The Japanese, who take more presents home,
spend on average twice as much a day as Americans, despite their
recent belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiian islands are also feeling the hangover from the
party they threw in the late 1980s, mostly with Japanese money.
Japanese investors ploughed money into Hawaiian property, sending
prices to dizzying levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, on the big island of Hawaii, is a
typical bubble development. The 1,200-room hotel was built in 1988
by a group of Japanese investors for an estimated $360 million.
Guests are ferried to their rooms by water taxi; employees scurry
about in underground tunnels. You can pay to swim with live
dolphins in a 2 million-gallon lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   The property was unloaded by a Japanese bank in 1993 for $55
million.
</P>
<P>
   Then there has been bad luck. Hurricane Iniki leveled the island
of Kauai in 1992, causing nearly $2 billion-worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the state as a whole, eight sugar-cane plantations have
closed in the past decade, in part because Asia can grow the crop
more cheaply, but also because Americans are using more
high-fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaiians sometimes feel they cannot win. ``We don't control
the forces on the outside. We're just a little dot on the
Pacific,'' says Hawaii's governor, Ben Cayetano.
</P>
<P>
   True, but this is an expensive, highly-taxed, highly-regulated
little dot on the Pacific, and Hawaii cannot blame all its troubles
on Asia; it is also a lousy place to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the cost of living roughly a third higher than the
American urban average, but government is far more centralized than
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, for example, is the only state with one unified school
district operated at the state level. (Not surprisingly, the
schools get poor marks.)
</P>
<P>
   Only Michigan and New York have a higher proportion of unionized
workers. The public-sector unions are particularly powerful. The
result is that Hawaii is 20 years behind other cities and states in
wringing productivity gains out of its public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Each new public employee can count on 21 days of paid holiday,
14 public holidays on which he gets paid, and 21 days of paid sick
leave. Should that prove too stressful, he must be caught drinking
on the job four times in a two-year period before being asked to
resign; he is not sacked.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the collective-bargaining agreement gives the
public-workers' union virtual veto power over any government
decision that changes ``conditions of work,'' even if no union jobs
are lost.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that public managers can spend years trying to
accomplish something as trivial as changing the route of a garbage
truck.
</P>
<P>
   And things have got worse. Last year, the Hawaii Supreme Court
essentially ruled privatization unconstitutional by finding that
the state's Civil-Service Act forbids moving to the private sector
any jobs that have ``traditionally and historically'' been
performed by public workers.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii's powerful environmental groups are skeptical, if not
hostile, to growth and development. On its face, that is a good
thing. Hawaii has some of the most spectacular scenery in the
world, and tourists fly thousands of miles to see its white sand
beaches and stunning volcanoes.
</P>
<P>
   These need to be protected. Yet the people most fiercely opposed
to development often earned their money on the mainland before
retiring to Hawaii; they are not unemployed farm workers, who might
benefit from a few more carefully managed projects.
</P>
<P>
   Take the contentious issue of the airport on Maui. At present,
the airport does not have a runway long enough to take large jets
from Asia. A longer runway would bring more tourists, and would
also help business.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gifford, the president of the Maui Land &AMP; Pineapple
Company, points out that the short runway makes it more difficult
to get fresh pineapples to market.
</P>
<P>

GOSHAWK NOT LIKELY TO BE LISTED AS ENDANGERED

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In a major decision affecting Western forests, the
federal government today is expected to refuse _ for the third time
_ calls by environmentalists to list the Northern goshawk as an
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   That decision would be a blow to environmentalists, but a
blessing for the embattled timber industry in Arizona and New
Mexico, already decimated by two federal injunctions in recent
years aimed at protecting the Mexican spotted owl and other
creatures that live in old-growth forests.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Clark, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is
expected to announce the decision today based on a recent review
conducted by the agency's regional office in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   That review was done, in part, by Richard Reynolds, a researcher
for the U.S. Forest Service who has advocated against placing the
goshawk on the federal Endangered Species List.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really outrageous is that logging on the national
forests is what's driving the goshawk extinct. The fact that they
put the Forest Service in charge . . . when it's the Forest Service
that (approves) logging the trees, shows you how corrupt this whole
process has become,'' said Kieran Suckling, executive director of
the Southwest Center for Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Tenney Jr., vice president of Precision Pine and Timber
Co., one of the state's few remaining logging firms, said he would
welcome a decision not to list the goshawk.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my view, the Forest Service has put in place guidelines
to protect the goshawk, and they are working,'' said Tenney, who
served on the committee that helped develop those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   While it does not explicitly recommend against listing the
goshawk, the new goshawk review by the Fish and Wildlife Service
concludes that current protections appear adequate and there should
be enough habitat for the goshawk to avoid extinction.
</P>
<P>
   In a critique of that review, Suckling charged that Reynolds'
involvement was ``a profound violation'' of scientific review
policies since Reynolds is the chief author of goshawk management
policies currently used by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Reynolds has conducted much good research on northern
goshawks, and is certainly an expert in the field,'' Suckling said,
``he also has a conflict of interest, which makes his presence on
the team inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who has focused his work for more than seven years on
the forest north of the Grand Canyon, did not return calls to his
office.
</P>
<P>
   However, in an interview last year, he said he did not believe
listing the goshawk was warranted, despite findings in his research
that goshawk numbers are in decline.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said he found that intensive, almost clear-cut logging
during the 1980s of the forests north of the Grand Canyon wiped out
habitat for goshawks and their prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned. (But) if you were to ask me, `Do you recommend
or do you not recommend that the species be listed,' I would not
recommend it at this time,'' Reynolds said last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to Clark, Suckling called the wildlife
agency's goshawk report ``deeply flawed,'' a ``violation of the
Endangered Species Act'' and ``a recipe for litigation'' for
failing to include the best science available.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Knudsen, biology supervisor for the Portland office, said
he didn't know whether the goshawk would be listed as an endangered
species, and declined to answer any additional questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suckling's group first petitioned the Fish and Wildlife Service
in 1991 to list the goshawk _ a bird of prey with short wings and a
broad tail. &QL; 
made for intricate maneuvering through forests.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service denied the request in 1992 and
1996, but both times was overruled by senior Judge Richard Bilby of
the U.S. District Court in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling last year, Bilby chastised the Fish and Wildlife
Service decisions as ``arbitrary, capricious and unlawful'' and
``an abuse of (Fish and Wildlife's) discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered Fish and Wildlife to conduct a third review of
the goshawk, which he said ``may be endangered'' based on previous
opinions by Fish and Wildlife's Phoenix research office and a
consultant to the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Fish and Wildlife Service's) actions have only served to
lengthen the amount of time until goshawks may be listed,'' Bilby
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released this month, Martin Taylor, an ecologist and
assistant professor of agriculture at the University of Arizona,
said goshawks in the West meet ``the best available criteria for
endangered species'' and ``are at risk from loss of habitat,
primarily from logging on federal lands.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor criticized the Forest Service guidelines, saying that,
since they took effect in 1992, ``goshawk populations have declined
sharply in the south and central West.'' &QL;

   JASPER, TEXAS _ At dusk on Friday night, at the end of a
difficult week in the east Texas town of Jasper, 80 or so boys were
playing basketball in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Two games were in progress, one at each net. Boys rose up,
caught air, dunked baskets. Cars were drawn up close to the court,
doors open, pumping out a heavy urban beat into the sultry air.
Every player was black, all the attendant girlfriends were black,
all the hangers-on were black. There was not a white in sight,
apart from this correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Did white kids come down and play sometimes? ``Who you kidding!
They wouldn't be seen with us.'' So it was just black kids all the
time? Several players nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, fool,'' said another player, striding over and slapping
his bare chest, ``What you think, that everything's all right 'cos
the old folk says so? Ain't all right man, we apart, we always been
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene, and the conversation, would not be unusual in
inner-city America. In a town of 8,000 people, it gives pause for
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper is a quiet, pretty place, with forests and lakes that
look more like Finland than Texas. Down one country road you pass a
creek, a meadow dappled in sunshine, then you go on into dense
emerald forest.
</P>
<P>
   This spot is where the last sinews on James Byrd's neck tore
loose and his head _ the face already shredded on the tarmac _
bounced off into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   The murder by three white men of Byrd, a happy-go-lucky black
man known in Jasper for singing songs and hitching rides, has
reminded Jasper _ and the rest of America _ that relations between
the races are as vexed as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Texas, which breaks down along Anglo-Latino
lines, east Texas is almost wholly black-and-white. This is
particularly true of Jasper, which is 55 percent white and 42
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction of the national media, as the story
broke, was to present east Texas as a white-trash outpost whose
public offices are occupied by closet bigots. In fact, as the
journalists soon discovered, Jasper has a black mayor and a black
school principal.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Black Panthers, who sallied into town for a shameless
publicity session, praised the white sheriff, Billy Rowles, for his
efficient handling of the case. Byrd's family offered unconditional
forgiveness to his white killers.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the week, militant blacks _ in town from distant
parts to preach their particular form of racial separatism _ were
shouted down not by whites but by blacks, who said they abhorred
violence and vengeance. On the surface, outrage and sorrow brought
Jasper together.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk were adamant that this awful crime did not
represent them. This was true. What represents the town, and makes
it so typical, is something much more subtle: a thousand small
prejudices and slights that blacks in east Texas feel, but whites
rarely notice.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers blacks in Jasper that the bank-tellers are almost all
white, and that they rarely see a black waitress in the more
expensive local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A group of black maids at a local hotel (speaking anonymously
for fear of managerial retribution) were particularly candid. They
felt humiliated, they said, when security people followed them
around the aisles in the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered why no blacks were ``good enough'' to work as
hotel receptionists. None of them thought blacks had a fair deal in
the town. ``Those signs may have gone,'' said one of the maids,
visibly surprised at her own outspokenness, ``but to me they're
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger blacks were particularly unhappy with Jasper's black
leaders, who, they said, were too deferential to whites. It had
taken the death of Byrd, they claimed, to wake up the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
</P>
<P>
   The black view often seemed to be that race relations were fine,
so long as blacks stayed in their place and did not get ``uppity.''
This meant, of course, that they were not as fine as all that.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Byrd's funeral showed the unstated segregation. Of
the 1,000 or so people who attended the service, fewer than 50 were
white.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was laid out in a black funeral home, eulogized in a black
church, and buried in the back part of the town cemetery, where
blacks have always been buried, out of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they tell you,'' one of the hotel maids had said
unhappily, ``they was going to bury him in the back?''
</P>
<P>
   White supremacy may be marginalized, but it is still menacing.

   JASPER, TEXAS _ At dusk on Friday night, at the end of a
difficult week in the east Texas town of Jasper, 80 or so boys were
playing basketball in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Two games were in progress, one at each net. Boys rose up,
caught air, dunked baskets. Cars were drawn up close to the court,
doors open, pumping out a heavy urban beat into the sultry air.
Every player was black, all the attendant girlfriends were black,
all the hangers-on were black. There was not a white in sight,
apart from this correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Did white kids come down and play sometimes? ``Who you kidding!
They wouldn't be seen with us.'' So it was just black kids all the
time? Several players nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, fool,'' said another player, striding over and slapping
his bare chest, ``What you think, that everything's all right 'cos
the old folk says so? Ain't all right man, we apart, we always been
apart.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene, and the conversation, would not be unusual in
inner-city America. In a town of 8,000 people, it gives pause for
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper is a quiet, pretty place, with forests and lakes that
look more like Finland than Texas. Down one country road you pass a
creek, a meadow dappled in sunshine, then you go on into dense
emerald forest.
</P>
<P>
   This spot is where the last sinews on James Byrd's neck tore
loose and his head _ the face already shredded on the tarmac _
bounced off into a ditch.
</P>
<P>
   The murder by three white men of Byrd, a happy-go-lucky black
man known in Jasper for singing songs and hitching rides, has
reminded Jasper _ and the rest of America _ that relations between
the races are as vexed as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the rest of Texas, which breaks down along Anglo-Latino
lines, east Texas is almost wholly black-and-white. This is
particularly true of Jasper, which is 55 percent white and 42
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The knee-jerk reaction of the national media, as the story
broke, was to present east Texas as a white-trash outpost whose
public offices are occupied by closet bigots. In fact, as the
journalists soon discovered, Jasper has a black mayor and a black
school principal.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Black Panthers, who sallied into town for a shameless
publicity session, praised the white sheriff, Billy Rowles, for his
efficient handling of the case. Byrd's family offered unconditional
forgiveness to his white killers.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the week, militant blacks _ in town from distant
parts to preach their particular form of racial separatism _ were
shouted down not by whites but by blacks, who said they abhorred
violence and vengeance. On the surface, outrage and sorrow brought
Jasper together.
</P>
<P>
   The townsfolk were adamant that this awful crime did not
represent them. This was true. What represents the town, and makes
it so typical, is something much more subtle: a thousand small
prejudices and slights that blacks in east Texas feel, but whites
rarely notice.
</P>
<P>
   It bothers blacks in Jasper that the bank-tellers are almost all
white, and that they rarely see a black waitress in the more
expensive local restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A group of black maids at a local hotel (speaking anonymously
for fear of managerial retribution) were particularly candid. They
felt humiliated, they said, when security people followed them
around the aisles in the Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   They wondered why no blacks were ``good enough'' to work as
hotel receptionists. None of them thought blacks had a fair deal in
the town. ``Those signs may have gone,'' said one of the maids,
visibly surprised at her own outspokenness, ``but to me they're
still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger blacks were particularly unhappy with Jasper's black
leaders, who, they said, were too deferential to whites. It had
taken the death of Byrd, they claimed, to wake up the local chapter
of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
(NAACP).
</P>
<P>
   The black view often seemed to be that race relations were fine,
so long as blacks stayed in their place and did not get ``uppity.''
This meant, of course, that they were not as fine as all that.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Byrd's funeral showed the unstated segregation. Of
the 1,000 or so people who attended the service, fewer than 50 were
white.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd was laid out in a black funeral home, eulogized in a black
church, and buried in the back part of the town cemetery, where
blacks have always been buried, out of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did they tell you,'' one of the hotel maids had said
unhappily, ``they was going to bury him in the back?''
</P>
<P>
   White supremacy may be marginalized, but it is still menacing.
The sheriff's claim that there are no Ku Klux Klansmen in Jasper
appears to be false. A local Klan leader insists that his group has
a strong presence there.
</P>
<P>
   And already the town is bracing itself for a Klan march on June
27, with its potential for a bloody showdown between white bigots
and Black Panther hotheads.
</P>

<P>
   JERICHO _ Whether or not the Israelis do what they are supposed
to do under the Oslo agreements, they continue to prepare for a
final settlement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of this is the quiet encouragement of Palestinian
migration from the Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Netanyahu and his government see the Jordan River as
Israel's permanent eastern border. A map which the prime minister
says will ``guide'' the negotiations on a final settlement would
reportedly annex to Israel a 20-kilometer (12-mile) swathe of land
along the river, excluding Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   Some 35,000 Palestinians live or work on the West Bank side of
the Jordan Valley. Covering an area of 700,000 dunums (175,000
hectares), the valley is one of the West Bank's most fertile
regions, containing 60 percent of the Palestinians' horticultural
land.
</P>
<P>
   With both water and a hot climate, it is ``a natural
greenhouse,'' says the Palestinian Authority's farm minister, Abdel
Jawad Salah. The locals see it as the agricultural basin of any
future Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1967 and 1993, Israel confiscated 100,000 dunums of the
Jordan Valley as ``closed security zones,'' making the land
off-limits to Palestinian farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It also set up some 20 Jewish settlements (with fewer than 3,000
settlers) on prime farming land.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians were left with about 95,000 dunums of
cultivated and irrigated land and a host of ``security''
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   After the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993, the
Palestinians hoped they might be able to add to the developed area.
But the restrictions and confiscations continue.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah cites the case of an agricultural research station
in the valley, which helped farmers with crop research and
technology; Israel has refused to transfer the station to the
Palestinian Authority by declaring its 300 dunums to be one of
those closed security zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have also, in the past three years, made security
zones of many of the hills in the Jordan Valley. These hills are
traditionally used as grazing pastures by Bedouin shepherds, who
are now being forced to abandon some of their goats and sheep.
</P>
<P>
   Jawad Salah estimates that the shepherds may have lost 50,000
animals.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the Israeli army appears to be turning the temporary
territorial divisions that exist in the West Bank under the Oslo
agreement into permanent facts.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 of the Palestinians who work on the farms in the
valley are seasonal laborers who live in villages near Nablus.
These are in Area B under Oslo's classification, meaning that they
come under Palestinian civilian jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jordan Valley, Jericho apart, is in Area C, under
Israel's exclusive military control. To get from B to C
Palestinians now require a permit from the army, ``exactly as if we
wanted to travel to Tel Aviv,'' says Muhammad Omar Jahalin, the
mayor of Jiflik, a Bedouin village in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   The permits are granted on a daily basis _ but the laborers work
on the farms for the whole winter.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of these measures is the steady migration of
Palestinians westwards from the valley to urban areas such as East
Jerusalem and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   For Jahalin, the aim is clear: ``Israel wants to empty the
Jordan Valley of its Palestinian inhabitants.''
</P>
<P>
   To resist such a future, the Palestinian Authority has earmarked
the valley as a ``priority'' area and is working with international
agencies to resuscitate farming. But real development will come
only with Palestinian sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, admits
Jawad Salah.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely this eventuality that Netanyahu is preparing
against. &QL;

FRIENDS, FAMILY PAY TRIBUTE TO LINDA MCCARTNEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Linda McCartney died of breast cancer in Tucson,
Ariz., on April 17, a spokesman for Sir Paul McCartney, her
husband, asked that the family be allowed to grieve privately. For
six weeks, that was what the McCartneys did, mostly at the family
farm in West Sussex, England.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday evening, Sir Paul, his four children and 400 invited
friends and relatives gathered at Riverside Church to pay tribute
to Ms. McCartney and celebrate her achievements as a campaigner for
animal rights and vegetarianism, and as a photographer, mother and
wife. It was the second such gathering this month. The first was in
London on June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Although England was her home during her 29-year marriage to Sir
Paul, her roots were in New York. She grew up in Scarsdale, and
before marrying she was a prominent rock photographer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ringo Starr nor George Harrison was expected to attend
the New York service, as they did in London, and neither was
spotted, nor was Yoko Ono, John Lennon's widow. Sir Paul and the
children, Heather, Mary, Stella and James, arrived at 8:20, 10
minutes before the memorial was to begin. But apart from the
McCartneys, Diane Sawyer, Mike Nichols and Ralph Lauren, few
celebrities were seen entering the church.
</P>
<P>
   Like the London memorial, the tribute Monday was a private
affair, with a guest list of around 400, said Joe Dera, Sir Paul's
spokesman. The church can hold 1,800. Reporters were not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the McCartneys, many of whom were nearly as fond of Ms.
McCartney as of her husband, were also asked to wait outside the
church. About 300 were on hand, some from as far away as Michigan
and California. A few brought posters that said ``Forever in Our
Hearts'' or ``Go Veggie for Linda.'' Others held candles.
</P>
<P>
   For the occasion, several large portraits of Ms. McCartney, 56
when she died, were arrayed across the nave, which was festooned
with flowers, said the Rev. Robert Gentile, an official at the
church.
</P>
<P>
   The program for the memorial, provided by Dera, listed the
singers Chrissie Hynde and Neil Young among the speakers. Ms.
Hynde, like Ms. McCartney, has been a vocal proponent of
vegetarianism and opponent of using animals for food or scientific
testing. Other speakers included the 1960s model Twiggy, as well as
Ms. McCartney's brother, John Eastman, and her two sisters, Laural
Malcolm and Louise Weed. Sir Paul was scheduled to offer his own
comments at the end of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Also part of the service was a brief appearance by a brown and
white dappled appaloosa, Ms. McCartney's favorite riding horse.
</P>
<P>
   The program included plenty of music. The service began with a
lone bagpipe player performing ``Mull of Kintyre,'' a song Sir Paul
wrote in the early 1970s. The Loma Mar String Quartet played
several of the songs Sir Paul wrote for his wife, including ``The
Lovely Linda,'' ``Somedays,'' ``Maybe I'm Amazed,'' ``Calico
Skies'' and ``My Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boys Choir of Harlem sang Sir Paul's song ``Blackbird'' and
the gospel hymn ``His Eye Is on the Sparrow.'' The choir and the
congregation were scheduled to join in versions of the hymn ``All
Things Bright and Beautiful'' and the Beatles song ``Let It Be.''

HISPANIC LEADER VOWS TO DEFACE ILLEGAL-IMMIGRATION SIGN AT BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The sweltering desert terrain surrounding the
Arizona-California border might get even hotter Saturday during a
showdown over a billboard that offers this greeting to Arizona
motorists: ``Welcome to California, the illegal immigration state.
Don't let this happen to your state.''
</P>
<P>
   The billboard, near Blythe, Calif., west of the state line on
Interstate 10, is sponsored by a group called the California
Coalition for Immigration Reform.
</P>
<P>
   The message has outraged a prominent veteran of the Hispanic
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This billboard is a public nuisance and an affront to Mexican
people,'' said attorney Mario Obledo from his law offices in
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo, who considers the billboard ``racist and divisive,'' has
vowed to deface or destroy it Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Obledo remains one the nation's most revered Hispanic
political figures. A former president of the League of Latin
American Citizens and 1982 candidate for California governor,
Obledo is no stranger to political causes.
</P>
<P>
   And the billboard's message comes at a time when portions of
California's Hispanic population feel victimized by ballot
initiatives in three successive elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, California voters approved Proposition 187, which
denied education, health benefits and social services to illegal
immigrants. In 1996, voters approved Proposition 209, which
eliminated state-sponsored racial preferences. Earlier this month,
they approved Proposition 227, which eliminates bilingual education
for California students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics in California are a people under assault,'' said
Obledo, now president of the California Coalition of Hispanic
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington Beach-based California Coalition for Immigration
Reform could not be reached for comment. An
answering-machine &UR; message at the group's headquarters describes the
billboard as the ``next step in halting the takeover of
(California) by illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   A group representative has said its members are prepared to meet
Obledo and his supporters at the state line to protect the
billboard.
</P>
<P>
   That has law enforcement officials in California bracing for a
possible physical confrontation between the two groups, something
that could be more likely if tempers flare amid weekend
temperatures that could reach 110 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the billboard's message is the assumption that
illegal immigration has harmed California and will do the same to
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo disagreed, citing California and Texas as examples of
states that absorb high numbers of immigrants and still thrive
economically.

JUDGE ALLOWS HOFFA TO REMAIN IN RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge Monday upheld a federal monitor's decision in
April not to disqualify James Hoffa from running for the teamsters'
presidency, although the judge criticized some of Hoffa's behavior
in the 1996 election as ``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal monitor, Michael Cherkasky, chose not to disqualify
Hoffa even though he found Hoffa was responsible for failing to
report almost $40,000 in campaign contributions accurately and had
not testified truthfully about receiving a $1,000 donation from a
former president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky had fined Hoffa $16,767, or 10 percent of the $167,675
in free services that Cherkasky said Hoffa had received from his
communications director. But the judge, David Edelstein of U.S.
District Court in Manhattan, ordered Hoffa to pay a fine equal to
the whole $167,675.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein called Hoffa's concealment of the contribution and his
failure to report other donations accurately ``worrisome and
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lyle, a Hoffa spokesman, said he could not comment upon
Edelstein's decision because he had not seen it. Hoffa has denied
that he lied to the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Carey's 1996 victory over Hoffa for the union presidency was
overturned by federal monitors who ordered a new election. It is
scheduled for this summer.

`ONE CHINA' POLICY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for updating, rewriting throughout0 CLINTON IS PRESSED ON (sw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's foreign minister on Tuesday called on
President Clinton to make a public statement during his state visit
this week restating American opposition to any move by Taiwan
toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference on Tuesday morning the minister, Tang
Jiaxuan, also called on the United States to halt sales of advanced
weapons like fighter planes and defensive missiles to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States should take concrete action to match the
commitments it has made on Taiwan with deeds,'' he said, referring
to the sale of advanced arms.
</P>
<P>
   Tang's statements broke no new ground and reflected the
overriding position of Taiwan, considered here as a renegade part
of the Chinese motherland, in Chinese foreign policy. But they did
disclose one of the key unresolved issues between the two countries
for a summit meeting that is expected to stress positive images and
gloss over differences.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington supports a ``one China'' policy and opposes
Taiwan's independence, Taiwan enjoys strong support in the
Congress. It appears extremely unlikely that China will get the
promise it seeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tang gave an upbeat assessment of the coming visit,
which the Chinese government hopes will improve China's image in
America and foster closer economic and political ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the visit to be crowned with a complete success,''
Tang said. ``It will propel China-United States relations into a
new stage of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leaders are well aware, Tang said, of what he called
the ``discord and noises'' in the United States coming from critics
of the administration's policy of engaging China. But he said: ``I
am convinced this does not represent the desire and conscience of
the vast majority of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Tang also responded to the attacks on Clinton's willingness to
be greeted in Tiananmen Square, where the military crushed student
demonstrations in 1989. He said that the spot _ a plaza on the edge
of the square in front of the Great Hall of the People _ was the
routine site for greeting foreign heads of state and that if
President Jiang were not to meet Clinton there, it would be ``a
lack of courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister also brushed aside calls by some democracy
advocates in China for Clinton to meet with their representatives.
The so-called dissidents, Tang said, ``usually are people who have
violated the criminal law of China.'' He noted that Clinton has
already indicated he will not seek a meeting with any political
dissidents during this visit.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues to be discussed, a senior Chinese trade official
said on Monday that China hoped to make progress toward joining the
World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast with earlier hopes that entry could be clinched
by now, the official, Shi Guangsheng, minister for foreign trade
and economic cooperation, said there was no timetable. His reaction
to American statements that China was far from satisfying
requirements for opening its markets to outsiders was mild.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``we will continue to hope for positive and
substantive progress'' toward agreement on entry into the trading
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``China wants to join the WTO because this is necessary for our
own economic reform and opening up,'' Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization sets global trade rules. Its 132 member nations
must reduce barriers to trade and investment, and in turn they are
given better trading conditions in other member countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Beijing the chief American trade negotiator,
Charlene Barshefsky, said it had become clear that Chinese leaders,
preoccupied with domestic economic dangers, were not ready to make
the major changes needed. Besides general tariff levels, American
officials are especially concerned about barriers to agricultural
imports and to foreign involvement in financial, accounting,
tourism and other service industries.
</P>
<P>
   China has portrayed entry into the trade body as a political as
well as an economic goal, and has sometimes lambasted the West for
imposing what China considers unfair requirements. But on Monday
Shi, consistent with a general effort by officials to minimize
conflict, kept his complaints muted. &QL;

ARIZONA FAILING IN TREATMENT OF TROUBLED KIDS, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ For years, people have criticized how the state takes
care of children in Maricopa County who are poor and mentally
troubled.
</P>
<P>
   A report to be released Tuesday shows how bad it can be:
</P>
<P>
   _ A 4-year-old on seven different types of drugs, including one
strong anti-psychotic drug. There's no system in place to determine
if this child is overmedicated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Psychiatrists unwilling to counsel children who have been
sexually abused because they don't think they can help the child
within the system's 90-day deadline. Talking about the abuse _
without resolving anything _ could cause more harm than good, they
believe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents turning custody of their children over to the state
because they feel individuals can't fight the system to get care
for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The state-run system is ``content to provide `poor care' in the
right way rather than `good care' the wrong way,'' the report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In affable _ yet scathing _ tones, the report, conducted by a
panel of state-approved experts, outlines how 61 percent of
children don't get the mental health services they need.
</P>
<P>
   The report confirms what parents, lawyers, judges and others
have said for years, said Anne Ronan, an attorney with the Center
for Disability Law.
</P>
<P>
   The center in 1991 filed a complaint in federal court about
children's care; the state last year agreed to have an independent
review rather go back to court.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office said it would review the report today and
would have a plan to deal with some of the problems in two weeks,
said Francie Noyes, press secretary for Gov. Jane Hull.
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said Hull was disappointed but not surprised by the
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Rhonda Baldwin, assistant director for behavioral health
services, agreed that the report pointed out the state's
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have made a lot of improvements, in the way that we
try to serve more people. . . . If people wish to see this report
as `I told you so,' that's fine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers analyzed computer records for 7,746 Medicaid-eligible
children enrolled in ComCare.
</P>
<P>
   They interviewed more than 100 people involved in the system and
scrutinized how 42 children get care.
</P>
<P>
   While praising individual efforts of some case managers, the
report paints a picture of a system driven by budget concerns
rather than human beings _ even though ComCare, the non-profit
agency responsible for the system _ was taken over by the state
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, half of the 42 children whose cases were
reviewed in depth had their services ended, reduced or changed
substantially _ and in at least half of those cases, there weren't
any clinical reasons for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, reviewers said the state needs to find out why
kids were getting too many medications without any clear-cut
justification.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers also found that there weren't any plans to make sure
children were getting the least amount of medications.
</P>
<P>
   And parents' reports of adverse side effects were ignored, the
report found.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 42 children whose records were looked at in-depth, 71
percent were getting medications.
</P>
<P>
   Ten children were on four or more drugs. Of those, one was
considered low need of services, six were moderate need and three
were high need.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin said the state would consider having the for-profit
company that replaces ComCare develop plans to check on possible
overmedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because a child is on multiple medications is not in
itself a problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the survey found that children were able to get into
the state-run system, but from there, they weren't able to get the
right kind of services _ frequently because staff members weren't
doing the right kind of assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluations were usually done after psychiatrists spent 15 to 30
minutes interviewing a child. Children didn't go through
standardized testing nor did caseworkers go to the children's
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment plans for the children seemed to be copied from a
manual of mental disorders rather than being tailored to their
needs, the review noted.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one child who had extensive developmental
disability didn't get accurately diagnosed as having mental
retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Children with the most complex cases seemed to suffer the most,
reviewers noted.
</P>
<P>
   One therapist used ``talk therapy'' with a non-verbal child and
another tried using hypothetical situations to draw out a child who
had an IQ of 50. Children with IQs below 67 are considered mentally
retarded.
</P>
<P>
   The system tends to prescribe a lot of medications in these
complex cases, reviewers found.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the system, parents and children found that their needs
were often disregarded. They wouldn't be reminded of appointments.
</P>
<P>
   There was little follow-up between inpatient and outpatient
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   And changes in care would happen often: one child had three
different therapists in eight months, reviewers found.
</P>
<P>
   Parents were excluded from discussions about their children's
care. Their signatures were often added to treatment plans after
they had been discussed, reviewers noted.
</P>
<P>
   And if parents tried to change the plan, they faced a
bureaucratic, hard-to-understand, 20-page appeals process,
reviewers found.
</P>
<P>
   There were no mechanisms in place to see how many people were
denied services or had those services reduced or terminated.
</P>
<P>
   The system's plan for determining and improving the care doesn't
meet national accreditation standards, reviewers found. &QL;

 &HT;    Yanks resilient against Maddux, bullpen
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Greg Maddux slept here Sunday night. It was an
unsound night's sleep. When he awoke Monday morning, Maddux had a
crick in his neck. By late evening, the Braves had themselves one
nagging pain in the neck: Another late-inning loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Once Maddux left after six innings, the Yankees scored three
runs off Dennis Martinez in the seventh. Tim Raines' two-out,
two-run double erased Atlanta's 4-3 lead and helped give New York a
6-4 win before 53,316 at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   That denied Maddux (10-2) a ninth straight victory and his 100th
as a Brave. It also gave the Yankees Round 1in this week's
four-game set and prolonged Martinez's misery in the Bronx. He's
now 0-7 lifetime in Yankee Stadium, 2-19 in his career against the
Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one pitch from getting out of it, but he didn't,'' said
Bobby Cox, who was ejected in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a World Series preview, Maddux might sleep in
another hotel bed come October. When he woke up Monday, his neck
hurt. ``I just got a crick in it,'' said Maddux, who gave up three
runs for the first time in 11 starts, since he last lost April 26
in Colorado. ``Slept on it bad. I thought it would loosen up in
warmups. It didn't. I was aware of it on every pitch, but I could
still pitch. It's not why I gave up the (nine) hits and runs, by
any means.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux attributed that to the Yankees themselves. To the four
straight two-out singles in the third inning that offset Gerald
Williams' two-run double in the top half. To the three one-out hits
to right in the sixth that offset Javy Lopez's RBI single earlier
that inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're smart hitters, man,'' said Maddux. ``They made
adjustments very well. They don't let you get 'em out the same way
twice, don't necessarily look for the same pitch every situation,
or on the same count.''
</P>
<P>
   After Chipper Jones' seventh-inning single gave Atlanta its
third and last lead, Maddux was finished after 87 pitches. ``His
neck was killing him,'' said Cox, who had had Kevin Millwood on
alert as a spot starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Enough's enough,''' said Maddux. ``For the first time
all year, it wasn't any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It was joyless when Martinez _ whom Cox hoped would work two
innings and then Kerry Ligtenberg the ninth _ walked two of the
first three batters he faced. After getting Tino Martinez to pop
up, Martinez threw a 2-2 fastball. Raines drove it far beyond
Andruw Jones to the center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Andruw was playing too shallow,'' Martinez
said. ``But when he hit it, I didn't think that ball would go over
his head. But that was the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I play there all the time,'' Jones said. ``I was playing
perfect, right where I need to play. He just hit that ball perfect
and I had no chance.''

LAKERS COULD MAKE A MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Whatever separates the Los Angeles Lakers
from the Western Conference champion Utah Jazz, don't expect them
to make up the difference overnight. Or at least, not over
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could trade up in the NBA draft, could unload a
couple of out-of-favor former starters and steal headlines away
from the Clippers and their No.1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more likely, the Lakers could simply stick to the
predictable, wait their turn and grab whomever's available at No.26
in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't such a bad thing. They got Vlade Divac at No.26 in
1989 and have seen nice returns on other latter-round pickups, from
A.C. Green at 23rd in 1985 to Elden Campbell at 27th in 1990 and
Derek Fisher at 24th in 1996. Not to mention second-round steal
Nick Van Exel, chosen 37th overall in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The draft is such that there seems to be a gray area in the
late teens to early 30s, where you may be able to pick up a player
that, under normal circumstances, would be drafted (in the top
20),'' general manager Mitch Kupchak said of the '98 draft.
</P>
<P>
   That gray area gives the Lakers two chances to grab at least one
player with a chance to make the team. They pick again five slots
later, at No.31 _ the result of a previous deal that let them swap
second-round picks with Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' third and final selection will come at No.45,
obtained from New Jersey in previous trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we'll be able to get a player, maybe two players,
that make our team,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sting of Utah's 4-0 sweep of the Lakers in the
conference finals, the team that won 61 games last season is on
course to remain largely intact for next season. Management is
standing by coach Del Harris, who has one year left on his
contract, and it so far has not jumped at the dozens of trade
offers made in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the belief remains the Lakers will unload point guard
Nick Van Exel, a disappointment in the playoffs, and perhaps
underachieving Elden Campbell and his $7 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   A deal could be consummated on draft day but more likely _
especially in Campbell's case _ will have to wait until later this
summer, when teams can clear salary-cap room by renouncing rights
to free agents. Teams are also wary of making deals with a lockout
looming and a new collective-bargaining agreement on the way and
possibly changing the cap rules drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some possibilities to move up (in the draft), and it
has to make sense. Obviously, we've run across nothing to date that
makes sense, because we haven't done anything,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   Their shopping list Wednesday is fairly vague and Kupchak is
touting the ``best available talent'' philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could use a point guard to back up Derek Fisher if
Van Exel is dealt, a power forward if Campbell is traded. They
could use an ace perimeter shooter no matter what else transpires.
Otherwise there are no gaping holes, save for possibly replacing
small forward Rick Fox, who might leave the salary- capped-out
Lakers for a long-term contract elsewhere. The Lakers can only
offer Fox $1.2 million for one year, but Kupchak is hopeful Fox
will return.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Lakers are well over the salary cap, they will be
limited this offseason to grabbing free agents who will sign for
the NBA minimum, about $300,000. That means any major improvements
this offseason will have to come via trade _ either before the
lockout that figures to begin next week or after it concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Lakers will concentrate on their current roster.
They are expected to exercise an option on forward Corie Blount.
Subject to the lockout, they will also try to negotiate contract
extensions for Kobe Bryant and Derek Fisher, who are both entering
the final season of their three-year rookie deals.

GIVEN CHANCE FOR SAVE, OWNERS BLOW IT WITH BUD SELIG 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   What a master stroke.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world did the lords of baseball come up with the idea
of Bud Selig as permanent commissioner of baseball?
</P>
<P>
   The choice was as inspired as appointing Dennis Rodman minister
of fruitcake. Or selecting Bobby Ayala the king of ball one.
</P>
<P>
   It's called playing to strength.
</P>
<P>
   Who better than Selig to preserve baseball's status quo?
</P>
<P>
   Selig hasn't actually taken the job yet. But media reports last
week indicated that the deed, despite his denials, is all but done,
awaiting only Selig's disposal of his franchise, the Milwaukee
Brewers. The official announcement might happen at the All-Star
Game, which will allow baseball to distribute a single piece of
confetti to every attendee for the appropriate response.
</P>
<P>
   Selig has made out like he has been resisting this nomination.
But the look on his face is of an Elks Club conventioneer being
lured by a strip-show barker.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the consensus choice among owners for the job since
it opened up the first weekend after the last ice age. He might
well be the only person who would willingly accept collect calls
from the lords of baseball, a group as pleasant and cooperative as
a dryer full of wolverines.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lords know how unmanageable they are. This was how one
of their number, the late Edward Bennett Williams, then-owner of
the Baltimore Orioles, greeted Peter Ueberroth when he took the
commissioner's job in 1984:
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome to the den of the village idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 years since, nothing has happened to invalidate
Williams' description. So no one is better qualified to maintain
this disorder than one of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The lords prefer baseball matters this way. Peter Gammons of the
Boston Globe this week quoted a prominent American League owner
telling Selig some time ago, ``I'm not letting anyone new come into
my business.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect summary for baseball's fundamental attitude toward
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Any competent outsider brought in as commissioner would insist
upon massive reorganization, changes in by-laws, fresh initiatives
in marketing, labor relations and race relations, and institution
of a philosophy of industry stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like Selig to you?
</P>
<P>
   That's why he's the commish.
</P>
<P>
   Despite appearances to the contrary for the average fan, the
lords have no sense of urgency for the big fix. Two reasons: Most
are too busy with their other empires to care, and whatever
operational losses are sustained annually, if any, are more than
recouped at time of sale.
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas Rangers were recently sold for $250 million, more
than twice what Gov. George Bush paid for the franchise in 1989,
you have all you need to know about baseball being an equity
business and not a cash business.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Dodgers for $310 million, which includes their
spring training facility and some L.A. real estate, to Fox was
another example of the value of sports franchises well apart from
any red ink on the annual income statement.
</P>
<P>
   So there is relatively little need for concern, even when, for
example, the game is flirting with debacle in expansionist Florida.
Apart from the well-chronicled hara kiri performed by the Marlins,
Devil Ray officials are wondering whether a mistake was made in
putting a franchise in Tampa. The first-year team's attendance
average of slightly more than 30,000 is sixth in the American
League, despite all the novelty, special promotions and a rich
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to expand, along with the creation of interleague
play, was spawned simply by the desire for immediate money rather
than from a strategic plan that would help the game grow. They were
Band-Aid responses to help repair the damage from what will be
Selig's cross to bear forever: The disastrous 1994 strike.
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner-without-portfolio-or-judgment, he presided over
a mistake that four years have not healed. Attendance, revenues and
ratings have still not recovered to pre-1994 levels, yet baseball
continues to entrust leadership to him.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's lack of ability to do the job has nothing to do with
being a puppet for owners. That's the very definition of the job,
and fans who think he should be somehow an independent guardian are
naive.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's David Stern is a puppet of owners too, as are all
sports commissioners. But Stern has demonstrated repeatedly a
vision for the sport that has been accepted by owners, players and
new fans, and has gone about delivering on the vision.
</P>
<P>
   Despite mistakes and complaints along the way, the NBA is an
unqualified business success because Stern made imperative a
league-wide business commitment to the greater good, and backed it
with riches for all.
</P>
<P>
   While Stern gets his greatest test in the coming weeks as his
labor agreement begins to fall apart, he will not have to dig out
from a two-decade avalanche of selfishness and shortsightedness
that has buried baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With Selig in charge, baseball has given itself a teaspoon to
dig a tunnel.

GOLF COURSE WON'T GET ANY EASIER FOR PGA CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They are West Coast courses ripe with trees on
every hole, tight fairways, several steep inclines, doglegs right
and left, and a well-fertilized rough that can swallow balls
skipping only inches off course.
</P>
<P>
   Both have two par-fives converted to par-fours for championship
play, and both place a premium on shot-making over distance off the
tee.
</P>
<P>
   One is laden with history, the other has history waiting to be
made.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Club Lake Course and Redmond's Sahalee Country Club,
site of this year's PGA Championship Aug. 10-16, have so much in
common that many of the players who completed the U.S. Open here
Sunday, might believe they are in time warp.
</P>
<P>
   If the Open was a preview of things to come at Sahalee, you also
might expect to hear players complaining about course conditions in
Redmond as they have about Olympic, where no players managed to
break par over the 72-hole event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you set Sahalee up like this?'' Fred Couples asked himself
Sunday after finishing the Open 17-over par. ``Yeah. But if they
set it up like this, you will hear people complain because they
don't know a lot about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples, who estimates he has played Sahalee 15 to 20 times
while growing up in Seattle, believes comparisons between the two
courses will immediately be evident once players start making their
way to Redmond for early practice rounds. Despite his score at
Olympic, Couples says he doesn't mind such a tough test of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun,'' he said. ``It's very challenging, but we
should have more tournaments set up like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the two courses are set up in similar fashion, they have
subtle differences.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee has numerous fairway bunkers, Olympic one. Sahalee has
ponds and water that come into play on five holes; Olympic has no
water hazards on the course, despite its location next to Lake
Merced.
</P>
<P>
   The other big difference is the size of the greens. Olympic's
are postage-stamp size with pin placements that can be downright
evil and surfaces that, when dry, make it nearly impossible to put
the brakes on a shot. Sahalee's greens are quite a bit bigger with
more tiers and undulations, which means that statistics for hitting
greens in regulation should be quite high when compared to Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this course had bigger greens, it wouldn't be as tough,''
Couples said. ``But that's the beauty of it. ... And they were
fairly soft for the U.S. Open. If not, it would have been
borderline ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious comparison between the two courses lies in the
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic's cyprus, pine and eucalyptus trees stand like ancient
sentinels along the fairways, casting stick-figure shadows across
the course without impeding the flight of balls unless shots stray
right or left.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee, on the other hand, has trees that are so dense in
places that rain doesn't even penetrate, and designer Ted Robinson
strategically left trees jutting into the fairways on several key
holes.
</P>
<P>
   The par-5 11th, for example, has a couple of trees in the
fairway ready to knock back any attempt to reach the green in two
strokes for an eagle. It is a hole that some of the pros are
already complaining about _ two months before the PGA even gets
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Like Olympic, Sahalee will take the driver out of the hands of
the long hitters, such as Couples, Davis Love III, John Daly and
Tiger Woods. In fact, players just might keep their drivers in the
bag for all but two or three holes on the entire course.
</P>
<P>
   Sahalee is quite a bit more narrow than Olympic, with just 21
acres of fairway to the Lake Course's 60 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freddy, Davis and Tiger aren't going to hit driver more then
two or three times here,'' Loren Roberts said before the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who played Sahalee last summer after playing in the
Fred Couples Invitational at Inglewood, added: ``I think it will be
the same thing up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Acton, Sahalee's former head pro, knows the two courses
will draw comparisons by the very fact that they are on the West
Coast. Never before has the West Coast hosted two of golf's four
major events in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   And while Olympic has hosted three U.S. Opens and numerous other
events in its 61-year-old history, Sahalee has only hosted one PGA
Senior Tour event, a handful of amateur events and local or
regional tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Players expected Olympic to be tough, but Sahalee has yet to
build such tradition in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of the coin is, how do you get tradition?''
Acton asks. ``You get tradition by having hosted several major
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at some point, you will have to host your first. I'm
sorry, but that's how you do it, and (Olympic) has hosted its first
at some point in time, and so has Pebble Beach and every other one
that is considered a great golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   If comparisons are any measurement, then Sahalee should be up to
the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sahalee is going to be kind of a controversial golf course,''
Acton said. ``It's a course that takes the driver out of (a
player's) hands a lot of the time. It's very tight and there's a
lot of places where there's a tree in the way. So it's a lot
different from what they are used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the players are going to love it, and a lot of the
players are going to hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Olympic.

   BEIJING _ In preparing to receive Bill Clinton, Chinese
authorities have outmaneuvered the White House on several points.
Will the Chinese similarly have the upper hand when the critical
issues of Tiananmen, Taiwan and trade are discussed?
</P>
<P>
   American, Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanese political observers
suggest that the White House has acquiesced because no one in the
administration's top level has had much experience in negotiating
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Said a Chinese scholar: ``The Clinton people are not aware of
how the Chinese will manipulate this visit. They don't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sighed an American official with long experience in Asia:
``Clinton's going to kowtow all over Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   American business executives in Beijing, initially eager to take
part in the visit, say they are backing away now because they fear
that the president will agree to a deal that will come under
critical scrutiny in Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An assessment of traps awaiting Clinton in China can be pieced
together from officials and private analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, for whom symbolism is all-important, persuaded
Clinton to move his trip forward from November to June, the
anniversary month of the Tiananmen episode in which the Chinese
army killed uncounted hundreds of democratic activists in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan to have Clinton's appearance in Tiananmen
Square help to bring symbolic closure to that sorry chapter in
China's history.
</P>
<P>
   At first the White House said he could not go before the
November midterm elections. Then political heat got turned up by
potential scandals, and White House officials arranged to get him
out of Washington in March to Africa, in April to Latin America, in
May to Europe, and now in June to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese demanded that the president come directly from
Washington to China and return home without stopping in Japan,
which is supposedly the key ally of the United States in Asia. Most
U.S. presidents have stopped in Tokyo on visits to Asia for the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials said the president had planned to stop over in
Tokyo on this trip. The Chinese insisted that because President
Jiang went directly to America and back last year, Clinton should
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have induced Clinton to spend nine days in China,
far more time than seasoned diplomats can remember a U.S. president
taking for a visit before.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin spent the same time in America last fall,
and Clinton's visit is intended to show that he considers Jiang to
be his equal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton visits Hong Kong, he will not have a separate
meeting with Martin Lee, in deference to Chinese wishes. Lee and 19
other democrats recently won election to the Hong Kong legislature
dominated by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions, which have drawn
worldwide criticism, have been added to the agenda, much to China's
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is closely allied with Beijing, and Clinton risks being
seen as lining up with autocratic China and Pakistan against
democratic India.
</P>
<P>
   Americans experienced in Asia express concern over how Clinton's
visit will be seen in Japan and the rest of Asia. They fear that he
will serve Beijing's crusade to revive the concept of the Middle
Kingdom, in which China is Asia's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   Not that President Jiang will have a free hand with Clinton. The
Chinese leader must quell a raging debate between leaders of the
People's Liberation Army, who demand that China confront the United
States, and the foreign and economic ministries, which see good
relations with America to be in China's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang cannot afford to anger senior military officers, who hold
the key to power in Beijing and take a hard line on Taiwan.
Military leaders have called Chinese diplomats ``traitors'' for
what they consider a soft attitude toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton can expect tough words about Taiwan. Chinese leaders
have said repeatedly that the future of Taiwan is the most
important core issue in relations between China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans appear to agree that good relations with China
are in the U.S. national interest. The question is whether Clinton
is going about it in the right way. &QL;

May to Europe, and now in June to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese demanded that the president come directly from
Washington to China and return home without stopping in Japan,
which is supposedly the key ally of the United States in Asia. Most
U.S. presidents have stopped in Tokyo on visits to Asia for the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton officials said the president had planned to stop over in
Tokyo on this trip. The Chinese insisted that because President
Jiang went directly to America and back last year, Clinton should
do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have induced Clinton to spend nine days in China,
far more time than seasoned diplomats can remember a U.S. president
taking for a visit before.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin spent the same time in America last fall,
and Clinton's visit is intended to show that he considers Jiang to
be his equal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton visits Hong Kong, he will not have a separate
meeting with Martin Lee, in deference to Chinese wishes. Lee and 19
other democrats recently won election to the Hong Kong legislature
dominated by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions, which have drawn
worldwide criticism, have been added to the agenda, much to China's
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is closely allied with Beijing, and Clinton risks being
seen as lining up with autocratic China and Pakistan against
democratic India.
</P>
<P>
   Americans experienced in Asia express concern over how Clinton's
visit will be seen in Japan and the rest of Asia. They fear that he
will serve Beijing's crusade to revive the concept of the Middle
Kingdom, in which China is Asia's dominant power.
</P>
<P>
   Not that President Jiang will have a free hand with Clinton. The
Chinese leader must quell a raging debate between leaders of the
People's Liberation Army, who demand that China confront the United
States, and the foreign and economic ministries, which see good
relations with America to be in China's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang cannot afford to anger senior military officers, who hold
the key to power in Beijing and take a hard line on Taiwan.
Military leaders have called Chinese diplomats ``traitors'' for
what they consider a soft attitude toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   So Clinton can expect tough words about Taiwan. Chinese leaders
have said repeatedly that the future of Taiwan is the most
important core issue in relations between China and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans appear to agree that good relations with China
are in the U.S. national interest. The question is whether Clinton
is going about it in the right way. &QL;

   BEIJING _ In preparing to receive Bill Clinton, Chinese
authorities have outmaneuvered the White House on several points.
Will the Chinese similarly have the upper hand when the critical
issues of Tiananmen, Taiwan and trade are discussed?
</P>
<P>
   American, Chinese, Japanese and Taiwanese political observers
suggest that the White House has acquiesced because no one in the
administration's top level has had much experience in negotiating
with China.
</P>
<P>
   Said a Chinese scholar: ``The Clinton people are not aware of
how the Chinese will manipulate this visit. They don't have a
clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sighed an American official with long experience in Asia:
``Clinton's going to kowtow all over Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   American business executives in Beijing, initially eager to take
part in the visit, say they are backing away now because they fear
that the president will agree to a deal that will come under
critical scrutiny in Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An assessment of traps awaiting Clinton in China can be pieced
together from officials and private analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, for whom symbolism is all-important, persuaded
Clinton to move his trip forward from November to June, the
anniversary month of the Tiananmen episode in which the Chinese
army killed uncounted hundreds of democratic activists in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan to have Clinton's appearance in Tiananmen
Square help to bring symbolic closure to that sorry chapter in
China's history.
</P>
<P>
   At first the White House said he could not go before the
November midterm elections. Then political heat got turned up by
potential scandals, and White House officials arranged to get him
out of Washington in March to Africa, in April to Latin America, in
May to Europe, and now in June to China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese demanded that the president come directly from

   NEW YORK _ Ladies and gentlemen and children of all ages, step
right up and see the latest casualty of the New York real-estate
boom, Le Cirque du Soleil.
</P>
<P>
   After pitching its blue-and-yellow tent at Battery Park City for
the last 10 years, the Felliniesque troupe is looking for another
home in Manhattan. Jacques Marois, the general manager of the North
American division of the circus, said that the Battery Park City
Authority had advised them that construction will begin in the fall
on land the 2,250-seat tent has occupied since March. He also said
that the agency had asked the circus to look for space outside
Battery Park City because there are no other undeveloped sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way this wonderful circus could stay is if we revised
our master plan, and a developer were willing to incorporate a
permanent home for Cirque du Soleil in a future building,'' said
the president of the authority, John Lamura.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe is looking for a 300-foot-by-550-foot space for its
tent, as well as space for trailers and support vehicles. ``We have
talked with a variety of landlords,'' Marois said, ``but nothing we
have seen is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Highly Quotable
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hugged Henry Kissinger,'' Dr. Ruth Westheimer bubbled
at a cocktail party preceding the American Foundation for AIDS
Research's tribute to the broadcaster Larry King at the Plaza
Hotel, ``so I'm already in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, she has the former secretary of state to thank for
the title of a book she plans to write with Steven Kaplan, a
historian, ``Power Is the Ultimate Aphrodisiac.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Kissinger think about saying something that Dr.
Westheimer turned into a book title?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every smart-alecky remark I make haunts me for the rest of my
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Matched Pairs?
</P>
<P>
   The third finger of Winona Ryder's left hand may draw stares at
a party Tuesday night at the National Museum of the American Indian
in lower Manhattan. Miss Ryder is one of the hosts of the party for
the New York premiere of ``Smoke Signals,'' the first
feature-length film written, directed and acted by American Indians
and the winner of two awards at the Sundance festival in January.
</P>
<P>
   But about her ring finger: The Internet has been buzzing with
speculation that Miss Ryder and Matt Damon are engaged. The
chat-room rumors were fueled by the Australian weekly New, which
quoted Kyle Pelt, a longtime friend of Damon's, as saying that
Damon had popped the big question ``and she had said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Miss Ryder's spokeswoman, Mara Buxbaum. ``She's not
engaged,'' Ms. Buxbaum said. ``It started as a rumor on E! Online
last week. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitched
</P>
<P>
   P.W. Botha, the former president of South Africa, married
Barbara Robertson, a 57-year-old legal secretary, Monday in South
Africa. They met while he was promoting his autobiography. Botha's
wife, Elize, died of a heart attack last year. He was engaged to
Reinette Te Water Naude for several months, but they broke up amid
newspaper reports that she was seeing someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Into the Picture
</P>
<P>
   The actor Ed Harris has spent three nights this month at Jackson
Pollock's house, preparing for a forthcoming film about Pollock,
the pioneering Abstract Expressionist, and his widow, Lee Krasner.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was gone before the start of a $2,500-a-person party for
the house (which is in the Springs section of East Hampton, N.Y.)
the other night in Southampton. But Helen Harrison, the director of
the Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center, said that Harris had
left behind an unfinished pack of unfiltered Camels, Pollock's
brand.

IRAQ INSISTS IT'S BEING CANDID WITH U.N. ARMS INSPECTORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 5th graf concerning Senator Lott's letter to
President Clinton on subject of VX nerve gas; re-editing
throughout)   (sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq has criticized a U.N. report that said it
is still hiding details about its program to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council made public on Monday, the
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, complained that the report
misrepresented Iraq's willingness to make a full disclosure, which
would permit lifting the embargo on oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   The letter offered the latest counterpoint to a running dispute
that began with the imposition of sanctions after Iraqi troops
occupied Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since it lost the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Baghdad has insisted
that it has disclosed the extent of its biological and chemical
weapons and ballistic missiles and the means to make them, but U.N.
inspectors have ferreted out evidence to the contrary. The ensuing
game of hide-and-seek has brought the United States and its allies
nearly to the point of military confrontation with Iraq twice in
the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is raising tempers on Capitol Hill. On Monday
evening, Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and three other
Republicans wrote President Clinton complaining about fresh reports
that Iraq had deployed weapons carrying VX nerve gas before the
gulf war, The Washington Post reported. The Republicans said it was
imperative that the U.N. inspection team get ``all the support it
needs and deserves from the U.S.'' They complained that Clinton had
a ``failed policy toward Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, dated Saturday, Aziz accused the chief arms
inspector, Richard Butler, who sent the report to the president of
the council last week, of ``concentrating on controversial points
in a manner that fails to give a balanced and objective picture of
what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the executive chairman of the United Nations Special
Commission, which is charged with ridding Iraq of its weapons of
mass destruction, visited Baghdad from June 11 to 15 to work out a
disarmament schedule that could open the way for the removal of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   He initially expressed optimism about his progress. But his
report to the Security Council last Thursday said, ``Iraq stated
that it has already presented all the evidence available to it, and
that no additional information or documentation would be provided
to the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular Butler said Iraq refused to respond to further
questions about its production of VX nerve gas. He also said Aziz
declined to provide more information about biological weapons and
missile fuel. Withholding such evidence would make it impossible to
verify that Iraq had eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Aziz appeared to have been timed to provide
Iraq's position before Wednesday, when Butler is to brief the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz wrote that Baghdad had given the Special Commission ``the
relevant clarifications, explanations and documents pertaining to
VX nerve gas'' and had demonstrated that ``Iraq did not have any
other documents on the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also argued that ``since the accounting for missile
engines, missile launchers and the warheads was completed, the
question of missile propellants loses importance and becomes a
secondary issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is in Iraq's interest to provide documents, Aziz
said, ``the Special Commission should not insist and request
something that does not exist.'' In the past, inspectors repeatedly
found documents with details of biological and chemical weapons
production that Iraqi officials had insisted did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Under Security Council Resolution 687, whose terms Iraq accepted
in 1991, the U.N. inspectors must verify that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction before the oil embargo can be lifted.
The next major review by the Security Council is scheduled for
October.
</P>
<P>
   If destruction of the weapons is confirmed, active inspections
are to be replaced by long-term monitoring by a surveillance system
of video cameras and other electronic devices in order to prevent
Iraq from rebuilding its arsenal.

DODGERS FIRE FIELD MANAGER, GENERAL MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, a franchise noted for its continuity
when owned by the O'Malley family, continued its ferocious makeover
following the takeover by the Fox Group, firing general manager
Fred Claire and manager Bill Russell Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Claire was the longest-serving major league general manager and
had been with the Dodgers organization since being named publicity
director in 1969. Russell, who was ousted before he could complete
his second full season, was also a fixture in Los Angeles, having
played shortstop for the Dodgers for 18 seasons. It was the first
midseason shake-up to hit the Dodgers' dugout for non-health
reasons since Leo Durocher bolted the Brooklyn team for the New
York Giants in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals opened the way for the return of Tommy Lasorda,
who was asked to replace Claire on an interim basis and engineer a
solution to the Dodgers' dismal 36-38 season. Lasorda, elected to
the Hall of Fame after a successful 20-year stint as Dodgers
manager, had reluctantly moved to the front office in 1996 after
heart surgery and was replaced in the dugout by Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who was serving as a Dodgers vice president, will now
oversee another of his former players in Glenn Hoffman, the
Dodgers' manager at Class AAA Albuquerque, who was promoted on an
interim basis to replace Russell and asked to finish out the
season.
</P>
<P>
   While the first inclination was to assign the seismic changes to
the ambitions of a new regime, Peter O'Malley, the former president
and club owner, who is now the Dodgers' board chairman, insisted
that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked probably 100 times the hypothetical question _
`Peter, if your family still owned the club would you have done the
same thing? _ and the honest answer is yes,'' O'Malley said during
a news conference broadcast from Los Angeles. ``I've been
disappointed in the team's performance, felt we were flat and have
been for some time. I think it's time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The reemergence of O'Malley's good friend, Lasorda, proved as
intriguing as the Dodgers' decision to step out of character by
dismissing a manager.
</P>
<P>
   The men who recommended the change _ O'Malley and the Dodgers'
president, Bob Graziano _ predate the Fox regime. And their actions
dovetailed nicely with the long-standing desire of Lasorda, a
mainstay of the franchise under the old ownership, to become the
club's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Explained Graziano, the 13-year club executive who succeeded
O'Malley: ``Over the course of the last several weeks I have spent
many, many hours thinking about how to get this team back on track.
The last couple of weeks I have spent countless hours with Peter
O'Malley, getting his advice on the best way to right this team.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Dodgers lost three of four games against a struggling
Rockies team in Colorado this past weekend and fell 12 1/2 games
behind the first-place San Diego Padres in the National League
West, the fates of Claire and Russell were sealed. ``Once I made
that decision, it did not make any sense to wait until the end of
the season, or three days, four days,'' Graziano said.
</P>
<P>
   Once Claire and Russell were informed of the decision Sunday
night, both O'Malley and Graziano met with Lasorda, who, Graziano
said, ``has always told me that if I ever needed anybody to step in
and help me, he was there for me.'' As for Lasorda, O'Malley said:
``Tommy always told me it wasn't my job he wanted _ fortunately.
Someday I'd like to be general manager _ no hurry, but I'd like to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda bubbled with joy, saying ``when I accepted this role, I
accepted it with a great deal of gratitude and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lasorda and Hoffman are able to shed the interim labels
by improving the team's fortunes remains to be seen. Should
Lasorda's stake be set more firmly than the Dodgers indicated
Monday, there could be ramifications for the Mets. Mets manager
Bobby Valentine is a Lasorda protege, began his big league playing
career with the Dodgers and has never hidden his admiration for the
franchise. Even though Valentine is in the first year of a
three-year contract extension, there will inevitably be speculation
he may look to move to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mike Piazza, the all-star catcher traded by the
Dodgers to the Marlins amid a contract dispute and then sent from
Florida to the Mets. Piazza is Lasorda's godson, and that
connection may play big when the potential free agent resumes his
pursuit of a $100 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of Claire and Russell were major moves for a a
team that stood as the last bastion for a family-owned baseball
dynasty. The O'Malley family, which had owned the team from 1950
until this spring, had employed only four managers _ Charlie
Dressen for three seasons, Walter Alston for 23 years, Lasorda for
20 and then Russell. As for general manager, Claire's 12-year
tenure was the longest consecutive active run in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet since turning the team over to Fox and Rupert Murdoch in
March, the team has subtracted not only old standards, also some of
its highest profile players. With injuries and the loss of those
traded, the Dodgers have foundered. ``I'm going to challenge this
team to go forth and play the kind of baseball they're capable of
playing,'' Lasorda vowed.

LATEST EPISODE IN FOX VENTURE INTO BLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Today's episode of the Fox melodrama, As The Blue
Fades, begins with a shot of four men sitting at a table, waiting
to put on a show for the assembled multitudes.
</P>
<P>
   On one end sits the titular head of the Los Angeles Dodgers,
Peter O'Malley. He is there to lend a reassuring presence, an
all-is-well air, to the fans at home. He really has no other duties
in the organization since selling the team lock, stock and bullpen
to the Fox Group.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end sits young blood, Bob Graziano, the likeable
new President of the Dodgers. He is as sincere as a summer day is
long, but there is no getting around the shadow Fox casts over his
domain, much as the Cigarette-Smoking Man casts his shadow on
Mulder and ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to Graziano sits Glenn Hoffman, the new character just
introduced. When Fox officials hear that the Dodgers have hired
Hoffman as their manager, they will reply ``Dustin?'' in unison.
</P>
<P>
   And between Hoffman and O'Malley sits the new interim General
Manager, Tommy Lasorda, just back from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending Monday's press conference to announce the latest
changes in Dodger culture said the proper and respectful things.
They expressed their gratitude to the men just launched, General
Manager Fred Claire and Manager Bill Russell, and their confidence
that things will get better. But one was still left looking for
simple answers.
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, Claire and Russell fell out of the Fox loop,
assuming they were ever in it. And two years after being nudged
into retirement ostensibly for health reasons after suffering a
heart attack, Lasorda has returned with a vengeance. He is in the
loop, and in fact may have given the loop its latest spin.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few people involved in the sale of Dodgers who had
contacts on both sides of the third base line was Lasorda. He has a
long friendship with Wall Street wizard Michael Milken, who is
friends with Rupert Murdoch and Fox COO's Chase Carey and Peter
Chernin.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Lasorda said he was scheduled to fly to Boston Sunday
with Milken on personal business before the bodies were found.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining why Lasorda was named the interim General Manager,
Graziano stressed that the club ``wanted Tommy more intimately
involved in baseball decisions.'' Later, he elaborated. ``Tommy has
a tremendous knowledge about baseball, and the fact was we weren't
using it.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was retired after his heart attack, O'Malley and Claire
both said the club wanted to make good use of Lasorda's baseball
knowledge. But Lasorda has basically been sent out and about as an
ambassador of the organization. The baseball trips he made often
were to scout prospects or kids in the low minors.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to L.A. Sunday from a trip he made to Glen Falls,
Montana, and Yakima, Washington, checking up on kids light years
away from the major leagues. Claire and Russell rarely sought his
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda acknowledged that he has contacts within the Fox Group,
and that some of the people there felt he wasn't being used
properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true,'' he said. ``When they bought the club, they
wanted to make sure I was still here and the club was taking
advantage of my knowledge. A few of them figured I should have been
(used more).''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Lasorda angrily denies that he did anything to get
Claire or Russell fired. ``I never said a bad word about them.''
</P>
<P>
   A baseball source said he didn't believe Fox was looking to fire
Claire or Russell. But it did know the team it had bought was in a
malaise, and that it had deepened since the wake-up call that was
the Mike Piazza trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Fox people knew coming in is that the team was
underachieving,'' said a baseball source. ``And the person that had
their ear most was Lasorda.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Fox directed Graziano and O'Malley to fire two
and hire Lasorda remains to be seen. The group does not micro
manage the team as much as some believe. If it had some kind of
blueprint, it certainly wouldn't have been to hire Lasorda as G.M.
(ital) after (end ital) clearing Piazza and Hideo Nomo from the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are Lasorda might have influenced both situations
differently than he did. ``That's a hypothetical question,'' he
said. ``I wasn't the guy back in April.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said he spoke with Fox officials on Friday and
indicated he was leaning to making a double-switch. ``I told them
(Carey and Chernin) we were leaning in this direction,'' said
Graziano. ``The final decision came down Sunday after hours of talk
with Peter (O'Malley).''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for anyone to say that Claire and Russell were
wronged. Claire has been the G.M. since 1987, and the last world
title and postseason win came in 1988. Russell may not have been
handed a full plate of talent, and may not have had as much impact
on the personnel he had as other managers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers didn't seem to be headed anywhere under his
stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we came to a decision, we felt there was no reason to
wait until the end of the season,'' said Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one can't say where they're headed now. They have a
manager who has never won on the minor league level, and a G.M. who
is 71, and both are labeled interim.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano said the team is committed to search for a full-time
G.M., and that Hoffman will be considered as a candidate based on
this half-season. One assumes, though, that Lasorda will be hard to
budge from the G.M. job now that he's got it.
</P>
<P>
   He always wanted to be G.M. If his heart were to go out
tomorrow, he likely would prefer that it happen on the job as the
G.M. as opposed to, say, Yakima.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talent here,'' Lasorda said. ``The challenge
we have is to get them to play the way they're capable. I accepted
this job with the idea that we would get things going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I'll do whatever the Dodgers want me to do. If I
do a good job, we'll see where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   And we'll be watching. Don't touch that dial.

<P>
   Heroics lacking, &QL; 
both early and late
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
YOU can think about it for another day before sending in your
ballot to give the Astros a nickname worthy of their gift for
late-inning comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   Not this night. A gangly lefthander who will turn 23 in August,
Eric Milton, stifled the Astros on two singles for six-plus innings
Monday, and Minnesota's Twins didn't crater in the last of the
ninth, and there went Houston's three-game winning streak. The
score was 5-3, which makes it sound as if the Astros put up a
better battle than they did.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, as you probably know, is a sport in which the defense
can't score. Which is a pity because the Astros made half a dozen
fancy fielding plays but had only one productive swing at bat. Brad
Ausmus planted a 1-0 pitch off reliever Mike Trombley with two on
in the seventh, getting Houston on the board and cutting the Twins'
lead to a run.
</P>
<P>
   Milton looked as if he could toy with the Astros all evening,
until his control took a hike. With two out, he walked Carl Everett
and went to 3-and-0 on Sean Berry, and manager Tom Kelly went to
his bullpen, apparently not wanting to risk a major misstep by the
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, that dishonor went to Trombley, who finished walking
Berry and then served up the third homer of the year to Ausmus, a
rocket shot that barely cleared the fence in left. The roar of the
crowd, 23,168 of them, indicated that another late-night Astros
rally might be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros' bats were like those air blowers in the
restrooms, enough to dry your hands but not enough to generate real
heat. Except for the blast by Ausmus, the Astros didn't get a
runner past first base until Jeff Bagwell singled to lead off the
ninth, stole second and went to third on a grounder. He was still
there when the game ended.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Twins were collecting eight of their 10 hits off
Jose Lima, including Terry Steinbach's solo homer in the second.
Milton seemed to be pitching well enough to make that run stand up,
but the Twins collected four doubles and three of them led to runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom dwellers drive in runs
</P>
<P>
   It didn't do much for the Astros' self-esteem when Minnesota
scored twice in the fourth with two out, on singles by Dennis
Hocking, a .153 hitter, and Milton, who ripped a grounder up the
middle for the first run batted in of his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brad got us back in it,'' lamented manager Larry Dierker,
``but it hurt when the eighth hitter and the pitcher got two-out
hits, and then they add the insurance run in the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   The rookie came into the game with a 3-6 record and an earned
run average over 5.00. But this was a case of Milton's Paradise
Won, or perhaps lost and found. In any case, the Chuck Knoblauch
trade is suddenly looking a whole lot more promising for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   When they gave up their All-Star second baseman to the Yankees,
young Milton was one of the four warm bodies the Twins received in
return. The 6-3, 200-pound Pennsylvanian had been named New York's
minor-league Pitcher of the Year in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, himself a child prodigy in the salad days of the
Houston franchise, was impressed with Milton's efficiency. ``He
showed us a 92-mile-an-hour fastball on the outside corner and a
good changeup,'' said Dierker. ``I was glad when they took him
out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Twins are still a game under .500 and in a rebuilding cycle.
If anything is going to speed up their progress, it has to be the
pitching, because this team doesn't have much muscle. Steinbach's
homer over the lottery sign in left field gave their starting
lineup a total of 30 home runs, leaving them only three behind Mark
McGwire of the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Lima goes sour
</P>
<P>
   You had to figure that if the teams were going to play long
ball, the advantage clearly belonged to the Astros. But for most of
the night, the Astros looked as if they had been watching too much
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who had given the Astros' starting rotation an
early-season lift, was rocked hard by the Twins and was fortunate
to strand three runners in scoring position. Craig Biggio saved him
once by getting a force at second, making a throw while flat on his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not his best game,'' Dierker said of Lima, in a
slight understatement, ``but he gave us innings. A lot of times, he
can give up four runs and win because we'll score.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not one of those times, and the Astros may need a new
game plan against a Minnesota team struggling to be ordinary. In
their only series a year ago, the Twins won two out of three.
</P>
<P>
   You know the Astros are not going to win many games when Biggio
provides one of their highlights by batting for nearly five
minutes. He was at the plate for 14 pitches, fouling off eight,
before lifting a pop fly to short.

EX-BOYFRIEND ARRESTED IN FATAL STABBING IN QUEENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 25-year-old Queens man who police said stabbed his
former girlfriend and her parents, killing her mother, in a jealous
rage on Sunday was arrested Monday morning after he was found
hiding in the back yard of a friend's house in Dutchess County,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Robert Parsell, was returned to Queens and held on
charges that he stabbed his former girlfriend, Heather Grech, 20,
and then killed her mother, Kathleen, 55, and seriously wounded her
father, Tristan, 54, when they tried to rescue her, said Chief of
Detectives William Allee Jr. Police said Parsell had become enraged
after being spurned by Miss Grech.
</P>
<P>
   The Queens district attorney, Richard Brown, said Parsell would
be charged with second-degree murder and attempted murder for the
attack, which occurred just before 7 a.m. Sunday in the living room
of the Grech family home at 69-26 61st Rd. in Middle Village,
Queens. ``Each suffered multiple stab wounds in what can only be
described as a blood bath, a jealous rage,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that Parsell grew desperate last week after Miss
Grech left him and moved with their 18-month-old son back to her
parents' home. His sadness turned to rage, they said, when he heard
that she had seen another man.
</P>
<P>
   Parsell asked Mrs. Grech to help him set up a meeting with her
daughter. When he arrived, Parsell pulled out a knife and stabbed
Miss Grech two dozen times, severing her liver and puncturing a
lung, police said. Her mother was killed and her father seriously
wounded when they intervened. ``Her mother came to her assistance
and quite possibly saved her child's life,'' Allee said.
</P>
<P>
   Heather's older brother, David, 22, woke up to the sounds of
screams and chased Parsell away.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives tracked Parsell to a friend's home in Beacon, N.Y.,
about 60 miles north of the city. At the request of New York City
police, officers from the Beacon Police Department began staking
out the house around midnight, said Lt. Paul Schettino of Beacon
police. At around 1:30 a.m., he said, they saw someone matching
Parsell's description walking around the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to elude them,'' Schettino said. ``He tried to hide
near a boat in the back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, Parsell's friends gathered outside the 104th Precinct
station house as he was led out in handcuffs. One friend, Marc
Harris, 20, said Parsell could not bear the thought of being
separated from Miss Grech and their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was crying on the phone to me all week,'' Harris said.

VIZCAINO JOINS TEAMMATES ON DISABLED LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Scoot over, Bobby Bonilla, Ramon Martinez and
Todd Hollandsworth. Jose Vizcaino needs space on the trainer's
table, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sprained right ankle made Vizcaino the third Dodger since
Friday to be placed on the 15-day disabled list. The shortstop, who
suffered the injury sliding into second base at Colorado on Sunday,
was replaced by Triple-A Albuquerque infielder Wilton Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said Vizcaino, who was on
crutches Monday, is expected to return from the DL on time. Eleven
Dodgers have spent time on the DL this season. Vizcaino's last
appearance on the DL was in 1992 with a torn tendon on his third
left finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our run-ins with injuries, but it goes in cycles,''
Strasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero, who started at second base Monday, began the season
with the Dodgers but was sent to Albuquerque on May 16 and demanded
to be traded. With the Dukes, the switch-hitter batted .298 with 36
hits, three doubles and a home run in 121 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   __ Martinez update: Right-hander Ramon Martinez will receive
season-ending surgery on June 30 to repair his damaged throwing
shoulder. The surgery, which will take place at Inglewood
Centinella Hospital Medical Center, will be on his rotator cuff and
cartilage tears. It will be done by Dodgers team physican Dr. Frank
Jobe and Angels medical director Dr. Lewis Yocum.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery time is expected to be six or seven months for
Martinez, who has a $5.6 million contract next season and a
$600,000 buyout option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the team decides to do with me next season is fine,''
said Martinez. ``I don't know if I can see myself in another
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Etc.: Outfielder Todd Hollandsworth, who is out for the
season with a left-shoulder cartilage tear, returned to the team
for the first time since having surgery. His rehabilitation
exercises consist of light-movement exercises... Third baseman
Bobby Bonilla, who was placed on the DL Sunday with an intestinal
infection, returned to Los Angeles Monday morning after a stay in a
Denver hospital. He will be examined by Dodgers physician Dr.
Michael Mellman this morning.... Second baseman Eric Young, who has
missed the last six games with a right-quadriceps strain, is
expected to return to the lineup tonight.

Twins rookie 
hurls and hits 
way to victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The scouting report on Minnesota rookie Eric Milton was pretty much
on the money.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old lefthander had his fastball in the 92-mph range
Monday night and mixed in an impressive changeup, just like the
intelligence report said. There was just one other minor thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew exactly what he could do, only he just did it better
than he has been doing,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said Monday
night after Milton and two other Twins relievers combined on a
four-hitter in a 5-3 victory over the Astros at the Astrodome. ``I
was happy when they took him out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's about the only chance the Astros had.
</P>
<P>
   Milton (4-6), who hadn't won since May 15, retired the first
eight batters he faced and 20 of 25 before being lifted with two
out and a 3-0 count on Sean Berry in the seventh inning. The Astros
scored their only runs of the game shortly after Milton's exit on a
three-run homer by Brad Ausmus off Mike Trombley.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Aguilera pitched a scoreless ninth for his 15th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody had a scouting report that said (Milton) had trouble
throwing his breaking ball for strikes,'' Astros first baseman Jeff
Bagwell said. ``He didn't have much trouble throwing anything for
strikes tonight. He mixed the ball in and out, changed speeds well
and made us put the ball in play. We just didn't hit.''
</P>
<P>
   With interleague play matching teams only once a year, it
doesn't give hitters a chance to adjust to pitchers. That could not
have been more evident in the first 6 innings, when Milton allowed
only a pair of singles to Jose Lima and Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The loss halted the Astros' three-game winning streak and gave
the Twins a 3-1 record at the Astrodome over the last two seasons.
The Astros are 5-2 against the American League in 1998 and 9-13 in
interleague play since its inception last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would want to play the Astros every day.
Just look at the numbers,'' said Minnesota manager Tom Kelly.
``You've got Craig Biggio, a terrific player, and Ricky Gutierrez
having a great year. Add in Jeff Bagwell, Derek Bell and Moises
Alou, and that's a real solid lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   But the above quintet went 2-for-19 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Astros righthander Lima (7-4) was the first six-game winner in
the National League but hasn't been the same since with a 1-2
record, 4.23 ERA and four no-decisions in his last eight starts.
Lima gave up four runs and eight hits in seven innings, falling
victim to a couple of bad pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 2-0, Lima left a fourth-inning changeup over the middle
of the plate to Dennis Hocking, who deposited the pitch into left
field for a run-scoring single. The shortstop, who took second on
the throw home, entered the game batting .140 with no RBIs in 44
lefthanded at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches later, Lima threw an 0-2 fastball to Milton, who
singled home Hocking with his third hit in six interleague at-bats
this season.
</P>
<P>
   All five of Minnesota's runs were scored with two out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't pitch badly,'' Ausmus said of Lima, who matched a
season high with seven strikeouts before leaving after seven
innings. ``They happened to score four runs, and we didn't produce
any offense. It looked a lot worse on the scoreboard. Generally,
four runs for this team is something that can be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Steinbach gave the Twins an early lead with a bases-empty
home run in the second inning, and Matt Lawton's RBI double in the
third made it 2-0. Lawton added a two-out RBI double off reliever
Reggie Harris in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the little mistakes you make in the game cost
you,'' said Lima, who failed to get victory No. 8 for the third
straight start. ``I tried to stay strong and keep the ballclub in
the game, but we came up short. I was real disappointed. I should
have won that game 3-2 or 4-3. I made the mistakes and paid the
price. I didn't worry about it after giving up two runs, not even
three runs. This club is going to score a lot of runs for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case Monday. The four hits were the fewest by
the Astros since they had four in an 8-1 loss to Cincinnati on June
12.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros avoided the shutout in the seventh with a two-out,
three-run rally. Milton walked Carl Everett and was charged with
walking Berry before being replaced by Trombley. Ausmus then
connected on his third home run of the season, a drive over the
left-center-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins threatened to put the game out of reach in the eighth
inning off reliever Doug Henry. Henry, who had not pitched in nine
days because of soreness in his right shoulder, gave up a leadoff
single to Marty Cordova. Orlando Merced reached on a fielder's
choice, and after Steinbach grounded out, Todd Walker walked. Henry
escaped the jam when Hocking flied out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had one last chance in the ninth when Bagwell reached
on a leadoff single to extend his hitting streak to 11 games. But
it was too much to ask the Astros for yet another comeback in their
last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have many opportunities,'' Bagwell said. ``Getting
Milton out of there was our only chance.''

YANKEES DEFEAT BRAVES, 6-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A midseason series against the Atlanta Braves, New
York Yankees Manager Joe Torre suggested on Monday afternoon, feels
more like an exhibition than a prelude to October. But three hours
later, Yankee Stadium rippled with emotion, every at-bat squeezed
sweat from the hands, and the ghosts of World Series past and
future haunted the place.
</P>
<P>
   When Tim Raines ripped a two-run double against reliever Dennis
Martinez in the seventh inning on Monday night, the pivotal hit in
the Yankees' 6-4 comeback victory, it was natural to recall how the
Yankees had exploited the Atlanta bullpen in the 1996 World Series.
It was easy to imagine how they could do it again, if the Yankees
(51-18) and the Braves (50-26), who have the best records in their
leagues, meet again this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' goal two years ago was to hang in against Atlanta's
starting pitchers, whether it was Greg Maddux or Tom Glavine or
John Smoltz. Just hang in, keep it close, until the Braves were
forced to go to their bullpen, the soft underbelly of the National
League's reigning dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   It was a familiar stratagem on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux started for the Braves and, bothered by a stiff neck that
he had awakened with, he labored uncomfortably through six innings,
throwing 87 pitches. With Atlanta leading by a run, 4-3, Maddux
asked out of the game. ``I was aware of my neck every pitch,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez replaced Maddux for the seventh inning, having a
dubious history in Yankee Stadium. Despite many seasons in the
American League, not one of his 243 victories occurred at this
place. Even at age 43, however, Martinez is perhaps the most
reliable middle reliever in the Atlanta bullpen, particularly now
that Mark Wohlers is in the Gulf Coast League trying to sort
through his problems.
</P>
<P>
   All night, the Yankees' hitters had picked away at Maddux enough
to hurt him, forcing him to throw pitches, to go deep in counts.
Some of them punched hits to the opposite field. And they proceeded
to do the same to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch drew a walk to lead off the seventh with a
seven-pitch at-bat; in the Yankees' dugout, David Cone said later,
there was a sense that the game had just turned in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter tried and failed to bunt Knoblauch to second, but in
flying out, he made Martinez throw six more pitches. During Jeter's
at-bat, Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox was ejected for arguing a
foul-ball call _ and Torre thought of the final game of the '96
World Series, when Cox was also ejected.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill was next, with 61 at-bats against Martinez in his
career, ``probably more than anybody else,'' O'Neill said. He knew
it would be a matter of getting ahead of Martinez, preventing him
from getting into a position where the veteran pitcher could throw
something nasty and make O'Neill chase it. O'Neill walked on five
pitches, the cheers of 53,316 building with each pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could've been a post-season game,'' Torre said later.
``Everything was a high-wire act.''
</P>
<P>
   Relievers were warmed up in the Atlanta bullpen, but no change
was made. Opposing managers have usually brought in lefties to face
the trio of the left-handed-hitting O'Neill and Tino Martinez and
the switch-hitting Raines, but the Braves stuck with the
right-handed Martinez, rather than trust their left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of tough when they left Dennis in the game,'' said
Andy Pettitte, who started and pitched six and two-thirds innings
for the Yankees. ``It was a good situation for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez fell behind no balls and two strikes, fouled off a
pair of two-strike pitches and then reached a full count before he
fouled out on the eighth pitch of his at-bat. Dennis Martinez had
thrown 26 pitches in the inning. Each Yankees hitter was setting up
the next.
</P>
<P>
   Raines was next, two outs and two on. Torre had started Raines
in left field rather than the rookie Ricky Ledee because he wanted
someone with experience to face Maddux, a four-time Cy Young award
winner. Raines was also quite familiar with Martinez, his high leg
kick, his torso cocked forward, the plug of tobacco packed into his
left cheek. Raines had seen all that, having 5 hits in 20 previous
at-bats against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to hit the ball hard there,'' Raines said.
``When 50,000 are cheering, you want to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines swung and missed at a 2-1 curve, then stepped out.
O'Neill, leading off first, checked the outfielders. All were
playing shallow, cheating in a bit to give themselves a chance to
throw out a runner at home on a ground single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez fired a fastball _ his 33d pitch of the inning _ and
Raines ripped it to dead center. As soon as Andruw Jones, the
Atlanta center fielder, turned his back, O'Neill knew and Torre
knew that Jones would not catch the ball. Both Knoblauch and
O'Neill scored, and the Yankees led, 5-4. The Yankees added another
run on an infield hit.
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, walked
through the clubhouse afterward, a hint of a grin on his face. ``We
can only think about one thing,'' he said. ``The World.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Series, he meant.

BAY AREA KNOWS HOW TO PUT ON A GOLF OUTING 
BY C.W. NEVIUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Bay Area has just about perfected the
concept of hosting the U.S. Open. The tickets sold out in nothing
flat. The setting was spectacular and the finish was sensational,
with Payne Stewart's putt on the final hole curling an inch away
from forcing a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   And best of all, in two years we get to do the whole thing
again. The Open travels to Pinehurst in North Carolina next year,
but it will be back at Pebble Beach in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   So start saving now. In two years you will need to take out a
second mortgage to purchase a U.S. Open sweatshirt at the
merchandise tent. And that's a best-case scenario. Other bests and
worsts from Olympic:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST EXAMPLE OF WHAT A DOWN-TO-EARTH GUY U.S. OPEN CHAMP LEE &LR; 
 &UR; JANZEN IS: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; At 12:30 on Sunday afternoon, a couple of volunteers and a
reporter were standing on a deserted dirt trail between the
clubhouse and the 1st tee. A guy in a golf cap comes huffing and
puffing up the hill, straining under the weight of a huge tour golf
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you have a caddie?'' asked one of the volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' he said, ``but he doesn't seem to be able to find his
way to the clubhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Janzen, on his way to the 1st tee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORST MANNERS BY A LOCAL CROWD: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; The relentless taunting of Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who may
be a rabbit-eared, red-faced, bundle of exasperation on the golf
course, but who is candid, thought-provoking and a stand-up guy off
it. Those louts calling him ``fat boy'' have no idea what they are
talking about and probably couldn't give you a good reason for
their behavior if you cornered them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST TACTIC MONTGOMERIE COULD HAVE TAKEN TO WIN OVER THE &LR; 
 &UR; LOCALS: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Because some of them appeared to be upset that he played so well
in the Ryder Cup, maybe he should have thrown his matches. If you
can't stand watching the Americans lose, have them play someone you
are sure they can beat, like Iran in soccer. Whoops, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST EXAMPLE SHOWING THE PROS ARE NOT THAT MUCH BETTER &LR; 
 &UR; THAN US HACKERS: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; On the 10th tee on Friday, 1996 U.S. Open champion Steve Jones
yanked his drive dead right, into a tree. It bounced out into the
fairway, but as several smirkers pointed out, it covered no more
than 100 yards on the 422-yard hole.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORST EXAMPLE SHOWING THAT WE HACKERS ARE JUST AS GOOD &LR; 
 &UR; AS THE PROS: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Jones then took out a 3-wood, crushed the ball in front of the
green, chipped up to one foot and made the putt for par.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST EXPRESSION OF WHAT THE OPEN IS REALLY LIKE FROM &LR; 
 &UR; SOMEONE IN THE TRENCHES: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; After his effort on Sunday, Olin Browne gets the nomination for
philosopher-king of the Tour. Browne finished 15-over-par, did a
dance of relief on the 18th green, threw his ball to the crowd and
then said the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a fry-off for the week. You can't get enough air in
your lungs, there's not enough blood to your head. You get so tired
of just grinding so hard every single day. And you let up for a
moment, and it kicks your butt. Because if you don't pull off the
exact shot you tried, you are dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the 18th. It's a 3-iron and a wedge and you stand on
the tee and you are scared to death. You finish and there is just
this extraordinary sense of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST REPLY TO FANS WHO SAY THEY KNOW JUST WHAT BROWNE IS &LR; 
 &UR; TALKING ABOUT: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; From Browne _ ``They don't have any idea.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WORST EXCUSES (FOUR-DAY TOTAL DIVISION): &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Tiger Woods. The greens were too bumpy, the pin positions were
``almost illegal,'' and the rough was too tough. At one point he
blamed a gust of wind for making his putt stop a good four feet
short. Woods has improved immensely in public relations in many
ways, but no one is going to buy this ``poor me'' act.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST ``TIN CUP'' OUT-TAKE: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Mark Carnevale, the guy who quit his job at Merrill-Lynch after a
single day to embark on a long, strange trip through mini-tours and
other countries, held on to make the cut. He slumped to a 78 on
Sunday but still earned $25,578, some $6,000 more than he picked up
over the first 14 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST, AND MOST SURPRISING, ADMISSION FROM THE USGA: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Friday, they confessed that the pin placement on the 18th green
was unfair, too hard and a mistake. Astonished pros swooned.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST NEWCOMER: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; Matt Kuchar in a landslide. Now there's a smile that is going to
make a lot of money. And as he showed when he took the microphone
to accept his low-amateur medal, he says all the right things, too,
with flair and a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEST FINAL WORD FROM OLIN BROWNE: &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR; ``Playing in the U.S. Open is abusive. It is a very, very
difficult test of all facets of the game, every single day. But you
know what? It is too hard a course for a fluke. For all the whining
and groaning you hear, the guy who plays the best _ and gets a
couple of breaks _ is the guy that wins.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't that all we want?

USGA SCORES OPEN A `10-PLUS' 
BY PAT SULLIVAN
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN FOLO-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; When the Olympic Club and the U.S. Golf
Association sat down Sunday night to compare notes on the 98th U.S.
Open golf championship, the club's tournament committee was anxious
for feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We asked them how they felt the tournament had gone, on a
scale of one to 10,'' general chairman John Hurd said yesterday.
``They said, `10-plus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was gratifying, to be sure, to club members involved with
the tournament, but it was no guarantee that the USGA will be back
in 10 years or so. For one thing, an entire segment of the club
doesn't want it back.
</P>
<P>
   While not a ``split'' among the membership, differences of
opinion on the Open do exist. ``There's always a group that feels
put upon,'' said Hurd, who was back behind his Walnut Creek desk on
Monday, catching up on his non-Olympian life as a consultant in
environmental-resource management. ``But the club also has an
obligation to the community and to the city. And there are only a
handful of places in the country that can host an Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposure is just unbelievable. I thought the city looked
great (on the telecast). I didn't realize it, but it rained in San
Diego last Tuesday. That just as easily could have been here.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs $2,500-$7,000 in initiation fees to join the Olympic
Club. Most of its 4,700 members are those who frequent the
seven-story athletic facility and socializing center on Post near
Mason. Only about 1,500 members hold golf privileges, for which the
fee is $25,000. The waiting list within the club for those
privileges is 10-12 years.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA paid the club a sum in the low millions to ``rent the
hall'' for the week, and staffers will be remaining at the USGA's
field office for six to eight weeks to oversee the ``teardown,''
Hurd said. The USGA also has promised to take an active role in the
restoration of Harding Park, used as a parking lot for 7,000 cars a
day during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The huge Open merchandising tent _ Logo City _ was strictly a
USGA operation. But the club did play a role, Hurd said, in the
corporate village effort managed by Mimi Griffin (an ESPN women's
basketball commentator) that set an Open record _ 51 separate party
tents, plus another large one with 80 tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mimi was a power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service was held last night and funeral services are
today (10 a.m, St. Charles Church in San Carlos) for Rick Maguire,
Olympic's Open Committee vice chairman, who died early Thursday at
age 50 following a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the good ideas for the tournament came from Rick,''
Hurd said. ``We lost a cornerstone.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; MISCELLANY:  &LR; The 1999 Open will be played at Pinehurst No.2
in Pinehurst, N.C. Tickets went on sale yesterday, by mail only.
For information, call (800) 336-4446. . . . Working in will-call
was an eye-opener for volunteer Jeanne Paparelli, who found out
that there are those confused about the concept. ``Some people
expect us to call someone for them or call them a cab. One man
wanted us to drive him to the clubhouse.'' . . . The Open was
viewed worldwide, so media tent volunteer Bob Seeger wasn't
surprised when he received a phone call Friday from Kuala Lumpur.
When he informed the caller about tee times ``tomorrow,'' the
caller said, ``You know, of course, it's already tomorrow here.''
Replied Seeger: ``Oh. Who won?'' . . . The PGA Tour resumes
Thursday with the Western Open in Chicago.

WARRIORS SWEAT OVER HUGHES 
BY DAVID STEELE
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Gary Fitzsimmons, the Warriors' assistant
general manager and one of the NBA's most astute talent scouts,
late last week tried to handicap the upcoming NBA draft. He figured
the first two players picked would be point guard Mike Bibby and
center Michael Olowokandi, probably in that order by the Clippers
and Grizzlies. Then, he said, ``(Numbers) three and four become
really the swing picks in the draft, and that will really determine
what's available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   How right he was. The Nuggets pick third in Wednesday's draft,
and the Raptors pick fourth _ followed by the Warriors at No.5.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Denver and Toronto were aggressively shopping
their picks; league sources are saying that Toronto and Vancouver
are discussing swapping picks, with the Raptors ending up with
Olowokandi and the Grizzlies with Michigan forward Robert Traylor
and guard Doug Christie.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that deal does not happen, the signs point to the
Raptors being wholly unimpressed with what is available at their
current draft position.
</P>
<P>
   Expect the Warriors to be waiting breathlessly on the Raptors'
final decision. Four players sit atop the Warriors' wish list,
roughly in this order: Saint Louis shooting guard Larry Hughes,
North Carolina swingman Vince Carter, North Carolina forward Antawn
Jamison and Kansas power forward Raef LaFrentz. Kansas swingman
Paul Pierce would make five, but only in the highly unlikely event
that he falls through the cracks amid all the wheeling and dealing
above them.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are that Hughes is the player the Warriors are
sweating over most; they paid a great deal of attention to the
6-foot-5 guard at the predraft camp in Chicago earlier this month,
and they like his combination of two-guard and point guard skills.
In his lone college season, the 19-year-old Hughes averaged 20.9
points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.2 steals.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Garry St. Jean has noted repeatedly that he has
no problem taking a player at a position the Warriors already have
filled (meaning that Jamison or LaFrentz have a chance).
</P>
<P>
   But with both backcourt positions in flux _ they're trying to
trade Latrell Sprewell, are prepared to lose Jim Jackson to free
agency and desperately need a starting point guard _ the Warriors
could stick Hughes into the lineup immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has a very good upside,'' St. Jean said recently.
``He has the potential to be a big point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Chicago camp, Hughes told Basketball News that the
Warriors were one of the ``one or two teams'' that had tracked him
closely. ``I've gotten every indication that they wouldn't mind
having me,'' he said of the Warriors. ``I've heard a lot of things
about them. I think there's a real good chance that's where I'll
wind up.''
</P>
<P>
   There's just as good a chance, however, that a team could jump
ahead of them into Toronto's spot and take Hughes. The Mavericks,
and ex-Warriors boss Don Nelson, are also hot after him, and they
choose sixth overall (although reports indicate that Nelson could
also trade down, pick up an extra first-round choice and get his
hands on the rights to German sensation Dirk Nowitzki).
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Warriors insist they will not be disappointed
with whoever they get at No. 5. They have not been scared off by
Jamison's lack of power-forward size nor his undemonstrated
perimeter game. Carter's athleticism intrigues them, as does the
fact that he played three years at a top-notch, proven program.
LaFrentz would be a longshot, partially because his position is one
the Warriors hope to fill through other avenues.
</P>
<P>
   The draft is one of three paths the Warriors can take to improve
on last year's disastrous 19-63 season. The others are a Sprewell
trade and free agency, both signing their own free agents and
bringing in others.
</P>
<P>
   Influencing these paths are the type of players available
through each. The draft (at least from where the Warriors sit)
happens to be the best source of shooting guards, with free agency
the favorite for a power forward and trades the best way to get a
point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an understanding of what we'd like to do via the
draft, via free agency and through trades,'' St. Jean said. ``And
as one (acquisition) comes, and we look at that, then look at what
comes next, we can make it all fall together. It may not be a
perfect formula right now in terms of order, but we think we can
bring it together.''

RAMGERS OFFENSE IS SNAKEBIT IN SHUTOUT LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The rash of poor performances by the Texas
Rangers rotation concealed the recent growth of an unattractive
wart.
</P>
<P>
   The American League's most productive lineup ceased production.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who endured their ninth defeat in the past 12
games, were shut out for the first time in 92 contests in a 6-0
loss to the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks Monday night at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers managed only nine base runners on seven hits and two
walks. Shortstop Kevin Elster, who hit ninth in the order,
collected three of those hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers afterward praised Diamondbacks right-hander Andy
Benes, who surrendered only six hits and one walk during eight
scoreless innings. Yet, it also should be noted that this lineup
hit only .241 during its past 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to battle through it,'' Rangers first baseman Will
Clark said. ``That's what we're in the process of doing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Benes (6-7) and one inning of scoreless
relief from left-hander Efrain Valdez represented the first shutout
thrown against the Rangers since former Detroit right-hander Scott
Sanders accomplished the feat Sept. 9, 1997, at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really didn't have too many good swings against him,''
Rangers manager Johnny Oates said of Benes. ``We just never got the
offense going. We didn't have too many base runners, and we didn't
hit too many balls hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had only four at-bats with runners in scoring
position. The first four hitters in the lineup _ center fielder Tom
Goodwin, second baseman Mark McLemore, left fielder Rusty Greer and
right fielder Juan Gonzalez _ failed on each occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Benes mesmerized the Rangers with all four pitches _ especially
the two breaking pitches _ in his arsenal: fastball, slider,
curveball and changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I kept the ball down and threw the ball
exceptionally well,'' Benes said. ``I went out and pitch, which is
what I expected to do, and _ after eight innings _ they hadn't
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one base-running mistake by Rangers third baseman Luis
Alicea kept the Benes-Valdez shutout intact. Alicea ran into an out
at third base attempting to stretch his third-inning double into a
leadoff triple. Right fielder Karim Garcia and second baseman Andy
Fox combined for two accurate throws to retire Alicea. The mistake
became more pronounced after the ensuing single by Elster.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in the ballgame,'' Oates said, ``that's a big
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett (4-8) gave the Rangers' struggling
rotation a shot in the arm with seven quality innings, but he ran
into a matchup too much for his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're solid one through nine,'' Benes said of the Rangers'
lineup. ``Their No. 9 hitter hit three BBs off me. You know whoever
is up there is going to be tough, so you just have to make more
quality pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Benes' 128 pitches fit that description.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good lineup,'' Clark said. ``It takes a very
well-pitched ballgame to do that against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but it might take just a little less at the moment.

REPLACING RUSSELL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Glenn Hoffman has come home. And it never felt
better.
</P>
<P>
   It was 18 years ago that Hoffman, an Orange County native and a
rookie with the Boston Red Sox, played for the first time at what
was then Anaheim Stadium. Singing the national anthem that night
was Ed Hoffman, Glenn's father, an usher at the stadium who
periodically put in double duty belting out the Star Spangled
Banner.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hoffman made another debut: He was
!ital!managing!off! his first major-league game for the Los Angeles
Dodgers. This time Ed Hoffman wouldn't be here on his son's big
day. He died three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Hoffman, however, played a role: Glenn received the
phone call that he was being promoted late Sunday _ Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it even more special to look at the schedule and find
out we were playing in Anaheim,'' he said shortly before Monday's
Dodgers-Angels game, his voice breaking just slightly. ``This is
the place I grew up 10 minutes from, and my dad worked here for 20
years singing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``...To get the call on Father's Day, there's a special message
there somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hoffman, only 39, special is the best word to describe this
day.
</P>
<P>
   He takes over a floundering team with half his players, it
seems, on the disabled list. He knows the Fox people aren't messing
around. If Mike Piazza can be traded, anybody can be let go. He
better win if he expects to be around for long.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Hoffman was in Calgary preparing for a game between
his Triple-A Albuquerque Dukes and the Cannons scheduled for today.
It was almost midnight on Sunday when he was told he would replace
Bill Russell and become only the fourth manager in Los Angeles
Dodgers history.
</P>
<P>
   Was he feeling the pressure on Monday?
</P>
<P>
   Nah. He was soaking it all in, beaming as he fielded questions
from dozens of reporters in front of the visitors' dugout. It was
the proverbial dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's emotion after emotion, the tears, the excitement,
everything all at once,'' he said. ``I've been asked to manage the
Los Angeles Dodgers....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to enjoy every moment of it.''
</P>
<P>
   His exuberance belies his image among the young Dodgers who have
played for him as a fiery but controlled competitor.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, whether he was managing in the minor leagues
or acting as minor-league field coordinator (since 1994), he
impressed the Dodgers organization with his knowledge of the game,
dedication, organizational skills and competitive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Interim general manager Tom Lasorda, one his mentors, told
Hoffman long ago that he would manage in the majors one day. He's
not a vocal motivator like Lasorda, however. In the minors, he had
other ways of getting the most out of his players while keeping the
game in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a competitor, he loves to win, he loves to play the
game,'' said Todd Hollandsworth, who played for Hoffman at both the
Double-A and Triple-A levels. ``That's what he's all about.... He
wants his guys to go out there and be fiery and play fundamentally
correct. But at the same time, have fun....
</P>
<P>
   ``We all understand this is a business. But he wants you to
understand this is the same game we played when we were kids. You
have to go out there and try to win but have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers haven't had a lot of fun in recent months, which is
in good part a product of losing. Which is why Russell is gone
after compiling a 36-38 record this season and Hoffman is here.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was asked several times about the daunting challenges
ahead. His answers carried the same message: positive, optimistic
but also realistic _ what one would expect to hear from a
first-time manager, especially one not prone to bluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of trying to win 12, 13 in a row,'' he said.
``We can't do it that way. It's not going to happen overnight. But
we're going to work at it.'' As he answered that question, it was
one of few times he wiped the smile off his face.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was going to ruin this day for Hoffman.

ORIOLES TOP METS, 7-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ New York Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was not around
long enough to see Brian McRae and Butch Huskey rifle back-to-back,
second-inning home runs off Mike Mussina at Camden Yards on Monday
night. Or, for that matter, to see the Orioles respond with shots
by Rafael Palmeiro and Cal Ripken Jr. off Bobby Jones on their way
to a 7-2 victory over the Mets in which Mussina retired the last 22
Mets he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Valentine wasn't present for the latest installment
in the Mets' lengthening slump was that he had been ejected in the
top of the second for arguing a called third strike on John Olerud.
</P>
<P>
   But the question being asked around baseball on Monday night was
whether Valentine will be around with the Mets next season if Tommy
Lasorda, suddenly back in a prominent role with the Los Angeles
Dodgers as their interim general manager, beckons Valentine to come
West. Valentine is under contract with the Mets through the year
2000, but Lasorda is his mentor and the Dodgers are the team he
started out with and the team many in baseball think he truly wants
to manage.
</P>
<P>
   And it was not just Valentine who had to answer questions about
his future on Monday night. For with Lasorda back in the picture,
the question of where Mets catcher Mike Piazza will be playing next
season becomes increasingly intriguing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is a free agent after the season, and while it was the
new owners of the Dodgers _ the Fox Group _ who stunningly traded
Piazza in May, there is nothing to prevent Piazza from going back
to Los Angeles next year. And since Piazza is very close to Lasorda
_ Piazza is his godson _ the notion that the Mets are in a strong
position to sign the catcher to an expensive long-term deal may no
longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his situation on Monday, Valentine said: ``I
have one of the greatest jobs in the world. And I'm not desirous of
any other job.'' When asked about Piazza's situation, and the Mets'
chances of re-signing him, Valentine was less emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's different than it was before,'' he said. ``Not
necessarily meaning that he's less likely to sign with us now. But
there will be more talk about a possible return'' to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   That discussion has apparently started on the sports-talk shows
in Los Angeles. But Piazza contended that he was not thinking about
the past or the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very much involved in my present situation with the guys
on this team,'' Piazza said. He said he was looking at Monday's
developments in Los Angeles _ Bill Russell and Fred Claire were
replaced as manager and general manager by Glenn Hoffman and
Lasorda _ ``as any outsider would.''
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the Mets have the inside track on re-signing
Piazza, because, as General Manager Steve Phillips said on Monday,
nobody else can formally negotiate with the All-Star catcher until
two weeks after the World Series ends. That is when eligible
players are allowed to declare free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Phillips said, ``we will make that effort prior to his
electing for free agency. I don't want to do hypotheticals. We will
make every effort to sign Mike. Our goal is to keep him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets are not believed to have had any negotiations
with Piazza, other than a get-acquainted meeting with one of his
representatives in Miami on May 26, four days after Phillips
acquired the catcher from the Florida Marlins, who had obtained him
a week earlier in a blockbuster trade with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers let Piazza go because they presumably did not want
to meet his asking price of a $100 million contract. Will the Mets
be willing to go that high? And how long will Piazza wait to hear
from the Mets before he decides to test the free agent waters after
the season, regardless of any offer the Mets propose.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, at least, Valentine represents a more clear-cut
situation because he is in the first year of a three-year, $2.1
million deal that he signed last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no escape clause or option to do anything else,''
Phillips said. ``It's a straight three-year contract. And Tommy
doesn't have his choice for anybody in baseball to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean Lasorda won't try, especially since
Hoffman, like Lasorda, is considered an interim replacement. After
all, when Lasorda was asked at his Hall of Fame induction last
summer who would be his preference for manager should he ever wind
up the general manager of a team, his answer was Valentine. And one
thing is certain: What happened in Los Angeles on Monday will
create a distraction for the Mets until the Valentine and Piazza
questions are clearly answered.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Mets, losers of five of their last six, are not a
team that needs distractions right now. Their back-to-back homers
against Mussina on Monday night were the only thing that stood
between the pitcher and a perfect game. He retired the first five
Mets he faced, gave up the home runs to McRae and Huskey, and then
retired the next 22 batters to close it out, with only three Mets
hitting the ball out of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's two-run home run put the Orioles ahead, 3-2, in the
third and Ripken hit a solo shot to make it 4-2 in the fourth, as
Jones, mired in a little slump of his own, fell to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it for the Mets, who often don't know where their
next run is coming from and who now can't be sure who their
manager, or catcher, will be next season.

NO DODGERS-STYLE CHANGES FOR RANGERS _ YET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Midnight Massacre swept through the Los
Angeles Dodgers late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   While longtime Dodgers officials were just beginning to mourn
the passing of former general manager Al Campanis, the new Fox
bosses were unceremoniously dumping both general manager Fred
Claire and manager Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's dismissal was hardly unexpected. His team was two
games under .500, 12 1/2 games out of first place and 17-16 since
the big trade with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Claire's dismissal was a little bit of an eye-opener, but then
Rupert Murdoch's errand boys have been moving quickly since taking
over less than three months ago, having already traded their best
player and marquee pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   So far their actions have made Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
look like the model of patience.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it can be sometimes when rich boys who are used
to getting their way take control of a new toy.
</P>
<P>
   But of course that can't happen here, not when Tom Hicks has
been saying all the right things since taking over the Rangers and
waxing poetic at every turn about his confidence in Tom Schieffer,
Doug Melvin and Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Rangers have slipped lately in the American
League West, nobody should be worried about a few baseball scalps
being hung in the same Hicks trophy case as a certain University of
Texas football coach.
</P>
<P>
   Should they?
</P>
<P>
   ``I put that pressure on myself regardless of who owns the
ballclub,'' Melvin said. ``I know the responsibilities of being a
general manager and I don't know if I've ever been in a situation
where I felt I could take it easy and have no pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put pressure on yourself to do your best. Whether you have
to do it immediately, I haven't got that sense. But I know Mr.
Hicks likes to win. He didn't buy this team just to be a member of
Major League Baseball. He wants this team to be one of the top
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But then there were the comments Oates made over the weekend
after watching Todd Van Poppel and Matt Perisho pitch against the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel was terrible, allowing five runs in two innings, and
afterward Oates said, ``What we saw today is unacceptable at the
major-league level. Actually it's unacceptable at any level.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who saw the performance said the manager was being
charitable, but such blunt criticism is still unusual for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the performances of Van Poppel and Perisho, Oates said, ``We
call two guys up and they don't go five innings between them. If
that's pressure on them, I'm sorry. We owe it to our fans to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Monday he was simply being honest. He also said he
feels no more of an urgency to win now than he did under the
previous ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to the ballpark to do the best job I can and my
expectations are the same, regardless of who owns the ballclub,''
Oates said. ``If we were 12 1/2 games behind and I still felt that
I had done the best job I could, then I would still feel good. But
if I felt I hadn't done the best I could, it would be tearing me
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates went through an ownership change midway through his
previous job. It was not a pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Oates had led the Orioles to two winning seasons when Peter
Angelos bought the team in 1994. Oates led them to a 63-49 record
that year but Angelos, after publicly stating his manager wasn't
fit to lead, fired him at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through that before,'' Oates said. ``There was a
time where I had to be a major-league manager and I felt I had to
do the job or else. Not any more. I have confidence in my ability
to manage and I'm going to give this job everything I've got. If I
don't, I probably should be doing something else anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said despite what has happened lately, he actually feels
encouraged about his ballclub, especially now that Mark McLemore
and Kevin Elster are off the disabled list and Darren Oliver will
be activated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be all right,'' Oates said. ``You look at those
three guys \RRick Helling, John Burkett and Aaron Sele\S and add
Oliver and that gives us four guys who give us a chance to win. Add
Todd or somebody else and we'll be fine. Overall, for the long
haul, I'm enouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin and Oates proved in 1996 they can win a championship
together. Last year proved that glory can be fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers Midnight Massacre reinforces what every baseball
official knows and that is, no owner _ good or bad _ remains
patient forever.

JORDAN SETS TERMS FOR RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Now that Phil Jackson has announced he will no longer
coach the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan has reversed his field and
said he will return to the NBA for another season if Scottie Pippen
and Dennis Rodman re-sign with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Jordan said he wouldn't play for any coach
other than Jackson, and would retire if Jackson was no longer
coaching the Bulls. But yesterday Jackson said his nine-year stint
as the Bulls coach is over, leaving Jordan to re-evaluate his own
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman will come back, but it
will take some time for them to think about it,'' Jordan said while
speaking yesterday at a youth basketball camp at the Austin
Convention Center. ``But I think there's a chance they will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue playing, but I want to play with the same
guys that I've been playing with. If not, it's been great. Those
things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson cleaned out his office yesterday at the Bulls' practice
facility in Deerfield, Ill., after turning down an offer from team
owner Jerry Reinsdorf to return as coach. After signing a one-year,
$6 million contract last summer, Jackson said this season would be
his last. He never wavered from that, telling his players from the
start of training camp that this was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel happy,'' Jackson said. ``I'm glad to be on my way out
of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jordan, ``If that's his decision, then I respect it.''
</P>
<P>
   And unless Pippen re-signs with the Bulls, the two who have been
together for all six titles will be going their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much longer this is going to last,'' Jordan
said of his 13-year career. ``It may be this year, or in five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls fans believe Chicago has at least another NBA championship
left, and would like to see Jordan, Pippen and Rodman stick around
for another coronation. Yesterday, at least, Jordan left that door
slightly ajar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches may not be the same and the players may not be the
same,'' he said. ``But that would be like starting over.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would consider being a player/coach for the Bulls,
Jordan explained that he does enough coaching at home with his
sons, Jeffrey and Marcus. Jeffrey is 9 years old, and Marcus 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between my two boys, that's probably as much coaching as I can
get,'' Jordan said. ``But things change. When I look back on my
career _ not that it's over with _ it'll be with happiness,''
Jordan, 35, said. ``I've had a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan told the 700 children yesterday: ``If I don't ever see
you again _ and I'm pretty sure I will _ make sure you listen to
your parents, your teachers, your grandparents and your guardians.
And don't ever give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy the game, and there are a lot of young players
in the league that still need some lessons,'' Jordan said. ``But
I've had a great time. If it ends today. I have no regrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Jordan was actually outdone by the Mavericks'
Michael Finley. who helped his team beat Jordan's, 117-111, in a
game at Southwest Texas State in San Marcos. Jordan, the obvious
fan favorite, had 39 points, but missed two jumpers in the final
minute that could have put his team back in the game. The sellout
crowd of 8,000 didn't care though, as they cheered his every move
as the soundtrack from Jordan's movie, ``Space Jam'', played every
time he scored.
</P>
<P>
   Finley finished with 51 points, making 10 3-pointers from the
shorter college 3-point line.

WHITMAN AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS AGREE ON BROAD OUTLINE OF STATE
BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Republican legislative leaders and Gov. Christie
Whitman agreed on the broad outlines of a new $18.2 billion state
budget on Monday that would increase spending by more than $1
billion for public schools, state colleges, open space preservation
and a handful of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers largely followed the spending plan that Whitman
first outlined in February, but they did reject a few of her
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   These included their decision not to eliminate the sales tax on
long-distance calls made within the state. They rejected proposed
cuts in the prescription program for low-income elderly residents.
And they stopped an effort by the Whitman administration to
eliminate some state jobs and turn them over to private
contractors, which Whitman said would save $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative leaders added almost $100 million in spending to
the governor's proposed budget for the fiscal year that begins July
1. The spending increases include $20 million for school
construction costs, $10 million for municipalities to keep down
property taxes, $10 million more to help maintain state parks and
$8.5 million in additional aid for middle-income school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in agreement on 99 percent of this budget,'' said Pete
McDonough, chief spokesman for Whitman. ``We will review the bill
after it is introduced and the governor will make her
determinations about line-item vetoes after the bill is passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget is expected to be considered by the budget committees
in the Senate and the Assembly on Thursday. It is expected to be
voted on by both houses early next week. Whitman is expected to
sign the new budget into law before the new fiscal year begins.
</P>
<P>
   State officials expect to end the current fiscal year on June 30
with a surplus of almost $1 billion and they estimate more than
$700 million in new revenues in the next fiscal year. The state's
economic boom has fueled budget largesse. The spending increase is
more than 6 percent over this year's state budget and is the
largest spending rise in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was unsuccessful in persuading lawmakers to raise the
gasoline tax by 2 cents a gallon to help pay for the preservation
of a million acres of farm land and other open space in the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But there is $50 million in the budget for the purchase of open
land. And Whitman and Republican legislative leaders have agreed on
a plan to borrow $1.4 billion in the next 30 years to meet the
governor's goals for preserving open space. The proposal, which
would go to the voters for approval in November, would cost
taxpayers about $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman administration officials and lawmakers said that the $50
million allocated in the new budget would be enough money for now
because the program would not begin until January.

MOOG RETIRES, SET TO SETTLE IN NORTH TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Moog carved out a significant following in four years as
the Stars' top goalie. Now, he's looking to carve out a home in
North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Moog announced his NHL retirement Monday, leaving behind a
guaranteed $1.5 million remaining on a contract with the Montreal
Canadiens in order to spend more time with his family in Coppell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said throughout my career that it isn't about
money,'' Moog said. ``Throughout these last few years I said each
season that if I didn't have the desire to play anymore, I would
quit. And right now, I don't have that desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog, 38, cited a variety of reasons that ranged from nagging
injuries to missing his family. After leaving the Stars as a free
agent last summer, Moog lived out of an apartment in Montreal for
one season while his wife Karla and three daughters lived in
Coppell, where Karla works as a substitute teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is retired, Moog said he and his family will spend
at least the next two years in Texas, where he will take a more
active role in running the Fort Worth Brahmas minor-league team, of
which he is a partial owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to be more involved, but it won't be on a daily
basis,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Moog is expected to contribute in ways that draw on his
visibility as a hockey icon in North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's obviously some things that I can do for the Brahmas
because of what I've been able to accomplish,'' he said. ``And I
think any time you're trying to sell hockey, it's good to have
hockey people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Moog retires with a 372-209-88 record, seventh on the all-time
wins list, and has the highest winning percentage (.621) of any
goalie to win 300 games. As a member of the Edmonton Oilers, he
helped earn three Stanley Cups (1984, '85 and '87), although mostly
as a backup to teammate Grant Fuhr. Moog was the No. 1 man in
earning the Boston Bruins the Jennings Cup in 1990 for lowest
goals-against average and in taking the Bruins to the Stanley Cup
Finals, where they lost to the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   While Moog said he has plenty to do with the Brahmas _ most
important, he said, is helping to select a new general manager _ he
said he'll likely take a step back from hockey for a while.
</P>
<P>
   When Moog decides to return, Stars general manager Bob Gainey
said that he has a standing offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he left here last year, we told him that were interested
in working something out with him,'' Gainey said.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' new general manager
said Monday, ``No, I don't foresee a great deal of changes.''
</P>
<P>
   From which we might learn something about Tom Lasorda even after
lo, his 49 years with the team.
</P>
<P>
   Either we learn he is a quick study, immediately applying the
first rule of front-office survival _ which is to avoid setting
impossible expectations in the way of trades and free-agent
signings. This is plausible, seeing that he's had his eye on this
job for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Or we learn he is so out of touch with the demands of his
office, somebody needs to sit him down with a job description and a
Dodgers roster.
</P>
<P>
   At the stadium press conference announcing that he is replacing
Fred Claire and Glenn Hoffman is replacing Bill Russell as manager,
Lasorda said the Dodgers have ``a lot of talent ... they just
haven't played up to their capabilities.'' Therefore, no major
changes are required.
</P>
<P>
   On this dubious point, the new Dodgers management team seemed in
general agreement. Peter O'Malley, embodying the old guard,
endorsed the thinking of first-year president Bob Graziano: ``I was
disappointed with the team's performance. I thought it was flat and
had been flat for some time.'' If the players could just unflatten,
no major changes would be required.
</P>
<P>
   But, heck, if no major changes were what the Fox Group wanted,
the owners could have stuck with Claire. And if no major changes
were what the team needed, it wouldn't have begun Monday night's
game in Anaheim 12{ games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, in his own quiet way, makes it clear he might like to
erase the ``interim'' from his title at the end of this season. If
he's serious about winning the job and if he's serious about making
the Dodgers competitive in 1998, he'll try to make his mark as soon
and emphatically as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The spoils of the Mike Piazza trade in May improved the batting
order, at least on paper. The Hideo Nomo trade in June got rid of
the dead weight in the starting rotation. Now it's time to work on
the rest of the pitching staff, which is so undistinguished, it
must be called the worst in the Dodgers' 40 years in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that where the Dodgers are concerned, the more
things change, the more things are likely to change. The firings of
Russell and Claire only portend more upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Were these smart moves? Even if you like and respect both men,
it's hard to argue with the facts. Under Russell, the Dodgers'
record is deteriorating for the second straight year. Under Claire,
the last great Dodgers moment occurred nearly 10 years ago. Few
managers and general managers get longer to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it took non-``baseball men'' like Graziano and the Fox
Group to remind sleepy Dodgers fans: You have to fire a manager
once every 44 years or so, just to keep people on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   What's unclear is whether Graziano is blaming the general
manager, Claire, for failing to procure good-enough players, or
blaming the field manager, Russell, for failing to win with players
who are good enough.
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be yes _ either, or both, whatever,
something had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is what happens this winter. Do both Lasorda
and Hoffman keep their jobs? Does neither? Lasorda but not Hoffman?
Hoffman but not Lasorda?
</P>
<P>
   The favorite, at this point, has to be neither.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano hung an ``interim'' tag around Lasorda's neck,
presumably as a reminder to Tommy, whose role is partially to help
find a permanent general manager. Listening to him talk Monday,
promising to fire up the team but making no mention of the tasks
normally associated with a GM, Lasorda sounded more like the new
manager than Hoffman did.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hoffman, although his title is not officially interim,
everything else suggests an October expiration date. Not having
been a local favorite as a player, or publicly groomed to manage
the Dodgers, he can be moved out of the way if a big-name manager
comes available. Mike Scioscia or Reggie Smith, the Dodgers coaches
most eligible for promotion, wouldn't have been so easily shunted
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the report last month in a Rupert Murdoch-owned New
York tabloid, that Florida Marlins manager Jim Leyland and GM Dave
Dombrowski would come to the Dodgers, makes a lot of sense.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, the Dodgers can advertise the most visible and
desirable manager and GM jobs in baseball. Leyland is almost
certain not to be back with the Marlins. Davey Johnson, if he
hasn't been hired elsewhere by then, will have been out of managing
for a full year.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be sitting in whose chair next opening day? Predictions
are pointless in the new Dodgers order. All that's for sure is that
change will beget more change, and whether or not anybody will
admit it, that's good.
</P>

IS LASORDA REALLY READY FOR THIS?
</HEADLINE>

By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tom Lasorda remembered that day 11 years ago when
his old friend Al Campanis was fired and his own dream of becoming
the Los Angeles Dodgers general manager ended.
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting in the visiting manager's office at the Houston
Astrodome and crying, partly for Campanis, whose racially
insensitive remarks on national television could never be taken
back. But there was much more.
</P>
<P>
   As Fred Claire flew in from Los Angeles to take over the
baseball operation, Lasorda also knew he'd never get the job he
really wanted, with his beloved Bobby Valentine as the manager.
</P>
<P>
   Campanis' forced resignation was the most traumatic moment in
Dodgers history until Sunday when his death became a footnote in
the firing of Claire and manager Bill Russell. Strangely, it also
was the day Lasorda, now 70, finally became the Dodgers general
manager, summoned late at night by a worried club president Bob
Graziano for the job of fixing a terribly broken team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Al died, I felt so bad, not just because he was so
important in my life but because of the way people remember him,''
Lasorda said. ``Now I have his old job. It is quite an honor.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't a real plan laid out at Monday's news conference to
announce the changes, no closer on the way, no new ace to take the
place of Ramon Martinez. But when he addressed the team for 45
minutes before its game against the Angels in Anaheim, Lasorda was
back on stage, part evangelist, part carnival barker, all Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   That is what he brings to the team now, 13{ games behind San
Diego in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   He inherits a team that is in a great position to mail in the
rest of the year. The Dodgers have a $57 million payroll and plenty
more tied up in long-term contracts. He has a pitching staff that
looks great for a night and awful for a week.
</P>
<P>
   He has new manager Glenn Hoffman, who played 13 big-league
seasons, but gets a team that is injured and indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's title of general manager also carries the disclaimer
``interim.'' There is a good chance the Dodgers just see him as
bridge to Pat Gillick or Andy McPhail, prototype GMs with records
of success.
</P>
<P>
   There also are concerns that Lasorda's resume does not qualify
him for the position, which has become increasingly technical the
past decade. He threw hours of batting practice to Steve Garvey and
Ron Cey, talked Orel Hershiser into greatness and took an average
team to the 1988 World Series title. Seems pretty tame compared to
designating a player for assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda never shied away from the crowds. When 100 fans followed
him into a bathroom at the 1991 World Series, he stopped to sign
autographs. When his players bet him he couldn't lose weight, he
dropped 40 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But GMs rarely carry a high profile. There is little theater in
the Rule 5 Draft. They sit in meetings and bargain with agents. For
every John Smoltz one steals for Doyle Alexander, there are 500
first-round picks who have to be released.
</P>
<P>
   But the past two years have been difficult for him since
stepping down as manager. He became a vice president for kissing
babies. The club sent him to Korea and the Dominican Republic,
basically to be Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did whatever they asked, gave speeches, went to dinner with
sponsors,'' he said. ``And that was fine. I've been here 49 years
and I wouldn't trade a minute. But there was something more I
wanted to do. I wanted to help build a team, for the fans and for
the city of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   He also seemed to lose that lovable side, often appearing surly
at public appearances. It was no secret that his long friendship
with Russell became strained. He had trouble letting go of the
limelight and the lineup card. Many in the organization think he
undermined Russell with the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   Campanis is gone and so are the O'Malleys. Valentine has a
three-year deal with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Nice dream.

INTERLEAGUE WARNING: IT IS STILL ONLY JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Let's get two things straight right off the bat, ash
or maple or whatever your preference:
</P>
<P>
   1. This is not a rematch of the 1996 World Series. These New
York Yankees and Atlanta Braves are not the Yankees and Braves of
1996, and this is June 1998, not October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   2. This is not a preview of the 1998 World Series. Yes, the
Yankees and the Braves could conceivably play each other in the
World Series come October, but this is June. The makeup of the
teams is not necessarily the same as it may be in October, and the
intensity of the competition is not what it would be in October.
</P>
<P>
   With those disclaimers out of the way, by all means enjoy the
four-game series the Yankees and the Braves began at Yankee Stadium
on Monday night. The disclaimers are simply to make sure that no
one tries to make more of the games here and in Atlanta than should
be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us might even make it to the World Series,''
said Tom Glavine, a member of the Braves' vaunted pitching
rotation. ``This doesn't mean anything come July, never mind
October.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won the first game, 6-4, because Greg Maddux had a
painful neck that limited him to six innings and the Braves'
bullpen could not hold a 4-3 lead. If there is a difference between
these two outstanding teams, if there is one edge the Yankees would
have if these teams were to play in the World Series, it is in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, especially with the lineup we have, to get a
complete game, said Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' starter on Monday
night. ``Our bullpen gives us an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager, was looking for two innings from
Dennis Martinez, a 43-year-old grandfather. But the often reliable
Martinez did not even make it out of the seventh inning, walking
two and giving up a two-out, two-run double to Tim Raines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw 30-some pitches to get two outs,'' Cox said. ``That's
not like Dennis. One thing he can do is throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Cox had defended his relievers, saying every
team blows a game now and then. But the Braves are working without
their flame-throwing closer, Mark Wohlers, who is in Florida
working on his inconsistent and ineffective pitching, and no one
has assumed his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes teams go through this,'' said Chipper Jones, the
Braves' third baseman. ``Relievers struggle for a certain period,
and you have to do the bullpen by committee.'' This committee,
however, needs a leader. ``It's up to somebody down there to step
up and take it upon themselves to be the man who's going to shut
the door when our starters can't go nine,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' starters all are capable of going the distance, but
even they don't do it too often. They have twice as many complete
games as anyone else in the National League, but their total is 12
in 76 games.
</P>
<P>
   If these teams are indeed heading for the World Series, the
Braves got a glimpse of what they face on Monday night. But this
was only one of 162 games on the regular-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Some amateur sports psychologists might suggest that teams in
these circumstances do consider the games important because each
wants to deliver a message to the other _ if they do play in
October, don't forget who was superior in June.
</P>
<P>
   But that idea works better in theory than in practice. In 1988,
the psychologists might recall, the New York Mets clearly
established their superiority over the Los Angeles Dodgers, winning
10 of their 11 regular-season games. Came the league championship
series, and the Dodgers were the team that went to the World
Series, the Mets the team that went home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fuss rages.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing that during the Montreal series,'' Cox said,
discussing the exaggerated emphasis placed on these games, ``and
all I was thinking about was beating Montreal. You look at the
schedule in spring training and say: `Boy, that will be a fun
series in New York. We get to go to Yankee Stadium.' That's as far
as it goes. Joe's trying to win a division; that's what we're
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Joe Torre, the Yankee manager, said he could not
wait to get the week over with. His week, though, will be far worse
than Cox's because the Yankees play the Mets this weekend, and that
is their most important series of the year, maybe even including
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an interesting thought. If the Yankees were to lose
all three games to the Mets but win the World Series, would George
Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, consider this a
successful season?
</P>
<P>
   With all of the talk about the World Series preview, it should
be recalled that last June, the Braves and the Orioles played each
other, then went on to achieve the best won-lost records in their
leagues. Their World Series preview, however, turned out to be no
preview at all.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team made it to the World Series.

 BBA-RED SOX-PHILLIES--BOS  
 EXTRA PUSH GETS PHILLIES BY RED SOX
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Larry Whiteside  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Monday night, the Red Sox got a painful reminder that you can't
score too many runs at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   The point was driven home in a 9-8 loss to the Philadelphia
Phillies before a crowd of 33,592 who were mostly glued to their
seats for all 10 innings it took to complete the first of four
interleague games between the teams.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, no lead was safe. Philadelphia went up, 3-0, only
to see the Red Sox go ahead with a solo run in the first and five
more in the fourth. Boston built an 8-3 lead with solo home runs by
Troy O'Leary and John Valentin. That should have been enough to pin
Philadelphia starter Curt Schilling with his eighth defeat, but he
got away clean, even though he did allow eight earned runs for only
the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling's teammates refused to lose, scoring six times against
Tim Wakefield and then finishing the job against the Red Sox
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia tied the game at 8-8 on a solo home run in the
eighth by Mark Lewis off Rich Garces. In the 10th, the Phillies
took advantage of Tom Gordon with three singles and a walk to plate
the winning run. Gregg Jefferies knocked in Alex Arias with a
two-out base hit, after Troy O'Leary had saved the Sox _ it seemed
_ by throwing out pinch runner Kevin Sefcik at home on Doug
Glanville's hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really know what's going to happen,'' said Sox
manager Jimy Williams. ``They score three to go ahead. The next
thing you know we're ahead by five. They fought back, too. That's
why this game can humble you.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by three in the first inning, Boston came
roaring back against Schilling, who was once Red Sox property and
is now one of the NL's toughest pitchers. Nomar Garciaparra got one
back in the bottom of the first. He tripled, extending his hitting
streak to 14 games, and scored on a base hit by Mo Vaughn. Boston
really came on in in the fourth and fifth innings, scoring seven
times to turn a 3-1 deficit into an 8-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of folding, Philadelphia went on the attack, sending
Wakefield to the showers with a three-run spurt in the sixth. In
the seventh, John Wasdin was charged with a run, and the cushion
suddenly was one, 8-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Lewis hit a blast off Garces over the left-field
screen, depriving Wakefield of a chance at victory and taking
Schilling off a giant hook. Schilling escaped despite allowing 12
hits. He did strike out 10 and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon entered in the 10th, and right away there were signs of
trouble. A single by Kevin Jordan was followed by a sacrifice bunt
and a walk. Glanville followed with a single to left, but Sefcik
was thrown out as catcher Scott Hatteberg survived a full-scale
crash that earned a standing ovation. But when Jefferies singled to
right, a faster Arias beat the throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got behind a couple of the hitters,'' said Gordon. ``When
I'm ahead, I can use my curveball. It didn't happen tonight. You
hate to lose but these things will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox just have to take this one in stride, said Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss,'' he said. ``But we're not perfect. We're
not machines. You have to put this behind you. We've been playing
well. I expect to see Garces back in that spot again. He's pitched
well. Just pick it up and keep going. You can't hang your head. You
have to just keep on pushing.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York City is taking a pounding from the movie
industry this season, what with an overgrown lizard squishing it, a
tsunami engulfing it and an asteroid bopping it hard enough to make
anyone wish he had a bunker of his own.
</P>
<P>
   This, some are convinced, is Hollywood's way of saying it really
loves us. Maybe there is something to that. Cinematically speaking,
New York is hot. There were 213 feature films shot here last year,
a record, and while the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and
Broadcasting will not say how 1998 is shaping up, the city seems to
be doing well enough.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't, the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens would
presumably not be planning to expand, and a couple of young
entrepreneurs would not be trying to build a large movie studio in
the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They are far enough along to have received
City Hall's go-ahead, provided they also get the necessary private
financing by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attraction for a lot of writers and directors is the city
itself,'' said James Rutherford, a managing director at J.P. Morgan
and the project's financial adviser. Now, once the New York
exterior shots are taken care of, actors and crews usually trek
back to Los Angeles for the indoor scenes. In theory, a
Hollywood-style operation in the Navy Yard would keep them hanging
around, and spending money, the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to make it easy for the people who want to be
here,'' Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   New York's appeal to moviemakers goes back a long way, a point
that was reaffirmed the other day when the American Film Institute
came up with its 100 best American films of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The howls of protest over this list were immediate and, many
would say, justified. How, they asked, did ``Dances With Wolves''
qualify (No. 75) but nothing by Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturges?
The absence of any Audrey Hepburn movie other than the plodding
``My Fair Lady'' (No. 91) is reason alone to arouse suspicion; take
it from someone who has been in love with her since he first saw
``Breakfast at Tiffany's.''
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the Top 100 includes many indisputably great
films, and nearly a quarter of them, 23, are set in this city,
entirely or in part. All were not shot here. But even if filmed on
sound stages, New York was their backdrop, including No. 1,
``Citizen Kane,'' and No. 100, ``Yankee Doodle Dandy.''
</P>
<P>
   No other place is remotely as popular, and the city does even
better in the Top 50, where it figures in 15 films, or 30 percent.
Among them are the first two ``Godfather'' movies (ranked Nos. 3
and 32), ``All About Eve'' (16) ``Raging Bull'' (24) ``Annie Hall''
(31) ``Rear Window'' (42) and ``Taxi Driver'' (47).
</P>
<P>
   (Confession: Rigorous standards were bent slightly to include
No. 50, ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' On their way to
Bolivia, Butch and Sundance stopped by Coney Island.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Manhattan's a small island, and so many people
of diverse backgrounds share it, is one reason the city's such a
great destination for film makers,'' said Bruce Goldstein, who has
put together several programs of New York movies for the Film Forum
in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein traces New York movies from the 1920s and 30s, when
neighborhoods like Orchard Street and Park Avenue were used to
establish class differences, through the New York films noirs of
the 40s and 50s, to the falling-apart city of the 70s: a
nightmarish vision, he says, that ``didn't stop even when things
got better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's so visual,'' he said. ``It always has been, and it
still is. Every studio back lot had a New York street, not a Boston
street or a San Francisco street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, for one, has little use for a ``best'' list that leaves out
a searing New York film like ``Sweet Smell of Success.'' But there
are compensations. One could argue that the three top-rated films
all make important nods to the city: ``Citizen Kane'' and ``The
Godfather'' for sure, in first and third place, but also
``Casablanca,'' ranked No. 2 and not included in the earlier count
of 23 New York films.
</P>
<P>
   You are perhaps shocked, shocked, to hear that the city figures
in that Humphrey Bogart classic? It does.
</P>
<P>
   When a German officer speculates about taking over New York,
Bogart tells him, ``There are certain sections of New York, major,
that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.'' With that Gotham
spirit, World War II was won.

NEW BRASS, SAME RESULT FOR DODGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Somewhere in Glendale Monday night, Bill
Russell got a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The deposed Los Angeles Dodgers manager didn't lie in bed,
wondering how his team _ and bullpen in particular _ could blow a
four-run, seventh-inning lead to the Anaheim Angels. That was
interim manager Glenn Hoffman's job now.

   In Hoffman's debut, the Angels rallied for one run in the
seventh, four in the eighth and one in the ninth on Tim Salmon's
bases-loaded walk to beat the Dodgers, 6-5, Monday night before
43,491, the biggest crowd in Edison Field history.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now won 19 of 22 and moved 3{ games ahead of
Texas in the AL West. The Dodgers fell a season-worst 13{ games
behind San Diego in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes left the game leading 4-1 after
giving up a double to Gary DiSarcina leading off the eighth. Scott
Radinsky came in to replace Valdes, and three batters later, the
game was tied at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad doubled in one run, Dave Hollins singled in another
and Jim Edmonds doubled home Hollins to tie the game at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McMichael replaced Radinsky and struck out Tim Salmon, but
Cecil Fielder followed with a single to right field, scoring
Edmonds for a 5-4 lead and what seemed would be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival, looking for save No.24, retired the first two
batters in the bottom of the ninth. He then fell behind 2-0 to
pinch-hitter Matt Luke, who the lined Percival's next pitch 10 rows
up into the right-field bleachers to tie the game at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   But it only delayed what seemed to be inevitable, the way things
have been going for both teams. In the bottom of the ninth,
McMichael walked Justin Baughman to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman went to second on DiSarcina's sacrifice bunt. After
Erstad was walked intentionally, Craig Shipley, a former Dodger in
the game as a defensive replacement, struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman then brought in left-handed reliever Mark Guthrie, who
walked Edmonds to load the bases. Hoffman summoned right-hander Jim
Bruske to face Salmon, who walked on a 3-1 count to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson staked Valdes to a 4-0 lead
almost single-handedly. Johnson, batting only .211 entering the
game, singled in the second and fourth innings and doubled in the
sixth off Olivares. Each hit scored a run, the fourth run coming in
on an error.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Dodgers had only four hits, all off Olivares,
until Luke's homer in the ninth off Percival tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Angels' clubhouse was a place of refuge.
While the horde of media gathered in around the Dodgers' clubhouse
and dugout, the Angels got ready for Monday's game in peace, except
for the sounds of Kool and the Gang's ``Celebration'' blaring from
the elaborate sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Angels are in first place and the Dodgers are
struggling to remain in the race. But the Dodgers are still the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's never going to change,'' said
Angels outfielder Garret Anderson, who grew up in the San Fernando
Valley. ``That's just the way it is, the way it's always going to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much tradition in Dodger history for us to get in
front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of World Series experience as an
organization,'' DiSarcina said. ``It's a strong organization. I
look at it as an abnormal year for them. It's always like there's a
stamp of approval on the Dodgers, because they've won. You can't
blame the fans for wanting to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in the shadows,'' Edmonds said. ``It's nothing we
can change. It's something we've dealt with, and are going to have
to deal with.''

CACHE OF CHEMICALS FOUND IN BRONX HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officers responding to a report of a burglary
in the Bronx on Monday afternoon discovered several boxes of rare
chemicals, some of which were radioactive and flammable, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals, found in the basement of a house at 4543 Bronx
Boulevard in the Wakefield section, included small quantities of
napalm, carbon 14, radium 226, chlorine 35, krypton 85, strontium
90 and cesium 135, said Charles Sturcken, chief of staff of the
city's Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel initially evacuated about 15 people from
seven adjacent houses, taking them to Public School 16 under the
auspices of the Red Cross. But by late Monday night, the
authorities, after determining that the materials emitted only low
levels of radioactivity and that there was no immediate danger,
allowed the people to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough to make a bomb,'' said an investigator who
spoke on the condition of anonymity, referring to the radioactive
materials. ``It was about the same amount as you'd find in a
dentist's office.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and investigators identified the resident of 4543
Bronx Boulevard as Carl Natanagara, 30, who neighbors described as
reclusive. They said Natanagara's father, who died recently, had
worked at Nuclear Research Corp., a Dover, N.J., company that
supplies radiation monitoring equipment. Natanagara's mother, they
added, now lives in a nursing home in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   All the chemicals, which environmental officials said were
safely stored, bore the label of the Nuclear Research Corp.,
Sturcken said. On Monday night, officials said company
representatives were at the scene and working with the authorities
to remove the chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what, if anything, Natanagara
planned to do with the chemicals, some of which are used in Geiger
counters. But investigators speaking on the condition of anonymity
said that the chemicals might have been in the house for as many as
15 years, and that Natanagara might not have been aware of them. By
early Tuesday morning, the police had not filed any charges against
Natanagara.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that the incident began shortly before 1 p.m.
when they received calls that someone had broken into Mr.
Natanagara's home. When the police arrived, Natanagara told them
that he had locked his keys inside and had kicked open the door to
gain access, said Detective Robert Samuel, a spokesman for the
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   When the police entered the house, they noticed a box labeled
``radioactive,'' Samuel said. An inspection of the box revealed
low-level radioactive material used to calibrate Geiger counters.
Officers also found 2 pints of napalm, 15 gallons of hydrochloric
acid, a .22-caliber handgun, a .22-caliber rifle, black powder and
various types of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the police could not identify some of the chemicals,
Samuel said. As a result, they called in an army of public agencies
_ including the FBI, the city Department of Health and the city
Office of Emergency Management _ to monitor the situation while
they evaucated the neighbors.

MARINERS' DEFENSIVE LAPSE LIFTS PADRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Say this for the Mariners. If they haven't exposed
their various warts enough times for their followers, they trot
them out at regular intervals seemingly just to reinforce the
point.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night at the Kingdome, another Mariner castoff succeeded
on the mound against Seattle, and the M's damaged themselves with
another mysterious defensive lapse in a 5-3 interleague loss to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Stop us if you've heard this one before.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of game we've been losing,'' said Alex
Rodriguez, the Mariner shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reconsidered. ``Blowouts, too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Hitchcock, dealt out of Seattle after the '96 season so
the M's could add a right-handed arm in Scott Sanders, tightroped
through six innings of two-hit ball and left with a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get the victory because he allowed a Rodriguez solo
homer, his 26th, and the Padre setup men were less overpowering
than usual. The San Diego closer had no problems, however;
presented a 5-3 lead in the ninth, Trevor Hoffman recorded his 23rd
straight save of the year and 31st over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner left-hander Jeff Fassero failed in his seventh straight
try to get his sixth victory. He hasn't won since May 16.
</P>
<P>
   But, aside from Hitchcock's pitching, what 41,571 Mariner fans
will likely take away from the game is another unspeakable
defensive play that nudged a 1-0 San Diego lead to 3-0, from which
Seattle never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Padre Greg Vaughn doubled and Ruben Rivera
walked. Catcher Jim Leyritz, who made it into town at 2 a.m. Monday
after being traded from Boston, lofted an eminently catchable ball
into short right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' said Fassero. ``I thought I was out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   But second baseman Joey Cora wove uncertainly after the towering
pop and right fielder Jay Buhner, playing deep, appeared to think
Cora had it under control. He didn't, waving futilely at it as
Buhner charged in, and the gift double gave San Diego two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what happened,'' said Mariner manager Lou
Piniella. ``Jay's leg has been bothering him, as you know. The ball
was up there a long time. But I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock quickly gave back one-third of the lead on Rodriguez'
homer, and left after the sixth with a 3-1 lead. The M's tagged
three balls to the warning track against him and drilled another
back to the box that he turned into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he lowered his earned-run average to 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have real good command,'' Hitchcock said. ``But it
seemed like when I needed to, I got out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It went to the eighth tied 3-3 after Rodriguez's two-run double,
when San Diego put the screws to the M's, with the help of another
near-miss play, this one a little more understandable.
</P>
<P>
   First, hitter extraordinaire Tony Gwynn, whom Fassero had
retired three straight times, managed to squeeze a pivotal walk
from the Mariner starter, checking his swing on a 3-2 slider that
dipped low and outside. A lesser hitter than Gwynn probably strikes
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe up an inch and he swings at it,'' sighed Fassero.
``Obviously, he was going out to get it. He just held up enough to
check his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Ken Caminiti then chipped a wedge shot that was
headed over the left shoulder of Rodriguez, who instead turned to
his right. By the time he could try to compensate and glove it on
the other side, it was falling for a hit, sending Gwynn to third.
Rivera's double down the left-field line then plated both Padre
runs, sending the National League West leaders to their 50th
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to make a very good play, but I came up
short,'' Rodriguez lamented. ``In your eyes, it might have been a
good game for me, but in my eyes, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I read it. I messed it up. I blew it. That's a play
that has to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's had a gasp left in the eighth, putting two runners on
with one out. But Dan Wilson, mired in a 6-for-38 slump, grounded
into a force and pinch-hitter Russ Davis struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't get the victory, but he's on a club 24 games
over .500, not one 15 games out of a division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't understand,'' he said, referring to
the trade, ``about three days before it, I talked to Lou in Tampa,
and he said he was comfortable going with four lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make baseball sense? Yeah, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, with the finale of the series at 3:35 p.m.
Tuesday, the M's will take baseball sense wherever they can get it.

   ``Yeah,'' said Fassero. ``I thought I was out of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   But second baseman Joey Cora wove uncertainly after the towering
pop and right fielder Jay Buhner, playing deep, appeared to think
Cora had it under control. He didn't, waving futilely at it as
Buhner charged in, and the gift double gave San Diego two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what happened,'' said Mariner manager Lou
Piniella. ``Jay's leg has been bothering him, as you know. The ball
was up there a long time. But I don't know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock quickly gave back one-third of the lead on Rodriguez'
homer, and left after the sixth with a 3-1 lead. The M's tagged
three balls to the warning track against him and drilled another
back to the box that he turned into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he lowered his earned-run average to 3.63.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have real good command,'' Hitchcock said. ``But it
seemed like when I needed to, I got out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   It went to the eighth tied 3-3 after Rodriguez's two-run double,
when San Diego put the screws to the M's, with the help of another
near-miss play, this one a little more understandable.
</P>
<P>
   First, hitter extraordinaire Tony Gwynn, whom Fassero had
retired three straight times, managed to squeeze a pivotal walk
from the Mariner starter, checking his swing on a 3-2 slider that
dipped low and outside. A lesser hitter than Gwynn probably strikes
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe up an inch and he swings at it,'' sighed Fassero.
``Obviously, he was going out to get it. He just held up enough to
check his swing.''
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Ken Caminiti then chipped a wedge shot that was
headed over the left shoulder of Rodriguez, who instead turned to
his right. By the time he could try to compensate and glove it on
the other side, it was falling for a hit, sending Gwynn to third.
Rivera's double down the left-field line then plated both Padre
runs, sending the National League West leaders to their 50th
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to make a very good play, but I came up
short,'' Rodriguez lamented. ``In your eyes, it might have been a
good game for me, but in my eyes, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I read it. I messed it up. I blew it. That's a play
that has to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The M's had a gasp left in the eighth, putting two runners on
with one out. But Dan Wilson, mired in a 6-for-38 slump, grounded
into a force and pinch-hitter Russ Davis struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock didn't get the victory, but he's on a club 24 games
over .500, not one 15 games out of a division lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I didn't understand,'' he said, referring to
the trade, ``about three days before it, I talked to Lou in Tampa,
and he said he was comfortable going with four lefties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make baseball sense? Yeah, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   And these days, with the finale of the series at 3:35 p.m.
Tuesday, the M's will take baseball sense wherever they can get it.

DODGERS LOSE IN HOFFMAN'S DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Somewhere in Glendale Monday night, Bill
Russell got a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The deposed Los Angeles Dodgers manager didn't lie in bed,
wondering how his team _ primarily the bullpen _ could blow a
four-run, seventh-inning lead to the Anaheim Angels. That was
interim manager Glenn Hoffman's problem now.
</P>
<P>
   In Hoffman's debut, the Angels rallied for one run in the
seventh, four in the eighth and one in the ninth on Tim Salmon's
bases-loaded walk to beat the Dodgers 6-5 Monday night before
43,491, the biggest crowd in Edison Field history.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have now won 19 of 22 and moved 3{ games ahead of
Texas in the AL West. The Dodgers fell a season-worst 13{ games
behind San Diego in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman probably didn't get much sleep Monday considering the
events of the day, which he termed bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a few people that become managers go through this,''
Hoffman said. ``I wouldn't trade it for the world, except for one
thing _ a win in the ninth. It is not a perfect situation right
now, but we're trying to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman and the Dodgers attracted most of the attention before
and after the game, but Angels manager Terry Collins said he can
live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nobody wants to pay attention to us, that's fine,'' he
said. ``I know one thing _ I want to play in October. Then people
will notice us. We'll be happy to get a couple wins, sneak out of
town and stay out of your hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes left the game leading 4-1 after
giving up a double to Gary DiSarcina leading off the eighth. Scott
Radinsky came in to replace Valdes, and three batters later, the
game was tied at 4. Darin Erstad doubled in one run, Dave Hollins
singled in another and Jim Edmonds doubled home Hollins to tie the
game at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McMichael replaced Radinsky and struck out Salmon, but
Cecil Fielder followed with a single to right field, scoring
Edmonds for a 5-4 lead and what seemed would be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival, looking for save No.24, retired the first two
batters in the top of the ninth. He then fell behind 2-0 to
pinch-hitter Matt Luke, who lined Percival's next pitch 10 rows up
into the right-field bleachers to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   But it only delayed what seemed to be inevitable, with the way
things have been going for both teams. In the bottom of the ninth,
McMichael walked Justin Baughman to lead off the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman went to second on DiSarcina's sacrifice bunt. After
Erstad was walked intentionally, Craig Shipley, a former Dodger in
the game as a defensive replacement, struck out. Hoffman then
brought in left-handed reliever Mark Guthrie, who walked Edmonds to
load the bases. Hoffman summoned right-hander Jim Bruske to face
Salmon, who walked on a 3-1 count to win it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to control my emotions in that situation,''
Salmon said, ``and not get too jumpy.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Charles Johnson helped Valdes and the Dodgers jump out
to a 4-0 lead. Johnson, hitting only .211 going into the game,
singled in the second and fourth innings off Angels starter Omar
Olivares, and he doubled in the sixth. Each hit scored a run, the
fourth run coming in on an error.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Dodgers had only four hits off Olivares, until
Luke's homer in the ninth off Percival tied it.
</P>
<P>
   Pervical (1-2) got the win over McMichael (1-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume that was what playoff atmosphere is like in
Anaheim,'' Salmon said. ``I've never seen it before. That's what it
was like in Seattle a couple years ago (in the one-game playoff).''

GIANTS OUTSLUG A'S 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ If Kevin Mitchell had his way, the A's and
Giants would have it out in a vacant warehouse somewhere,
splattering each other with paint-ball pellets. If they did, it
wouldn't look much messier than Monday night's 12-8 Giants victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants busted out with a season-high nine-run rally in the
fifth, making the most of the A's weak bullpen; every Giants
starter scored a run; and the A's lost three different players to
injury: starter Kenny Rogers, Mitchell (back spasms), and catcher
A.J. Hinch (elbow).
</P>
<P>
   Losing Rogers after three sharp innings to a strained oblique
muscle doomed the A's. ``That was a terrible break,'' A's manager
Art Howe said. ``That changed the whole complexion of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   All that mayhem should have left both teams on cruise-control,
but instead they both kept banging out hits all game long,
including a Rickey Henderson solo shot in the eighth and a leadoff
double from Matt Stairs in the ninth, giving him his first career
four-hit game.
</P>
<P>
   But once Stairs reached base in the ninth, Giants closer Robb
Nen went to work and gave the fans something to cheer about. That's
right, it was the second-largest crowd of the season at the
Coliseum, 36,096, and these people were Giants fans, cheering for
J.T. Snow's defensive-replacement appearance late in the game (a
stirring moment) almost as loudly as they cheered Henderson's homer
and the fireworks that followed.
</P>
<P>
   As Nen made quick work of Mike Blowers, Jason Giambi and Rafael
Bournigal in the ninth, the fans in the first deck rose to their
feet and cheered like crazy. Soon it was over and Kirk Rueter (9-3)
had his fifth straight victory, leaving him with three more wins
than any other Giant starter.
</P>
<P>
   Once Rogers left the game, the Giants celebrated like kids whose
parents have just left town for a week's vacation. Rogers held them
to one hit and precious few good swings, but going against reliever
Aaron Small gave the Giants a whole different look. Small found a
way to get out of the fourth without mishap, despite Barry Bonds'
one-out flare double to shallow right, but ran out of luck in the
nine-run, eight-hit fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jones started the inning with a double, Marvin Benard
sacrificed him to third, then eight straight Giants hitters reached
base, none of them wasting much time before lunging at fat
offerings. Small gave up seven runs in 11/3 innings, lifting his
ERA to 7.25 and raising the question ``How much more of him do the
A's need to see?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the quickest nine runs I've ever seen scored,''
Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``That was the quickest I've seen
since the Big Red Machine did it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   That should have ended the game, right then and there, but oh
no, not hardly. The A's scored five runs in the sixth to make it a
9-6 game, rookie shortstop Miguel Tejada falling a few feet shy of
a grand slam that inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got right back in the ballgame,'' Baker said. ``I'm glad
our guys had their hitting shoes on because THEIR guys sure did.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally might have had a little more oomph to it if Ryan
Christenson had not pinch-hit for Mitchell, who left with a sore
back, and if Izzy Molina had not pinch-hit for Hinch, who left with
a sore left elbow. That isn't a knock on Molina, who came through
with a pinch single to center to keep the rally alive. But the
sense that the A's were dropping like flies did not help their
prospects, even though after the game the word was Hinch and
Mitchell should both be available soon.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Buddy Groom came out in relief of left-hander Mike
Mohler in the seventh with two runners on base, and shortstop Rey
Sanchez liked Groom's first pitch so much, he launched it over the
left-center-field wall for a three-run homer. Even that didn't
quite end it, but it was one more sign that the A's couldn't win
just by throwing up more runs, not without Rogers in there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to see anybody get hurt,'' Baker said.
``Certainly Kenny Rogers is one of the best pitchers around. When
your starting pitcher gets hurt that early, you have to go to the
bullpen early and that makes it tough the next night and the next
night.''

SUSAN YOACHUM, CHRONICLE POLITICAL EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH J. GARCIA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; Chronicle Political Editor Susan Yoachum, who
covered two decades of electoral campaigns with the same passion,
determination and irrepressible spirit she later brought to her
fight against breast cancer, died Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum, who had battled the disease for seven years, was 43.
</P>
<P>
   She died, surrounded by family members, at home in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  ``The Chronicle newsroom is a sad place today,'' said
Managing Editor Jerry Roberts. ``In Susan, we have lost a tough
reporter, a stylish writer, a beloved friend and colleague and,
most of all, a remarkable human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum was renowned on the campaign trail for her tenacity, her
humor, her sophistication and her competitive knack for seizing on
scoops and breaking stories. She often worked around the clock
while on the road, filing dispatches for numerous editions.
Diagnosed with cancer in 1991, she continued to work, and her
editorial output remained remarkably prolific and diverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great loss for journalism, it is a great loss for
humanity, and for all of us who are women, it is a loss of one of
the great ones,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein. ``I know of no one
who fought a better fight against cancer with such overwhelming
determination. She inspired literally everyone who talked with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Board of Supervisors adjourned Monday in
Yoachum's memory, and Mayor Willie Brown said Tuesday he will order
all flags on city buildings flown at half-staff in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She embodied the highest ideals of public service,'' said
Supervisor Michael Yaki. ``To face her illness the way she did was
a testimony to the kind of human spirit we would all like to see in
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Yoachum revealed in a first-person story that her
cancer had returned and was spreading through her body after being
in remission for several years. Her moving disclosure prompted a
health columnist for the Wall Street Journal to call her ``a
real-life Murphy Brown'' for her courage in sharing her private
battle with hundreds of thousands of readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her work has has been a lighthouse beam through the fog of
local and national politics,'' the Journal's Marilyn Chase wrote.
``She stands as a model of professionalism and courage in the
workplace. The lesson for colleagues of cancer survivors:
Professionalism doesn't disappear with a diagnosis.''
</P>
<P>
   As political editor, Yoachum understood prepackaged candidates,
prearranged conventions and predictable stump speeches. She could
sniff out a story, a fib, a hint of scandal or a dodged question
with uncanny speed. She kept her competitors running and the
politicians running harder.
</P>
<P>
   She had a passion for political campaigns and a healthy, if
skeptical, view of career politicians. In the often-raucous world
of campaign reporting still largely dominated by men, she showed
that she was more than a match for ``The Boys on the Bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved politics, and she hated hypocrisy,'' said Phil
Trounstine, political editor of the San Jose Mercury News, where
Yoachum covered politics during the 1980s. ``She was tough, sharp
and fair and a great friend. Everyone in the political press corps
loved and respected Susan Yoachum. She was just a wonderful human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Born on May 12, 1955, in Dallas, Texas, Susan Gail Yoachum was
the daughter of Betty and the late Charles G. Yoachum. She
graduated in 1975 from Southern Methodist University in Dallas with
bachelor's degrees in journalism and political science. She was a
reporter for the Dallas Morning News, the Independent Journal in
Marin County and the San Jose Mercury News, where she was part of a
team that won a 1990 Pulitzer Prize for breaking news. She joined
The Chronicle in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest political dramas of the '80s and '90s were
published under her byline.
</P>
<P>
   She covered national, state and local politics for The
Chronicle, and her assignments included the 1992 presidential
campaign, the governor's races in 1990 and 1994, the 1991 San
Francisco mayoral race and the 1992 U.S. Senate race. She wrote
in-depth about issues, from affirmative action to abortion, from
the tobacco tax to the hazards of toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum was promoted to political editor in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In August, she was named journalist of the year by the Northern
California chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Some
400 people honored her at that awards banquet with repeated
standing ovations _ and many tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my moment,'' Yoachum said that night, in an emotional
acceptance speech. Days later, her illness suddenly worsened as the
cancer entered its final phase.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist and a role model, Susan has been an
unparalleled asset to the Bay Area,'' said Sally Lehrman, chapter
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum was an evocative writer and a voracious reader whose
love of language surfaced at an early age: She became the National
Spelling Champion in 1969, winning her crown by correctly spelling
the word ``interlocutory.''
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, she communicated the drama of American politics
_ its joys, intrigues and deceptions _ in her stories. She was also
an articulate, funny and in-demand national political analyst on
both television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   A true daughter of Texas, Yoachum lapsed into a sly southwestern
drawl whenever it suited her purpose. Her refreshing candor and
insight _ along with tough questions, usually delivered with a
disarming smile _ made her a popular and frequent guest on programs
ranging from CNN's ``Inside Politics'' to news shows on virtually
every Bay Area radio and television station.
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum earned a widespread reputation for her integrity and
balance _ which won her the respect of the elected officials and
insiders she covered.
</P>
<P>
   A tribute to her fairness came as news of her illness spread.
Sources and contacts across the political spectrum called to offer
their prayers, support and help.
</P>
<P>
   ``She paid attention and listened and sought both sides and was
always looking to be fair,'' recalled Ken Khachigian, a political
consultant who has worked for many Republican candidates, ``I have
no idea what her own political leaning was, which says something.
There was a reporter in her heart.''
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing treatment for tumors both in 1991 and 1992,
Yoachum remained cancer-free until the spring of 1997 _ a five-year
period that cancer specialists say indicates a ``cure.'' But a few
weeks later while making a call on a story, she felt a lump in her
neck. She immediately went to her doctor. Soon after, she learned
the cancer had returned.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the cancer was spreading through her body so
fast that the last round of chemotherapy seemed to do little but
make her more ill. But she managed to file for the paper one last
time, offering a withering view of the gubernatorial debate on May
13 that was marred by a technical glitch.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a 10-minute television blackout, she wrote, would
viewers have bothered to ``watch Al Checchi again duck the question
of why he was evidently too busy in the '90s to vote. ... Or was it
simply an `X-Files' moment, complete with alien abductions?''
</P>
<P>
   Her prose was as amusing and trenchant as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, she dubbed Democratic candidates Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer _ who would become the first pair of women from the same
state to serve in the Senate _ ``the Thelma and Louise of American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, she took aim at President Clinton during his
annual address.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his fifth State of the Union address last night, the
president came perilously close to giving a strong, memorable
speech. Then he kept talking for another 30 minutes,'' she wrote.
``The speech delivered more promises than most could count and more
preaching than some would want.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum wrote and spoke with authority, optimism and a friendly
accessibility that belied her toughness. She knew her way around a
smoke-filled room, a council chamber or the back of Air Force One.
No one intimidated her, and everyone knew it. She never shied away
from a good story _ or a fight with sources or editors to get it
into the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Yet of all the battles she encountered, the most difficult was
her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have metastatic breast cancer,'' she wrote last September.
``It's a tough word to spell and an even harder one to say, but its
meaning is rather simple. It means a runaway train is careening
through my body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know that I'm scared _ and that I feel good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum's raw pain touched countless women with breast cancer _
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many others, I cried when I read Susan Yoachum's stark
accounting of her life with metastatic breast cancer,'' one reader
wrote in a letter to the editor. ``I know it will not only help
those who are similarly stricken, but the goals of better cancer
research and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum did not hesitate to make such connections about the
disease _ or to be an ardent advocate for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   She frequently spoke to local women's groups and political
organizations, introducing herself with the phrase, ``I'm a breast
cancer survivor.'' It was her chance to give a human dimension to a
medical headline _ and to give hope to those who had been there.
</P>
<P>
   That advocacy became the hallmark of her last years. She sweetly
goaded her newspaper colleagues to sign up for cancer fund-raising
runs in Golden Gate Park. She critiqued books about cancer for The
Chronicle's book review section.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book,'' she wrote in a September 1995 review, ``closely
parallels what it is like to undergo cancer treatment in this
country today: good intentions, great uncertainty _ and not many
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing about the 180,000 women who get breast cancer each year,
she said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want there to be a face that goes with these statistics. It
certainly doesn't have to be my face; it can be the face of someone
you surely know and love who has had her life torn apart by this
disease. This carnage has to stop. I write to plead for more and
better research, for more and better treatment. Like too many women
before me, I write to plead: Find something to save my life. To
save all of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown, who had known Yoachum since her days as a reporter
in Sacramento when he was Assembly speaker, said she was a friend
as well as a journalist. ``Early on, when she wrote about her
illness, it was one of the first times anyone with breast cancer
put it out there,'' Brown said. ``I imagine her comments saved a
lot women's lives by alerting them to get checked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoachum is survived by her husband, Mike Carlson; her mother,
Betty; and her brother, Charles, of Dallas, and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements are being made for later this week. The
family requests that contributions in her name be sent to The
Breast Cancer Fund, 282 Second St., San Francisco 94105; or to the
Ernest Rosenbaum Cancer Research Fund, Mount Zion Health System,
3330 Geary Blvd., San Francisco 94118.

NORTHERN IRELAND'S VOTERS TAKE NEXT STEP ON ROAD TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COUNTY ARMAGH, Northern Ireland _ When the guns fall silent,
peace isn't beyond the imagination on a spring morning in Armagh.
Along the banks of the River Bann, winding its sleepy way through
lush emerald hills, the only sound as dawn breaks is the buzz of
honeybees rising in the mist.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Northern Ireland goes to the polls again, to elect
a governing assembly authorized by May's ``yes'' vote on a peace
settlement. The novelty of tranquil mornings in Armagh _ ``Bloody
Armagh'' in the violent chronicle of Ireland's ``Troubles'' _ hangs
in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on people like George Savage, 56, a local
councilman from the Ulster Unionist Party, and Dara O'Hagan, 30, an
assembly candidate on the ticket of Sinn Fein, the political wing
of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   They are canvassing opposite ends of the sectarian divide as the
election approaches, determined to win as many seats as possible
for their respective parties in the 108-seat assembly. But the
larger purpose, for both, is to silence the gunshots and bomb
blasts of Armagh forever.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Hagan, Savage has spent his entire life here: nearly half
a century as a dairy farmer, a decade as a councilman _ and 14
years as a soldier in the Ulster Defense Regiment, a 97-percent
Protestant army, hunting Catholic republicans in the hills above
the Bann.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men he hunted was O'Hagan's father, Joe O'Hagan, a
leading IRA man who eluded hundreds of army patrols in the Armagh
hills before he was finally captured in the 1960s and sent to
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA and the British fought each other to a standstill.
Nobody won,'' Dara O'Hagan says. ``We have to recognize now that
the time for fighting is over, and that republicans must manage the
transition from rebellion to power, from waging war to
administering a just peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The election and the next few months, says Savage, ``will
present us with our sole opportunity in a lifetime to look to the
future, not back over our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Their words frame the immensely difficult task that lies ahead _
a quest for justice that is not mired in the unresolved conflicts
of the past, a quest for the future that is not ambushed by a
generation born to the gun.
</P>
<P>
   The two quests will converge in County Armagh, a scant 10 days
after the election, at the portals of Drumcree Church one mile west
of the River Bann.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Sunday of every July since the 18th century,
thousands of Protestants have marched to and from Drumcree in
commemoration of the 1795 founding of the Orange Order, the
80,000-member lodge that is the largest unionist organization in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the right of the Orangemen to march. The issue
is the route, and it is a compelling symbol of the power that
unresolved history wields in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order has long insisted on parading down Garvaghy
Road, in the Armagh town of Portadown, through the heart of a
neighborhood that is 100 percent Catholic. Accompanied by uniformed
pipe bands _ and often protected by the armored cars of the Royal
Ulster Constabulary _ the marchers sing of Protestant triumphs over
``Fenians,'' an epithet for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are up to our necks in Fenian blood. Surrender or you'll
die!'' one of the songs proclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The route is chosen to humiliate us, to remind us that we are
second-class citizens in our own country,'' says Breandon
MacCionnaith, an independent nationalist councilman in Portadown.
``There is no good reason why they can't march from Drumcree down
another road.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Protestants, any tinkering at all with such rituals is
unacceptable. The parades are intrinsic to the unionist identity;
provincewide, there are more than 3,000 of them in a ``marching
season'' that pivots around early July.
</P>
<P>
   The British government backed the Orange Order last year,
deploying heavily armed security forces to clear Garvaghy Road for
the marchers. The parade was followed by weeks of rioting, in what
has become an annual response to Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   This year, London's position on the march route remained in
doubt as the elections neared, and the Garvaghy Road residents
association has invited Catholics from all over the island to join
them on July 5 in blocking the parade.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, the Orange Order's youth wing paraded down Garvaghy
Road in a preliminary march. They were met by 400 Catholic young
people throwing rocks, bottles and Molotov cocktails. Three
civilians and 11 police officers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Unless a compromise on the July 5 event is achieved very soon,
the scene has been set for a much more serious confrontation less
than two weeks after the election. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for a peace-loving, but loyal unionist politician
like George Savage is to push for compromise on the march issue
without appearing to abandon two centuries of Protestant tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for his Sinn Fein counterpart, Dara O'Hagan, is to
press for a basic human right _ the right of Catholics not to be
humiliated in their own front yards _ without taking her own
community back down the road to an endless exchange of provocation
and violent response.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the entire province, says Mark Neale, 32,
Savage's fellow unionist councilman, ``is that our history has bred
entrenched cultures of grievance and revenge in Northern Ireland,
and we must escape them.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a ``culture of secrecy'' to contend with, says
Armagh County attorney Rosemary Nelson, that has hidden the deeds
and strategies of paramilitary and security forces behind a thick
veil.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to nationalism and unionism, `securitism' is part
of the legacy of Irish history,'' says Nelson, a prominent critic
of police abuses in the province. ``As long as it goes
unchallenged, a genuine civil society is beyond reach.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, everyone who wants peace believes that the book
must somehow be closed, that the atrocities of the past must be
forgiven if not forgotten _ that the cultures of grievance, revenge
and secrecy must give way to a genuine civil society.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is sure how to accomplish that goal without appearing
to betray the 45,000 people, Catholic and Protestant alike, who
were killed or wounded in sectarian conflicts over the past 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness is rare in Northern Ireland. It would be rare in any
place with such a toll. Since 1969, more than 3,200 people have
died in Northern Ireland from sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we know the truth about what happened in those years,
behind the veil of secrecy, it will be impossible to build a new
society,'' says Paddy Kelly, 35, a Belfast human rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims are entitled to the truth _ the victims of the
state security apparatus, as much as those of the IRA and the
loyalist paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   History, she points out, has not ended simply because 70 percent
of Northern Ireland's people voted ``yes'' on a referendum for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the referendum, hardly an hour passes in an Armagh
town without a British patrol dodging down a shopping street in
full battle gear, faces smudged with black camouflage paint,
assault rifles loaded and aimed.
</P>
<P>
   As the chill Armagh winter waned into an unusually sunny spring,
hardly a day passed without a reminder that the book is not closed
yet: a 26-year-old Catholic father of two beaten to death in
Portadown; two Protestant-owned shops bombed by rogue IRA units;
bombs tossed at Royal Ulster Constabulary posts in the middle of
the night; the May 31 battle on Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers and the paramilitary fighters from both sides who
oppose the peace pact are still on war alert. They _ and their
victims _ are mostly young.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of those who are under 30 in Northern
Ireland have never attended a school with someone from across the
sectarian chasm.
</P>
<P>
   Very few Catholics work in Protestant-owned businesses or in the
swollen security force that has tried to keep the two communities
from tearing each other apart, which is one reason why the
unemployment level among Catholics is 21/2 times that of
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland wants peace. The referendum was eloquent and
clear on that simple, unelaborated point. But it is in the
elaborations that peace will succeed or fail, and in much of Armagh
they speak of a land that remains deeply divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement reinforces the separation of Catholic and
Protestant into their traditional power blocs, nationalism and
unionism,'' says republican leader Bernadette Devlin McAliskey,
explaining why she voted ``no'' in the referendum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, the towns of Armagh offer virtually no model for
the creation of a joint society. It is amid the honeybees and
grazing cows of the rural countryside, says George Savage, that a
glimmer of hope shines.
</P>
<P>
   With his background in the Ulster Defense Regiment and as a
politician arguing the unionist cause, Savage might be expected to
hate his Catholic neighbors as thoroughly as the loyalist gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   He might be expected to rank high among the unforgiving, since
the night one year ago when his 30-year-old son, George, Jr., was
jumped by five assailants outside a Portadown disco. His skull
fractured, he hung between life and death for a week and has not
yet fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   But Savage is a farmer, and the elemental demands of the earth
and his own herd of 80 cows have taught him lessons that are not
yet understood in Armagh's towns.
</P>
<P>
   Dairy cows, and the rich Irish grass that nourishes them, are
neither unionist nor republican.
</P>
<P>
   About three fourths of the farmers in Savage's constituency are
Protestant, a quarter Catholic. But the conduct of their days is
determined by the land and the cows, not by religion or a choice
between flying the Irish tricolor or the Union Jack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulster's farmers meet all the time, talk all the time. They
don't talk about politics or religion _ their concerns are things
like pasturing and livestock prices and the quality of various
feeds,'' says Savage. ``They meet in the fields, they meet at the
border with farmers from the Irish Republic, they meet when their
tractors cross paths.''
</P>
<P>
   Savage paused, wiped a handkerchief across a brow deeply
furrowed from half a century in the sun and blustery winds of rural
Armagh. ``Farmers know that they have always had more in common
with each other, Protestant and Catholic, than they ever will with
anyone in Dublin, Belfast or London.''

FDA OFFICIALS ORDER BOOKS ABOUT HERB DESTROYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials ordered
the destruction of three books about an herb and its use. Never
mind the First Amendment. Never mind upholding the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The herb at the center of this controversy is Stevia rebaudiana
Bertoni, better known as stevia or ``honey leaf.'' Under the law,
stevia can be marketed as a dietary supplement like a vitamin but
not as a food additive.
</P>
<P>
   The herb is said to benefit the health of those who take it. The
FDA considers stevia safe to simply swallow as a supplement (powder
or liquid), but unsafe when added to food or drink.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA goes ballistic when it thinks a company is selling
stevia as a natural sweetener _ a property for which the herb is
well-known in Paraguay and Brazil where it grows.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, Compliance Officer James Lahar of the Dallas, Texas
district office of the FDA, faxed a letter to Oscar Rodes,
president of the Stevita Co. in Arlington which sells the herb. The
letter states, in part: ``... a current inventory must be taken by
an investigator of this office, who will also be available to
witness the destruction of the cookbooks, literature, and other
publications for the purpose of verifying compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The books in question address stevia's sweetening property _ a
big no-no, in the eyes of the FDA. Stevia could be a major economic
threat to established companies that manufacture artificial
sweeteners. It's calorie free.
</P>
<P>
   So the federal agency targeted the books: James Kirkland's
``Cooking with Stevia: The Naturally Sweet &AMP; Calorie-Free Herb,''
David Richard's ``Stevia Rebaudiana: Nature's Sweet Secret,'' and
Linda Bonvie, et al.'s ``The Stevia Story: A tale of incredible
sweetness &AMP; intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Rodes said that when he received the FDA
fax, he called his attorney in Washington, D.C. The local FDA
officers arrived a few hours later. According to Rodes, he said
that he would not destroy the books unless his attorney advised him
to do so. However, Rodes told them, if the FDA officers wanted to
destroy them, he would merely use his video camera to record the
event. The FDA officers left.
</P>
<P>
   Rodes also claims that the FDA officials told him that they
wanted Rodes to recall all the copies of the books he had already
sold. According to Rodes, that amounts to more than 4,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lahar now claims he never ordered the books destroyed. In an
interview, he said, ``The sentence reads to the effect that if
books are going to be destroyed, we'd like to observe it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked then where the idea for destroying books came from,
Lahar said he wouldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   He responded, ``I've have been asked to refer calls to our press
office in Washington. ... We all have a boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who made the decision to silence him, Lahar referred to
FDA Associate Chief Counsel for Enforcement Annamarie Kempic in
D.C. Kempic did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   When the D.C. press office was called, press officer Judith
Foulke said she couldn't answer any questions about this case
because the matter was still under investigation _ a convenient
Catch 22. She couldn't even comment on the destroy-the-books
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Another wrinkle popped up. Julian Whitaker, a physician, asked
Rodes if he could purchase the three stevia books in question for
research purposes. Rodes, thinking he might violate FDA orders by
selling the books to the doctor, refused _ and explained why.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor called renown First Amendment attorney in Jonathan W.
Emord in Washington, D.C., to see what he could do. Emord called
the FDA to advise the agency that he planned to initiate legal
action to free the hostage books.
</P>
<P>
   Kempic then faxed a letter, dated June 5, to Emord in which she
says that Rodes can sell the books to Emord's client and states:
``... we have contacted Mr. Rhodes (sic) and advised him not to
destroy the books at this time.'' The ``at this time'' tells it
all.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure on the FDA had begun to mount. In a letter faxed to
Emord three days later, Kempic changed her tune. She writes: ``The
FDA Dallas District Office informs me that it was Mr. Rodes who
chose the option of destroying the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Rodes, emphatically. Why, after all, would he want
to destroy thousands of dollars worth of inventory?
</P>
<P>
   Rodes changed the labels on his stevia products so that they
conform to the strictest FDA regulations. They no longer suggest
any other use for stevia. A label that said ``tabletop ready'' was
replaced because this implies that stevia in these packages could
be used as a flavoring ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, the presence of the books remains a
critical issue for FDA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rodes' company is one of the nation's major distributors of
stevia. The FDA confiscated two shipments of the herb that belong
to Rodes. Those shipments have yet to be released. This action is
costing Rodes business and money.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA oversees the sale and distribution of food and drug
products for the safety and health of the nation. The agency
sometimes acts overly cautious. Although stevia has been used as a
food additive without ill effects in Japan for more than 25 years,
the herb has not, according to the FDA, undergone sufficient
testing in this country to assure that it isn't harmful if used as
an additive.
</P>
<P>
   According to FDA officials, the herb stevia can be
``adulterated'' merely by being in the presence of information that
reveals its sweetening property.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas FDA agents even went so far as to mark up copies of the
offending books so that they couldn't be sold. Clearly these agents
violated the law. The FDA has no legal authority to destroy books.
None whatsoever _ no matter whose economic interests are at stake.

115-FOOT GOZILLA BILLBOARD DRAWS PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sighs do matter.
</P>
<P>
   And that is how preservationists have greeted the appearance of
an enormous new billboard in the main concourse of Grand Central
Terminal featuring a 30-foot Godzilla claw _ with sighs of
exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   The banner darkens three soaring, arched windows over the east
balcony that had been uncovered as part of the $196 million
renovation of the terminal by the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority. First planned in 1990, the project is now nearing
completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really regret the decision to install the banner,'' said
Jennifer J. Raab, chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks
Preservation Commission. ``Since such effort was taken to expose
the wonderful architecture of Grand Central, to obscure it at this
point is really unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society, the
civic group that has been a leader in the fight to preserve the
Beaux-Arts landmark, said, ``The MTA is covering up some of its
best work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's self-defeating,'' Sexton said. ``They're doing a
wonderful job with the terminal. Why besmirch it?''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the MTA offered assurances that the billboard was
temporary and did not augur a return to the days when the concourse
looked like a merchandising carnival, filled with kiosks and signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the kind of advertising that would ever be accepted
once the terminal is done,'' said Tom Kelly, a spokesman for the
MTA. Rather, he said, it was permitted for one month, since the
concourse is still under reconstruction. The authority will earn
$100,000 from the billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Raab said the commission, which must approve alterations to
the structure, was ``relieved that the banner is temporary and that
they have committed not to do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 115-foot-long vinyl mesh banner promotes ``Godzilla,'' which
is distributed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, and a very slim new
laptop computer from Sony Electronics. Referring to both, the
advertisement declares, ``Size does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jodi A. Yegelwel, senior vice president of TDI, which sells,
posts and maintains the advertising at Grand Central, said the
billboard coincided with a recent computer trade show in New York,
PC Expo, and would be removed July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great opportunity for Sony to reach a target market
during a very important month,'' she said. ``It was probably the
highest-profile ad location in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   But the banner is also an opaque curtain over windows that have
only recently filled the terminal with daylight after years of
obscurity: first, blacked out to accommodate a Kodak sign, and then
lost amid the scaffolding for the reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a temporary return to the bad old days,'' said Francis
Morrone, an architectural historian who leads tours of the terminal
for the Municipal Art Society. ``It's as though Godzilla himself
had descended on Grand Central.''

NETS' SALARY APPROACH RUBS WILLIAMS THE RIGHT WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKILLMAN, N.J. _ Jayson Williams was more than happy to deliver
good-natured barbs at his employers today at a celebrity golf
tournament, saying it would take $1 billion to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   When reality set in, the Nets learned that Williams' agent, Sal
DeFazio, had set the salary standard Monday by grouping Williams,
who earned his first All-Star berth this past season, with Patrick
Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning, Hakeem Olajuwon, Dikembe
Mutombo and David Robinson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who earned $2.5 million last year, is seeking a
seven-year deal believed to be worth approximately $15 million a
season.
</P>
<P>
   Those six players' average salaries last season was $12,961,667,
topped by Ewing's $20.5 million. But their complete pacts average
even more, with Ewing and O'Neal each earning approximately $17
million a year and Mourning pulling in $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at those top five or six guys, that's where he
belongs,'' DeFazio said. ``I think if you look at where those guys
are, take their average salaries, what they're going to be earning,
look at those numbers and it pretty quickly tells you where he
belongs and what he deserves.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rowe, the Nets president, and John Nash, the general
manager, were here at the Cherry Valley Country Club, jokingly
reminding Williams and DeFazio that the general managers of the
teams who are sure to place calls to DeFazio on July 1 were nowhere
to be found on the golf course.
</P>
<P>
   With little leverage this time around, the Nets know they need
every bit of Williams' loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're showing some sincerity about me coming back,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nets do not seem averse to dealing in the
stratosphere, provided that the two sides are allowed to negotiate
on July 1 and there is no lockout. The Nets' unstable ownership is
prepared to offer more money than is has ever offered to a player,
exceeding the nine-year, $80 million offered Derrick Coleman before
settling on a seven-year, $63 million deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a value that we've placed on Jayson for a number of
years,'' Rowe said. ``It's a healthy offer. It's more than we've
offered any other player to my knowledge in our history. If he is
unhappy with that, he is perfectly allowed and would be encouraged
to test the market to see if in fact that's a going rate. And if he
comes back and finds out it was in fact a decent rate and wants to
sign with us, we'll have a great dinner and do it very quickly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Williams has never made a secret of his desire to stay in New
Jersey, close to where he grew up in New York and close to his
family and friends. And if the Nets treat him fairly, he maintains
that he will be back next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Nets offer me fair value, then the case is closed,''
Williams said. ``If the Nets come to the number that Sal and I have
spoken about and then somebody came with a number that is higher,
I'm still staying in New Jersey, I'm not going to hold them over a
barrel.'' &QL;

FOR A BRONX KNIGHT, MANY CHESS PRIZES STILL TO WIN

 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Here is Fritz Gaspard, chess coach, on his chess
star:
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling you get from him is that he has this world view.
He has an open mind to all different kinds of chess positions, and
is willing to try anything that looks reasonable. He's also willing
to do the work that's involved. If he decides he wants to play a
certain opening, he'll go out and research it, and not just play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Any weaknesses? ``Maybe some overconfidence. And basically, his
nerves. He puts a little bit too much pressure on himself
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably. Our chess star is Kwadwo Acheampong, 14, of the
South Bronx, co-captain of the Middle School 118 All-Star Knights,
winners last month of the 1998 National Junior High School
Scholastic Chess Championship in Phoenix. This is a big deal; elite
New York City schools like Hunter and Dalton have traditionally
reigned supreme in chess. Next month the All-Star Knights travel to
Moscow for the World Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Kwadwo (pronounced KWAD-jo) will start ninth grade at
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., on a full scholarship. (He
turned down Exeter, Deerfield and the Bronx High School of
Science.) He has already appeared on ``Good Morning America'' and
``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.'' His mother is a hairdresser, an
immigrant from Ghana; his father, a onetime cab driver, also from
Ghana, deserted the family when Kwadwo was 5. Kwadwo, born in
Harlem, wants to be a lawyer, like Johnnie Cochran _ ``If he can do
it, I can too'' _ or President of the United States. Today he is
speaking at Middle School 118's graduation, as salutatorian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people tend to underestimate me,'' Kwadwo said in an
interview during chess practice last week, after the All-Star
Knights had analyzed a 1986 world championship game between Gary
Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. ``But a lot of people call me a born
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lessons here, before we get to Kwadwo.
</P>
<P>
   One, chess in inner-city schools promotes academic success. ``It
taught me how to discipline myself,'' said Kwadwo, who has played
chess since first grade, initially to try to beat his older sister,
Akua, 16. ``It taught me critical thinking. It taught me how to
attack weak points.''
</P>
<P>
   Two, it is important to have a mother whose life centers on the
education of her children. ``If I had gotten the chance, I would
have done better than I did,'' said Kwadwo's mother, Agnes Osei,
whose stepfather did not let her go to college in Ghana. ``I was
not going to let that happen to my children. I knew from the
beginning that they were very smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Three, there are many paths to success. After 18 months of
preparation at Stuyvesant High School's Math/Science Institute,
which consists mostly of minority students, Kwadwo did not score
well enough on the admissions test for entry to Stuyvesant, the
elite public high that was his dream. ``It was a disappointment,''
he said. The best prep schools in America didn't care at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see why they grabbed him when they met him,'' said
Bruce Ravage, the director of the Math/Science Institute. ``This is
the kind of kid you really want to afford an opportunity to.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week in a sweltering MS 118 classroom, in
the East Tremont section of the Bronx, Kwadwo was sophisticated,
sure of himself, poised _ and in pain about a father who seems to
have rediscovered his successful son. ``He's basically trying to
reinsert himself into my life,'' Kwadwo said. ``He calls a lot, but
so much has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers and coaches say that one of the most striking things
about Kwadwo is his adultlike bearing, much in evidence at an
awards ceremony last week held by Chess-in-the-Schools, a nonprofit
group that sponsors the All-Star Knights and brings chess to 22,000
disadvantaged students in New York. Even though Sunil Matabeek, 13,
was Chess-in-the-Schools' Player of the Year (based on his No. 1
ranking), Kwadwo, whose ranking fluctuates between second and
third, was the clear spokesman. He made two speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chess has always been very important to me,'' he said, in
speech No. 1, as he presented a gift to the All-Star Knight
coaches. ``It has allowed me to leave the streets of New York City,
to explore the nation, and this summer, the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Speech No. 2 was to accept the Scholastic and Chess Excellence
Player of the Year award. ``When I go away to boarding school,''
Kwadwo said, ``I will not forget what you all have done for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kwadwo first played chess with the team at Community Elementary
School 70 in the Bronx, which won the state elementary school
title. But when he moved on to sixth grade at MS 118, he discovered
the school didn't have a chess team. He and three other players
started one, and went on their own, in sixth grade, to the 1996
state championships in White Plains. To everyone's astonishment,
they came in second. Chess-in-the-Schools dispatched coaches to MS
118 the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Andover hasn't had a competitive chess team, but as Kwadwo told
one of his coaches, ``They do now.'' He also said he felt
comfortable when he visited Andover because there were plenty of
minority students and a ``homey'' atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Now he says the kids on the street in the Bronx tell him, ``When
you become rich and famous, don't forget about us.''

LEARNING CO. TO ACQUIRE BRODERBUND SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Learning Co. said Monday that it had agreed
to acquire Broderbund Software Inc., a rival producer of
educational software, in a stock swap valued at $420 million.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest and largest in a new wave of
consolidation in the educational and consumer software market.
Through a series of acquisitions and aggressive marketing tactics,
the Learning Co. and Cendant Software Inc., which includes the old
Davidson and Knowledge Adventure brands, have emerged as powerful
runners-up to the Microsoft Corporation in this part of the
software business.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund, despite popular titles like ``Myst'' and the Carmen
Sandiego series, has struggled in recent years, hurt by the
Learning Co.'s and Cendant's price cuts and by its own failures to
generate fresh products.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Broderbund said it expected to report a loss for
the third quarter, ended on May 31, and that it had retained the
investment banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to explore
strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund ``has been getting squeezed, and the irony of it is
they've been getting squeezed by Learning Company,'' said Stephen
Fleming, an analyst with Banc-America Robertson Stephens. ``Now
that Learning Company owns them, you will probably see a more
constructive, collaborative effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. shares closed today at $24.875, down 12.5 cents,
while Broderbund shares rose $2.25, to close at $18.75, both in
Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the Learning Company will issue
0.80 of a share for each of Broderbund's 21 million shares
outstanding. Based on Learning Co.'s closing stock price of $25 on
Friday, the deal values Broderbund at $20 a share, or $420 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin O'Leary, the Learning Co.'s president, said the combined
business ``will have access to a data base of over 20 million
registered end-users who have purchased one of our products and
desire to hear about more offerings, which will allow us to build
our presence in the online and Internet channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Broderbund, which is based in Novato, Calif.,
fought a losing battle with Softkey International, based in
Cambridge Mass., to acquire the old Learning Co., creator of the
Reader Rabbit educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   Softkey took the name Learning Co. and, through the aggressive
use of debt financing and stock swaps, built a portfolio of leading
consumer and educational software titles.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's chairman and co-founder, Douglas G. Carlston, has
voted to approve the acquisition, the companies said, as have the
Learning Co.'s major shareholders, the Thomas H. Lee Co. and Bain
Capital Inc.

 &HT;    ``If history had wings . . .''
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A woman in a pink dress with white daisies, who
remembered when President John F. Kennedy's body was flown from
Dallas to Washington, D.C., in the plane, spoke quietly, almost
reverently to her female companion. ``If the insides of this plane
could only talk. My goodness, the stories we would hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were among about 900 who visited the U.S. Air Force
Museum to tour the original Air Force One and to take a personal
look at the plane that winged presidents around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who made the last official state
flight aboard this Air Force One last March said, ``If history had
wings, it would be this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call the Boeing 707, which traveled more than 5 million
miles since it was put into service in 1962, the world's most
famous aircraft. After serving presidents, heads of state and world
dignitaries for 36 years, the plane called Special Air Mission
26000 by the Air Force is open for public inspection in the Air
Force Museum annex.
</P>
<P>
   The plane promises to be a star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   As the steady line of folks worked their way through the plane's
aisles, protected with plastic windows from ceiling to floor to
keep visitors from touching furniture or equipment, you hear the
same thoughts repeated in different ways: ``I think that is where
President Johnson stood when he was sworn in after President
Kennedy was shot. I think that is where President Kennedy's casket
was put. I think that is where Jackie Kennedy sat on the way back
from Dallas still wearing that blood-splattered dress.''
</P>
<P>
   The fateful Dallas trip in November 1963 when President Kennedy
was assassinated and President Johnson sworn into office will stand
out as the plane's most memorable hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history here,'' said Orville Howard, 72, to
his grandson, Tim Fox, 12. They had come from Frankfort, Ind., to
see the plane. ``I wanted Tim to see this. For those of us who
remember the dark days when President Kennedy was assassinated,
this brings a bit of closure, in a way. And it is just amazing to
think of the famous people who have been on this incredible plane.
So much history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cy and Audrey Laughter plan to visit the plane soon. The
Laughters were supporters and friends of President Richard Nixon,
and remember the time they had lunch on the plane as it was parked
at Andrews Air Force Base in 1969. ``It was a gift from President
Nixon to us to lunch there,'' Laughter said. ``The plane brings
back many memories for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand McElroy, 32, of Springfield brought his two kids and
two neighborhood youngsters to see the famous plane Monday. ``I
think it is important for the young ones to have a sense of
history,'' McElroy said. ``Things happened on this plane that
shaped the future of our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Works, on hand as a greeter for visitors to the plane, said
she is moved every time she boards the plane. ``I get a chill,''
she said. ``There's something about it that just gets you.''

 &HT;    Healing teen-age heartache
 &HT;    By Ricardo Gandara
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Catherine Fohn remembers sitting on her
daughter's bed _ the 14-year-old's heart was broken for the first
time _ and no words would come out. Just tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to hold her like a baby to tell her everything would
be OK, but I couldn't,'' the mother says. ``Instead, I was in
shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknowingly, Fohn's compassion helped her daughter. All too
often, however, parents fumble their way through dealing with a
child who has been hurt in a relationship. They say or do the wrong
things. It's a critical time for pre-adolescents and teen-agers
because they are seeking support and understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, I told Sarah how much I loved her,'' says the mother of
seven children, ages 5 to 19. ``I wanted to convey that I had been
through this before. I explained that I didn't know why these
things happen''
</P>
<P>
   It helped Sarah. ``She listened, cried, hugged me and gave me
time to be alone,'' says the daughter, who will be a high school
sophomore this fall. ``The only thing she didn't understand is that
I would feel that way at 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Carl Pickhardt says young love is a serious family
matter. ``Love at 13, it's just as powerful and to be respected as
love at 30,'' he says. ``The larger issue is that parents often
discount their children's feelings by saying, `Oh, they're just
children. What can they know?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah is doing fine now because she continued her friendships,
stayed focused in school and remained involved in her family. ``You
want a child to stay engaged in her relationships and activities in
school. This way, they are distracted,'' Pickhardt says.
</P>
<P>
   Family counselors say talking to a child and listening is
critical when dealing with a broken heart. The power of physical
contact _ holding a hand or giving a hug _ is not to be
underestimated. It makes a child feel loved and better prepared to
deal with rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's OK to cry with them,'' Catherine Fohn says.
</P>
<P>
   Love starts early, even before children become teen-agers. They
want the independence to explore life and relationships, but they
don't have the skills to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   And when it's time to cope with loss, girls deal better with
heartache than boys, Pickhardt says. ``Girls are more socialized.
They have more capacity to talk out their feelings. Thus they deal
with pain better and more directly. Boys don't have that history.
Boys are about proving themselves and competing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Price-Bennett agrees. She has a daughter, 18-year-old
Brandi, and a son, 15-year-old Carlisle. ``Boys have a hard time
letting parents be part of it. It is like pulling teeth,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Her son was 12 when he and his first serious girlfriend mutually
decided to break it off. It was not until later that she learned of
the depth of his hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all came out through something else that happened,'' says
the mom. ``That's when I knew that he had been hurt bad. All of a
sudden, he was my vulnerable and sensitive little boy, not a big
tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickhardt warns parents that boys don't cope well when they've
been dumped. ``Boys take it much harder and are often more
vulnerable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologist who's written several books including
``Parenting a Teen-ager,'' says boys hide their feelings and can
display anger. ``He's at risk to act out on that anger by
threatening a girl, spreading rumors, vandalizing something and
even getting physical,'' Pickhardt says.
</P>
<P>
   Those are more reasons for parents not to ignore boys who have
had their hearts broken. If their behavior or comments suggest
anger, get professional help. Don't take threats of any kind
lightly.
</P>

 &HT;    Dome on the range near Italy, Texas
 &HT;    By Don McLeese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ITALY, Texas _ The rest of the world is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The world sees square, where you see round. The world sees ugly,
where you see beauty _ for what could be more beautiful than an
egg, a breast, a supremely functional curve? Maybe the world sees
you as eccentric, even a kook, for isn't that usually the lot of
the visionary? You know that you're closer in spirit to Galileo
(from that other Italy) than to those extremists such as David
Koresh or the Republic of Texas types _ the ones who have given the
rugged individualism of the Lone Star State such an unfortunate
spin.
</P>
<P>
   You are a practical man, likely the most practical you know. As
the cliche would have it, you have built a better mousetrap _ in
this case, the dome as the progressively practical domicile _ and
you've been waiting a quarter-century for the world to beat a path
to your door.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, that door has been on the outskirts of Italy, an
hour's drive south of Dallas off Interstate 35, where the signpost
welcomes visitors to ``The Biggest Little Town in Texas.'' Your
workshops have drawn dreamers and schemers from coast to coast, and
from Puerto Rico to Saudi Arabia, most of them hoping to capitalize
on your vision of the future as dome sweet dome. They pay you $750
per workshop to have you show them how to build a dome on your
property _ so they then can build their own.
</P>
<P>
   Every time you read another newspaper headline about a tornado
destroying a town or a hurricane ravaging a region, you shake your
head at the tragic waste. Because you believe to the depths of your
soul that your domes will withstand conditions that turn
conventional homes to splinters.
</P>
<P>
   You are David B. South. You were raised in Idaho, where you
developed a boyhood interest in dome technology and invented the
process for what you would market as the Monolithic Dome. You
became a Texan by business philosophy. You originally followed your
dreams to California _ as so many do _ but found your enterprise
entangled in the red tape of a state enmeshed in bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have built in most of the states, and I really like the
business climate in Texas,'' explains the short, stocky and
good-humored South, a 59-year-old engineer and computer programmer
turned entrepreneur, as we sit in the three-domed business office
that serves as the nerve center of Dome Park. The office feels a
little like a futuristic cave. ``Texas is kind of a throwback: You
leave me alone, and I'll leave you alone. When you're doing
business, the handshake still means a lot more in Texas than it
does in some other places. ... You've got to have a place, and
Italy's as good as any.''
</P>
<P>
   From the exit off I-35, Dome Park looks like it's in the middle
of nowhere, just down the road from the inevitable Dairy Queen.
Italy is a few miles east, a town of less than 2,000. What does the
community think of its domed neighbor?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect the community's a little incredulous, but I wasn't
really trying to get a response out of the community,'' South
replies. ``I came here as a place to do business.'' The perfect
shape
</P>
<P>
   From the highway, kids don't see it as a place to do business.
They see the seven domes strung together as a caterpillar, with the
face painted on the garage door, and they figure it for some sort
of playground or children's attraction. Maybe an insect equivalent
of Chuck E. Cheese. During the first few dozen times I drove past
it on trips to Dallas, I looked at the cowboy boots painted on the
side, kicking up their heels, and thought the place must be some
sort of peculiar roadhouse dancehall.
</P>
<P>
   At Dome Park, they call it Bruco: The Texas Italian Caterpillar;
``bruco'' is the Italian word for caterpillar. Inside Bruco is the
manufacturing plant where Monolithic Constructors makes what South
has dubbed the Airform. Let's think of the Airform as a big balloon
of untearable fabric _ the key to the entire concept of the
Monolithic Dome. Once the Airform is inflated, it is sprayed inside
with three inches of polyurethane foam insulation, reinforced with
steel rebar, which is then covered in concrete. The Airform
continues to serve as the structure's outer shell, a waterproof
membrane.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a pure dome, unlike the earlier and more prevalent
geodesic domes that first caught South's fancy. The early '50s
brainchild of R. Buckminster Fuller, the geodesic dome is actually
a series of flat surfaces, a bunch of connected triangles, in an
attempt to duplicate nature's ideal architectural model: the egg.
As dome enthusiasts have long recognized, no shape provides more
strength through less surface material. Where the geodesic dome
offers the illusion of curvature, South aspired to authentic
domedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though they're sort of the same shape, they are vastly
different animals,'' he explains. ``Engineering-wise, the geodesic
is totally different, using square materials to make an
approximation of a dome. Monolithic, on the other hand, has very
little square materials involved. It's an actual, pure dome, smooth
like an egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent the dome,'' he continues. ``We've been having
igloos and all kinds of domes for thousands of years. What I did is
invent this technology where we could inflate a balloon, go inside
the balloon, out of the weather, and then spray it with the
polyurethane, tie the rebar and spray it with concrete to give it
structure. And it's the symbiotic relationship of all these pieces
that I have my patents on.''
</P>
<P>
   Residential domes are the last frontier for South, who began by
building big industrial facilities, where the big money is. He
patented the process with his brothers Barry and Randy South in
1975. Appropriately enough for their native Idaho, their first dome
was a potato-storage building, 105 feet in diameter and 35 feet
tall. It has since become a factory for the manufacture of
waterbeds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, South built his first dome home for his family, the
8,000-square foot ``Cliffdome'' on the banks of the Snake River.
The Souths' home was something of an Idaho tourist attraction,
drawing tens of thousands of visitors, as the nine South children
became adept at conducting impromptu tours. (One of those
offspring, Nanette, was crowned Miss Idaho in 1985.)
</P>
<P>
   David South subsequently split from his brothers, who continue
to conduct business from Idaho Falls as Dome Technology. That
business focuses mostly on the construction of industrial and other
facilities, while David has become more of a missionary _ training
builders, conducting workshops, selling Airforms, spreading the
word that the building of tomorrow is available today.
</P>
<P>
   In the compound outside Italy that serves as the research and
development site, there are domes wherever the eye turns _ from
storage sheds to one-room efficiencies to the 2,700-square-foot
``Charca Casa'' residence _ ``House by the Pond'' _ where South
lives with his wife, Judy. It is like living in a parallel universe
_ one in which all the square corners and right angles have been
rounded off. There is even a domed doghouse (which the Souths
couldn't resist when they saw it at Wal-Mart).
</P>
<P>
   ``The dome shape really confronts people,'' says 29-year-old
David South Jr., the company's information systems manager, who
lives down the road from his parents in a smaller dome. ``You
almost have to make a determination about it. When people are
confronted by a dome, they say, `Why would anyone want to live in
one?' And that opens the door for us to explain all the
advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   The Souths number those advantages like commandments: The dome
is air-tight, sound-proof, energy-efficient, virtually
indestructible and no more expensive to build than a conventional
home that isn't nearly as insulated or weather-resistant. The dome
makes a powerful statement of independence, in a world in which
conventional wisdom so often translates into conformist medi-
ocrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an embryonic industry,'' says South the father. ``It
just takes time. It'll never be pushed, but the more it's noticed,
the more we sell. We have to teach people how to build it, and then
we have to teach people that they want it. And then we teach more
people how to build it.

   In Austin, Rob Delamater became a dome convert through church.
In particular, Our Lady's Maronite Catholic Church on East 51st
Street, just north of the airport. Delamater was hired as project
manager for the construction of the domed church, which duplicates
the shape and spirit of an Old World Catholic Eastern Rite
cathedral. His research on dome construction led him to the
Internet, which led him to the Monolithic Dome (www.monolithic
dome.com)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is safe in all aspects and fire-resistant,
lightning-resistant, wind-resistant,'' says Delamater. ``They are
safer than any other building. There's nothing for the wind to grab
hold of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to put this church on the Web as a model
church,'' he continues. ``It's an Old World church, and the dome
represents the head of Christ. It would have cost $80,000 for a
steel dome, but this one is only $45,000.''
</P>
<P>
   On the street adjacent to the construction site is a sign
reading ``Thou Shalt Not Park Here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roots are in the Middle East, the Holy Land,'' says Father
Don Sawyer, the priest of the 200-family parish. ``Theologically,
contrary to Gothic style, this architecture represents that God is
with us _ like a mother hen, hovering. The dome is God's presence
among his people.''
</P>
<P>
   Contracted to build his first dome, Delamater assumes it won't
be his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has all kinds of creativity that is left up to the
architect,'' says Delamater. ``It takes imagination not to make it
look like a ball in the ground. Other than that, it has all the
possibilities in the world.'' Where crackpots live Look inside a
domed home, and you're likely to find someone who considers himself
a maverick, a free thinker, maybe even a crackpot _ someone, at
least, who refuses to be confined by the boxes of conventional
society or even to live in one. If such folks are out of step with
the rest of the culture, they consider this a point of pride rather
than a source of worry. They figure that the rest of the culture is
just a few steps behind and will catch up eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're a little weird,'' says Ken Hanson, a former
elementary school principal who built his dream house last October
outside Hondo after he and his wife, Nola, both retired from the
San Antonio school district. ``I had always envisioned building a
dome. I really like the concept; they will withstand a 400-mph
wind, and we wanted something that is very energy-efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looked at us like we're crazy, but to me it made
more sense than building square or rectangle. You know, your head's
not a square, and God decided to put the most precious organ we've
got in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly discovering that if ``you talk to an architect about a
dome, they have no concept; they've never been trained,'' the
Hansons found the road to domedom through a trip to Dallas, when
they saw the caterpillar and decided to stop on a whim. They
learned from South that another Texas retiree named Bill Click had
built his own dome in Bandera after attending a workshop, and that
he wanted to go into business building domes for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had worked for 10 or 12 years trying to design an
energy-efficient home, before a friend introduced me to the
Monolithic Dome,'' says Click, a former welder and instructor for
Amoco Oil. ``Right away, I realized there was no way I could build
a conventional home that was anywhere near as insulated. Plus, it's
completely fire-resistant because it's all concrete. The real
attractions are the economics and the security of it. We're still
struggling with the insurance companies because they don't know how
to write a policy on a place with no roof, no fires and no need of
replacement costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Any other drawbacks?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that's a little tough is the decorating,'' he
admits. ``You're not used to a curved wall, and it's hard to hang
pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   The dome that Click built for himself has 1,734 square feet. The
home he built for the Hansons last October is a double dome
connected by a breezeway foyer with a little more than 1,800 square
feet. Hanson says their residence looks a little like a brassiere
from the air, and that they were thinking of painting nipples on
the domes to amuse pilots flying private planes into the nearby
airport. Click says he already has 12 more customers who are
interested in having him build dome homes for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools are crazy not to build these,'' insists Hanson, a
former principal. ``The cost is recovered in 20 years (through
savings in utility bills), and the building will still be here in
500 years. If the people in Jarrell had built these, there wouldn't
have been any casualties.'' A conspiracy theory 'In engineering,
you always want to simplify,'' said Walter Burnham, owner of the
Rocky Mountain Dome Co., which he started three years ago in Idaho
after years of building subdivisions through conventional
construction. ``Instead of having 30,000 different pieces, we've
only got four materials.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnham became a convert to dome technology through his
experiences from rebuilding in areas that had been struck by
disaster. ``I knew that something had to happen after seeing all
those schools devastated and churches leveled,'' he continued. A
self-described UFOlogist, he believes that the dome is the shape of
progress, a progress impeded through a conspiracy of corporations
that have too much to lose in profit if the simplicity of the dome
prevails.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a land of image, and image says that an old
house with a point on top is home,'' he says. ``We're going up
against these corporate giants that have invested billions of
dollars in promoting the idea that `This is the home.' '' Waiting
for disaster Those who peer into the future and see a sea of
spheres where boxed homes used to be figure that we can't be more
than a few natural disasters and an energy crisis from popular
domedom. They see that domes have increasingly become the norm for
new construction of arenas and stadiums. (The Austin Ice Bats are
the latest team looking to build a ``monolithic-type dome,'' says
organization president Ed Novess, on Auditorium Shores or
elsewhere.)
</P>
<P>
   Domophiles believe that the brave, new world of residential
development is just around the corner. They talk of homes that can
withstand tornado winds and bomb detonations, of energy efficiency
that can cut utility bills in half.
</P>
<P>
   So, why doesn't everybody want to live in a dome?
</P>
<P>
   Because, South admits, it looks like a dome. When you've lived
since birth in a world that is square, there's considerable
resistance to coming around to round.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're born and slapped on the butt and dropped into a square
crib,'' South says. ``And from then on, we live in a square world.
We've just gotten used to square _ square beds, square rooms,
everything is square. People like to go to church in a
unique-looking building, or to sporting events. They love to go to
a Hyatt hotel because it's unique inside. But where they live, they
are more fashion-conscious, and they want to stay closer to what
they're used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a long time to convert mama to a dome,'' he
continues. ``But since we've been down here, there have been a
significant number of women who will drag their husband in here and
say, `Honey, this is what I want.' Because she's worried about
safety first, energy efficiency second, and what it looks like
third. You ask me what will be the driving force? One of these days
we're going to have a natural disaster, like a hurricane that will
come ashore and kill 10,000 or 100,000 people. And that will be the
driving force.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that you're rooting for a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, no,'' says South the son with a laugh. ``But what we
figure is, if a tornado is going to land, let it be on our
building.'' The money problem 'You just have to overcome the fears
of these buildings, the marketability,'' says Gary Clark, the
company's vice president of construction, as he leads a couple of
dozen workshop attendees through the construction of a dome. ``If
the average Joe America wants to find a loan company that will
finance a dome, it can be a problem. Who would buy the dome if you
wanted to sell it?''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of getting a conventional mortgage is that a
property's value is typically determined by ``comps'' _ the price
for which comparable houses in the area have been selling ,
typically three comps within the previous six months. Since domed
homes are often unique to an area, there are no comps through which
to determine their resale value.
</P>
<P>
   Those who build must either pay cash, put down a heftier than
usual down payment or indulge in creative financing. An
architectural dome enthusiast in Arizona is offering free plans to
any developer who will build a subdivision of at least 150 homes,
figuring the concept will then spread like seeds in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks want to see how many similar houses have been sold,''
Clark continues. ``And people who build domes don't sell them ;
they live in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Who are these people?
</P>
<P>
   ``You have individuals who are not trying to follow the standard
mold,'' he responds. ``We have people who are interested in it for
ecological aspects. We have people who are interested because of
self-sufficiency and safety. We have engineers interested in the
designer aspects. And we have retirees on a fixed income who are
interested in keeping their utility bills low.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have a lot of people who say, `I'd really be
interested if they just didn't look like domes.' Well, you can make
a dome look awfully attractive. All you have to do is throw a lot
of money at it.'' Deluxe dome home
</P>
<P>
   To that end, discussion inevitably turns to the ``Eye of the
Storm,'' the Taj Mahal of Domedom, the residence that Huiet and
Helen Paul built on Sullivans Island, S.C., after Hurricane Hugo
destroyed their previous home. It's a two-story, four-level
structure with a curved (naturally) staircase in its center, and it
encloses 5,000 square feet of living space. It cost more than
$600,000 to build, and sits on a lot valued at $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   See, say the dome enthusiasts, the Pauls could have built
anything, and they chose this. It has since withstood two lesser
hurricanes that found Sullivans Island evacuated. Except for the
Pauls, who felt safer in the ``Eye of the Storm'' than they would
have fleeing from it. An igloo or a shoebox? 'I've seen plenty of
estate homes that cost $500,000 or $600,000 that are virtual clones
of each other,'' says Michael Wesley, an Austin-based information
technology consultant who attended a recent workshop in Italy with
hopes of building his own dome and starting a business to build
others. ``With domes, everyone can be as creative as your
imagination. Builders don't want anything to do with it because
they don't want to change their standard way of doing things.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think, `Why would I want to live in an igloo?' My
argument to that is, `Why do I want to live in a shoebox?' ''
</P>
<P>
   How did Wesley become a convert?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been looking more at geodesic structures, but I subscribe
to Dome Magazine, saw an ad for Monolithic Domes, and they just
seemed like an easier way to build,'' he replies. ``It's a very
simple process. There's an Airform to inflate, some concrete to
mix, some foam to mix, and that's just about it. At the workshop,
we got plenty of hands-on experience, with the opportunity to
understand the entire process and to network.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to teach and train and push, push, keep on
pushing,'' says South, using the lunch break of his long workshop
day to preach the gospel of the dome. ``At one time, I wanted to
build all the domes, and it can't be done. The only way we're going
to see it done is to get a thousand dome builders. My goal is to
see the domes being used. When we made the decision to train and
teach, it did two things simultaneously. It gave us a bigger pool
of builders, but it also gave us a bigger pool of salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are going to run around and go into the school
boards and pound on the desks, and there'll be a lot of domes sold.
Unfortunately, it has taken a little longer than I thought, but
it'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   When?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not in my lifetime, but it'll happen,'' he insists.
``It's gotta happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the domed cave that serves as an office, the future is
already here. If you are David B. South, you can close your eyes
and see domes all over the countryside, eggshells where little
boxes used to be _ developments, neighborhoods, entire cities of
domes. If the rest of the world continues to think square, you know
that this is a mass delusion. For you know that the world is round.

<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ Florida's cattle ranchers will likely become the
latest victims of the state's continuing heat wave, adding to the
$80 million in crops already lost this summer, Agriculture
Commissioner Bob Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been this desperate in Florida in 50 years,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months of record-breaking heat, North Florida
farmers have lost $20 million worth of sweet corn, $20 million of
hay, $15 million in peanuts, $12 million in cotton and $10 million
in soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   It's that loss of hay _ about 95 percent of the expected crop
this year _ that in turn is cutting into the $150 million-a-year
cattle industry, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Large ranchers might be able to cope by purchasing hay from
other states, but smaller ranchers are more likely to ship their
calves to market early, depressing further an already low market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of pasture. We're out of hay,'' said Lawrence
Heitmeyer, director of Leon County's Agricultural Extension. ``We
just don't have anything to feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ranchers' losses won't translate into cheaper steaks at
the supermarket, cattle experts said. Rather than raising cattle to
the size necessary for slaughter, Florida cattlemen produce calves
that are then shipped to feed lots in the West and Midwest. Two
years later, the animals are sent to large slaughterhouses and then
to meat wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Don't look for cut-rate rib-eyes this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a couple of years to affect that price,'' said Mark
Kistler, head of the Okeechobee County Extension, adding that the
business has ``too many middlemen'' for consumers to see any
benefit at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for other foods, like corn or peanuts, may rise slightly,
depending on what happens to crops in other states, Crawford said.

 &HT;    ``If history had wings . . .''
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A woman in a pink dress with white daisies, who
remembered when President John F. Kennedy's body was flown from
Dallas to Washington, D.C., in the plane, spoke quietly, almost
reverently to her female companion. ``If the insides of this plane
could only talk. My goodness, the stories we would hear.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were among about 900 who visited the U.S. Air Force
Museum to tour the original Air Force One and to take a personal
look at the plane that winged presidents around the world.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who made the last official state
flight aboard this Air Force One last March said, ``If history had
wings, it would be this aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Some call the Boeing 707, which traveled more than 5 million
miles since it was put into service in 1962, the world's most
famous aircraft. After serving presidents, heads of state and world
dignitaries for 36 years, the plane called Special Air Mission
26000 by the Air Force is open for public inspection in the Air
Force Museum annex.
</P>
<P>
   The plane promises to be a star attraction.
</P>
<P>
   As the steady line of folks worked their way through the plane's
aisles, protected with plastic windows from ceiling to floor to
keep visitors from touching furniture or equipment, you hear the
same thoughts repeated in different ways: ``I think that is where
President Johnson stood when he was sworn in after President
Kennedy was shot. I think that is where President Kennedy's casket
was put. I think that is where Jackie Kennedy sat on the way back
from Dallas still wearing that blood-splattered dress.''
</P>
<P>
   The fateful Dallas trip in November 1963 when President Kennedy
was assassinated and President Johnson sworn into office will stand
out as the plane's most memorable hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of history here,'' said Orville Howard, 72, to
his grandson, Tim Fox, 12. They had come from Frankfort, Ind., to
see the plane. ``I wanted Tim to see this. For those of us who
remember the dark days when President Kennedy was assassinated,
this brings a bit of closure, in a way. And it is just amazing to
think of the famous people who have been on this incredible plane.
So much history here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cy and Audrey Laughter plan to visit the plane soon. The
Laughters were supporters and friends of President Richard Nixon,
and remember the time they had lunch on the plane as it was parked
at Andrews Air Force Base in 1969. ``It was a gift from President
Nixon to us to lunch there,'' Laughter said. ``The plane brings
back many memories for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferdinand McElroy, 32, of Springfield brought his two kids and
two neighborhood youngsters to see the famous plane Monday. ``I
think it is important for the young ones to have a sense of
history,'' McElroy said. ``Things happened on this plane that
shaped the future of our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Works, on hand as a greeter for visitors to the plane, said
she is moved every time she boards the plane. ``I get a chill,''
she said. ``There's something about it that just gets you.''

 &HT;    Donated frozen embryos save Florida couple from childlessness
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ A couple has been selected to receive six
frozen embryos offered for donation last December and will have
them implanted in late July, according to the lawyer who conducted
a nationwide search.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Charlotte Danciu would not identify the couple except
to say they aren't from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A Broward County couple who identified themselves only as Donna
and Ron offered last December to donate the embryos, frozen for
seven years after Donna had one child from an implantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's very excited,'' Danciu said. ``We want to
encourage other people to do this. These were the ones, and it
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Danciu said she received about 50 legitimate inquiries. Many
were eliminated for medical reasons or because they didn't meet the
couple's requirement that any children be raised in a Christian
family. Interviews determined the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   Danciu also said other couples have since inquired about
donating embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The donation comes as the medical industry wrestles with the
ethics of infertility, a $2 billion-a-year business. While selling
embryos for profit violates medical ethics rules, some clinics
reportedly sell eggs left by patients and fertilized by donor sperm
to desperate couples. Ethicists have said the practice could lead
to ``designer babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron, a 43-year-old production manager, and Donna, a 41-year-old
homemaker, had tried for 15 years to conceive. In 1989, doctors
fertilized 15 embryos and implanted four. One took: young Ronnie
was born in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult pregnancy, and Donna almost died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple concluded they wouldn't try again, but they did
nothing about the nine remaining embryos, which were frozen. Donna
later learned a vial containing three embryos had broken, and the
clinic planned to begin charging $600 a year for storage.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the couple decided to give the embryos away.

 &HT;    Man sues Lamborghini for selling defective car
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ He thought he'd be James Bond-cool in
his new purple Lamborghini, which came complete with a hydraulic
lift to get the low frame over the speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   But once the car's battery died, and the roof started leaking,
and the doors stuck shut, and the steering wheel rapped his knees,
and the sunroof latches thwacked him in the head, John Martin's new
car seemed more like something from the garage of Inspector
Clouseau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted a quality vehicle,'' he said. ``With all the
money you're paying, you expect the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, filed a lawsuit in federal court
charging the Automobili Lamborghini company, maker of his 1997
Diablo Roadster model, with knowingly selling him a defective car.
Martin's lawyer, Saul Smolar, said he has sworn statements from
four former employees of the Italian automaker who said the company
has concealed a litany of faults with the Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Few Lamborghinis are on the road, probably because of their
prohibitive cost (including the Ferrari he traded in, Martin and
his parents paid about $240,000 for his). But Smolar and two other
law firms want to make Martin's suit a class-action on behalf of
the 50 to 60 other people in the United States who bought Diablos.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's suit seeks repayment for the car, repair costs,
insurance costs and interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Diablo went on the market in 1996 as Lamborghini's first car
intended for typical driving conditions. Until then, Lamborghinis _
which can reach speeds exceeding 200 mph _ primarily were racing
cars, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with the Diablos, Smolar says, are their
distinctive vertical doors. The windows are supposed to retract
slightly to let the door rise, but often the windows get stuck,
preventing passengers inside from getting out. The doors also are
part of the leaking problem, in which the car fills with water
every time it rains, Smolar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a Diablo that does not leak,'' Smolar said. ``You
need an umbrella in the car if you are going to drive in the
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his car was in the shop more than 10 times for
repairs, the last time for nearly three weeks. He said the
dealership that sold him the car, Prestige Imports in North Miami
Beach, refused at first to take the car back.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the car's makers sent Martin a recall notice, offering
to fix a switch in the door and recommending that Martin drive with
the windows slightly open at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's lawsuit lists still more complaints about his car: It
stalls, it's rusting, the horn doesn't work, and lights on the
dashboard sometimes flicker inexplicably. Not even that nifty
hydraulic lift is working; he says he's still bouncing off the
speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a pharmacy student at Broward Community College, has
placed his Lamborghini in the garage. Now he's driving a sports
utility vehicle made by Mercedes Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gave up on anything Italian except pasta,'' he said.

   GEO-DOMES _ ITALY, Texas _ You are a practical man, and you've
been waiting a quarter-century for the world to beat a path to your
door. Since 1990, that door has been on the outskirts of Italy, an
hour's drive south of Dallas off Interstate 35, where the signpost
welcomes visitors to ``The Biggest Little Town in Texas.'' Your
geodesic dome workshops have drawn dreamers and schemers from coast
to coast, and from Puerto Rico to Saudi Arabia, most of them hoping
to capitalize on your vision of the future as dome sweet dome. They
pay you $750 per workshop to have you show them how to build a dome
on your property _ so they then can build their own. (McLeese,

the original Air Force One and to take a personal look at the plane
that winged presidents around the world. (Huffman, Dayton Daily

 &HT;    COLUMN: So much for vacations...
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. The toughest part of being a schoolteacher is
summer vacation. Sounds a little odd, I know, but it's the truth.
Too
</P>
<P>
   much free time. Too many decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   The most strenuous one of all is about getting up in the morning
- as in when to, or even whether to. I love not having to wake up
at 5:45
</P>
<P>
   with Big Ben jitterbugging in my ear and I look forward to
summer when my sleeping arrangements move from a sensible, indoor
bed to a hammock
</P>
<P>
   on the upstairs screened porch. I can snooze away in the
treetops enjoying the nighttime skies and sounds. The luxury of
cool evenings and
</P>
<P>
   good books bids me stay awake a little longer. No wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, my bucolic reveries are invariably short-lived because
just as I'm settling down, my back yard is coming to life.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere around the witching hour, the `possum comes for a
drink but since he's too short and can't fly, it's impossible for
him to reach
</P>
<P>
   the birdbath - even on tippytoes (I've watched him). That's when
the dish gets shoved off of its pedestal and lands with a
resounding thud
</P>
<P>
   upside down in the pansies. First time it happened, I scrambled
out the wrong side of the hammock just in time to see Mr. Possum's
fat backside
</P>
<P>
   waddling off into the herb garden.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights in a row I was jump-started out of a sound sleep by
a thirsty `possum. Belatedly, good sense set in. Why not give him
his own
</P>
<P>
   water dish? That old crock in the garage would be just the
ticket. I cleaned it, filled it, and put it next to the birdbath.
And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   No more crashes in the night...but!
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever heard a `possum drink? ``Shluurp! Shlooop! Slop!
Slop!'' The first night I heard the racket, I pulled the comforter
over
</P>
<P>
   my head figuring Godzilla was on the loose and had decided to
make my backyard his refuge. ``Shlop! Shluurp!'' I couldn't help
but wonder: How
</P>
<P>
   thirsty can a dinosaur get?
</P>
<P>
   Serene summer's evenings, when the sun is setting and the
neighbors have stopped torturing me with steaks-on-the-grill
smells,
</P>
<P>
   just beg to have windows flung open and doors onto screened
porches left ajar to welcome the night air. My cats like it too. By
nature they are
</P>
<P>
   nocturnal creatures, but by edict (mine) they are also
housebound, and so the closest they come to experiencing nature in
the raw is through
</P>
<P>
   the screens - usually on the downstairs back porch which just
happens to be directly under my sleeping aerie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rrroooowww! Spaat! Hissst!'' It's four in the morning and the
girls (Stella, a 13-year-old white, and Biddy, a 9-year-old mouthy
</P>
<P>
   Siamese) are having a little disagreement with a gentleman
caller from a couple of houses down. I give them five minutes to
settle it or until I
</P>
<P>
   hear the sound of claws climbing screens, before I roll out and
go to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woo-wow!'' That's the interloper. ``Wooo-oo!'' I think he's
telling the ladies how good looking he thinks they are and asking
them to come
</P>
<P>
   out for a moonlight frog chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eee-YOW!'' That's Biddy shrieking like a fishwife.
Translation: Get your fuzzy feets off my back steps RIGHT NOW, you
ugly hairball! The
</P>
<P>
   girls ain't long on manners. I intervene before the neighbors
start throwing old shoes at all of us. ``Go home, Mr. Thomas,'' I
holler. He's
</P>
<P>
   surprised to hear a people voice from somewhere in the treetops
and skedaddles. I roll over and pull the comforter back over my
head. It's
</P>
<P>
   cold out here.
</P>
<P>
   At exactly 5:45 I hear footsteps approaching. Clomp! Stomp! Onto
the sleeping porch. There's a scurrying sound as Biddy turns three
</P>
<P>
   circles before making a pass at the porch rail. Scuttle! Scrape!
Thump! She misses and goes back in the house to soothe her dignity
and pretend
</P>
<P>
   it never happened. She'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I feel eyes on me which is a little unnerving
considering I'm abed and most improperly attired. I peek out and
there's
</P>
<P>
   a squirrel hanging by his toenails from the gutter, watching me.
I blink. He clucks.
</P>
<P>
   Galumph! Scrabble! Thunk! Biddy's back and she's made it onto
the rail. The squirrel doesn't move. His chatter gets louder. More
footsteps
</P>
<P>
   approach. Stella has left her favorite bunny-watching basement
window and come to join the fun. She makes the rail in one pass -
thanks to
</P>
<P>
   agility and the fact that she weighs only half what her Siamese
sister does.
</P>
<P>
   Now, both cats are chatting up one very vocal and absolutely
fearless squirrel...and I'm wide awake. ``I might as well try to
sleep in
</P>
<P>
   a zoo,'' I mumble as I roll over and try to squeeze out an extra
five minutes. Nobody's listening.
</P>
<P>
   So much for decisions.
</P>
<P>
   And so much for vacations.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio. The toughest part of being a

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Over all these years, I've misspelled names
and places, and gotten dates wrong, even matched the wrong person
with an event. And made some bad decisions. But never
intentionally. Neither have any of the people I've worked with. All
this comes to mind because of Patricia Smith, the Boston Globe
columnist and Pulitzer Prize finalist, who was exposed recently as
fabricating quotes, people and events, and forced to resign.

   GEO-DOMES _ ITALY, Texas _ You are a practical man, and you've
been waiting a quarter-century for the world to beat a path to your
door. Since 1990, that door has been on the outskirts of Italy, an
hour's drive south of Dallas off Interstate 35, where the signpost
welcomes visitors to ``The Biggest Little Town in Texas.'' Your
geodesic dome workshops have drawn dreamers and schemers from coast
to coast, and from Puerto Rico to Saudi Arabia, most of them hoping
to capitalize on your vision of the future as dome sweet dome. They
pay you $750 per workshop to have you show them how to build a dome
on your property _ so they then can build their own. (McLeese,

the original Air Force One and to take a personal look at the plane

   TECHREPORT _ But times have changed. Now there are cordless

road, you're missing calls at home. Oh, sure, you have an answering

<P>
   It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of China's place in
the world today, or of the role it is likely to play in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As President Bill Clinton has said, our relationship with China
``will in large measure help determine whether the new century is
one of peace, security and prosperity for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of the world's population lives in China. It
has the world's third-largest economy. It is a nuclear weapons
state, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and, after
the United States, the world's largest source of greenhouse gases.
China shares borders with 14 other nations _ more than any country
in the world _ and it has unresolved border disputes with four of
them.
</P>
<P>
   From maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula to resolving
the economic problems of East Asia to addressing global warming,
China will play a key role in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   That role can be helpful or harmful, and it is the task of
American diplomacy to ensure that it is indeed helpful. The manner
in which we engage China will have an important bearing on whether
China becomes integrated as a constructive participant in
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to China presents an opportunity to continue
building a productive relationship with this vast country, one that
will benefit both of our peoples for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 26 years, six presidents have all striven to
achieve a proper balance in our relationship with China. But
engagement with China does not mean endorsement. To accomplish our
goals, we need a clear policy that firmly advances American
interests and values.
</P>
<P>
   We must assert our positions on issues ranging from
nonproliferation to intellectual property. We must voice our belief
in the universality of human rights. And we must make clear our
commitment to the peaceful resolution of the differences between
China and Taiwan. Clinton's policy of engagement with China meets
these needs.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy is based on the premise that it is in our interest
to work toward the emergence of a great, stable, open and
nonaggressive China that embraces political pluralism and global
norms of conduct and that works with us to build a secure
international order, as well as peace and stability in the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy has thus far achieved significant results. After
decades of rejecting such cooperation, since 1992, the People's
Republic of China has signed on to a variety of nonproliferation
regimes, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, when the five permanent members of the Security
Council met in Geneva to discuss nuclear tests in India and
Pakistan, China _ this month's coordinator for the permanent five _
oversaw efforts that led to a forceful expression of the
international community's determination to stabilize the situation
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, where American and Chinese troops once battled, we are
now working together with China in the Four Party Talks aimed at
finally realizing a permanent peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   China has also released on medical parole to the United States
such prominent dissidents as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, signed the
U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and has
pledged to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
   However, many differences remain. We continue to push for more
progress on our nonproliferation, trade, human rights and energy
and environment agendas. Clinton's visit offers an opportunity to
energetically press for such progress. Meanwhile, we have seen
China move in the right direction, toward greater acceptance of
international norms.
</P>
<P>
   In our determination to address these challenges, we must not
ignore the achievements. And to make further progress, expand
cooperation and advance our national interests, we should continue
our engagement with the Chinese people and government through firm,
forceful and patient diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   On regional and global issues, in the areas of nonproliferation,
economic cooperation and even human rights _ where much more
progress is still needed _ the achievements are real, and our
policy is working.

 c.1998 MSNBC and the Center for War, Peace and the News Media  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Whether the United States can ever come to terms with China and
forge the ``strategic partnership'' the Clinton administration
envisions rests on one crucial issue: China's record on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1994 decision to ``delink'' human rights from China's
``most favored nation'' trading status, the Clinton administration
has been struggling to find a credible way to address human rights.
It has yet to come up with an effective strategy that is clearly
based on principle and consistently carried out. Only such an
approach has a chance of being taken seriously _ in Beijing or on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White House has pressed for token gestures by China
that give the appearance of making progress, while overall
human-rights conditions remain essentially unchanged:
</P>
<P>
   _ There has been some loosening of restrictions of free speech
and assembly, but overt challenges to Communist Party rule are
routinely suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worker unrest is growing and the government has squelched any
attempts to organize independent trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang remains
intense. Though officially sanctioned religious groups are
thriving, state controls on unofficial religious activity remain in
place.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crime campaign, called ``Strike Hard,'' has resulted in
hundreds of thousands of arbitrary arrests and thousands of
executions. Torture and ill-treatment in prisons and labor camps is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legal reforms have instituted greater protections of
defendants' rights, at least on paper, and the elimination of some
political crimes. But with the party and the state firmly in
control of the judicial system, China is a long way from meeting
international legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this dismal record, in March the Clinton administration
dropped sponsorship of a critical resolution on China at the annual
meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Every
year since 1990, the United States and other governments had pushed
a China motion in Geneva, triggering a worldwide lobbying effort by
Beijing, anxious to avoid U.N. censure and a loss of face.
</P>
<P>
   But when China agreed to release Wang Dan and other dissidents,
and promised to sign a key U.N. human-rights treaty, the
administration backed off. Not only was Beijing let off the hook,
but the prospects of using the U.N. forum as an incentive to get
China to make more far-reaching human-rights reforms are now
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   The president says that summitry and high-level meetings offer a
more ``practical'' and productive route to encourage change than
criticism, and the outcome of the summit may reinforce his argument
that ``constructive engagement'' works. But if the visit is long on
photo opportunities but short on results, it will raise questions
about a policy toward a China that shrugs off virtually all forms
of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   What can the president realistically achieve at the summit? It's
important that Clinton speak out publicly about human rights while
he is in China. He should reconsider participating in an official
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and he should meet with
family members of the victims of the 1989 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other things Clinton can do to address human rights on
his visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek agreement to release or review the sentences of some
2,000 persons imprisoned on vague charges of
``counter-revolutionary activities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Convince the Chinese government to grant unrestricted access
to Tibet and Xinjiang by foreign journalists and human-rights
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Persuade Chinese officials to review current regulations
requiring all religious bodies to register with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Press Beijing to protect the rights of Chinese workers,
including those seeking to exercise their rights under the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(which China signed last October).
</P>
<P>
   _ Promote the lifting of restrictions on Chinese citizens living
abroad who have been blacklisted and forbidden to return to China
because of their pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek a commitment to end the system of re-education through
labor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with China have reached a critical point, but
where they go from here will depend, at least in part, on how
successful the White House can be in translating its rhetoric about
human rights into meaningful policy and action.

<P>
   Whether the United States can ever come to terms with China and
forge the ``strategic partnership'' the Clinton administration
envisions rests on one crucial issue: China's record on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1994 decision to ``delink'' human rights from China's
``most favored nation'' trading status, the Clinton administration
has been struggling to find a credible way to address human rights.
It has yet to come up with an effective strategy that is clearly
based on principle and consistently carried out. Only such an
approach has a chance of being taken seriously _ in Beijing or on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White House has pressed for token gestures by China
that give the appearance of making progress, while overall
human-rights conditions remain essentially unchanged:
</P>
<P>
   _ There has been some loosening of restrictions of free speech
and assembly, but overt challenges to Communist Party rule are
routinely suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worker unrest is growing and the government has squelched any
attempts to organize independent trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang remains
intense. Though officially sanctioned religious groups are
thriving, state controls on unofficial religious activity remain in
place.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crime campaign, called ``Strike Hard,'' has resulted in
hundreds of thousands of arbitrary arrests and thousands of
executions. Torture and ill-treatment in prisons and labor camps is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legal reforms have instituted greater protections of
defendants' rights, at least on paper, and the elimination of some
political crimes. But with the party and the state firmly in
control of the judicial system, China is a long way from meeting
international legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this dismal record, in March the Clinton administration
dropped sponsorship of a critical resolution on China at the annual
meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Every
year since 1990, the United States and other governments had pushed
a China motion in Geneva, triggering a worldwide lobbying effort by
Beijing, anxious to avoid U.N. censure and a loss of face.
</P>
<P>
   But when China agreed to release Wang Dan and other dissidents,
and promised to sign a key U.N. human-rights treaty, the
administration backed off. Not only was Beijing let off the hook,
but the prospects of using the U.N. forum as an incentive to get
China to make more far-reaching human-rights reforms are now
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   The president says that summitry and high-level meetings offer a
more ``practical'' and productive route to encourage change than
criticism, and the outcome of the summit may reinforce his argument
that ``constructive engagement'' works. But if the visit is long on
photo opportunities but short on results, it will raise questions
about a policy toward a China that shrugs off virtually all forms
of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   What can the president realistically achieve at the summit? It's
important that Clinton speak out publicly about human rights while
he is in China. He should reconsider participating in an official
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and he should meet with
family members of the victims of the 1989 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other things Clinton can do to address human rights on
his visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek agreement to release or review the sentences of some
2,000 persons imprisoned on vague charges of
``counter-revolutionary activities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Convince the Chinese government to grant unrestricted access
to Tibet and Xinjiang by foreign journalists and human-rights
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Persuade Chinese officials to review current regulations
requiring all religious bodies to register with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Press Beijing to protect the rights of Chinese workers,
including those seeking to exercise their rights under the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(which China signed last October).
</P>
<P>
   _ Promote the lifting of restrictions on Chinese citizens living
abroad who have been blacklisted and forbidden to return to China
because of their pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek a commitment to end the system of re-education through
labor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with China have reached a critical point, but
where they go from here will depend, at least in part, on how
successful the White House can be in translating its rhetoric about
human rights into meaningful policy and action.

<P>
   We are at the threshold of a new millennium. Since the end of
the Cold War, the world has undergone profound changes. The
international situation on the whole is moving toward greater
relaxation. Peace and development, economic prosperity and social
progress _ all these have become the common desire of all nations
and the imperatives of our times.
</P>
<P>
   But there still exist many destabilizing factors in the world.
The planet we call home is far from a tranquil and peaceful land.
How to bring a peaceful, stable and prosperous world into the 21st
century is a huge challenge facing all of us.
</P>
<P>
   China and the United States are two great nations. One is the
largest developing country and the other is the largest developed
country. Both are permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
The two countries share common interests in maintaining peace and
stability both in Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
   We share great responsibilities in promoting global economic
cooperation, preventing proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, cracking down on international terrorism, drug
trafficking, cross-border crimes and many other areas.
</P>
<P>
   There is huge potential for cooperation between China and the
United States in the areas of economic cooperation and trade,
science and technology, education, culture, energy, environmental
protection, legal and military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   During the recent nuclear crisis in South Asia, China and the
United States had very fruitful cooperation and reached a common
strategy in dealing with the situation. In the ongoing Asian
financial crisis, China and the United States have conducted
dialogues on several occasions and contributed a great deal in
their respective ways to stabilize the financial situation in the
region, which has won wide appreciation and acclaim from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   These developments demonstrate that the strategic importance of
China and the United States has not diminished, but increased. The
potential for both countries to cooperate in various fields is
expanding, not dwindling.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government attaches great importance to China-U.S.
relations and places it on top of its foreign-relations agenda.
Over the years, China has made tremendous efforts to improve and
develop this important connection because we believe maintaining a
sound and stable linkage between the two countries not only serves
the interests of our two peoples but also the peace and development
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, as we differ in social system, history, cultural
background and level of economic development, it is natural that
there are differences between us. The key is that these differences
should be bridged or narrowed through dialogue on the basis of
equality and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   If we cannot resolve them immediately, we should put them aside
and not let them stand in the way of seeking common ground and
further strengthening our ties. We should learn to agree to
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is the most important and most sensitive issue in
China-U.S. relations and is at the heart of the three joint
communiques between our two nations. U.S. leaders have reaffirmed
on many occasions America's commitment to the ``one China'' policy
and to the three joint communiques.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has also undertaken that it does not support
``two Chinas'' or ``one China, one Taiwan,'' it does not support
the ``independence of Taiwan,'' and it does not support Taiwan's
entry into the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that if the Taiwan question is handled improperly,
it can be the biggest obstacle to the sound growth of our ties. It
is our hope that the United States will honor its commitment on the
question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It is very unfortunate that at the moment when China and the
United States were intensively preparing for the visit to China by
President Bill Clinton, we heard some noises in China-U.S.
relations. Some people even spread rumors and fabricated stories
with ulterior political motives. This is really an appalling
development.
</P>
<P>
   We hope that the political leaders in both China and the United
States should once again show their wisdom, courage and strategic
vision, as did our leaders in early '70s. We should work together
to overcome the interference and, relying on the consensus reached
between our respective leaders, expand our common ground, increase
trust, reduce difference and press forward toward our goal: to
bring a stable, healthy China-U.S. relationship into the 21st
century.

<P>
   On the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to China, he is
being admonished not to visit Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989
bloodshed, and to press Beijing to permit full religious freedom
and other human rights.
</P>
<P>
   By overwhelming votes, the House has voted to ban the sale of
missile and satellite technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Clinton will be balancing a complex array of competing
interests on his China trip. But this is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   China has long been a contentious and prominent subject of
debate in American domestic politics. The debate over who ``lost''
China spawned McCarthyism in the early 1950s. Open conflict in
Korea between China and the United States intensified the
bitterness. It took two figures with unassailable anti-Communist
credentials, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, to begin the
process of normalization, powerfully aided by the Cold War and
Beijing's growing apprehensions about Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square
caused a resurgence of American anger. Thus, candidates Clinton and
Gore used China against President George Bush in l992, accusing him
of coddling dictators. Today, it is Clinton who is accused by
critics of appeasing Beijing and risking security breaches by
authorizing the sale of high-tech products having military
applicability.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when U.S.-China relations can affect the entire
Asia-Pacific region _ including such crucial issues as North and
South Korea, nuclear proliferation and the Asian economic crisis _
domestic politics guarantees that the relationship will remain
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   On China, there are many and varied domestic constituencies. An
important portion of the American business community _ the aircraft
industry, electronics firms and other high-tech operations _ have
long lobbied for fuller access to the China market, citing the
policies of other nations and the advantages of a China that is
increasingly linked to the international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural producers also have a strong interest in the China
market. These forces are heard when the yearly issue of renewal of
Most Favored Nation treatment is debated.
</P>
<P>
   Among conservatives, however, there is a strong anti-China
strain and a tendency to cast China in relatively static,
absolutist terms. More importantly, human-rights groups that span
the political spectrum _ joined by a significant portion of the
U.S. media _ scrutinize China's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   These groups remain unsatisfied with ``token actions'' such as
the release of dissidents like Wang Dan. Tibet is an issue evoking
powerful feelings, driven by an understanding that Tibetan culture
as well as civil rights are being progressively crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture is Taiwan, which enjoys a
generally favorable image in the United States as a society that
has successfully combined economic growth and democracy, and hence
should have its desires recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minority of American scholars and journalists espouse the
``China threat'' position, arguing that confrontation is inevitable
with an emerging, assertive China. Most accept a more complex view,
seeing China as capable of taking diverse roads in the future, with
American policy being a potentially significant factor in
determining which road.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that it is desirable to build a mix of incentives and
deterrents to promote regional and global cooperation. They assert
that efforts at containment would isolate the United States, not
China, and abet the extremist cause.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing came to a fuller recognition of the nature of American
politics long after Taiwan. Hence, its attention to the U.S.
Congress and public has grown recently, along with questions about
the tactics used in seeking greater influence, an issue earlier
raised with respect to the Taiwan lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, both Beijing and Taipei are now engaged in seeking
support at many levels within U.S. society. Meanwhile, in China,
domestic politics is also a factor in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, among whom certain military and senior party
officials are to be included, remain skeptical of close ties with
the United States, citing the risks of ``spiritual pollution.'' And
the current force of a resurgent Chinese nationalism makes itself
felt within the younger generation and among Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, criticism of America's purported effort to maintain ``a
unipolar world'' is coupled with an oft-repeated insistence that
there must be no interference in China's internal affairs. The
sovereignty of the nation-state must be absolute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese pragmatists welcome the decline in ideological
barriers to the outside, and the growing interaction with their
American counterparts. And they are becoming more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in both the United States and China, internal divisions
and debate over our bilateral relations will continue. Yet it is
likely that the governments of the two nations will opt for
policies that seek to maximize cooperation, while subjecting
differences to extensive negotiations. Mutual criticisms, official
and unofficial, will be voiced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet America will increasingly recognize that China is changing.
Leninism is giving way to authoritarian pluralism. Politics is
still controlled in varying degree, but a civil society apart from
the state is emerging, with diverse interests being voiced. The
economy is increasingly mixed, with the private sector rising in
importance. Communication with such a society is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, U.S.-China relations will reflect a broader and
more complex pattern of international relations. In the 21st
century, on a widening range of issues _ from economics and
security to the environment _ nations like the United States and
China will be able to fashion common policies, working together,
both bilaterally and multilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   But given the unresolved issues, nationalist passions and
political divisions, the simultaneous maintenance of a balance of
power is required to discourage a resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on this combination, and counting also on the domestic
problems that will take priority and the growing economic
interdependence of all nations, we can hopefully relegate to
history the global wars of the past 100 years.

<P>
   On the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to China, he is
being admonished not to visit Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989
bloodshed, and to press Beijing to permit full religious freedom
and other human rights.
</P>
<P>
   By overwhelming votes, the House has voted to ban the sale of
missile and satellite technology to China.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Clinton will be balancing a complex array of competing
interests on his China trip. But this is nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   China has long been a contentious and prominent subject of
debate in American domestic politics. The debate over who ``lost''
China spawned McCarthyism in the early 1950s. Open conflict in
Korea between China and the United States intensified the
bitterness. It took two figures with unassailable anti-Communist
credentials, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, to begin the
process of normalization, powerfully aided by the Cold War and
Beijing's growing apprehensions about Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square
caused a resurgence of American anger. Thus, candidates Clinton and
Gore used China against President George Bush in l992, accusing him
of coddling dictators. Today, it is Clinton who is accused by
critics of appeasing Beijing and risking security breaches by
authorizing the sale of high-tech products having military
applicability.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when U.S.-China relations can affect the entire
Asia-Pacific region _ including such crucial issues as North and
South Korea, nuclear proliferation and the Asian economic crisis _
domestic politics guarantees that the relationship will remain
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   On China, there are many and varied domestic constituencies. An
important portion of the American business community _ the aircraft
industry, electronics firms and other high-tech operations _ have
long lobbied for fuller access to the China market, citing the
policies of other nations and the advantages of a China that is
increasingly linked to the international marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Agricultural producers also have a strong interest in the China
market. These forces are heard when the yearly issue of renewal of
Most Favored Nation treatment is debated.
</P>
<P>
   Among conservatives, however, there is a strong anti-China
strain and a tendency to cast China in relatively static,
absolutist terms. More importantly, human-rights groups that span
the political spectrum _ joined by a significant portion of the
U.S. media _ scrutinize China's human-rights record.
</P>
<P>
   These groups remain unsatisfied with ``token actions'' such as
the release of dissidents like Wang Dan. Tibet is an issue evoking
powerful feelings, driven by an understanding that Tibetan culture
as well as civil rights are being progressively crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture is Taiwan, which enjoys a
generally favorable image in the United States as a society that
has successfully combined economic growth and democracy, and hence
should have its desires recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Only a minority of American scholars and journalists espouse the
``China threat'' position, arguing that confrontation is inevitable
with an emerging, assertive China. Most accept a more complex view,
seeing China as capable of taking diverse roads in the future, with
American policy being a potentially significant factor in
determining which road.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that it is desirable to build a mix of incentives and
deterrents to promote regional and global cooperation. They assert
that efforts at containment would isolate the United States, not
China, and abet the extremist cause.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing came to a fuller recognition of the nature of American
politics long after Taiwan. Hence, its attention to the U.S.
Congress and public has grown recently, along with questions about
the tactics used in seeking greater influence, an issue earlier
raised with respect to the Taiwan lobby.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, both Beijing and Taipei are now engaged in seeking
support at many levels within U.S. society. Meanwhile, in China,
domestic politics is also a factor in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, among whom certain military and senior party
officials are to be included, remain skeptical of close ties with
the United States, citing the risks of ``spiritual pollution.'' And
the current force of a resurgent Chinese nationalism makes itself
felt within the younger generation and among Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, criticism of America's purported effort to maintain ``a
unipolar world'' is coupled with an oft-repeated insistence that
there must be no interference in China's internal affairs. The
sovereignty of the nation-state must be absolute.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chinese pragmatists welcome the decline in ideological
barriers to the outside, and the growing interaction with their
American counterparts. And they are becoming more vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in both the United States and China, internal divisions
and debate over our bilateral relations will continue. Yet it is
likely that the governments of the two nations will opt for
policies that seek to maximize cooperation, while subjecting
differences to extensive negotiations. Mutual criticisms, official
and unofficial, will be voiced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet America will increasingly recognize that China is changing.
Leninism is giving way to authoritarian pluralism. Politics is
still controlled in varying degree, but a civil society apart from
the state is emerging, with diverse interests being voiced. The
economy is increasingly mixed, with the private sector rising in
importance. Communication with such a society is possible.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, U.S.-China relations will reflect a broader and
more complex pattern of international relations. In the 21st
century, on a widening range of issues _ from economics and
security to the environment _ nations like the United States and
China will be able to fashion common policies, working together,
both bilaterally and multilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   But given the unresolved issues, nationalist passions and
political divisions, the simultaneous maintenance of a balance of
power is required to discourage a resort to force.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on this combination, and counting also on the domestic
problems that will take priority and the growing economic
interdependence of all nations, we can hopefully relegate to
history the global wars of the past 100 years.

 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ An update on adolescent hijinks in suburban
Albany:
</P>
<P>
   _ A high school junior is charged with a misdemeanor after,
according to the police, he sent an e-mail to the mayor of Cohoes,
threatening to kill him. And, the police say, after the kid
threatened to gun down his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   His father's response: ``This is a big joke. This is a very good
son, and everything is all right.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Five seniors are accused of slipping into Duanesburg High
School through a window after hours and breaking into the lockers
of other students.
</P>
<P>
   The response of the parents of one kid: ``They removed only
school-owned textbooks ... from lockers and stacked them on the
school-owned floor of the school-owned cafeteria, not taking them
off school premises. Explain to us how that becomes a burglary in
the third degree?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Seventeen seniors break into Bethlehem High School. According
to the police, they destroyed a dozen classroom locks, damaged 10
desks, plugged up two drinking fountains and poured cooking oil on
the tile floors of several corridors.
</P>
<P>
   Total damage _ about $3,200. When the kids were barred from
graduation exercises, the reaction of the parent of one high school
student was: ``It seems to me that the administration's response
has not carefully weighed the potential impact on the lives of
these students ... Are we as parents and educators willing to hold
ourselves blameless when behavioral anomalies result in destructive
events?''
</P>
<P>
   As the school year winds down, things like this are happening
all over the country. High school kids are getting weird, and their
parents are getting even weirder. All of which, I think, raises
this crucial question:
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time for this society to require a license for
parenting? After all, in most places you need a license to raise a
dog. Raising a kid is less important? Or, at least, shouldn't there
be some test _ even an oral _ to determine if a would-be parent
knows right from wrong and possesses some small inclination to
transmit that information to a boneheaded, hormone-soaked
adolescent?
</P>
<P>
   Having raised two kids _ and possessing a finely-honed
appreciation of how challenging that chore can be, especially
during their teen-age years _ I never cease to be amazed at the
attitudes some parents adopt when their kids do something stupid,
destructive and/or dangerous to others. Not to mention when those
kids commit serious crimes in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Take the kids last year who burglarized Burnt Hills-Ballston
Lake High in the Albany suburbs to keep the school from opening
after Christmas break. One set of parents fought that suspension
all the way to the New York state education commissioner. Take the
parents in Fultonville-Fonda, another Albany suburban area, who
were infuriated when the school board tried to keep a few would-be
bombers off the high school football squad. Hey, say parents like
this, boys will be boys, won't they? After all, they're just kids.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Billy the Kid was a kid; that's why they called him that.
Before a lawman named Pat Garrett finally killed him, Billy the Kid
gunned down 20 men.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe that was only a little teen-age horseplay.
Nonetheless, this was not a nice person.
</P>
<P>
   Billy the Kid probably didn't see himself that way. He probably
figured that, OK, so I get a little out of hand occasionally. I'm
really a good guy, though.
</P>
<P>
   What he never understood, apparently, was that you are what you
do. If you kill, then you're a killer. If you steal, then you're a
thief. If you commit burglary, then you're a burglar.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for any kid to distinguish what he does from who he
is. The prisons are jammed with guys who can't connect what they
did with who they are. But if it's not the responsibility of a
kid's parents to tell him that what he does defines him, then just
whose job is it?
</P>
<P>
   If you're not up to that, then you have no business whatever
splashing around in the gene pool.

WHY GAY-BASHING REPUBLICANS ARE KILLING THE PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Hormel is the kind of guy who needs a bigger
job than being ambassador to Luxembourg. Right now he has one.
</P>
<P>
   Just by sitting and waiting for Senate confirmation, he's
helping the Republican Party destroy itself.
</P>
<P>
   That probably is the last thing Hormel would want. He's a true
gentleman from an old Republican family, not a man who would find
pleasure in watching the party of Lincoln be embarrassed by stupid
comments from the likes of Trent Lott, Dick Armey and Don Nickles
about the nature of sexuality and sin.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, politicians lectured the American people on sexuality and
sin, while killing major tobacco legislation and Lord knows how
many teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to get some expert opinion on sin from America's only
native criminal class, as Mark Twain described Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Homophobia was a plague upon both houses of Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   First, Lott, the Senate majority leader who has been holding up
Hormel's confirmation, said homosexuality is a sin, but a treatable
one, like kleptomania, of all things to spring into a politician's
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Next, Armey, the House majority leader who once called Rep.
Barney Frank ``Barney Fag,'' quoted biblical verses that he said
showed homosexuality is a sin.
</P>
<P>
   He ignored verses defining remarriage after divorce as a sin _ a
sin committed by many Republicans, including Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Nickles, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, said
Hormel was unfit to be an ambassador because those who promote
``immoral behavior'' shouldn't represent the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this has been a perfectly moral country from the very
beginning, when we stole it from the Indians we killed.
</P>
<P>
   Let me tell you about the first time I met Jim Hormel vs. the
first time I met Trent Lott, and then you tell me who you want
representing your country.
</P>
<P>
   I met Trent Lott at the 1996 Republican Convention in San Diego,
when he rode in on a Harley with a not-so-wild bunch of Republican
bikers.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with riding a Harley. However, sin of all
Harley sins, Lott was a wannabe biker. I wouldn't compare it to
kleptomania, but Lott was breaking the law. He wasn't wearing a
helmet _ not even his usual helmet hair.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a leather hat with a fake ponytail hanging out the back.
It wasn't quite as goofy as his so-called real hair, but you hate
to see this kind of transfollicular behavior from a senator.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I see Lott on television, I think of him cross-dressing
as a biker, and wonder if Trent mouth is a treatable disorder.
</P>
<P>
   His black-leather act was kind of funny. He may be the worst
kind of gay-hater, one who really doesn't hate gays, but pretends
to hate gays, and for what he thinks is his political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I met Jim Hormel was 13 years ago. San Francisco
was in early stages of the desperate struggle against AIDS, a fight
which Hormel hasn't quit.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ``agenda'' at that lunch, to use a favorite word of
politicians who have an agenda against gays. It was just a way to
introduce some San Franciscans who were trying to save lives to the
new columnist in town. It was like an ambassadorial function.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, Hormel introduced
me to everyone he knew. Again there was only an ambassadorial
agenda _ to connect a newspaperman from his town to important
members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   In all the years I've known Hormel, he has been unfailingly
kind, discreet, honest and generous. He has contributed money to
causes of all kinds, not just to gay causes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what this ``gay agenda'' is that Republicans say he
will push in Europe, a continent that even Lott's fellow
Mississippians know already has plenty of gays.
</P>
<P>
   Look, when I met Lott, he was wearing black leather. I've never
seen Hormel in anything but a conservative suit.
</P>
<P>
   What's the Republican agenda? The purpose of all this can't be
just to keep one wealthy Democratic contributor from serving as
ambassador to a small country that was overrun by the Nazis and
knows what intolerance tastes like.
</P>
<P>
   Luxembourg, like San Francisco, has outlawed discrimination
against gays. Luxembourg's ambassador to the United States said his
country would welcome Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, Armey and Nickles are simply using Hormel for
fire-and-brimstone target practice. The Republicans don't have a
program besides getting Bill Clinton, and the only thing they can
get him on is the sin issue.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder how a party can win elections by promising a
gay pushed back in every closet, a Clinton in every clink and an
abortion in every back alley, but that's what conservative
Republicans are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   If all those without sin cast their votes for the party of Lott,
Armey and Nickles, the party will sink like a stone.
</P>
<P>
   And Jim Hormel goes on quietly and diplomatically doing his
philanthropic work, while the Republicans self-destruct.

ON A CRUISE TO MEXICO, ELATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE COOPER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE ELATION _ One of Carnival's Fun Ships is called the
Celebration. While this one is the Elation, most people aboard the
855-foot ocean liner are celebrating one thing or another.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Kellys _ Pat and Peggy from Beeville, Texas. For their
37th wedding anniversary, Peggy wanted a cruise, and the Elation,
Carnival's newest ship, offered a way to see the Mexican Riviera at
a leisurely pace. Its seven-day itinerary to Mexico from Los
Angeles calls at Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   Pat was a happy cruiser, celebrating a $250 Slots Tournament
complete with a ``solid gold'' plastic trophy and an Elation watch.
</P>
<P>
   The Kellys might have gone to Las Vegas, but ``I'd much rather
do a cruise,'' Peggy said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines are hoping others think the same. Indeed, the
``Most Popular Cruise Line in the World'' has its big, splashy
theme hotels, gambling, sunshine, pools, buffets and shows. The
Elation has all that _ and you're floating.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Jon Jaso, honeymooners from Orange County, Calif., had
never cruised before. They represented the first-timer market that
Carnival actively pursues. Maybe that's why this particular cruise
was 108.5 percent filled _ that's more than two people to a cabin,
according to Carnival spokesman Tim Gallagher.
</P>
<P>
   That translates into 2,215 people on board during a late April
floating party to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomething Jasos _ she's a nursing student and he's an
electrician _ asked me to take their picture when we met on deck
the second day of the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   That's another nice thing about cruising; you meet many people
from different walks of life. Midway through the week you find
yourself nodding and smiling to everyone, joining new friends for
lunch or a stroll around the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jasos, with a dark tan and white-blond hair, was the
picture of the happy honeymooner. The couple shared an iced bucket
of Coronas and enjoyed the band playing Calypso music on deck near
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Around the pool on the Lido deck, with its distinctive water
slide, the smell of coconut-based suntan lotion permeated the air.
So did cigar smoke from the playful group of adults at poolside.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 one afternoon a line formed for the slide _ all adults _
and when the band struck up a particularly playful tune, the line
began to dance and sing.
</P>
<P>
   Cocktail servers, wearing bright pink shirts and blue shorts,
were kept busy hawking special drinks with names such as Caribbean
Breeze ($5.75, and you keep the plastic glass), Goombay Smash and
Riviera Delight.
</P>
<P>
   There are three pools on the Elation. The Promenade deck pool is
quieter; this is where the serious sunbathers/readers gather. On
the Verandah deck, there is a wading pool for little kids near a
piece of playground equipment.
</P>
<P>
   More families are choosing to cruise year round with children.
The Camp Carnival program is a big draw with cruising families. The
programs, which operate from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. (with some
after-hours specials), is for children 2 to 17. Carnival's Fantasy
Class ships, of which Elation is the newest, are the first to have
space designed with children in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 130 children on board my cruise, while an
Easter cruise carried 400 youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   June and Ron Piltz, of Anchorage, Alaska, dropped off 4-year-old
Josh in Camp Carnival. While the Piltzes stood hesitantly watching
the children and the caregivers, little dark-eyed Josh went right
into the playhouse and then moved to the computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation is a Fantasy-class ship, seventh in a fleet of eight
70,000-ton vessels. Paradise, the final ship in the series, which
will be the industry's first non-smoking ship, will set sail this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only ship based in Los Angeles to do a seven-day
Mexican Riviera cruise, said Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la
Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation also is the first Carnival ship to feature the
Azipod propulsion system, which pulls the ship through the water
rather than pushing it like a conventional system. Azipods
eliminate the need for rudders, long shaft lines, conventional
drive units and stern thrusters. They also make the ship easier to
steer and maneuver. Noise and vibration are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The ship is dazzling with its fiber-optic stars and soaring
atriums. There are a lot of neon and high-contrast colors. In the
bright red, white and black Jekyll and Hyde disco, the eyes glow
and the heads of the 8-foot sculptures swivel. In Duke's Bar (named
for Duke Ellington), there's a giant Statue of Liberty head as
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything on the Elation was cause for elation. One of the
glass-enclosed elevators did not work and there was only one iron
(but two ironing boards) in the laundry room on the Upper Deck.
</P>
<P>
   Kavita Panjabi, whom I met at the Coketail Party, had damaged
luggage and clothing items missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guest expectations may be a little bit higher,'' said
Elation's hotel director, Keith Bunton.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel director is a relatively new position, less than 10
years in the cruise industry. It replaces the job of head purser
(think Gopher on ``Love Boat'').
</P>
<P>
   Bunton, a native of New Mexico, has had experience in resorts in
Guam and Reno, Nev. The Elation is his first brand-new ship in five
years with Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the `wow factor' that I get very enthusiastic about,
especially from couples who never thought they could afford a
cruise,'' Bunton said.
</P>
<P>
   In yearly gatherings of other Carnival hotel managers, Bunton
said he learned ``there's never a problem _ only challenges.''

IMPOTENCE PILL CAN CAUSE PLENTY OF VIAGRAVATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Viagra is helping men overcome impotence. So why
do some of them still feel deflated?
</P>
<P>
   ``A pill is not going to solve a relationship problem,'' said
Dr. Stanley Bloom, a urologist and director of the Men's Sexual
Health Center in Livingston, N.J. ``Lack of sexual activity in a
relationship can be due to other issues besides lack of an
erection.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two months since Viagra made its way into thousands of
bedrooms across the country, doctors and psychologists say they are
starting to see some unexpected side effects from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Like complaints about wives who don't want sex or want too much.
Men who are using the drug not with wives but with girlfriends.
Women who are sneaking the pill for themselves and demanding equal
attention to their problems. Couples who believe life was a lot
simpler when they could just turn out the light and roll over.
</P>
<P>
   The honeymoon is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good erections don't fix bad relationships, unfortunately,''
said Dr. James Barada, a urologist and the director of the Center
for Male Sexual Health in Albany, N.Y. ``In some cases, it just
makes things worse. You've added a negative stimulus to a
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Barada acknowledges he's written
prescriptions for men who ``don't want their partners to know
they're taking the pill.''
</P>
<P>
   With two other impotence pills awaiting approval by the Food and
Drug Administration, Barada expects to hear more about the impact
on relationships of these and other treatments for sexual
dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brave new world,'' he said. ``This represents a new
phenomenon. Viagra in one fell swoop has removed the stigma in
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   And people are talking. On late-night television, in locker
rooms, around water coolers and even to attorneys. Consider the $2
million lawsuit filed in New Jersey last month by Roberta Burke.
She blames Viagra for prompting her partner to leave her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He now thinks he is a young man in the body of a 70-year-old
man,'' Burke's attorney told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sex in the '90s has just gotten more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us are concerned,'' said Howard Ruppel, the executive
director of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors
and Therapists in Iowa. ``There will be people who are unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the disappointment is wrapped in hyped-up expectations
around the drug. For months, men and women waited for the FDA to
approve the drug, manufactured by Pfizer Inc. As the company's
stock went up, so did the hopes of couples affected by erectile
dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does take a toll on relationships,'' said Mark Hillman, a
psychotherapist in Clifton Park, N.Y. ``It creates anger, hostility
and, in some cases, doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapists and doctors credit Viagra for helping couples realize
they aren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Two men in five have problems getting an erection at age 40.
Nearly seven in 10 at age 70. Estimates place the number of
American men suffering from erection problems at between 20 million
and 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Viagra has proved to be one of the most popular drugs
ever, with doctors writing 570,000 prescriptions during its first
month on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The pill isn't 100 percent effective and it's no substitute for
desire, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials show the drug improved erections in about 72
percent of men. But those improved erections don't necessarily
correlate with a return to satisfactory intercourse, either from a
physical or psychological point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Haffner, the director of Sexuality Information and
Education Council of the United States in New York City, has heard
both positive and negative stories about the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard of one couple who has gotten engaged and another
couple where undue pressure has been put on a woman who isn't
interested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes too much emphasis has been put on finding a medical
solution to sexual problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If every man who has gotten a prescription in the last month
had sat down and talked with his partner ... sex would be a lot
better now than before the prescription,'' she said. ``What we
really need to do is talk to our partners.''
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, therapists believe Viagra has the potential to
exacerbate problems in a relationship, especially as they relate to
desire, the frequency of sex and ideas about intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   What they're talking about is libido or a lack of it, an issue
that's preoccupied humankind for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the quest for the perfect aphrodisiac, which has driven
people to try everything from Spanish fly to rhinoceros horn in
hopes of boosting desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viagra doesn't help with that,'' said Robert Athanasiou, the
medical director at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in upstate New
York and a certified sex therapist. ``It doesn't increase desire.
It implements desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Among married couples, desire discrepancy is often one of the
thorniest problems to sort out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard for someone with normal desire to understand
how someone else might not be interested in sex,'' he said. ``That
kind of thing, we don't have a drug for.''
</P>
<P>
   At least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are hopeful that Viagra will help solve some of the
mysteries surrounding sex and open up the conversation,
particularly in response to some women's concerns about their
problems, from vaginal dryness to difficulty reaching orgasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of activity in the next several
years on female sexual dysfunction,'' Bloom said. ``The scientific
community is going to take a hard look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinical trials are already under way on how Viagra affects
menopausal women.``The mechanism of Viagra is increased
bloodflow,'' Bloom said. ``In principle, it should work in the
female sexual organ. I think there's a lot of promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Urologists across the country are hearing stories about women
experimenting with the drug, and in some cases, getting their
doctors to write prescriptions for it. But Bloom cautions against
the off-label use of the drug by women of child-bearing age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what the effect may be on the fetus,'' he said.
Viagra's impact on sex and relationships is also uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruppel, of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors
and Therapists, believes couples need to be open and honest about
what they want out of their sexual relationship from ``a peck on
the cheek to ... pull the phone out of the wall, lock the door and
don't bother me until Monday sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of emotional intimacy can't be bought at a
drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, the pills won't do it completely,''
Ruppel said.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and

   Tired of battling doctors, billing clerks, HMOs? May be it's
time to organize, or ``unionize,'' the only unorganized part of
medicine _ the patients! _ writes Robert Lipsyte, author of ``In
the Country of Illness: Comfort and Advice for the Journey.'' ``Our
imperfect union of imperfect people will include the measured
brand-testing of the Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation
of the teamsters' union under Jimmy Hoffa,'' he writes in this

   Are men worth it? More precisely, is the maxim true about
marriage being good for a man's health but hazardous for a woman's
_ or is it a sly old spinster's tale? Do we live better with men or
without them, and which life will be longer, and which will simply
seem longer? Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To
Dance With the Devil: The New War on Breast Cancer,'' reports.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   VILNIUS, Lithuania _ It is a grim, frightfully intimate job
performed by Juozas Aleksiejunas. He gives guided tours of his
former hell.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-year-old Aleksiejunas escorts visitors around Lithuania's
appallingly well-preserved KGB prison, a lingering monument to the
bleak, brutal days of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt ill when I came back here,'' he said of his first
glimpse of the prison in 1992, almost 50 years after his
incarceration. ``People who left this building after interrogation
here just wanted to see it torn down. But if you tore it down the
evidence would be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithuania, the first of the three small Baltic states which
broke away from the Soviet Union in 1990, looks back with this
unique museum to the KGB, the feared security apparatus which kept
dissidents in check and punished any notion of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of its capital, the Lithuanian government has
preserved the brownstone building in all its horrific detail _ from
the suffocating isolation chambers to the barren interrogation
rooms. Now, the prison goes by the name of the Genocide and
Resistance Center.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is the wholly preserved padded cell where torture
took place, a room well insulated to mask the inmates' agonizing
screams from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   In another is the ``wet'' cell, where prisoners were stripped
naked and forced to squat for hour after hour on a small metal
platform while frigid water flooded the concrete cell floor beneath
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who were brought here, their cases were already
decided,'' said Aleksiejunas, who began working at the museum as a
volunteer and now receives a small salary to augment his pension.
</P>
<P>
   He was a nationalist partisan fighter in the 1940s who spent
four months in the prison in central Vilnius before being exiled to
Siberia, one of an estimated 350,000 Lithuanians who were
imprisoned and banished by the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   He points to the spot in a gloomy concrete cell where he was
forced to squat for hours under questioning while being beaten.
</P>
<P>
   And then, to emphasize his point, he invites his visitor to
assume the position for only 45 uncomfortable seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lithuanians are eager to assert their nationality and
their liberty from the Soviet past. They want alliances with the
European Union and with NATO that will remind them and the world
that they are no longer shackled to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that message stronger than in the dank, dark recesses
of this museum, which preserves the thick stone walls, bare light
bulbs and heavy steel doors of its infamous place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Grainy black-and-white photos display the fighters who did not
survive their stay. Between 1944 and 1947, an estimated 700 people
were executed at the prison, most of them shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Such ruthlessness by the KGB diminished the armed resistance but
did not stifle the underground antagonism towards the Soviets. Over
the decades of Soviet rule, a steady stream of patriotic writing
was circulated, some of it on display at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955 an anonymous writer penned: ``They keep our hearts
pinched as with red-hot pliers and they wash their hands in the
blood of our brothers and sisters. Perhaps this independence day
will free our young hearts when the tricolor (flag) waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas was a member of Brothers of the Forest, a
resistance group which first fought the Soviets, whose Red Army
occupied Lithuania in 1940, then the Nazis who followed a year
later, and then the Soviets again, who drove the Germans out at the
end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested in 1945, charged under the notorious Soviet
Article 58 -- betrayal of the socialist state. Three years later,
his parents also paid for his resistance activities. They were
deported to Siberia and their family farm in Lithuania was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy to be convicted under Article 58. If you were
chatting with three friends and you were talking about cars,
perhaps you might have said that American cars are better than the
Russian ones. If one of your friends was an informant, you ended up
in jail for treason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksiejunas spent 18 years in various prisons and labor camps,
including Vorkuta, nearly 1,200 miles northeast of Moscow, a link
in the infamous Soviet gulag.
</P>
<P>
   But the jail in Vilnius was among the worst of it, he recalls,
because here he lost many of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep the memories, to tell people about the
past,'' he said. ``Because without the past there is no future.''

   ``The decisions were being made by politicians who were seeking
reelection and those same politicians had a very limited amount of
information to work with and they chose to err on the side of
safety,'' said Susan Bloss, director of the Love Canal Area
Revitalization Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the congressional response to Love Canal, the
1981 Superfund law, was so far-reaching in its effort to ``make
polluters pay'' that many cleanups quickly devolved into fights
over who was liable. By 1996, a congressional study showed that
one-third of the $28 billion spent on Superfund went to lawyers and
others not directly involved in cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the list of Superfund sites ballooned while
cleanups went forward at a sometimes-glacial pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, the strictness of Superfund _ Love Canal
cost Hooker's corporate descendant, Occidental Petroleum, more than
$233 million _ moved industry to curb pollution. From 1988 to 1996
alone, chemical discharges have dropped 46 percent, according to
EPA's Toxic Release Inventory.
</P>
<P>
   However, fear of getting drawn into a hazardous waste dispute
scared developers away from land that even potentially contained
hazardous waste. The environmental insurance industry estimates
there are up to 500,000 of these unused industrial sites
nationally, so-called ``brownfields,'' only a fraction of which are
heavily contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superfund is a poorly designed law,'' said Boston College
professor Landy, calling the stigma on industrial property ``the
single worst thing. You have to think about a particular community
and what is blighting the neighborhood. What are we going to do to
bring it back into productive use?''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA answered critics in 1995 with an overhaul of Superfund
that threw thousands of lightly contaminated sites out of the
program and made redevelopment of industrial property a top
priority. Since then, the pace of cleanup has quickened: of the
1,353 sites on the Superfund list, cleanup construction is complete
at 520, though only 162 have been cleaned up enough to be crossed
off the list altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The program now has some striking successes, such as the former
Industri-plex tannery site in Woburn, Mass., which will soon host a
Target department store and a transportation center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, EPA officials built up greater trust with the
neighbors of hazardous waste sites, by shelving plans to burn toxic
chemicals in New Bedford because of citizen opposition, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure we talk to the people who live near the site
because they're the people who know things we couldn't know,'' said
Paula Fitzsimmons, director of policy in New England's EPA office
of site remediation and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   But Love Canal, the preeminent Superfund site redevelopment,
remains controversial. Former residents, who sold their homes to
the EPA when they moved out, have been fighting EPA since 1988 when
the agency determined that the northern section was safe for people
to move back. EPA said the chemicals were contained and so
thoroughly ringed with monitoring wells that they would quickly
know if something leaked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sickening. They don't know what's in there,'' said former
resident Luella Kenny, whose 7-year-old son died of a kidney
disease called nephrosis that she believes was caused by chemical
exposure at Love Canal. ``The thing that really bothers me is the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Love Canal has become such a hot real estate market that
one developer is building new houses within view of the dump site.
And the Love Canal revitalization agency no longer offers a
discount on the houses it sells in Love Canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice quiet neighborhood,'' said Floyd Garrow, a
72-year-old retiree whose well-tended back yard ends at the fence
around the chemical dump. ``That doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The rush to Love Canal matches the waning concern Americans have
for hazardous waste. Once a top environmental concern, hazardous
waste had fallen to eighth place among environmental issues in a
1997 Roper survey. ``It is so hard to raise money these days for
this issue,'' said Gibbs, whose Virginia-based group is seeking
affluent backers. ``Even direct mail falls flat on its face.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Gibbs is working in a changed world from the late 1970s
when Love Canal was fresh in the public mind.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial pollution generally doesn't seem to be the health
menace people once feared as studies increasingly show that
environmental factors may affect 15 percent of cancers or less. Out
of more than 200 recent studies of perceived disease clusters in
Massachusetts, state epidemiologists have found an environmental
link in only about 15 or 20, according to the state Bureau of
Environmental Health Assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Condon, the bureau's director, said there may be more
environmentally-induced disease than researchers have found so far,
but the public is also learning that pollution is just one cancer
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Still, broad statistics don't mean much for places where
hazardous waste has taken a heavy toll, such as Woburn, where
children died as a result of exposure to contaminated well water.
Likewise, EPA has had to evacuate 16 neighborhoods near Superfund
sites so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try telling someone next to a Superfund site that they should
be more concerned about air pollution,'' said EPA spokeswoman
Lauren Michael. Lois Gibbs would never do that.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

 By LESLIE EATON 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.

<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

 By KATHLEEN McAULIFFE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

 By KATHLEEN McAULIFFE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.

grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

HARVARD'S COLLEGE OF CARNAL KNOWLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE STUDENT BODY 
By Jane Harvard 
Villard, 354 pp., $23 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the premises of ``The Student Body,'' a beach-blanket
thriller co-authored by four members of Harvard's class of 1986, is
that some grown men _ and some grown women, too _ will pay large
amounts of money to have carnal knowledge of real live Harvard
students.
</P>
<P>
   A prostitution ring run out of Harvard? Pass the smelling salts.
``Harvard is a big fantasy. We sell it to people who never came
here, and to the ones who didn't get lucky while they were here,
but now can afford the best,'' explains the evil Desiree, the
ring's co-mastermind and _ what else? _ a Harvard Business School
student.
</P>
<P>
   Are there, in real life, people who daydream about sex for hire
with somebody who has a pair of perfect SATs? There are weirder
fantasies, certainly. But this has to be fiction. Everybody knows
student prostitution would never get off the ground at Harvard Yard
the way it did at Brown in the mid-1980s, when two students were
busted for peddling Ivy League thrills. That case inspired the plot
of ``The Student Body.''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Isaacs, hard-hitting reporter for the Harvard Crimson and a
knockout to boot (``large, slightly tilted eyes, smooth, velvety
cocoa skin, ... full breasts,''), hears rumors of a student-run
prostitution operation and sets out to investigate by applying for
a position at Class Ring, an escort service so academically upscale
it uses condoms packaged in crimson and emblazoned with the Harvard
seal. Unfortunately, Toni is arrested on her very first
investigative ``date.'' Fortunately, the bust occurs before she's
asked to do anything explicitly sexual _ not that she would have,
even for the sake of a great story. Her subsequent humiliation
before the Cambridge police, the university administration, and her
bewildered parents only fuels Toni's zeal to expose Desiree's
nefarious scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Toni is pretty certain that it was a suspicious Desiree, whose
real name Toni soon discovers is Dora Givens, provided the tip that
led to her arrest. Her journalistic instincts tell her there's
something much bigger than prostitution afoot. She's right. The
plot includes murder, kidnapping, blackmail, and grand-scale
financial fraud, among other skulduggery. It also includes sex _
lots of sex, of all sorts: straight, homosexual, bisexual, and
voyeuristic, among other variations. Sex in stairwells. Sex in
hotel rooms. Video sex. Film sex. A full-scale orgy in the Adams
House swimming pool. You might think Harvard invented sex, the way
these characters carry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Student Body'' is being promoted as a ``multicultural
thriller.'' Toni's background is African-American and West Indian.
Her roommate Consuelo Santana, called Chelo, is a Latina, a
pre-med, and the only character who ever seems to find time to
study. The cast includes, among others, Nguyen Van Thieu, a
handsome Vietnamese-American; Didi Caron, a wealthy Cuban-American;
Sterling Kwok, a scheming Harvard dean originally from Hong Kong.
And there are a few WASPs, among them Cabot Winthrop, a social
activist to whom Toni is drawn against her better judgment, and the
mysterious Dayton Moore, a professor who teaches ``Sexuality and
Social Institutions'' and writes book with titles such as ``Shame,
Shame, Shame,'' and ``On Doing the Nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard is really the main character in ``The Student Body,''
but it's not Harvard as it's often portrayed, a place where
privileged white folks follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.
This Harvard is multicultured and multicolored, a place where
political correctness does daily battle with academic integrity. At
this Harvard, scholarship students and the sons and daughters of
the rich share a common struggle with the enormous weight of
unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   At one point a university administrator begs Toni to forget
about exposing everything she's uncovered in her investigation and
protect the reputation of the university, ``the dream of Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the center of the universe,'' she tells him. ``It's
just a pretty good place to go to college.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to assume that the Harvard of ``The Student Body''
reflects the college experiences of the authors, a multicultural
foursome, two men and two women, who write under the pen name of
Jane Harvard. The book was six years in the making, according to a
press release. The results don't read like a collaborative effort,
which is very much to their credit. ``The Student Body'' isn't
great literature, but it's a briskly paced thriller with an unusual
set of characters, an irreverent view of Harvard and, as noted,
loads of sex. It has ``movie'' written all over it.

QUEENSLAND'S EMU CALLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVINGTON STATION, Queensland, Australia _ Des Fallon is lying on
his back in some bushes, wiggling his upraised legs and grunting.
Sounds as though he's in either pain or love.
</P>
<P>
   Why is a grown man acting like this on a remote, sere outback
plain? Because he's the world champion emu caller, that's why. At
least Des, blocky and spry proprietor of Avington Station (what
we'd call a cattle ranch), says he is. Since I'm not acquainted
with that calling, I'll take his word _ and performance _ for it.
</P>
<P>
   A couple hundred yards away a half-dozen emus glance in our
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're curious. Get your camera ready,'' Des instructs my
friend Aurelio. Here's a man who can talk, grunt, and shake legs at
the same time. Brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Emus can shake a leg, too. Run like hell. But these tall, wild,
and wondrous birds _ cousins of the ostrich and the cassowary, but
found only in Australia _ can't get off the ground. Flightless.
Long-necked and long-legged _ the Big Birds of the bush, but a long
way from Sesame Street _ they look, at a distance, like walnuts on
toothpicks, topped by strands of uncooked spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   But they are coming closer, muddy-looking six-footers, their big
eyes popping, apparently magnetized by Des's carryings-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photo op _ now!'' he commands, knowing his quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Clickety-click. Aurelio is snapping, just in time. Seeing that
the object of their inspection is only Des, the emus wheel and
retreat fast. Gone in a swirl of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Though impressed, Aurelio wonders, ``Des, are these the house
emus _ just part of the act?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not, love. Just because they live on my property
doesn't mean they're tame or recruited from the zoological branch
of Central Casting. They have minds of their own. Not much, as
minds go. But they do find me irresistible, as you've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims no such mastery over kangaroos. But there are so many
of them romping and pogoing on his acreage that even the rankest
camera-pointer is going to get the picture. Why, if even a fraction
of the population gave up their tails for conversion to
ever-popular kangaroo tail soup, these dry plains would be tastily
flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Jovial Des and Norma Fallon have been a hard-laboring
cattle-raising couple for almost half a century. However, now
they're ``taking it easy'' at Avington, a relatively small spread
way out here in the Queensland sticks _ 9,500 acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in what you Yanks call the hospitality business,'' says
Norma, an energetic grandmother, irrepressible despite being
crushed nearly to death in a terrible accident a few years ago. She
was run over by a runaway tractor. ``Curtailed my tennis for a bit,
love,'' she says, smiling, while making breakfast pancakes and eggs
for three paying guests in her kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Norma, good enough as a junior to play mixed doubles tournaments
with future Hall of Famers Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall, remains a
tough partner when guests get the urge to use the Fallons' lighted
court next to the tidy tin-roofed, frame homestead. It's a typical
rouge-toned country court _ ant bed _ like those on which
Queensland farm boy wonders Rod Laver, Mal Anderson, and Roy
Emerson grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Laver recalled in his autobiography, ``The Education of a Tennis
Player'': ``You just knock over some of those ant hills, or termite
mounds, with a tractor, spread it and roll. Makes a nice gritty red
court, sort of like clay.'' Those insect-built protruberances,
about the size of traffic cones, are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although Avington is down-home, bed-and-breakfast atmosphere, it
sports a landing strip that can accommodate small jets, and a rough
but serviceable nine-hole golf course. There are horses for riding,
squirmy sheep for shearing (by the adventurous), the caffe
latte-shaded Barcoo River for a refreshing skinnydip. Or shady
porches on the widespread 130-year-old house for napping and doing
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' says Des, ``you don't have to help with the cattle
unless you want to. They don't belong to us anyway. Norma and I are
beyond that now. We rent the ranges to other owners. We're just a
place with plenty to do and plenty not to do. We can handle 16
guests in the homestead, 30 in the outbuildings, and have room for
unlimited camping. The only thing you don't want to miss are the
meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Driving in from Barcaldine the day before, after alighting from
the Spirit of the Outback, the overnight train from Brisbane, we
were ambushed by hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ``No worries,'' said Helen Heath, steadily at the wheel of the
Land Rover for the rutted 60-mile thump-bumping overland push
across the bush as kangaroos, emus, and bustards streaked through
the twilight of a ranch called Home Creek Station. ``Des will have
the barbie going when we get there.''
</P>
<P>
   An East African feeling pervaded as the sun, crashing on a
grassy expanse, seemed to set fire to a forest of
acacia-resembling, low and delicately-branched boree. A blazing sky
that went on forever was smudged with dark clouds that prompted
Aurelio to remark, ``Charcoal. I hope he's got that grill flaming
with plenty of charcoal.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Des, was chef-ing over home-grown steaks, sausages, and
lamb chops in an arbor adjoining the house. Norma had salad, beer,
and wine on the table, with apple crumble and ice cream to follow.
Post-dessert liquid, a cloudburst, leaked through the canvas roof.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody cared because by that time Des, the venerable ringer
(cowboy), was up and cracking his stockman's whip as he recited in
lusty, twangy baritone, and from memory, ``The Man From Snowy
River,'' a poetic saga by the bygone bard of the Outback, ``Banjo''
Patterson:
</P>
<P>
   ``When they reached the mountain's summit, even Clancy took a
pull _ /It well might make the boldest hold their breath, /The wild
hop scrub grew thickly, and the hidden ground was full /Of wombat
holes, and any slip was death. /But the man from Snowy River let
the pony have his head, /And he swung his stockwhip round and gave
a cheer, /And he raced him down the mountain like a torrent down
its bed, /While the others stood and watched in very fear''
</P>
<P>
   Pausing for malten oiling of the larynx, he then charged into
the next stanza, and to the end _ ``The Man from Snowy River is a
household word today, /And the stockmen tell the story of his
ride'' _ as though Des was aboard that cow pony himself.
</P>
<P>
   Avington, a single-story structure of several additions over the
years, purchased and restored ``from dumpy condition'' by the
Fallons nine years ago, has eight neat bedrooms. Frogs in our
bathroom are friendly and unobtrusive. Wick, the resident black
cat, is a frequent visitor. A lulling cross-room breeze shuffles
through our door that is open to a porch, and out a window. Stars
chaperoning the Southern Cross splatter across the sky like an
explosion in a marshmallow factory.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep comes swiftly, and dreams of emus like stilt-legged sugar
plums go dancing in our heads.

NOTRE DAME'S GARRITY PREPPED FOR THE PROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WALTHAM, Mass. _ Anyone who played against Notre Dame's
basketball team last season is aware of sophomore guard Keith
Friel. The son of former University of New Hampshire coach Gerry
Friel was the second leading scorer for the Irish last season with
an average of 10.8 points. That meant he gave opponents some cause
for concern when they debated whether to put all their efforts into
stopping Notre Dame's scoring sensation Pat Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   Most teams, however, opted for zeroing in on Garrity, with good
reason. The senior accounted for 33 percent of ND's offense and was
the fifth leading scorer in Division 1, averaging 23.3 points. He
also watched many of his better efforts go to waste: The Irish
finished 13-14 last year, and Garrity finished his final season as
he did the previous three _ devoid of an NCAA tournament
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his efforts caught the attention of many coaches whose
efforts to stop him were in vain, including Celtics coach Rick
Pitino. Garrity scored a game-high 25 points on 8-for-15 shooting
(including 9 for 11 from 3-point range) in an 80-56 loss to
Pitino's Wildcats Dec. 14, 1996, in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't surprising to see the 6-foot-9-inch, 231-pound forward
among those the Celtics worked out Friday at Brandeis University.
They were among 10 teams who brought Garrity in for a workout, and
many analysts expect him to be selected in the top half of the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   After that Kentucky-Notre Dame game, Pitino said, ``He can play
at the next level. He moves well without the ball and he gets
everyone's attention. It's hard to score when you are the focal
point of all the defenses. But, he still puts up the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Garrity's junior season, when he began emerging as one
of the more fundamentally sound, deft scorers in the nation. He
finished the season averaging 20.1 points and was Big East player
of the year. But the team garnered only a berth in the National
Invitation Tournament, his only postseason appearance.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you have to hand it to Garrity for starting in all of
the 111 games he played at Notre Dame _ a school record. ``He knows
what it's like to be called upon and be productive night after
night because he was about all they had to go to,'' said Celtics
general manager Chris Wallace. He added that Garrity has benefitted
from the tutelage of Notre Dame coach John MacLeod, former coach of
the Dallas Mavericks and Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a finished product. He's fundamentally sound,'' said
Wallace. ``He's probably a stronger, more forceful version of Don
MacLean in that he can shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity said MacLeod helped prepare him for the next level,
running offensive plays that MacLeod ran in Dallas and Phoenix. He
taught Garrity the importance of footwork and being able to read
and react to screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are two things we did here that were beneficial
to him,'' said MacLeod. ``First of all, we run 99 percent
man-to-man defense, which is what they do in the pros. Secondly, we
emphasize the running attack, and getting the big men out on the
break and filling the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He reminds me of Dave DeBusschere in that he can shoot it well
from the outside, he can play the power forward spot, and he
rebounds well. And he's not afraid to shoot the ball, which is a
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrity finished with 2,085 career points, third highest in
school history behind Austin Carr and Adrian Dantley, and he is the
leading scorer in Big East history among players who have played
three seasons or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Garrity is one of the toughest players that we've ever
faced because he moves so well without the basketball,'' said Miami
coach Leonard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   But even his toughness couldn't get the Irish into the NCAA
tournament: The team hasn't made it to the Big Dance since the
1989-90 season.
</P>
<P>
   Garrity was born in Las Vegas but took up basketball while his
father, a former football player at Air Force, was stationed at
Shaw Air Force Base in Sumter, S.C. Garrity took up the sport in
his sophomore year because the high school didn't have football. He
honed his skills playing pickup games against enlisted men. His
family moved to Monument, Colo., and he averaged 27 points and 12
boards in leading Monument to a state title. But he was virtually
overlooked by many college recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because I was so skinny,'' said Garrity. ``I was 6-9,
and I weighed 190 pounds. Once I started lifting between my senior
year in high school and my freshman year, I made up that gap and
was able to compete at the major college level.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Garrity began participating in summer
basketball tournaments that he began considering the NBA. He was
the leading scorer on the United States Under-22 team that finished
fifth in the World Champioships, averaging 11.8 points. ``After my
junior year (the NBA) became a goal of mine,'' said Garrity. He
graduated from Notre Dame with a pre-med major of professional
studies with an emphasis on biology and chemistry. He finished with
a 3.68 grade-point average and was an Academic All-American his
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Garrity makes no bones about where his career goals are
focused. Asked if he wants to be a doctor some day, he said, ``Not
really. I came in as a science major; that's what kept my attention
in college. But this (playing in the NBA) is what I want to be
doing.''

   ASIA-TRAVEL _ WASHINGTON _ Once an out-of-reach destination for
frugal travelers, east Asia is now more accessible than ever.
Tumbling currencies due to Asia's economic woes have resulted in
deep discounts on airfares, hotel rooms and package tours. With
intra-Asian travel at a near halt, airlines and tour operators are
looking to fill up empty seats and hotel rooms with Western
travelers. Once in Asia, Americans will find their dollar stretch
with drastically-reduced merchandise. The best news for travelers:
Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. But even Japan, which has
traditionally been exorbitantly priced, is now affordable as the
yen's value descends to rock bottom. Here's just one example: 4
nights. Included is roundtrip airfare, a half-day sightseeing tour
where you'll visit the Golden Buddah in Bangkok. You'll stay at the
Royal River Hotel. Excursions can include a visit to one of
Thailand's snake farms, elephant rides or a trip to a remote hill
tribe. Besides the above, included in the price is an airport
welcome by an English speaker, hotel taxes and service charges and
bonus miles. $850. Last year, the trip would have cost you $1,200.

   ``The Eleventh Commandment.'' By Jeffrey Archer. HarperCollins.
$26. 359 pages.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Jeffrey Archer delivers a first-rate, well-crafted and
very readable international thriller.
</P>
<P>
   Connor Fitzgerald is almost too good to be true _ college
football star, Congressional Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam,
devoted father and husband, and a negotiator for an insurance
company specializing in international kidnappings and ransoms. And
for the last 25 years, Fitzgerald has been the CIA's top assassin
and followed the Eleventh Commandment: Thou shalt not get caught.
But if you are, deny absolutely that you have anything to do with
the CIA. Don't worry _ the Company will always take care of you.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly he is being forced into retirement by his boss, CIA
Director Helen Dexter, who will do anything to keep her job. The
president wants her out, so she sets up Fitzgerald, who believes
the president himself has asked him to go to Russia and take out
one of the leading presidential candidates. Fitzgerald, of course,
is caught before he can carry out the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   Archer is a master at building political intrigue and crafting
interesting and multilayered characters. His plot rings true and
moves along at a satisfying pace. And best of all, he doesn't give
away the ending.

   The authors get so involved in the techno jargon that what
should have been a truly entertaining thriller gets buried.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day, terrorists explode six nuclear bombs
beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf, causing the shelf to break up.
Instantly, a 400-mph soliton wave begins to move across the
Pacific, wiping out everything in its path _ first the HMS

can send out a disaster warning, refuel and get airborne before the
wave hits. Somehow, they must get to the man who originated the
Icefire plan, find out if the wave can be stopped, convince the
U.S. military to act and find the terrorists.

   ``The Tin Man.'' By Dale Brown. Bantam Books. $24.95. 367 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Read somewhere that ``The Tin Man'' was one of the summer's hot
books. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. This book is
a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Gen. Patrick McLanahan is the director of scientific
development for a San Diego firm specializing in creating
technologies for the military. He and his very pregnant wife fly to
Sacramento for his brother Paul's graduation from the police
academy. On his first night on the force, terrorists hit the money
room of a huge complex, kill several police officers and seriously
wound Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick decides to track down the killers. He dons a ``carbon
filament bodysuit that can instantly harden into
stronger-than-steel protective armor,'' making the wearer almost
invincible. The suit cannot be pierced by bullets, bombs, etc. But
it can be pierced by a knife. And every time Patrick puts it on, he
goes a little insane, hurting even some of his colleagues. Go
figure this logic.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the terrorists offer the biker gangs (who are drug
dealers) a deal they can't refuse. The terrorists, calling
themselves the Aryan Brigade, will supply the gangs with new
cookers and supplies for making illegal drugs. All are delivered on
the same night, all blow up and most of the gang members of
Northern California are wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   About the only character in this book that's believable is the
wounded Paul, who reacts to his plight like a normal human being.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aryan Brigade's ultimate goal is about as far-fetched as
you can get in one book. This tale just doesn't make sense.

KENNEDY'S NOOSE AROUND LOTT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The last time Senator Edward M. Kennedy did what
he is about to try to do, he drove Bob Dole batty.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling toward the Republican presidential nomination two
years ago, Dole wanted to save money and strut his stuff as Senate
majority leader one last time. In his way was Kennedy, cheerfully
and relentlessly pushing for votes on a higher minimum wage and
health insurance reform.
</P>
<P>
   So relentless was Kennedy that Dole quit the Senate early, and
the proposals became law. Two years later, under probably more
difficult circumstances, Dole's successor, Trent Lott, is about to
get the same treatment, only with three twists.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he will have to block votes on three worthy and
popular measures: the procedurally blocked tobacco legislation,
reform of literally predatory health maintenance organizations, and
a substantively unassailable followup increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Lott's lot has company in Newt Gingrich's
dysfunctional House of Representatives, where Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt is planning maneuvers to free similarly blocked
proposals for voting consideration on the floor. And for another,
the battling over these policy issues will not obscure a fourth,
also blocked initiative to change the scandalous campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   What Kennedy is planning, thanks to the Senate's tradition of
almost anything goes, is to keep offering the blocked proposals as
amendments to whatever is the official business on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   What Lott then has to do is muster either a majority to set
Kennedy's initiatives aside each time or a minority of at least 40
to block a vote on the merits. More often than not _ for sure on
tobacco and possibly on the others _ it will have to be a minority
of almost entirely very conservative Republicans. That is because
tobacco, HMOs, and the minimum wage all have one important,
political thing in common _ moderate Republicans, some of them
facing the voters this fall, who favor action.
</P>
<P>
   Having done his homework, Kennedy has already made sure his own
party is solidly aboard. This means that he is pushing proposals
for which a Senate majority already exists. In the case of tobacco,
for example, the comprehensive measure drafted by Commerce
Committee chairman John McCain of Arizona had 57 senators
officially ready to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was absurd _ a steady stream of Republican amendments
to the McCain bill, followed by their leadership's claim that it
had become too unwieldy to be voted on because it had too many
amendments attached.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of HMOs and the minimum wage, the Lott tactic for
the moment is to keep both proposals off the Senate's official
radar screen. And for that reason, it becomes the Kennedy tactic to
keep bringing them up, on the theory that it becomes harder to take
the difficult votes to block them as Election Day gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the conservatives, there is ideology behind the
opposition and not merely PAC money. They see taxes or big
government or both involved, and they see red.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair as well to Lott, there is nothing un-American about
using tactics to block votes in the Senate on measures one opposes
strongly. Liberals, Kennedy included, have done it countless times.
The political difficulty comes in when the measures one is blocking
are clearly popular and would become law if senators could vote on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is forcing his opponents to vote affirmatively to not
vote. Over time, that position can become increasingly difficult to
sustain, as Dole discovered. That is why there is talk (but so far
no action) in the GOP leadership in both houses about offering
greatly slimmed down versions of the blocked measures, targeting
but not hitting young smokers and HMOs. The political problem,
however, is that it is even harder to offer a pale palliative while
refusing to consider the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Kennedy says, pushing the palliatives is an attempt to
save politically fearful senators while doing nothing to help
people. For $1.10 per pack of cigarettes and the first real
regulation of the tobacco racket, a lot of young people won't start
smoking and a lot more will have health insurance and day-care
slots. For a simple chance for senators to vote, the insurance
monsters will have to concede patients some basic rights. And for
the same chance, wages at the bottom can rise again in the middle
of the best economy in a generation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. _ It is as though Beaver Cleaver's
all-American neighborhood moved to the Twilight Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Pastel, vinyl-sided homes surrounded by swing sets, marigolds
and satellite dishes look out on the most famous hazardous waste
dump in America. Mothers pushing baby strollers don't even look as
they pass the ``Danger'' sign on a chain-link fence that encloses
20,000 tons of buried chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the site was known as Love Canal, a
neighborhood whose evacuation launched the national crusade against
toxic waste. But today, with the dump entombed in clay and new
people buying long-empty houses, the name is being erased along
with the bad memories. The sign on the main drag welcomes visitors
to ``Black Creek Village.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that reside here just want (the controversy) to be
over with,'' said Jeff Principe of the federally funded Love Canal
Area Revitalization Agency, which changed the area's name.
</P>
<P>
   The strange rebirth of Love Canal, which critics say has not
been properly cleaned up, mirrors deep divisions over this
country's two-decade-long effort to clean up industrial waste.
Despite untold billions spent by government and industry on waste
sites since Love Canal, few are satisfied with the progress, and
many question whether the benefits have been worth costs that
include vast tracts of land abandoned for fear of cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
   Research has not shown that hazardous waste is the pervasive
threat it seemed when Love Canal residents first fled black ooze in
their basements. The National Research Council's 1991 review, the
broadest look at hazardous waste sites, found that the health harm
from these places ``appears to be small,'' but complained about the
overall lack of good research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every important study I am aware of questions not that the
(hazardous waste) problem exists, but how high a priority it is
among environmental problems,'' said Boston College political
scientist Marc Landy, who believes government and industry have
spent too much on the hazardous waste issue that could have been
spent on more pressing environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Love Canal, where the school was literally built on top
of chemical waste, major studies found an increase in birth defects
and miscarriages, but, with the exception of one heavily criticized
study, did not find other serious health problems that residents
suspected. Numerous observers believe that at least some of the
residents left their homes needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But, Lois Gibbs, the homemaker-turned-activist who led the
citizen protests at Love Canal, believes that government and
industry haven't done nearly enough to clean up Love Canal or many
other industrial sites. She argues that health studies often ask
the wrong questions, or ignore local concerns such as a cluster of
breast cancers in one part of Love Canal.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (hazardous waste sites) are like red flags that say
something is seriously wrong with this country,'' said Gibbs,
founder of the Center for Health, Environment and Justice, which
helps grass-roots environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   That Gibbs is still leading fights 20 years later reflects the
enduring impact Love Canal has had on environmental politics,
unleashing a new breed of activist personified by Gibbs, a woman
once so shy of public speaking that she skipped school to avoid
book reports.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent, skeptical of government, and willing to use
theatrics to make their point, these ``mother bears'' cut
sympathetic figures, standing up for their children against
seemingly insensitive corporations and bureaucrats. Over the years,
they forced Congress to pass new laws and industry to reduce
chemical use, and defeated unwanted projects across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Lois did was show that an average person like me can
prevail with enough tenacity and persistence,'' said Joanne Muti,
who used Gibbs-inspired tactics to win a six-year fight against a
sewage debris landfill in her town of Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts believe that, in the process, the activists
injected irrationality into the environmental debate. Even as Gibbs
rails against toxic chemicals, she smokes cigarettes (although not
around her children). And colorful demonstrations often drown out
the sober review of facts.
</P>
<P>
   The result, argues author Gregg Easterbrook, is that activists
often exaggerate pollution's effects and, therefore, the need for
action. ``Many people would rather believe distant villains are to
blame for any sickness they may contract,'' he writes in ``A Moment
on the Earth,'' which criticizes excesses of the environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   There had always been something odd about Love Canal, like the
phosphorous rocks that sparked when children dropped them and the
way kids came home covered in grease. But, for a city where the
chemical industry is king, Love Canal seemed like countryside, and
many residents didn't even know that an old canal full of waste was
buried between 99th and 97th streets.
</P>
<P>
   The Blizzard of 1978, followed by a high spring water table,
uncovered Love Canal's dirty secret, dislodging toxic chemicals
that Hooker Chemical had dumped into the buried canal. People
reported strange smells and liquids in basements, and seemingly
high rates of illness. Gibbs, mother of two young children, began
to press for answers.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 7, 1978, when President Carter signed the emergency
declaration to relocate residents, Love Canal was in a full-fledged
panic; several suicides were later attributed to fear of the
chemicals. In response, the federal government agreed to buy houses
well beyond the 239 homes closest to the canal. Ultimately, more
than 800 families would move out, even though the EPA had scant
evidence that many of them were affected.

TRUTHS LEARNED ON THE STREET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ I am sitting on a bench in Stephen's Green, listening
as one of my sons describes the look and feel of a museum exhibit
where he had just seen the uniform worn by Michael Collins the day
he was ambushed decades ago, shot to death by his own people. Irony
prevails. It is an odd feeling: Cleared of a crime you didn't
commit. It's like responding to the unanswerable accusation, ``When
did you stop beating your wife?'' Indicted. Investigated. And
declared not guilty. Yet why do I still not feel in tip-top shape?
</P>
<P>
   I sit thousands of miles from a genuine human tragedy. This was
not some industrial accident. A woman's life has been shattered.
Her career destroyed. Her dream momentarily dead. Yet that seems
not to satisfy the predators within the press corps who then
decided to take 25 years worth of my work and use it as target
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In order to balance its uncomfortable decision, the Globe chose
to put me on the rack to appear even-handed within the politically
correct, agenda-driven journalism of the age. No double standards
here!
</P>
<P>
   And who better to incite the trial than the noted ethicist,
Inspector Dershowitz, champion of the underdog, especially when
cameras are around. The self-promoting professor thinks O.J.
Simpson is innocent, Louise Woodward is a terrific baby sitter, and
that I am a bad guy. I can live with his contempt.
</P>
<P>
   For few have been allowed my privilege: To record stories of our
time, thrice a week for over a quarter of a century. To take note
of the pain, the humor, the daily drama far from bright lights and
front pages. To offer a portrait _ a snapshot if you will _ of
those moments in tenement halls, firehouses, police stations,
courtrooms, classrooms, dark corridors and sidewalks cluttered with
the chaos, humanity, the good, the evil and the inexplicable that
shape how we live and who we are. To witness that. To have people
share their grief or their delight with you is a humbling thing.
</P>
<P>
   And these people, many falling below the media's radar screen,
are real. Their tales are told without deception or the arrogant
delusion that I am always right, never mistaken, totally
infallible. Because I _ like you, the customer, the state employee,
the nurse, the bus driver, the hospital orderly, the teacher, the
detective, parish priest or rabbi, neighborhood nun or social
worker, like even the bums, content in their own integrity _ am
indeed human.
</P>
<P>
   This is no trick. It is simply one aspect of being a part of a
magnificent business at a tremendous time when people of honor like
Davis, John I. and Bill Taylor along with Tom Winship, Bob Healy,
Jack Driscoll and Ed Doherty taught me to report the truth, to be
unafraid of controversy, and to avoid writing for the approval of
colleagues or to satisfy ``uptown'' encampments.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we talk endlessly about codes of ethics. But they are
useless if they have to be drawn up by study groups of editors on
retreat because the ultimate code is character.
</P>
<P>
   As this is whirring through my head, a brilliant rainbow
suddenly appeared over Phoenix Park and at the end of it I could
actually see the vision of ``Juicy'' Johnson, dead on the ground,
in an alley between three-deckers in Dorchester, one of the first
victims of the ``crack wars'' that claimed so many a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's body, looking as if it had been shot with a sewing
machine, was on the pavement that night when a woman came to stand
on the porch. I asked if she'd heard the gunfire. When she
indicated she had, I wanted to know what she did next, and she
looked at me and said: ``I called Radio-59 for the $50 news tip,''
talking about the old WEEI in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Three policemen stood alongside: Bo Mullane, Danny Downey and
Bob Faherty. Mullane turned and said with a grin on his face: ``You
put that in the paper and they'll think you made it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, years later, it is still astounding to me how much daily
drama happens out of the headlines. And it is amazing as well as
sad that when the concerns, the problems or some of the issues that
affect the consistently normal are chronicled, their stories _ even
their lives _ are thought to be fiction by the isolated or the
affluent. I am proud of what I do, yet, believe me, no paycheck is
worth a reputation.

HOW AN HONOR ROLL SON BECAME ENSNARLED IN GANG VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Holly Charles always thought that her son, Dwayne
Johnson, had it all going for him: handsome, athletic, smart.
School officials pushed him to achieve. She sustained him.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also wore a blue bandanna, an emblem of his reputed
allegiance to the Crips gang.
</P>
<P>
   Charles found it one day, tucked among her son's underwear and
T-shirts in a bedroom dresser, below a poster of pro football star
Natrone Means.
</P>
<P>
   Charles knew what the blue bandanna meant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ma,'' he told her. ``I just wear it for style.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled out a lighter and torched the bandanna, hoping to
make an impression. But, it turned out, she couldn't stop her son
from playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years later, at 16, Dwayne Johnson is a reputed Crip
leader, languishing in a 5-by-12 cell in the Plymouth County
Correctional Facility. He's awaiting trial for allegedly trying to
murder an associate of the Bloods _ a rival gang whose members
pledge fealty to the color red.
</P>
<P>
   A son's descent is a mother's grief. Holly Charles's story _ a
mother's tale _ could be the lament of as many as 500 women who,
police sources say, may be losing their sons to the Crips and the
Bloods, Los Angeles-inspired gangs gaining a foothold in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Charles feels she did all a mother could. She said she told
Johnson she loved him every day. When tender talk didn't work, she
laid down a curfew. Then she asked the courts to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried my best. ... I didn't just sit back and let it
happen,'' Charles, 34, said in a recent interview. ``Whatever they
were telling him is more powerful than me.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials remember Johnson as clean-cut, confident,
talented, an honor roll student who was respectful to authorities
and respected by his peers.
</P>
<P>
   If he had kept out of trouble, they say, his future would have
been bright. They envisioned him as a class president and college
graduate, someday working in business or government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson's success story is a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had natural ability far above most of the average kids in
the Boston public schools,'' said Lieutenant Michael Hennessey of
the Boston School Police, who spent hours trying to set Johnson
straight. ``Now, he's a poster boy for what can happen when you get
caught up in the insidiousness of gang culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on her living room couch at the Faneuil housing project,
insulated from Crip graffiti that scars the common corridor,
Charles &UR;  &LR; buries her face in the crook of her arm. Her doe eyes
begin to fill with tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much I can take,'' she said. ``There's so
much tragedy in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles, a store clerk, quit high school when she had Dwayne,
her oldest child. Together with her mother, she raised him at the
South Street projects.
</P>
<P>
   She described him as a sweet child who walked away from fights.
He carried a football everywhere he went and told her he was going
to make it to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although he denied it, his mother knew Dwayne missed having
his father around full time. His 25-year-old uncle was shot down in
the projects, allegedly over a drug theft. Dwayne was 9. Surrounded
by bad memories, the family moved to the Old Colony development in
South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the bullets followed them. One day about a year later, an
older white boy spit at Dwayne and used a racial slur. After she
confronted the boy, Charles said, someone shot at Dwayne's
stepfather, Max Charles, as he sat in his car, and strafed their
living room with gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Again Charles sought refuge for her family, this time at the
Faneuil projects. But in the mid '90s, Boston's Allston-Brighton
section was the breeding ground for Crips and Bloods in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And by 1995, school police who tracked gangs reported that
Dwayne Johnson _ then a 13-year-old in Taft Middle School _ had
quietly emerged as the neighborhood leader of the Crips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Appearances are deceiving,'' said Irene McCarthy, principal at
the Taft. ``He was a bright child _ all the leaders of gangs are
bright people. They don't apply their thinking skills to everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles's maternal instints detected danger signs.
</P>
<P>
   She bought him a red shirt. He refused to wear it.
</P>
<P>
   She asked about his cryptic blue tattoo. He denied it was a gang
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   She asked him hard questions, but got soft answers.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled a typical exchange:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Dwayne. Do you think I don't love you? Are you all
right?'' she asked. ``Is it that you can't get out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand, Ma,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me understand so I can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't in no gang, Ma.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson had already been initiated into the gang the usual
way _ by being beaten _ when he was a fifth-grader, school police
say he told them. Gang members in a nearby city taught him the Crip
hand signals, colors, and code. He allegedly said he enjoyed being
part of a group willing to die for one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue for life,'' Johnson reputedly bragged.
</P>
<P>
   In school and at home, Johnson remained soft-spoken and polite.
He exchanged pleasantries with the older women in the neighborhood,
even carried their groceries.
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Allston-Brighton, police say, Johnson and
his fellow Crips faced down the Bloods, each side wielding bats or
bike chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was with his peers he was a totally different
individual,'' said Chris Rogers, youth service police officer in
Allston-Brighton, who had encouraged Johnson to become a
trophy-winning soccer player in the Police Activities League only
to see him turn into a bike-stealing bully. ``He had to be the
tough guy, the leader of the gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Johnson, Hennessey saw a charismatic person with great
promise. The veteran officer warned the boy of what lay ahead in
the gang life: addiction, jail, even death. If he went straight,
Hennessey promised, he'd get Johnson an after-school job at John
Hancock. Johnson said OK.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spiraled further into the gang realm. He started
skipping classes, officials say, and allegedly immersed himself in
the Book of Knowledge _ the Crips bible, which tells the secrets of
the national gang.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, sources said, he was arrested for an armed carjacking
in Waltham. A year later, he was jumped by neighborhood Bloods as
he went to school at English High, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obsessed with Crippin','' said Hennessey.
</P>
<P>
   Charles tried to win back her son. Hearing that he was under the
influence of a Crip ``recruiter'' originally from Los Angeles,
Charles tracked the man down and got in his face, warning him to
stay away from her son.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to follow all the rules for at-risk children: She made
sure someone was there when her son came home. She preached the
value of education. She punished him when he broke curfew.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At wit's end, Charles said, she petitioned juvenile court to
monitor her son's school attendance and curfew, but he fell through
those cracks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I would have been there every minute,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 4, Johnson told his mother he was going to play
basketball. He never came home. Dressed in blue, he ended up in
handcuffs, charged with a gang attack in Allston. Police say
Johnson and a group of Crips cornered a 17-year-old, bashed his
head with a hammer, and cut his face with a meat cleaver. Some
believe it was payback for Johnson's beating.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Charles pulls out a picture of Johnson as an early
adolescent, smiling and wearing red pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dwayne is a sweet kid deep down inside,'' she said, still
searching for answers, and beating herself up when none are found.
``I don't know if he's trying to prove something to the people he
hangs with. ... Maybe he needed a brother. I wish I could have done
more.''

LOOKING DAPPER FOR THE RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a sporting event so stiff and formal that male
spectators, the poor dears, need permission to take off their
jackets, no matter how hot and humid it gets. And women? They're
turned away at the door if their skirt or dress doesn't completely
cover their knees.
</P>
<P>
   It would probably prompt a lawsuit in Boston. But in England,
strict dress codes like these are ancient tradition at the annual
Henley Royal Regatta rowing race for anyone sitting in the best
seats in a private area near the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   And since Harvard University has decided to compete there next
month, many of the friends and family of the school's heavy-weight
rowing crew (whose oarsmen must weigh 185 to 220 pounds each) are
grappling with what to pack for the hoity-toity event, which runs
July 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   After all, spectators at Harvard's races typically wear jeans
and sneakers. But Henley's rules clearly state that men must wear
suits and ties or blazers with flannel pants. Women must wear
dresses or suits that cover their knees. Culottes, trousers,
shorts, and jeans just aren't an option.
</P>
<P>
   As if that's not bad enough, British women take it to the
extreme, stepping out in dresses fit for a wedding reception, high
heels, and fancy hats adorned with feathers and scarves that match
their school's colors. Even gloves and parasols are part of this
social scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to buy a lot of fancy clothes just for this,''
says Joanne Moser of Moultonborough, N.H., whose son Wolfgang will
compete.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts and high heels indeed. If it rains, the grass alongside
the Thames River will turn into mud, she says, adding ``I should
bring my New Hampshire mud boots. These rules are from an era when
people had servants who looked after them. They haven't kept pace
with the times too well.''
</P>
<P>
   British men put on the ritz as well. The typical outfit is white
flannel trousers, school blazers striped in their former school's
colors and straw boater hats with coordinated ribbons. ``I don't
think there's a shop on this side of the Atlantic that sells white
flannels,'' says Peter Ellis of Cambridge, Mass., whose son David
is on the Harvard team. ``I'm wearing a blue blazer and
summer-weight gray flannels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Yankees are going to have to submit to the
British on this one. The rules, which date to the first races in
1839, clearly state that spectators in the Stewards' Enclosure are
required to ``dress in accordance with long-established
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep on their jeans, the Americans could stand upstream away
from the finish line and wear whatever they want. But it's
considered an honor to be invited to the Stewards' Enclosure, which
only allows a few competitors' families in. There, sitting in
canvas deck chairs and grandstands, they can see the finish line,
sip champagne, and eat strawberries with whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard doesn't compete every year, either. The heavy-weight
crew hasn't been to Henley since 1993 (the light-weight crew
competed in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress for Henley has always been very smart,'' says Sarah
Moody, a Henley spokeswoman. ``We've had this tradition since
Henley began. You can compare it to going to a wedding as a guest.
It's a very important social occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Sahs of Southborough, Mass., who's been to Henley twice
and whose son Geoffrey is rowing this year, says, ``Picture being
invited to a Great Gatsby party. It's absolutely the most fun
parade. You stroll around while a big band plays in the pavilion.
Some women have parasols, and the men are just as decked out as the
women are. It's quite a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristie Ellis, 20, Peter Ellis's daughter who also lives in
Cambridge, says she's looking forward to the event and to seeing
her brother compete. A rower herself at Williams College, she says,
``This is probably the only time in my life I'll travel with a hat
box. It'll be sort of surreal standing on the shore with my
champagne glass, watching my brother sweat it out. I know how
agonizing it really is. It's sort of weird how refined (the event)
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Because royalty could very well show up, the Americans need to
be aware of the unwritten rules of the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No.1? In British culture, there's absolutely no screaming
and yelling during the races. Pleeeease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is very dignified,'' says Sahs, ``You can always tell
who the Americans are. We're much more boisterous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, wearing the same dress every day might raise a few
eyebrows. ``My daughter needs four dresses. Obviously, she can't be
seen in the same dress twice,'' Peter Ellis concedes. ``I'm not
sure if cotton is acceptable or if it has to be a silk blend.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtsying or bowing if you cross paths with royalty isn't likely
to come up. ``When (the royals) come, it's an organized visit, and
they're usually surrounded by security,'' says Moody, the Henley
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, hot as they may get in their jackets and ties, the men
must keep stiff upper lips and not take off their coats unless an
announcement is made over the loudspeaker that, indeed, it's too
hot to bear. Unfortunately for the men, that kind of announcement
is rare. Says Moody, ``The last one was in 1976.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long list of rules (some are published on the
Internet and others are passed along through friends), Sahs says
she's ready to embrace British ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Americans should go over there with an
attitude.'' she says. ``It's a very different culture, and it
sounds very contrived. But let me tell you, it's fun. I consider it
a huge treat to go.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The third annual International Festival of Arts and Ideas will
be held in New Haven June 24-28.
</P>
<P>
   The festival features a broad range of world and American arts,
and many events will be free.
</P>
<P>
   Performances will be given by the Royal National Theatre of
London; Cirque Baroque, an international circus group; Little

   America's national parks are one of the greatest assets of the
land. The parks are also some of the most popular vacation places
throughout the year. With more than 300 million visitors a year,
the national parks could easily be endangered. The National Parks
and Conservation Association says that the best visitors are those
who know the regulations and leave only footprints. To help ensure
the fullest enjoyment of the parks and to protect their fragile
ecosystems, the association has published ``National Park Discover
Guides.'' The guides cover the nation's entire park system in eight
regional manuals: Alaska, Heartland, Northeast, Pacific, Pacific
Northwest, Rocky Mountain, Southeast, and Southwest. Each guide
($8.95 plus $2.85 postage) provides information on regulations,
resources, programs, plants and animals, maps, events, and points
of interest nearby. For any guide, call 800-395-PARK.

   Looking for high adventure without losing contact with the
earth? The Great Balloon Experience at Fantasy of Flight in Polk
City, Fla., can do just that. It's the first tethered balloon ride
of its kind in North America. The adventure provides all the
excitement of a balloon flight without the uncertainty of knowing
when or how the gas-filled vehicle will descend. The 115-foot
Fantasy of Flight balloon can rise 500 feet, yet is securely
anchored at 16 points to the ground. Drivers on Interstate 4
between Orlando and Tampa can easily see the balloon from the
roadway. Similar balloon rides in Sweden and Germany have had a
perfect safety record, according to the operators. The attraction
is about 20 minutes west of Disney World. For information, call

   ``The Riches of France, a Shopping and Touring Guide to the

Clemente is not, as the title may imply, just a shopping guide to
France. The book reflects Clemente's ``crazy love affair with
France.'' She adds, ``I did not shop my way through the country,
rather, one could say, I chatted my way through, talking with
glassblowers, cheesemakers, potters, and many more wonderful
artisans and boutique owners, in order to learn about what they
loved to do most.'' The book reveals France through the rich
history of many of its products. Clemente also includes museums and
other places of interest, and favorite places to stay and dine.
Clemente adds the book will not go out of date because many of the
places she writes abut have been in business for centuries.

KENNEDY'S NOOSE AROUND LOTT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The last time Senator Edward M. Kennedy did what
he is about to try to do, he drove Bob Dole batty.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling toward the Republican presidential nomination two
years ago, Dole wanted to save money and strut his stuff as Senate
majority leader one last time. In his way was Kennedy, cheerfully
and relentlessly pushing for votes on a higher minimum wage and
health insurance reform.
</P>
<P>
   So relentless was Kennedy that Dole quit the Senate early, and
the proposals became law. Two years later, under probably more
difficult circumstances, Dole's successor, Trent Lott, is about to
get the same treatment, only with three twists.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he will have to block votes on three worthy and
popular measures: the procedurally blocked tobacco legislation,
reform of literally predatory health maintenance organizations, and
a substantively unassailable followup increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Lott's lot has company in Newt Gingrich's
dysfunctional House of Representatives, where Democratic leader
Dick Gephardt is planning maneuvers to free similarly blocked
proposals for voting consideration on the floor. And for another,
the battling over these policy issues will not obscure a fourth,
also blocked initiative to change the scandalous campaign finance
system.
</P>
<P>
   What Kennedy is planning, thanks to the Senate's tradition of
almost anything goes, is to keep offering the blocked proposals as
amendments to whatever is the official business on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   What Lott then has to do is muster either a majority to set
Kennedy's initiatives aside each time or a minority of at least 40
to block a vote on the merits. More often than not _ for sure on
tobacco and possibly on the others _ it will have to be a minority
of almost entirely very conservative Republicans. That is because
tobacco, HMOs, and the minimum wage all have one important,
political thing in common _ moderate Republicans, some of them
facing the voters this fall, who favor action.
</P>
<P>
   Having done his homework, Kennedy has already made sure his own
party is solidly aboard. This means that he is pushing proposals
for which a Senate majority already exists. In the case of tobacco,
for example, the comprehensive measure drafted by Commerce
Committee chairman John McCain of Arizona had 57 senators
officially ready to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   The result was absurd _ a steady stream of Republican amendments
to the McCain bill, followed by their leadership's claim that it
had become too unwieldy to be voted on because it had too many
amendments attached.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of HMOs and the minimum wage, the Lott tactic for
the moment is to keep both proposals off the Senate's official
radar screen. And for that reason, it becomes the Kennedy tactic to
keep bringing them up, on the theory that it becomes harder to take
the difficult votes to block them as Election Day gets closer.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the conservatives, there is ideology behind the
opposition and not merely PAC money. They see taxes or big
government or both involved, and they see red.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair as well to Lott, there is nothing un-American about
using tactics to block votes in the Senate on measures one opposes
strongly. Liberals, Kennedy included, have done it countless times.
The political difficulty comes in when the measures one is blocking
are clearly popular and would become law if senators could vote on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is forcing his opponents to vote affirmatively to not
vote. Over time, that position can become increasingly difficult to
sustain, as Dole discovered. That is why there is talk (but so far
no action) in the GOP leadership in both houses about offering
greatly slimmed down versions of the blocked measures, targeting
but not hitting young smokers and HMOs. The political problem,
however, is that it is even harder to offer a pale palliative while
refusing to consider the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Kennedy says, pushing the palliatives is an attempt to
save politically fearful senators while doing nothing to help
people. For $1.10 per pack of cigarettes and the first real
regulation of the tobacco racket, a lot of young people won't start
smoking and a lot more will have health insurance and day-care
slots. For a simple chance for senators to vote, the insurance
monsters will have to concede patients some basic rights. And for
the same chance, wages at the bottom can rise again in the middle
of the best economy in a generation.

FRENCH FINALLY CONCEDE AMERICA CREATES REAL JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin visited
the United States last week to examine how its economy has created
millions of jobs during a time when his country and most of Europe
are suffering from heavy unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's trip punctured a cherished French myth. The French have
consistently argued that the vast increase in U.S. jobs since the
early 1990s was overwhelmingly due to hamburger-flipper-type work,
badly paid and without prospects of advancement.
</P>
<P>
   French officials and much of the docile media here sought to
console the more than 12 percent of their compatriots who have been
unable to get work by contending that they receive a better deal
under the protection of generous state unemployment benefits than
the mass of unskilled workers in America do from their low-level
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jospin, in many ways a refreshingly fair-minded politician,
decided it was time to dispel this bunkum although, as he
confessed, he had regarded it as an article of faith for years.
</P>
<P>
   He grasped that the dynamic growth of the U.S. economy, now
recognized throughout the world, made it impossible to continue
denying the fact that many good jobs were being created.
</P>
<P>
   Won over by America's unmatched prosperity, he declared that
``the first lesson to be drawn from America's economic development
and the steep drop in its unemployment, contrary to what we've long
claimed and even believed during a long period, is that the
creation of jobs in the United States is not solely or even in a
majority of cases based on low-paid, unskilled work.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that much of the 2-million-jobs-a-year increase since
1993 was in high technology and at salaries superior to the
national average. It's a record that no other country has come
close to, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A French government spokesman later explained that, with the
American model before him, the prime minister now wanted ``to give
greater weight to the spirit of enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's verdict is all the more noteworthy since, unlike
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, he isn't a capitalist in
socialist clothing.
</P>
<P>
   At 65, he remains a convinced leftist who insists social justice
must have priority over the market place. The most important steps
he has taken in the year he has been prime minister have been to
introduce a mandatory 35-hour work week in an effort to persuade
employers to take on more people and to beef up the state payroll
by 750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists are convinced that the 35-hour week will worsen
unemployment rather than cut it and that the additional state jobs,
mostly make-work schemes, will do little or nothing for the
economy. But old-line socialist dogma compelled Jospin to take
these measures against common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a trip to the United States opened his eyes. Too bad he
didn't stay there more than a few days. A longer visit might have
sent him home with some concrete ideas about how to get France back
to work.

   Dr. Beach, a.k.a. Stephen P. Leatherman, has once again named
his top beaches. No New England beach makes the top 10, but one,
Coast Guard Beach on Cape Cod, is No. 18. Leatherman, a professor
at Florida International University of Miami, devises the list
based on 50 criteria within categories that include: physical
factors such as sand softness; wave size and current strength;
biological factors such as water color and quality and presence of
pests; and human-use factors and impacts such as lifeguard
protection, visual obstructions, and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 beaches are: Kailua Beach Park, Hawaii; Kaunaoa,
Hawaii; St. Joseph Peninsula State Park, Florida; Wailea, Hawaii;
Caladesi Island State Park, Florida; Hamoa, Hawaii; Cape Florida
SRA, Florida; Hanalei Beach, Hawaii; Fort Desoto Park, Florida; and
St. George Island State Park, Florida.

TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching state insurance regulators in action Monday was almost
enough to give you a fuzzy feeling about the banks, for heaven's
sake. There they were at the Marriott Copley Place in Boston, 20
regulators and aides from various states gathered around a table,
now nearly a year into their debate over the merits of the
controversial concept of mutual insurance holding companies. The
discussion was ``perfect timing,'' said Jack Ehnes, Colorado's
insurance commissioner and the chairman of the National Association
of Insurance Commissioner's working group, given that the
Massachusetts Legislature was rumored to be taking up its own
holding company bill that very day.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect timing? The debate over how the nation's mutual insurers
are going to raise billions in new capital to compete with banks
and mutual fund companies is almost over, and state insurance
regulators across the country are still trying to decide whether
the introduction of article B, section II of their ``White Paper''
should be one paragraph or four?
</P>
<P>
   No, these mostly well-meaning, underpaid regulators have lost
their chance to play a real role in one of the most critical turns
in the history of the mutual insurance industry _ and, just as
importantly, in how millions of policyholders will, or will not, be
compensated for surrendering their ownership stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the only real debate (and in some states there has been
no debate at all) has come in the legislatures, where threats by
insurance companies to move jobs to Oshkosh and campaign donations
carry a lot more weight than technical discussions about closed
blocks and dividend scales.
</P>
<P>
   In the past couple of years about 20 states have passed
holding-company laws, which would allow policyholder-owned mutual
companies to raise capital by selling up to a 49 percent interest
to investors in a stock-owned insurance subsidiary. Policyholders
would retain a stake in the holding company.
</P>
<P>
   After a year of on-again, off-again debate a holding company
bill is near final approval by the Massachusetts Legislature; it
didn't come up Monday, as Ehnes suggested but it could later in the
week, as soon as the House finishes considering the assault weapon
ban.
</P>
<P>
   The state's two largest insurers, John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., had
pushed legislators hard for this bill. But then John Hancock
dropped out, opting instead for a plan to go public through a
traditional demutualization, in which its policyholders will be
paid for their ownership interests.
</P>
<P>
   All this is the kind of stuff only an actuary could love. But
here, in short, is about all any real human being needs to know:
Under Hancock's demutualization plan, policyholders would get, on
average, maybe $2,000 in stock, cash, or policy enhancements;
should Mass. Mutual pursue a mutual holding company, its
policyholders would get zero _ that's zero as in no stock, no cash,
no policy enhancements.
</P>
<P>
   Mass. Mutual says it wants the holding company bill only as
another ``option.'' But it is the one staking out legislators in
the hallways on Beacon Hill. And its general counsel, William
Fisher, was at the microphone at the NAIC meeting repeatedly
Monday, carrying the industry argument against consumer advocates
who oppose the mutual holding company approach. David Schiff,
editor of Schiff's Insurance Observer, dogged Fisher and the state
commissioners throughout with his video camera. ``The eye of
truth,'' as Schiff called it.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday night in New York, the campaign by Governor George
Pataki and that state's biggest insurers to push through a
last-minute holding company bill collapsed. The failure came
despite personal lobbying at the State House by the chairmen of
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and New York Life. And it came
despite a series of 11th-hour concessions by insurers that would
have provided compensation to policyholders for their ownership
stake and linked future shareholder dividends with those of
policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Now Massachusetts legislators are being asked to approve a bill
that consumer activists say has none of those same concessions
insurers were willing to make in New York. Monday, Fisher, Mass.
Mutual's general counsel, seemed pretty confident his company could
get it done.

ELATED OVER THE ELATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the newest cruise ships afloat gives a new reason to sail
the West Coast. Carnival Cruises' Elation is now the largest ship
to cruise from Los Angeles to the Mexican coast.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,040-passenger vessel cruises from Los Angeles on Sundays,
calling on Puerto Vallarta, Mazatlan, and Cabo San Lucas in Mexico.
The ship allows for three ``fun'' days at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Carnival is the largest cruise line around, and each
week sails almost always full, many people have said that if
they're going to cruise, Carnival isn't for them. Too much neon,
too glitzy, it's Las Vegas at sea, they say, adding that they don't
think the food is up to their standards. My wife was one of those
critics until I persuaded her it was time to try Carnival.
</P>
<P>
   Our brief cruise aboard the Elation changed her mind. One reason
was that Joe Farcus was aboard. Farcus has been designing the
interiors of Carnival ships for 21 years. He likes innovation and
he likes people to know they're not at home but on an adventure. He
believes in designing up, not down, for people, and that the design
affects the experience of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation offers a new experience and one that should appeal
to a broader market. My wife liked what he had to say, and
appreciated his art all the more, especially after Farcus explained
details that we might have missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation's interior design is fun. The Jekyll and Hyde Dance
Club has eight-foot-tall sculptures with faces split to convey both
benevolence and menace, eyes glowing as their heads swivel right
and left to the music's tempo, and occasionally blowing puffs of
smoke. In Duke's, the piano lounge named for Duke Ellington,
there's a New York motif with scale models of the city's famed
buildings, even a detailed model of the Brooklyn Bridge. There's
even a zeppelin floating in the sky, and tiny zeppelins embedded in
the rug design. Fun rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of materials and features throughout the ship are
superior to that found in most hotels or resorts.
</P>
<P>
   The ship has its quiet areas, like the Mark Twain Library, done
in the style of a river steamboat. As Dorothy might say, ``We're
not in Kansas anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship is designed to be enjoyed. Maybe it's not for everyone,
but it made my wife happy. She was impressed with the quality of
the food, the facilities on board, the size of the cabins, and even
the baths, which were more spacious than on some ships we've
sailed.
</P>
<P>
   The ship dazzles with its shows, casino, and lounges. There's
even a wonderful children's area, with everything from a play area
to computers to learn on. There's even a conference center. And a
grand fitness center overlooks the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation has an innovative propulsion system that pulls
rather than pushes the ship through the water. The engine is
quieter, less thirsty, and makes the vessel easier to maneuver.
Passengers will notice none of this, but it's nice to know it's
there.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation is the seventh ship in Carnival's Fantasy class of
70,000-ton vessels. The final edition will be the Paradise, billed
as the world's first smoke-free cruise ship. The Paradise begins
Sunday cruising on Dec. 6 from Miami with seven-day cruises
alternating between the eastern and western Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure: Even though there will be eight ships in the
Fantasy class, and even though they have many similarities as to
location of public rooms, each is distinct and fun.
</P>
<P>
   Carnival recently completed the acquisition of the Cunard Line
and is already beginning to create new life for the venerable line.
Larry Pimentel, Cunard's new president, announced that the line
will build a ``stately superliner that will evoke the spirit of a
bygone era of seagoing luxury. Our goal is nothing less than to
create a new golden age of sea travel for those who missed the
first.''
</P>
<P>
   No further information was given on the plans other then to note
the ship will not replace the QE2.

   Cruise happenings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seabourn Cruise Line will hold a Twentieth Century Fox Film
Retrospective cruise with guest lecturers and films from the golden
years of Hollywood. The 12-day cruise on the Seabourn Pride will
sail from New York on Oct. 20. Movie stars June Haver and Donald
O'Conner will be aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Aloha Festivals/Hawaiian Heritage theme cruises will be held on
American Hawaii Cruise Independence on Sept. 12, 19, and 26 and
Oct. 3. The weeklong cruises that visit the Hawaiian islands will
feature onboard activities on music, history, dance, and the arts
of the islands.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to fly to take a cruise. Uncommon Journeys
(309 Lennon Lane, Suite 101, Walnut Creek, CA 94598; telephone
800-323-5893) features rail-to-ship trips. Among offerings are A
Journey to Quebec by streamliner train to the Queen Elizabeth 2,
Oct. 5-15. Travelers will depart New York City to Quebec City for
the voyage.
</P>
<P>
   United and Northwest Airlines will award members of their
frequent-flier programs 20,000-30,000 bonus miles per stateroom on
23 voyages of Radisson Seven Seas Cruises 180-passenger Song of
Flower in Arabia and Asia from October 1998 through December 1999
if the trip is booked by Aug. 1, 1998. The voyages range from eight
to 14 nights in length.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Olson Cruise Lines is offering a 25 percent discount and
free air fare on fall cruises from Barbados. The cruises are aboard
the Black Watch (formerly the Royal Viking Star). The 12-day
cruises begin at $2,016 a person. For information, call EuroCruises
at 800-661-1119.
</P>
<P>
   Where will you be on Dec. 31, 1999? If you cruise on Holland
America Line, you could have the opportunity to celebrate the turn
of the century twice, toasting it in Hawaii or on a Panama Canal
cruise. Bookings for the millennium cruises have just opened, and
travelers wishing to lock in their cruise are asked for a $500
deposit on seven-day cruises or $1,000 a person on cruises of 10
days or longer. Early booking discounts will be available. To
celebrate the new century, the Nieuw Amsterdam on its Australia/New
Zealand cruise will sail east across the International Dateline
into ``yesterday'' so they can celebrate all over again.
</P>
<P>
   This being honeymoon season, many who are about to be married
may want to know about honeymoon cruises. The Cruise Line, which
offers savings of $300 to $2,000 on cruises it sells, has a free
32-page Guide to Cruise Ship Honeymoons &AMP; Weddings. For a guide,
call 800-777-0707.
</P>
<P>
   Ivaran Lines, which operates the luxury passenger freighter
American, is now including gratuities for onboard staff in its
pricing for 1999. The cruises from Houston to South American ports
begin at $4,458 for an inside single. Special cruises, booked by
Nov. 19, come with a savings of up to 20 percent off '99 rates.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing you'd think cruise passengers would want to be
reminded of is a seagoing tragedy. But when it involves the
Titanic, anything goes. The film ``Titanic'' is being credited with
a new interest in cruising. And this summer, guests on Holland
America Line's Veendam cruises to New England and Canada will call
on Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they will explore sites and
memorabillia associated with the sinking. Haligonians were
commended at the time for their response and compassion during the
relief effort in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who take a cruise like to know where they are going.
However, those booking a cruise on the Delta Queen Aug. 25 will
only know where they are leaving from (Little Rock) and where they
will disembark (Cincinnati). Captain Gabe Chengery of the historic
paddlewheeler says, ``Nothing is definite, except that I guarantee
an adventure _ just like traveling aboard steamers a century ago.''
The captain plans to ``tie up'' wherever the whim arises. If you
choose to wait till next year to take a ``tramping'' (stopping
wherever and whenever) cruise, free air fare is being offered. Call
800-543-1949 for details. Fares for the eight-day '98 cruise begin
at $1,350 a person; in '99, a seven-day version begins at $1,050.

Barging in America
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America's great rivers _ the Mississippi and Ohio among them _
have been known for two means of transportation, steamboats, and
barges. Travelers will now be able to cruise these and other
waterways on a luxury barge. RiverBarge Excursion Lines offers a
different way of looking at the rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the river barge has evolved into a luxury means of
transportation; now the same will be true in America. The River
Explorer is the first American-built first-class hotel barge and
will offer four- to 10- day excursions throughout America's
heartland rivers and the Gulf Intra Coastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   The River Explorer is actually two 295-foot-long barges that are
connected together. The aft barge contains 100 spacious staterooms
that give the barge a 200-passenger capacity. All staterooms
feature large picture windows, a choice of twin- or queen-size
beds, a television with a VCR, phones, mini-refrigerators,
coffeemakers, irons, and a bathroom with a tub. The forward barge
contains public rooms, including a single and open-seating dining
room, a show lounge, a bar, a gift shop, a library, a game room,
and a Pilot House, a re-creation of a working pilot house with
radios, radar, maps, and a large window over the bow for viewing
the river.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises begin at $750 a person for a four-day excursion and
include tips, taxes, port charges, and scheduled shore excursions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We designed the River Explorer so it will offer a wide range
of comforts, options, and amenities, which we think our guests will
find desirable,'' said Jeff Krida, RiverBarge Excursion Lines
president. ``And, apart from a wonderful vessel, we also will be
offering our guests the opportunity to partake in the customs and
traditions of the folks who live along the waterways we'll visit.''
Krida, who once headed the Delta Queen Steamboat Co., added, ``The
barge platform has given us a dependable and proven base to build a
wonderful floating hotel/resort, and we're doing just that.''

   Hanging around airports can be B-O-R-I-N-G, especially when your
flight has been delayed. But maybe you'll be lucky and find
yourself in one of these airports that, according to Travel
Holiday, feature unique diversions.
</P>
<P>
   _Schiphol in Amsterdam. There is a casino where you can play
roulette, blackjack, or slots and where 16 kinds of currency are
accepted. (The casino is between the west wing and the central
terminal, beyond Customs.)
</P>
<P>
   _Miami International. At the Airport Hotel, you can swim in an
outdoor pool, get some sun, take a sauna, or jog on a track for a
mere $8. Locker rooms and showers are available, too. (Head for
Concourse E, second floor.)
</P>
<P>
   _Milwaukee Airport. The Renaissance Bookshop sells used
paperbacks, vintage Life magazines, even gems like a Steinbeck
first edition for $35. (The shop is in the main terminal.)
</P>
<P>
   _Orlando International. The world's first airport microbrewery
offers five beers, darts, and a tour of the facility. And if you
have enough brews, you won't care how late your plane is. (The
microbrewery is in the main terminal's central corridor. A second
pub is near gates 60-99.)

 &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  An American and an Irishman bump into each other.
``Sorry,'' says one. ``I wasn't looking where I was going.''
``Excuse me,'' says the other. ``Neither was I.'' Which is the
American? (Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; And speaking of Irish things: &LR;  We recently mentioned that an old
Irish nickname for a pint of Guinness is a ``parish priest.''
Edward J. Flynn of Peabody writes that another nickname for
Guinness, with its dark body and white foamy top, is ``the blond in
the black dress.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``I haven't been Everywhere, but it's on my list.'' _
Susan Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; In a name: &LR;  Viagra is not yet legal in Canada. But so many Canadian
men have been crossing the border to fill prescriptions of the
impotence drug that ``The Honeymoon Capital of the World'' has
gained another nickname: Viagra Falls.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Today's fractured English lesson: &LR;  The Hotel Inter-Continental in
Tashkent, Uzbekistan, has an order form for room-service breakfast
that instructs the guest to ``please hang the completed doorknob
outside your room before retiring.'' (With thanks to Elia L. Puffer
of Winchester.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Seen in the sky:  &LR; Apparently the airlines consider ``One Fine Day''
to be one fine movie: It was selected by the greatest number of
airlines worldwide for in-flight vieiwng during 1997. Here,
according to the World Airline Entertainment Association, are the
rest of the top five: ``Jerry McGuire,'' ``The First Wives Club,''
``101 Dalmations,'' and ``The Saint.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; It's contest time:  &LR; You're driving along and suddenly a tune enters
your head _ and you can't stop singing it! Don't fret: It might
give you fame of sorts. Just sing your favorite song into a tape
recorder. Then write in 50 words or fewer why the song is your
favorite to sing while traveling. Then submit tape and essay to
Dramamine Drives, c/o CGI Group, PO Box 3842, Grand Central
Station, New York, NY 10163. The grand prize winner gets to sing at
a professional venue in his or her hometown. Entries must be
postmarked by June 30, and tapes and essays will not be returned _
as if you really wanted them back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Tired travel joke:  &LR; A man checks in at an airport counter. He says,
``I've got three suitcases. I want you to send one to New York, one
to Chicago, and one to L.A. ``I'm sorry,'' the attendant replies,
``we can't do that.'' ``Really?'' the customer says. ``You did last
week!'' (With thanks to Josef Orosz of Cyberspace.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Did you guess it? &LR;  The American is the one who said ``Excuse me.''
``Sorry'' is the more common expression in Ireland.

THE FIRING OF AL DUNLAP, FROM THE PEN OF FRANZ KAFKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Al Dunlap awoke one morning from a troubled dream, he found
himself changed in his bed into a monstrous insect. He lay on his
back, which was as hard as armor plate, and, raising his head a
little, he could see the arch of his great brown belly, divided by
bowed corrugations. The pattern of his stomach faintly reminded him
of a Grillmaster grill.
</P>
<P>
   Al was chief executive of Sunbeam Corp., and his products _
barbecue grills, coffee makers, smoke detectors, electric blankets
_ were never far from his thoughts. He heard a soft gurgle from his
bureau and was cheered by the thought that his Mr. Coffee had
completed its automatic brewing. He shifted his buglike eyes to a
tiny, red light overhead _ it was his First Alert smoke detector.
His Sunbeam electric blanket slipped off his belly, and Al's legs,
pitiably thin compared with their former size, fluttered helplessly
before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to me?'' he thought.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed what had happened? Here was the high-flying chief
executive _ so ruthless and unforgiving he was known as ``Chain Saw
Al'' and ``Rambo in Pinstripes'' _ now reduced to a quivering
insect. Al was the turnaround magician who had waved his chain saw
at Scott Paper Co., hacked off 11,000 jobs, saved the company, and
walked away with his reward of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam had been so impressed _ and so financially distressed _
it booked the rescue artist for an encore performance in corporate
triage. Again Al whipped out his enchanted chain saw and sheared
away 6,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Things couldn't have looked better. When Superman Al first flew
in through the window at Sunbeam, the stock price leaped 49 percent
in a single bound. Soon he was boasting of a swift and efficient
turnaround. But lately, the magician had been revealed for a
curious sleight of hand. Last year, earnings had been artificially
inflated by an accounting gimmick, it was disclosed, and Sunbeam's
stock had plunged back to earth, losing half its value in three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I will fix everything,'' thought Al. ``If I can just get
myself out of this bed.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a cautious tap at his locked door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert,'' said a voice _ it was his wife. ``It's a quarter to
seven. Didn't you want to fire more people today?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, of course, that was his only solution. He had to cut costs
still further by hurling hundreds more employees out into the
streets. He lay on his hard-shell back and, rubbing his scrawny
feet together, muttered diabolically: ``I'll crush them like
insects.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought momentarily lifted his spirits. And he started
rocking his body, with the idea of swinging himself onto the floor.
When at last he was half out of bed, there came a second knock at
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albert,'' his wife whispered. ``Mr. Price and Mr. Perelman are
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Michael Price and Ronald Perelman were the biggest
shareholders in Sunbeam. They had been bitterly disappointed over
the past several months as the value of their holdings had
deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on in there?'' Price demanded. ``Open the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain Saw Al was uncharacteristically silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't seem your old self, Al,'' Perelman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slight illness, an attack of giddiness,'' replied Al. His
voice had a horrible twittering squeak.
</P>
<P>
   Price came right to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've wrecked everything, Al,'' he said. ``You're not what
you appear to be. You leave us no choice. Open the door, Al. One
way or another we're coming in there and we're going to crush you
like a bug!''

SUIT REVEALS ISSUES BETWEEN YOUNGER, OLDER WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was TJ Maxx trying to promote a more youthful corporate culture
when a young manager at a New Jersey store fired several employees
over 40?
</P>
<P>
   Talk to Sherry Lang, spokeswoman for TJX Cos. in Framingham,
Mass., and her response is an emphatic ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By policy, this company does not discriminate against anyone
for any reason,'' says Lang. ``We believe their claims have no
merit, none at all.''
</P>
<P>
   A class-action lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission last fall alleges TJX Cos., parent of the retail chain,
had exposed older employees to unfair discipline since August 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the case centers around 59-year-old Betty Heyner, a
former sales clerk who claims she was railroaded out of her job
back in 1995 because of her age. Heyner is alleging that many of
the problems she experienced while running the jewelry counter at a
suburban New Jersey store stemmed from a young supervisor's brash
managerial style and unorthodox work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Heyner's former manager could not be reached by telephone to
comment. But if allegations in the case illustrate anything at all,
it is that tensions between Generation Xers and senior employees
are not uncommon, and when younger managers are in charge of older
workers emotions are apt to heighten.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 45 million Generation Xers, born between 1965 and
1977. Self-starters who would rather be in the driver's seat than
wait their turn, many twentysomethings are now moving into coveted
managerial positions, jobs baby boomers waited years to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Xers are really the forerunners of a new career
paradigm, and they think of themselves as free agents,'' says Bruce
Tulgan, founder of Rainmaker Thinking, a New Haven consulting firm
that helps companies better understand this generation. ``They move
into positions of power quickly because they don't do things the
old way, and many are really trying to be the kind of manager they
wanted to have.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind of manager is that? Managers who sidestep rules that
get in the way. Managers who aren't afraid to take chances. Not
surprising, baby boomer employees often describe these new managers
as brash, audacious, arrogant, and, yes, a bit threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older workers often feel that companies are looking for
younger people, that they can bring in people who are younger on a
temporary basis and not pay benefits,'' says psychologist Bruce
Cedar, a workplace consultant at CMG Associates in Newton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older worker feels more vulnerable. When you get younger
mangers in, oftentimes I've heard it said that older employees feel
even more threatened,'' notes Cedar. ``They feel younger people are
simply looking for ways to get rid of older, more expensive
workers. This is coming from what individuals feel, and is
certainly not based on any company policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The workplace of the 1990s might seem threatening, even
volatile, to baby boomers. Generation Xers, by contrast, have
experienced little else but change, and they thrive on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Xers disdain authority for the sake of authority,''
says Tulgan, author of ``Managing Generation X'' (1995 Merritt
Publishing, $19.95). ``So, most of the young people who are moving
into positions of power tend to soft pedal their authority because
of perceived hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   And that can cause problems in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they soft pedal their authority so much that when
things go wrong, they go ballistic,'' notes Tulgan ``And there may
be awkwardness with authority, which can be manifested by
inappropriate behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyner claims her 21-year-old manager had temper tantrums and
blew up at her without cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I saw her blow up, right at the store,'' says Heyner.
``I was stunned. She started throwing papers around and yelling.
She didn't like the way (the jewelry) was being displayed. The
whole thing was shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts stress most Generation X managers take their
responsibilities seriously. But they don't want to be held back by
policies such as seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a myth out there that these young people, as
managers, are slackers,'' said Tulgan. ``That's not true. These are
people who have come of age during the most profound changes in our
economy since the Industrial Revolution. For boomers, downsizing
and reorganizing and re-engineering may seem totally revolutionary
and frightening. But to Generation Xers, that's just the way things
are. They grew up with it, and they are taking advantage of the
changes and transformations.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say, companies would do well to offer these young
managers what they crave most: training, plenty of feedback, clear
goals, and monthly rewards for job performance.

WHERE CUSTER WENT TERRIBLY WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes sidebar)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.  R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROW AGENCY, Montana _ George Armstrong Custer, the dashing boy
general of the Union Army in the Civil War, came to a very bad end
on a grassy hillside above what is now Interstate 90. That was on
the morning of June 25, 1876, and today's interstate was an Indian
trail from the Dakota Plains to the rich grasslands of the
Yellowstone River valley. Custer's Crow scouts had seen that trail
a few days earlier, and it was beaten flat by the movement of a few
thousand Lakota and Sioux and Cheyenne and Blackfeet warriors and
their families and their strings of spare horses. The scouts could
not imagine such a vast army, and despite their best efforts at
explaining what they had seen, neither could Lieutenant Colonel
Custer.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakota and Sioux and their allies could not imagine
something, too _ that there was a man foolish enough to attack
their huge force. Everyone, at the Battle of the Little Bighorn,
began the day laboring under monstrous misapprehensions.
</P>
<P>
   Some 400,000 visitors come each year, one gathers watching them
tour the five-mile-long battlefield, to make their own attempt at
figuring out what went so terribly wrong. The site of Custer's Last
Stand (it is not clear whether he ever had a first stand, his style
was always to charge straight ahead, whether at Confederates or
hapless villages of Native Americans) is an easy hour's drive from
Billings, and on the direct route from the midwest to the Big Sky
country. Unfortunately, by accidents of geography and politics, one
enters the scene from the wrong direction, emotionally and
intellectually. The route is all truck stops and traffic and barely
skirts the territory of the Crow tribal casino and an uninspiring
Indian souvenir store just at the entrance road. Inside the
national monument, you are required to begin at the end, at the
information center just downhill from the foreshortened granite
obelisk that marks the graveyard of about (Army records were a
little vague) 210 men under Custer's command.
</P>
<P>
   If you have never visited, either read about the battle
beforehand (Evan S. Connell's ``Son of the Morning Star'' is
sufficiently accurate and tremendously readable) or stop briefly at
the information center and pick up two publications, the
battlefield official map and guide and the new (1996)
``Reno-Benteen Entrenchment Trail'' guide. Then drive directly to
the east end of the battlefield, stop where Major Reno and Captain
Benteen survived, study your printed matter, and start slowly back
toward ``Last Stand Hill,'' and let the enormity of it begin to
sink in. Remind yourself that Custer _ at best _ had seen only the
fringe of the Indian encampment, south and west of the
Reno(EQ)Benteen entrenchment, far below and far away.
</P>
<P>
   As you drive northwest, think of Reno down in the valley, out of
sight now, setting up a skirmish line so that when the boy general
descended from the hills and scattered the Lakota and the Sioux
(something he was well-practiced at doing), Major Reno would be
there to close the trap. Notice, and Custer had no better view,
that you cannot see a bit of the valley, none of the thousands of
tepees, not a man of the thousands of warriors racing to their
horses, many in such a hurry that they had no time for ceremony _
no paint, no prayer. Go slowly, this was no cavalry charge and
never would be, just the jostling of horses and saddles, the faint
clank of canteens and ammunition belts. Things fell off along the
way _ bits of tack and dropped cartridges and such things that
resist the elements have allowed archeologists a fair glimpse of
Custer's path. He is, for the most part, east of the road, with no
better view than the curious visitor has today.
</P>
<P>
   It is a morbidly curious place. By the time you arrive at the
very last stand, you realize what war is, a fog of misinformation
and the piercing clarity of a last, brief, understanding that today
is a day for dying. For all the classic paintings of the Last Stand
(Budweiser beer put one in virtually every saloon in America),
death was more scattered. Above and below the road, white monuments
mark where one or two cavalrymen, occasionally a small unit, had
their horribly personal last stand. The excellent map and brief
narrative will explain what happened. The visitor will have to
decide why.
</P>
<P>
   By fall 1998, there will be an additional memorial on Last Stand
Hill, one to the Indians who fell there (less than half as many as
Seventh Cavalry officers and soldiers). A juried competition chose
an earthen berm and a theme of reconciliation. Spirit posts,
according to the jury, will welcome the cavalrymen to the Indian
memorial. It is a very proper and very pre-millennium thought _ the
ghosts of all concerned sharing a spiritual retreat, talking about
the old days. It is a physically unobtrusive memorial, and has as
little to say about the morning of June 25, 1876, as the granite
obelisk over the mass grave of the Seventh Cavalry. What speaks,
when all is said and done, are the white markers on the brown
hills.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
SIDEBAR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DECKER, MONTANA -- Eight days before the Battle of the Little
Bighorn, another US Army unit encountered many of the same
tribesmen who would wipe out five companies of the Seventh Cavalry.
Forty miles by paved highway from the Little Bighorn site, south
and east off Montana highway 338 is the Rosebud Battlefield State
Park.
</P>
<P>
   General George Crook, a veteran of wars with the Apache bands in
Arizona had been sent north to join with Custer in a pincers
movement against the plains Indians. At the Rosebud, with an army
of nearly 1000 troopers and infantrymen, Crook came near to having
his own ``Last Stand.''
</P>
<P>
   The battlefield is something of a mirror image of the Little
Bighorn. Crook was encamped on the low ground along Rosebud Creek,
the Indians came down off the rolling prairie and attacked him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosebud site is lightly developed for tourism, and brochures
are not always available in the honor-system boxes at the site. An
excellent short history and map of the Rosebud is available at the
Little Bighorn information center.
</P>
<P>
   From the shallow valley of Rosebud Creek, visitors can walk and
drive up the coulees. A few hundred feet above the valley floor,
the broken land turns into a rolling prairie that runs out to the
horizon, a horizon marked by the low hills beyond the Little
Bighorn valley. It is not difficult to imagine the emotions when
Crook's troopers chased an apparently fleeing foe up the coulees
and onto the plains, and then suddenly realize that these
magnificent horsemen had now drawn them out, scattered the
troopers, and had them at their mercy in a warfare of movement and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   There is no monument to Crook's 10 dead. At approximately the
site of the first parkinglot, he buried them, and then rode his
entire force across the gravesite to obliterate it and protect it
from imagined and anticipated desecration. It is worth the trouble
to walk up one of the coulees and look across the rolling plain. It
says so clearly that you have crossed the threshold from an army
encampment, down along the water, to the endless plains where the
horsemen rule.
</P>
<P>
   After the licking he took at the Rosebud, as it does not mention
in the brochure, Crook retreated back to his base on the Tongue
River in present day Sheridan, Wyoming, and simply went on
vacation. He and his men were trout fishing and bear hunting when
Custer died. Although maligned, Crook returned to his Arizona base
and continued to be a relentless pacifier and persecutor of the
Apache bands. He was a great general in broken and mountainous
terrain, but he was, to use perhaps appropriate metaphor,
``buffaloed'' by the endless prairie. A general capable of putting
Geronimo's back to the wall had no answers on the borderless high
plains. The Rosebud, even more than the Little Bighorn, is a study
in the mastery of geography over ill-prepared humanity.

FOR THE OLYMPIC, A GOLD MEDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Early in Sunday's final round, when the
ne'er-do-wells and also-rans and never-rans were teeing it up in
the US Open, the volunteers manning the leaderboards needed
something to do to pass the long hours until the leaders teed off.
</P>
<P>
   They posted scores.
</P>
<P>
   Many of which were all in red.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger's was the most brilliant red of all, a 5-under-par
round of 65. The red numbers, for sub-par scores, also were posted
beside the names of Mark O'Meara, Jeff Sluman, and Colin ``Jousting
With The Galleries'' Montgomerie. Why not? All were far back, none
of them felt any pressure, and they could whale away at the Olympic
Club at will.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And then came green number after green number, ugly green
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest part of the afternoon, when the Olympic Club
leveled the world's best golfers, there were no red numbers on the
leaderboard after the names of the top 10. Instead there were only
those green numbers _ for par or over-par golf _ until a solitary
red number went up by the name of David Duval, who broke par by a
single stroke, and then by the name of eventual winner Lee Janzen,
who finished 2 under for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But, for overall scores for four days of trying to survive
Olympic, there was not a single red number. Janzen's final number _
a ``0'' for level par _ also was in ugly green.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Club had won the Open. Janzen had survived and taken
home the $535,000 winner's check because some golfer must be
declared the winner, but it was the golf course itself that had
won. As is usually the case with the United States Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Olympic Club really won, because there was only
one person even par for the tournament,'' said Payne Stewart, who
once led by five strokes but succumbed to Olympic and the Open
pressure to blow the largest Sunday lead since Tony Jacklin had a
four-stroke lead in 1970. ``I think this golf course stood up to
the test of being an Open Championship course.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor over the impossible pin placement on a top
slope of the 18th green Friday, for which the US Golf Association
apologized, Stewart conceded that the course was ``fair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course was every bit championship-caliber,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA takes untold abuse year after year for making its Open
courses as difficult as possible. The best golfers in the world,
believing that the minus-16 scores posted at Pleasant Valley or
Hartford or Memphis are their birthright, moan and then moan some
more. Jack Nicklaus call these golfers ``whiners,'' and whiners
they are.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of this Open, golfer after golfer had stopped
moaning and was complimenting Olympic and, by entension, the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the USGA ever decided to go on rotation, Olympic should
definitely be in the rotation,'' said Azinger. ``I think the
golfers, for the most part, all love this course.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the powers that be wish to give the United States a
home-course advantage for the Ryder Cup at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass. next year, they might copy what the USGA does at
its Open courses _ let the rough grow. Specifically, let the rough
grow around the greens, that high rough only a few feet from the
greens that bedeviled golfer after golfer, particularly the
Europeans. Lee Westwood (tied for seventh) and Nick Price (fourth)
were the only foreigners to finish among the top 14.
</P>
<P>
   Even Montgomerie, the Scot whose 69 Sunday brought a horrible
performance back to respectability _ he finished 18th _ praised
Olympic despite enduring more than a few catcalls from the gallery.
Several fans jeered Montgomerie, doubtlessly engendering more
anti-US fervor in the London tabloids ``and it all had to do with
the Ryder Cup,'' he said. ``I was seemed to be blamed for (Europe)
winning the Ryder Cup. But it's always the minority more vocal than
the majority, unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the course itself, ``I think they set this course up
fantastic,'' said Montgomerie. ``It's a real mental battle, and you
get rewarded for good shots and you definitely get penalized for
bad ones. I'm a great fan of that and always will be, and I think
(the USGA) has done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   This Open at Olympic will be remembered for much: for Tiger
Woods officially stepping down from Olympus and becoming just
another good golfer; for Casey Martin proving he is an exceptional
golfer and more than just a man who needs a golf cart to get
around; and for the fresh face and fresher smile of amateur Matt
Kuchar lighting up the Open just as they had lit up the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Olympic itself that will be most remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard out there,'' said Duval. ``It was hard Saturday
and hard the day before that. You can't define it. I mean, it's so
subtle.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said this was the hardest course he has played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had to carve a golf shot on every hole as I had to
carve a golf shot here,'' he said. ``You had to slam it against a
slope or else you go into rough. Then ... it's tough to make a
15-foot putt here.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly as the test to find the national champion should be.

`MONK AND MINGUS' MAKE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP ELWOOD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Monk and Mingus'' _ a conveniently alliterative
matching of jazz pantheon members' names _ was the only title that
the JVC Jazz Festival's Symphony Space marquee needed to lure 1,000
jazz fans, young and old, to the nicely renovated old theater.
</P>
<P>
   As structured by drummer-leader T.S. Monk Jr., the musical
portions of his tentet's ``Monk on Monk Tribute,'' are presumably
held together by his rambling reminiscences and anecdotes about his
famous pianist-composer father.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his remarks (often frivolous and apocryphal) bog down
his set's musical momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Monk composed at the piano, worked regularly as a
quartet leader and was never successful in the role of a big-band
leader at the keyboard. His son, wisely making use of a midsized
piano, bass, four-sax, three brass and drums complement _ and
employing lead trumpeter Don Sickler's brilliant arrangements _ has
come up with a marvelous book of Monk music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Epistrophy,'' loaded with cascading, dissonant runs undercut
by Howard Johnson's surging baritone sax, proved a perfect
overture, leading into ``Bye-Ya,'' which was followed (after T.S.'s
first stand-up monologue) by a magnificent rendition of
``Evidence,'' featuring Jeff Stockham's French horn solo and a
couple of passages by an unusual baritone sax-clarinet-alto
sax-soprano sax quartet, which spun off into individual solos.
Pianist Ronnie Matthews, masterful in his Monkish chording, seldom
uses Monk's jagged rhythms and broken meters _ on ``Evidence,''
however, he inserted a chorus of ``Thelonious,'' much to my
delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Mean You,'' a wonderful Sickler orchestration with John
Gordon on Bird-like alto, is a lusty romp, and Nneenna Frelon's
vocals on ``Ruby, My Dear'' and ``In Walked Bud'' fitted into the
performance nicely. Outstanding tenor sax work by Johnson and Dave
Schumacher and trombone by Eddie Bert were highlights.
</P>
<P>
   By midconcert, T.S.'s ever-longer commentary was backed lightly
by pianist Matthews and bassist Gary Wang. ``Four in One,'' an
expanded version of one of Monk's more complex compositions, was a
fitting conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Monk mavens might note that Monk's wife (T.S.'s mother),
``Nellie'' (as in Monk's tune ``Crepescule for Nellie''), was
sitting behind me, having a grand time and looking great.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the evening's bill with T.S. Monk was the Mingus Big
Band, playing its familiar Mingus stuff like ``Moanin'' and ``Love
Chant,'' as well as ``Sweet Supper Dance,'' the multipart
``Kuumbwa'' and a sensational arrangement of ``Isabel's Table
Dance'' (from Mingus' famed ``Tijuana Moods'' recording), complete
with a castanet-clicking, lady-in-red, Spanish dancer.
</P>
<P>
   She danced on stage, not on a table.
</P>
<P>
   Though the New York-based Mingus Band's complement of 14 to 15
is in a constant state of flux, it draws from a pool of 40 to 50
musicians, all of whom share an enthusiasm for the free-spirited,
go-for-it, Mingus musical mode. Outstanding at the Symphony Space
concert on Friday were Andy McKee (emerging as a great
band-bassist), Ronnie Cuber (baritone saxist and Mingus Band
concertmaster), alto saxist Vincent Herring, trombonist Britt
Woodman (there's a legendary name) and pianist Dave Kitakovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mingus' concept of composition and orchestration was founded on
his role as bassist and pianist _ bassists are part of both the
rhythm and harmony segments of a band; pianists, in modern jazz

While listening to the Mingus Big Band, one feels the spirit, the
freedom, the expansiveness (melody, harmony, rhythm) that Mingus
pursued in his music _ and in his life.

 &HT;    Cobbler recipes are simple and follow basic rules
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's hardly a better way to enjoy summer fruits than cobbled
with biscuit topping and crowned with pure vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Cobblers and crisps (and crumbles and slumps and grunts) are
truly folk food, as Richard Sax explains in his book, ``Classic
Home Desserts'' (Chapters, $29.95). And he came up with no less
than 18 different recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them break down to the essentials: fruit and dough,
or some crumbly-sweet topping. And there are some basic rules. It's
best to use the ripest fruits possible, because they will provide
more juices. And don't be afraid to play with the amount of sugar
in a recipe. Adjust to your taste and to the sweetness of the
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overmix or stir. That's especially true, Sax wrote, to get
a light biscuit topping. We'd also recommend paying careful
attention to the kind of flour a recipe calls for. The simplest
recipes will call for self-rising flour.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, your imagination is the limit. To get started, try
some of these ideas.

   This recipe comes from Marcia Adams' ``New Recipes From Quilt
Country'' (Clarkson Potter, $30) and is a tradition on ``work
days,'' or days when Amish women gather to do canning, special
heavy cleaning and other chores.
</P>
<P>
   1cup gingersnap crumbs (about 20 cookies), homemade or bought
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup quick-cooking oats (not instant)
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon grated nutmeg

<P>
   1/2cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
</P>
<P>
   Red food coloring (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine the
gingersnap crumbs, oats and nutmeg. In a large bowl, combine the
rhubarb, granulated sugar and brown sugar. Add a few drops of red
food coloring to tint the mixture light pink, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Grease a 2-quart flat casserole and sprinkle 1/4 cup of the
crumb mixture on the bottom. Add half the rhubarb and top with 1/2
cup of the crumb mixture. Add the rest of the rhubarb and top with
the remaining crumbs. Dot mixture with butter and bake for 35 to 40
minutes, or until the top of the crisp is browned and bubbling up
in the center. Serve warm with cream or a scoop of ice cream.

   The combination of peaches and blueberries not only tastes
sensational, but it looks sensational, too. This recipe provides
ample, biscuitlike crust. It comes from April Moon's ``The Flying
Biscuit Cookbook: Breakfast and Beyond'' (Longstreet Press, $14).
</P>
<P>
   2cups fresh blueberries, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds fresh peaches, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2cups plus 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, divided

   1/4teaspoon ground nutmeg

</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>

<P>
   4tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons raw sugar for sprinkling over the top
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl mix blueberries,
peaches, 1/4 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar and nutmeg. Turn fruit into a
2-quart baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Topping: Place 2 cups flour, baking powder, salt and 3
tablespoons sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut butter into 1/2
tablespoon-size pieces and work into the flour with your fingertips
or a pastry cutter until mixture resembles coarse meal. With a
wooden spoon, stir in cream and mix until just combined.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tablespoon, drop batter over the top of fruit until
entire surface is covered. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons raw sugar.
Bake cobbler for 40 to 50 minutes. The top will be golden and the
center bubbling when done. Serve warm, with a scoop of vanilla bean
ice cream.

   June means it's blackberry-picking time, and novelist and food
writer Jack Butler suggests there's no better way to enjoy the
jewels than in this cobbler. We tried his recipe from ``Jack's
Skillet: Plain Talk and Some Recipes From a Guy in the Kitchen''
(Algonquin Books, $19.95) and have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1Universal Black Iron Skillet Pie Crust (see recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   6cups fresh or frozen blackberries
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a mixing bowl, cut butter or
margarine into flour until mix is consistency of cornmeal. Then
thoroughly mix in 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of the sugar, according to
taste. Layer the prepared crust with about a third of the berries.
Sprinkle this layer liberally with about a third of the remaining
sugar, then sprinkle it with a third of the butter-flour-sugar mix.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out dough scraps as thin as you can make them and top the
layer of berries. (You don't have to cover the berries completely,
as this layer of dough serves to create dumplings.) Repeat this
process twice more, so that you have 3 layers of berries and your
skillet is full. For the final layer of berries, you may wish to
cut your dough into strips for a latticework top crust or into
other decorative shapes. Sprinkle the top crust lightly with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Put cobbler in oven. Check it after 40 minutes, although it may
need another 10 minutes or so. It is done when the crust is
browning lightly and the dark juices are bubbling up through the
top crust.

   Pie Crust
</P>
<P>
   Makes one 10-inch pie crust plus dumplings or two 9-inch pie
crusts
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 40-50 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2cups unbleached white flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   2/3cup margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup ice water
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine or butter with a
table knife or rubber spatula until mix has the consistency of
cornmeal. Trickle in ice water gradually, mixing with spatula until
dough balls up. You probably won't need all the water. Do not knead
the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Roll dough out on floured board, dusting both sides as needed to
keep it from sticking to the board or the rolling pin. Roll out to
desired thiness (for a truly flaky rather than stout crust, usually
1/16 inch or less). Roll out evenly in all directions, forming a
rough circle. When the circle is 3 or 4 inches wider in diameter
than necessary to fill a 2 inch-deep, 10 1/4-inch black iron
skillt, it is about the right thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the crust and fit into the skillet, then trim the edges
with a knife. (The crust may tear as you lift it into the skillet.
No problem. It tears because it is fragile, which means it will be
truly crisp and delicate in texture. Make patches from the remnant
dough, moisten the edges with ice water and press the patches into
place in the skillet.)
</P>
<P>
   Press a dinner fork around the edges of the crust to provide a
decorative crenelation. Depending on the filling, the leftover
dough may be used for stripping for the top, as with a cobbler, or
as dumplings for the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Bake as needed for the particular filling. With any given dish,
you generally don't want the crust to bake more than 40 to 50
minutes. If the filling is cooked ahead of time and requires less
baking time, brown the crust at 375 for 10 minutes before adding
the filling.

brown sugar, flour, oats, salt, cinnamon, ginger, walnuts and

   This is Dana Phelps-Marschalk's recipe adapted for mangoes. But
if you want to try other fruits, sprinkle with up to 1/2 cup sugar
and allow to sit at room temperature for an hour. You can also
increase the sugar in the dough up to 1 cup. It's all a matter of
what your sweet tooth desires.
</P>
<P>
   2cups sliced mangoes, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup unsalted butter

</P>
<P>
   1/2cup milk
</P>

   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Allow mangoes to sit at room
temperature for one hour. Melt the butter in an 8-by-8-inch baking
pan. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and milk. Drop spoonfuls of the
flour mixture into the melted butter. Do not mix or stir. Then drop
the fruit on top of the butter and around the batter. Again, do not
mix or stir. Bake for 30 minutes.

   A slump or grunt is so named because of the sound the berries
make while boiling. This recipe comes from Richard Sax's ``Classic
Home Desserts'' (Chapters, $29.95), which is loaded with
fruit-dessert recipes.
</P>
<P>
   1generous pint fresh blueberries (or 2 cups frozen)
</P>

<P>
   1/4cup water
</P>

<P>
   Pinch each of ground cinnamon and freshly ground pepper

   2tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup buttermilk (or a mixture of plain yogurt and skim milk

</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons cinnamon-sugar, for topping
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cream or ice cream for serving, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Place the berries in an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or shallow
heatproof casserole and add 3/4 cup sugar (or more to taste),
water, lemon juice and the optional cinnamon and pepper, if
preferred. Toss gently to combine and set aside. In a mixing bowl,
stir together the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Add enough of the
buttermilk to form a soft, sticky dough that is slightly wetter
than biscuit dough.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the skillet with the berries in it and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat to a steady simmer, uncover and spoon the dough over
the fruit, forming small dumplings with a soup spoon. Sprinkle
dumplings with cinnamon-sugar. Tightly cover the skillet with the
lid or a sheet of foil and steam the mixture over medium-low heat
until the dumplings set and their surface is dry when touched,
usually about 15 minutes. Spoon the slump into serving bowls, and
top with heavy cream or ice cream.

   It's worth seeking out fresh cherries at the farmers market to
make this cobbler because they taste so good with the apricots.

 &HT;    Cobbler recipes are simple and follow basic rules
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's hardly a better way to enjoy summer fruits than cobbled
with biscuit topping and crowned with pure vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Cobblers and crisps (and crumbles and slumps and grunts) are
truly folk food, as Richard Sax explains in his book, ``Classic
Home Desserts'' (Chapters, $29.95). And he came up with no less
than 18 different recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But all of them break down to the essentials: fruit and dough,
or some crumbly-sweet topping. And there are some basic rules. It's
best to use the ripest fruits possible, because they will provide
more juices. And don't be afraid to play with the amount of sugar
in a recipe. Adjust to your taste and to the sweetness of the
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overmix or stir. That's especially true, Sax wrote, to get
a light biscuit topping. We'd also recommend paying careful
attention to the kind of flour a recipe calls for. The simplest
recipes will call for self-rising flour.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, your imagination is the limit. To get started, try
some of these ideas.

   This recipe comes from Marcia Adams' ``New Recipes From Quilt
Country'' (Clarkson Potter, $30) and is a tradition on ``work
days,'' or days when Amish women gather to do canning, special
heavy cleaning and other chores.
</P>
<P>
   1cup gingersnap crumbs (about 20 cookies), homemade or bought
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup quick-cooking oats (not instant)

   1/2cup light brown sugar, firmly packed
</P>
<P>
   Red food coloring (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, combine the
gingersnap crumbs, oats and nutmeg. In a large bowl, combine the

   The combination of peaches and blueberries not only tastes
sensational, but it looks sensational, too. This recipe provides
ample, biscuitlike crust. It comes from April Moon's ``The Flying
Biscuit Cookbook: Breakfast and Beyond'' (Longstreet Press, $14).
</P>
<P>
   2cups fresh blueberries, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2pounds fresh peaches, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2cups plus 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, divided
</P>
<P>
   2/3cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4teaspoon ground nutmeg

   TOPPING:
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt

<P>
   4tablespoons unsalted butter, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons raw sugar for sprinkling over the top
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a large bowl mix blueberries,
peaches, 1/4 cup flour, 2/3 cup sugar and nutmeg. Turn fruit into a
2-quart baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Topping: Place 2 cups flour, baking powder, salt and 3
tablespoons sugar in a mixing bowl. Cut butter into 1/2
tablespoon-size pieces and work into the flour with your fingertips
or a pastry cutter until mixture resembles coarse meal. With a
wooden spoon, stir in cream and mix until just combined.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tablespoon, drop batter over the top of fruit until
entire surface is covered. Sprinkle with 2 tablespoons raw sugar.
Bake cobbler for 40 to 50 minutes. The top will be golden and the
center bubbling when done. Serve warm, with a scoop of vanilla bean
ice cream.

   June means it's blackberry-picking time, and novelist and food
writer Jack Butler suggests there's no better way to enjoy the
jewels than in this cobbler. We tried his recipe from ``Jack's
Skillet: Plain Talk and Some Recipes From a Guy in the Kitchen''
(Algonquin Books, $19.95) and have to agree.
</P>
<P>
   1tablespoon butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1Universal Black Iron Skillet Pie Crust (see recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   6cups fresh or frozen blackberries
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a mixing bowl, cut butter or
margarine into flour until mix is consistency of cornmeal. Then
thoroughly mix in 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup of the sugar, according to
taste. Layer the prepared crust with about a third of the berries.
Sprinkle this layer liberally with about a third of the remaining
sugar, then sprinkle it with a third of the butter-flour-sugar mix.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out dough scraps as thin as you can make them and top the
layer of berries. (You don't have to cover the berries completely,
as this layer of dough serves to create dumplings.) Repeat this
process twice more, so that you have 3 layers of berries and your
skillet is full. For the final layer of berries, you may wish to
cut your dough into strips for a latticework top crust or into
other decorative shapes. Sprinkle the top crust lightly with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Put cobbler in oven. Check it after 40 minutes, although it may
need another 10 minutes or so. It is done when the crust is
browning lightly and the dark juices are bubbling up through the
top crust.

   Pie Crust
</P>
<P>
   Makes one 10-inch pie crust plus dumplings or two 9-inch pie
crusts
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 40-50 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2cups unbleached white flour
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of salt
</P>
<P>
   2/3cup margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup ice water
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour and salt in a bowl. Cut in margarine or butter with a
table knife or rubber spatula until mix has the consistency of
cornmeal. Trickle in ice water gradually, mixing with spatula until
dough balls up. You probably won't need all the water. Do not knead
the dough.
</P>
<P>
   Roll dough out on floured board, dusting both sides as needed to
keep it from sticking to the board or the rolling pin. Roll out to
desired thiness (for a truly flaky rather than stout crust, usually
1/16 inch or less). Roll out evenly in all directions, forming a
rough circle. When the circle is 3 or 4 inches wider in diameter
than necessary to fill a 2 inch-deep, 10 1/4-inch black iron
skillet, it is about the right thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Lift the crust and fit into the skillet, then trim the edges
with a knife. (The crust may tear as you lift it into the skillet.
No problem. It tears because it is fragile, which means it will be
truly crisp and delicate in texture. Make patches from the remnant
dough, moisten the edges with ice water and press the patches into
place in the skillet.)
</P>
<P>
   Press a dinner fork around the edges of the crust to provide a
decorative crenelation. Depending on the filling, the leftover
dough may be used for stripping for the top, as with a cobbler, or
as dumplings for the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Bake as needed for the particular filling. With any given dish,
you generally don't want the crust to bake more than 40 to 50
minutes. If the filling is cooked ahead of time and requires less
baking time, brown the crust at 375 for 10 minutes before adding
the filling.

   This is one of the easiest ways to gussy up plums, and the oats

</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a bowl stir together the plums,

bottom of a buttered 8-inch-square pan. In another bowl blend the
brown sugar, flour, oats, salt, cinnamon, ginger, walnuts and
butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Sprinkle the brown
sugar mixture evenly over the plum mixture and bake the dessert in
the middle of oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it is crisp.

   This is Dana Phelps-Marschalk's recipe adapted for mangoes. But
if you want to try other fruits, sprinkle with up to 1/2 cup sugar
and allow to sit at room temperature for an hour. You can also
increase the sugar in the dough up to 1 cup. It's all a matter of
what your sweet tooth desires.
</P>
<P>
   2cups sliced mangoes, room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1cup self-rising flour

<P>
   1/2cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Dash salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup milk
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Allow mangoes to sit at room
temperature for one hour. Melt the butter in an 8-by-8-inch baking
pan. Combine the flour, sugar, salt and milk. Drop spoonfuls of the
flour mixture into the melted butter. Do not mix or stir. Then drop
the fruit on top of the butter and around the batter. Again, do not
mix or stir. Bake for 30 minutes.

   A slump or grunt is so named because of the sound the berries
make while boiling. This recipe comes from Richard Sax's ``Classic
Home Desserts'' (Chapters, $29.95), which is loaded with
fruit-dessert recipes.
</P>
<P>
   1generous pint fresh blueberries (or 2 cups frozen)

</P>
<P>
   2tablespoons cinnamon-sugar, for topping
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cream or ice cream for serving, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Place the berries in an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or shallow
heatproof casserole and add 3/4 cup sugar (or more to taste),
water, lemon juice and the optional cinnamon and pepper, if
preferred. Toss gently to combine and set aside. In a mixing bowl,
stir together the flour, 2 tablespoons sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and salt. Stir in the melted butter. Add enough of the
buttermilk to form a soft, sticky dough that is slightly wetter
than biscuit dough.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the skillet with the berries in it and bring to a boil.
Lower the heat to a steady simmer, uncover and spoon the dough over
the fruit, forming small dumplings with a soup spoon. Sprinkle
dumplings with cinnamon-sugar. Tightly cover the skillet with the
lid or a sheet of foil and steam the mixture over medium-low heat
until the dumplings set and their surface is dry when touched,
usually about 15 minutes. Spoon the slump into serving bowls, and
top with heavy cream or ice cream.

US DOWN TO LAST STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  LYON, France _ They are among the World Cup zombies now,
wandering around the countryside with the Japanese and the Saudis
and the Jamaicans and the rest of the walking dead.
</P>
<P>
   The US men's soccer team, eliminated from the tournament by its
2-1 loss to Iran here Sunday night, still has to play Yugoslavia in
its group finale Thursday night. So the players arose stiff-legged
and glassy-eyed Monday, slipped into their team blazers, caught a
flight to Nantes, and went back out on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Dead or not, the Yanks still have something to prove to the
world: that they can match up with the best sides on the planet and
play entertaining soccer doing it. And if they play like zombies in
Nantes, they'll be soundly hammered by the Yugoslavs, who can still
be eliminated even though they're undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play to win,'' vowed US coach Steve Sampson,
who could be out of a job if his squad does not. ``We're going to
play to get a result. The objective in the third match has not
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the stakes have, dramatically. Ever since last December's
draw, the US had assumed that it would still be alive and kicking
coming into the Yugoslavia match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept was to get a tie against Germany and get a win
against Iran,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after losing, 2-0, to the Germans, the Americans would have
advanced to the second round _ their announced goal _ by winning
their other two matches. That was why Sampson shook up his lineup
against the Iranians and loaded it with attacking players, to go
for the knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we took the risk of sending so many people
forward,'' he said. ``Because we needed the 3 points.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans created dozens of scoring chances. They took 27
shots, whacking balls off both posts and the crossbar. Even after
Iran burned them twice for goals on counterattacks, the Americans
kept risking, pushing, shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored another goal and you didn't,'' Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi told Sampson afterward. ``That is the only reason why you
didn't win in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the Yanks still went two-and-out, walking off the
pitch at Stade Gerland depleted and deflated as Iranian drums
pounded a victory beat all around them. ``Fin Des Illusions
Americaines,'' L'Equipe, the French sporting daily, proclaimed
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had no illusions about winning the Cup. Their
admittedly bold master plan/pipedream doesn't have them doing that
until 2010. They knew, in their heart of hearts, that it would be a
coup even to survive their group.
</P>
<P>
   What they wanted to show here was that 1994 had not been an
illusion, that their results since then _ victories over Mexico and
Nigeria and Argentina and Brazil and Austria _ showed that the US
had evolved from the college all-star side that got a harsh lesson
in the global grad school eight years ago. That they had developed
a tactical sophistication, that they had learned how to impose
their game on a rival, that they knew how to get whatever result
they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to show that we'd improved,'' said Ramos, who was
playing in his third Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did not show that against the Germans, when they
came out on tentative tiptoes and were knocked back on their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed them too much respect in the first half,'' Sampson
said. ``The Germans were ripe for the taking.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Americans imposed themselves on the Iranians from the
first minute, and got everything but the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans had bad luck,'' said Miljan Miljanic, president
of the Yugoslav football federation.Monday ``They should have won
the match.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the should-have/could-haves were done, what the world
saw was that the Americans had lost to a team that hadn't been to
the dance in 20 years, had never won a Cup match, and needed a
miracle to get here. Unless you can win matches when the world is
watching, the world doesn't want to hear about your improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to leave here at least winning one game,'' said
Ramos, who is 1-7-1 in his Cup career. ``But it's going to be
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslavs, who were banned from the last tournament, are
very much alive and need at least a draw to advance. And they've
seen enough American horror flicks to know that you must kill a
zombie twice.

SAVARESE GETS A RUNNING START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While preparing for Thursday night's showdown with former
heavyweight champion Buster Douglas, Lou Savarese decided that in
the long run it was best to go for a short run.
</P>
<P>
   On the run is not exactly where you'd expect to find a
power-punching knockout artist from Long Island, but after two
straight defeats, Savarese understood he needed to do something to
energize his suddenly flagging career. Before he would visit
Douglas, he decided, he would visit Tim Hallmark, the fitness
fanatic who helped redirect the fortunes of the most successful
heavyweight of this era, Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   What came from that was a new approach to an old boxing wives'
tale. At Hallmark's insistence, Savarese went for a run, but not
the kind you see in the movies. No hooded sweatshirt pulled over
his head, no neck bowed against the chilly morning air, no feet
shuffling along a country road for miles as his trainer rides
alongside in a slow-moving Caddy with a cigar clamped in his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   These are high-speed, high-tech times, so Savarese has taken a
high-speed, high-tech approach to perhaps the oldest sport known to
man. To fight for long, it was decided, first you had to run short.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run a lot, at least 6 miles a day, five days a
week,'' Savarese recalled after finishing a recent day of sparring
and sprinting in Houston. ``But Tim's not big on long runs. Now I
only run three times a week, with the longest run maybe 3 miles.
There's a lot less long running and more sprint work. It's called
peak-and-valley training. It's designed to get your heartbeat up.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it will be up Thursday night in the Bingo Hall at
Foxwoods, where Savarese and Douglas will fight for a minor title
and their futures. The winner will leave with the little-known
International Boxing Association heavyweight championship, a title
that is vacant for a good reason.
</P>
<P>
   It is vacant for lack of interest, a trend that is very likely
to continue once it's occupied.
</P>
<P>
   So the title itself is not the aim for Savarese, just as a short
sprint championship is not the aim of his form of training. Both
are designed to serve a larger purpose. They are to be used to
resurrect a once-burgeoning career that came to a halt the night it
ran up against George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened to a lot of fighters, so this is nothing new.
But what followed their meeting last April _ a disappointing
split-decision defeat for the previously unbeaten Savarese (with
judges' cards that ranged from Savarese winning, 114-113, to
Foreman winning, 122-115 _ was a stunning fifth-round stoppage five
months later that no one could have predicted.
</P>
<P>
   That night, unheralded David Izon (20-2) blasted out Savarese in
a fashion that cried out for change and hinted at Post-Traumatic
George Disorder. It was the kind of shock that either ends your
career or alters it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it was a lucky punch, but he beat me and that's
it,'' said Savarese (36-2, 20 KOs). ``I was coming off the Foreman
fight, and looking back I could see I should have been busier in
the last rounds in that fight, but mentally and physically I got
dejected after they took a point away from me late. That was my
only regret in that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it, I thought I was going to fight Shannon Briggs, and
when they changed to Izon at the last minute, I was mentally let
down again. I thought I'd just knock Izon out.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not a totally unreasonable assumption, but assumptions
can get you in trouble in boxing, and so can big guys like Izon if
they hit you right. He did, which led Savarese to Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen for a reason,'' Savarese said. ``I don't get
Buster if I won those fights. This is a great opportunity I don't
get if I'm 38-0 with a win over George.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what this fight is for me. It's everything. I don't
want to be a journeyman. It's not like the old days when guys were
fighting all the time. Now there's such a stigma to not being
undefeated, but what are you gonna do? It's why so many guys are
hand-picked (opponents).
</P>
<P>
   ``But after a loss you can do three things. You can quit. You
can do the same things. Or you can correct your mistakes. After I
lost to Izon, I hired Tim.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark changed Savarese's diet, actually adding food to it,
and changed his running approach. The result is an additional 8
pounds with a reduction in body fat to about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for me,'' Savarese said. ``I've
watched the Douglas-(Mike) Tyson fight a dozen times. I've watched
some of his later fights, too, and he still puts his punches
together great. If he dictates the pace, he's great because of that
jab and what he can throw behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to go after this guy. You can't stay at the end
of his jab. You gotta beat his jab. He sets everything up with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese will thus take a run at Douglas the same way he trained
for him. He'll come out hard and fast, fighting in spurts.
Sprinting, not jogging, to get back into the pack of heavyweights
pursuing Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running I've been doing is sport-specific for the first
time and it's really helped my conditioning,'' Savarese said. ``It
makes sense. How often do you go at the same heart rate for a
half-hour in boxing? A guy's not going to let you just plod along
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Savarese doesn't intend to allow Douglas to plod
along. His plan is to run for it, something he's been doing for
seven long weeks in the Texas heat. In the long run, Savarese is
hoping that route will be a short cut to a title nobody wants and
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight will be decided by conditioning,'' Savarese
postulated. ``I'm in the best condition of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to say anything more to make his point. In his
mind, he's on the move again. Off and running.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how the heavyweight division is today,'' he said. ``A
day is a year in this division. You win a fight like this, you're
right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back on the short list.

 By MICHAEL WINERIP  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting
room, that something hot was for sale and a lot was at stake.
 &HT;    A dozen eager company reps _ stylish young men and women of all
races and backgrounds _ stood behind two long tables with slick
brochures and stacks of applications in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    There were balloons and potted plants everywhere, cookies,
pastries, coffee, juices and soft drinks, a room nearby to park the
children.
 &HT;    By the time Kathleen Madigan, Ed.D, began her pitch on this
April night, it was standing room only, more than 300 Jersey City
parents. One father in the audience, Robert Silberman, was struck
by how much the meeting felt like a sales presentation at the
telecommunications company where he works, while others remarked on
the speaker's evangelical tone.
 &HT;    But what was being offered was neither cell phones nor God's
salvation. The offering to this heavily minority audience in one of
the poorest school districts in New Jersey was a free, publicly
financed education for their children at a new charter school to be
opened in September by Advantage Schools Inc., a Boston-based,
for-profit company with schools in Phoenix and Rocky Mount, N.C.
 &HT;    ``As we speak,'' began Madigan, Advantage's curriculum director,
``I have kindergartners in Phoenix and North Carolina who can tell
you the three phases of matter! ... I have 5-year-olds in North
Carolina who know where the prime meridian is! ... We have 200
instructional days, 20 more than the public schools! ... We go from
8 in the morning until 3:30 in the afternoon! Eight in the morning
until 3:30! ... We will have a phenomenal staff to make this a
reality. We get to choose our teachers ... We don't say it's the
child's fault, or they didn't have a good breakfast, or they came
from this kind of family.
 &HT;    ``This is how they're taught to walk down the hall,'' she said,
marching, her hands folded in front of her.
 &HT;    For an hour those parents sat, rapt, listening to one remarkable
story after another. She told them how Advantage ran a
direct-instruction school stressing basics, with teachers using
daily scripts to drill students. She showed them videos of young
black boys reading.
 &HT;    ``Our children on third level are reading the `Iliad'; in fifth
grade they read Homer's 'Odyssey.' ... Most children don't like to
rewrite. Oh no? Our children say, 'Give me one more chance! ... No
child will fall through the cracks in our school.''
 &HT;    And then she made an irresistible claim: ``Every single one of
our kindergartners in both schools is reading! Every single one! I
don't get up here and say it unless it's true.''
 &HT;    Kimlee Acosta, an employment agency worker and mother of two
boys in the public schools, was sold. She found a pay phone and
called her friend Christine Litaker, who was still at work. ``You
got to get down here,'' Acosta said. ``It's freakin' great! They're
going to start school at 8; they go to 3:30! My kids start school
at freakin' quarter to 9.''
 &HT;    India Sloane, a home health aide with a daughter entering
kindergarten, thought it sounded better than her local public
school. ``I'm going to apply her for this school,'' she said. ``It
have good qualifications for, you know, a child.''
 &HT;    That night, hundreds of Jersey City parents signed up their
children for a school that didn't have even a building or location
yet, run by a company whose entire track record is two schools,
each in existence for less than a year. The parents were willing to
take the plunge because while they didn't know fully what they were
getting into, they knew they weren't pleased with what their
children had.
 &HT;    Still, not everyone was converted. While Silberman liked it, his
wife Karen thought it sounded militaristic. ``I guess we're having
a disagreement,'' she said. And Sandra Oviedo has a son who's
having problems with math in a school that uses a similar method.
``It's not magic,'' she said.
 &HT;    Even many parents eagerly signing on the dotted line were
wondering if there really could be such a miraculous urban public
school where every kindergartner reads.
 -0- 
 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke
out; the lunchroom was in chaos.
 &HT;    The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes,
but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere _
whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a
better public school _ that at P.S. 39 average class size is
actually small, 21.
 &HT;    At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl
named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and
fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days.
There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying.
 &HT;    Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to
handle her daughter either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be
signing up her five children (three of them in special education)
for a charter. She had never heard of charters. ``I don't know too
much about them,'' she says.
 &HT;    This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39,
Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the
personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and
it enrages the teacher of the year.
 &HT;    ``If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off
to charter schools, God bless them _ let them go if it gives them
better lives,'' she says. ``But that makes us like a prison. We'll
be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School.''
 &HT;    The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't
work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue
projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City
children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if
that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and
schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded.
Those schools, which also have the top test scores, such as P.S.
27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 students in first grade. And
Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of
the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's
public schools (''They're a failure,'' he said), is not much help.
 &HT;    While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City
schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from
$91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently
used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not
for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied
by charter schools. This diversion of resources is public
educators' worst fear.
 &HT;    Yet the school-choice debate is most importantly about how to
design an effective public system to educate poor children, as
Meier, the progressive educator, argues in ``The Power of Their
Ideas.'' The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always
enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they
can choose a private school or move to a suburb.
 &HT;    Indeed, in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of white ethnic Jersey
City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey
City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly
minority children _ a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and
African-Americans (41 percent), along with immigrants.
 &HT;    In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and
still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing
system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since
1996, when the Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won
passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to
Trenton.
 &HT;    Jersey City's Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate.
He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old
Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation
as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent
years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by
Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the
mainstream.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration, always quick to jump on a popular
Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to
charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
 &HT;    But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in
Jersey City. Significantly, after nine years of state takeover
there, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results
for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most
middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the
top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is
at the bottom.
 &HT;    And there is considerable correlation: The more free lunches,
the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools such as P.S.
16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in
this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in
their homelands.
 &HT;    When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 _ a
predominantly African-American school with many second-generation
welfare families _ the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward
Adu Jr.
 &HT;    Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from
Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted
to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school.
 &HT;    In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended
a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English
and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows
little of America beyond P.S. 39. While he has stood on Jersey
City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's
skyscrapers, he has never visited there.
 &HT;    When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, ``It
seems the schools in Africa are better than here.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It was easy to tell right away, walking into the large meeting

 &HT;    This is the cutting edge of the school-choice movement, and it
is stunning to behold because it is so radically different from
what has come before in public education, and at the same time so
much in sync with this era, when the free market is entrusted to
deliver the best public-policy choices for us all.
 &HT;    In the new education marketplace, public schools are expected to
sell themselves aggressively, and the burden of figuring out what
is real and what is hype falls not on regulators or district
bureaucrats or boards of education but on parents. During the
question period at that April meeting, Carlos Garcia asked what
kind of guarantees went with all the company's promises.
 &HT;    ``What happens if my child does fall by the wayside?'' Garcia
asked. ``I'm having that now, in another charter school.''
 &HT;    ``You're asking what recourse you have if we don't do what we
say,'' Madigan responded. ``I don't have a good answer for you. If
this school doesn't do it, you tell other people and we don't keep
in business.''
 &HT;    In short: Let the buyer beware.
 &HT;    Each new school year brings more charters, and that in turn is
pressuring public schools to sell themselves harder. Since 1991,
when Minnesota passed the first charter legislation, 32 other
states, including New Jersey (but not New York), have followed
suit. There are currently 786 charter schools in America, with 400
to 500 more expected this fall.
 &HT;    They tend to be in big cities, but exist in suburbs and rural
areas too, varying enormously in philosophy and quality. While most
are run on a nonprofit basis, started by parents and educators,
there are also about a dozen for-profit charter companies,
including Edison, the best known, which will have 48 schools by
fall, and Advantage, which will have 7 or 8.
 &HT;    The movement has attracted support across the spectrum, from
conservative businessmen like Steven Wilson, a founder of
Advantage, to liberal public educators like Deborah Meier, who
created the widely admired Central Park East public school in
Harlem in the 1970s and recently started her own charter in Boston.
 &HT;    In Jersey City alone _ where six charters have been approved _
there is one started by white yuppies and one by the Urban League.
There are charters that stress basics, and there is the Learning
Community charter, which uses the Bank Street model and has a
principal who warns parents that there will be little homework and
no textbooks. When Kiwan Fitch is asked what she likes about that
charter, she mentions the time her kindergartner, Brandon,
dissected a fish.
 &HT;    Anyone in New Jersey who wants to start one _ parents, teachers,
professors, businesspeople _ submits a plan to the state. If the
state approves, then that plan _ the charter _ becomes the
blueprint for the school. A charter school is free and open to any
child who lives within the public-school district where the charter
school is located. Typically, too many children want to attend and
a lottery is held.
 &HT;    Financing is all tax dollars, and that is where the competition
comes in, where things turn nasty. Nearly every dollar that goes to
a charter is subtracted from that district's public schools.
 &HT;    Jersey City public schools currently receive about $7,000 from
the state and city for each child educated. When a charter opens,
it receives most of that $7,000 per child enrolled and the public
school loses that $7,000 per child.
 &HT;    So Advantage's charter, with 500 students, would receive close
to $3.5 million in public funds that would have otherwise gone to
Jersey City public schools. The numbers make it easy to understand
the hard sell at that April meeting. Every family could bring in at
least $7,000 to Advantage Schools Inc.; Acosta's two sons were
worth a cool $14,000.
 &HT;    Nor are public-school districts sitting by quietly as their
funds and motivated students are skimmed off. Of 23 new charters
approved this year in New Jersey, 14 faced legal challenges, most
claiming they were an unfair economic drain.
 &HT;    Supporters of school choice say that rather than being hurt,
good public schools will rise to the market challenge and improve.
And you can see some of that in Jersey City, at schools such as
P.S.16, where the principal and parents are also out selling their
school hard. Fortunately, P.S. 16 has lots to sell: It's a small
school in a handsome old building in a gentrifying neighborhood of
brownstones, with a poor yet upwardly mobile immigrant population
whose children have some of the city's best test scores.
 &HT;    The problem with school choice is what happens to schools that
have nothing to sell, schools left behind after the most-motivated
families have made their choices and moved on.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is widely regarded as Jersey City's worst elementary
school, a large, dark building at the end of a dead-end street
surrounded by a 25-foot-high chain-link fence that makes it look
like Riker's Island. The school has the city's lowest test scores
and the most poor children, 94 percent qualifying for free lunches,
many living on welfare in the Duncan Avenue projects. Midyear, the
principal resigned. The week I visited, fights frequently broke
out; the lunchroom was in chaos.
 &HT;    The stereotype of bad inner-city schools is overcrowded classes,
but so many parents work hard to get their children elsewhere _
whether a charter, a Catholic school or, by using a fake address, a
better public school _ that at P.S. 39 average class size is
actually small, 21.
 &HT;    At P.S. 39, in Laurie Ralph's third grade this year, a girl
named Fathema often screamed, rolled on the floor like a dog and
fought, making it impossible to accomplish anything some days.
There were times the veteran teacher broke down crying.
 &HT;    Fathema's mother, Peggy Smith, 30, says she doesn't know how to
handle her daughter either. One thing is certain: Smith won't be
signing up her five children (three of them in special education)
for a charter. She had never heard of charters. ``I don't know too
much about them,'' she says.
 &HT;    This year's Jersey City Teacher of the Year is from P.S. 39,
Jerri O'Brien-Cass. She works long hours and learns about the
personal problems her third graders face at home so she can help
them better. For one boy who can't read and is failing, she sent
home 17 notes requesting a parent conference _ with no response.
 &HT;    P.S. 39 is on the losing side of the school-choice debate, and
it enrages the teacher of the year.
 &HT;    ``If my best students, my Schnelle and my Phillip, are going off
to charter schools, God bless them _ let them go if it gives them
better lives,'' she says. ``But that makes us like a prison. We'll
be the Last Stop Incarceration Public School.''
 &HT;    The answer from school choicers would be if P.S. 39 doesn't
work, get rid of it and let the children of the Duncan Avenue
projects choose among the city's best schools. In fact, Jersey City
children can leave their neighborhood school and pick another if
that other school's principal signs a waiver saying there is room.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, most Jersey City schools are overcrowded, and
schools in the more upscale neighborhoods are the most overcrowded.
Those schools, which also have the top test scores, such as P.S.
27, P.S. 38 and P.S. 6, average 30 students in first grade. And
Jersey City's mayor, Bret Schundler, who is a national leader of
the school-choice movement and regularly disparages his city's
public schools (''They're a failure,'' he said), is not much help.
 &HT;    While the state has tripled its annual aid to Jersey City
schools in the last decade, the city's contribution has shrunk from
$91 million in 1990 to $72 million this year. Schundler recently
used his political clout ($34 million in city bonding power) not
for public schools but to finance six new buildings to be occupied
by charter schools. This diversion of resources is public
educators' worst fear.
 &HT;    Yet the school-choice debate is most importantly about how to
design an effective public system to educate poor children, as
Meier, the progressive educator, argues in ``The Power of Their
Ideas.'' The middle and upper classes, she points out, have always
enjoyed school choice. If they don't like their public school, they
can choose a private school or move to a suburb.
 &HT;    Indeed, in the 1960s and '70s, thousands of white ethnic Jersey
City families exercised choice by moving to suburbia. Today, Jersey
City, the state's second largest district, has 32,000 mainly
minority children _ a mix of Hispanics (38 percent) and
African-Americans (41 percent), along with immigrants.
 &HT;    In 1989, the state took over Jersey City's public schools and
still controls them, the longest-running takeover of a failing
system in the nation. Of 39 charters approved in New Jersey since
1996, when the Republican governor, Christine Todd Whitman, won
passage of enabling legislation, Jersey City has 6, second only to
Trenton.
 &HT;    Jersey City's Schundler has been a vocal school-choice advocate.
He is a popular Republican in a Democratic city, a 39-year-old
Harvard-educated bond salesman turned politician with a reputation
as an urban reformer. The shift in Schundler's focus in recent
years from vouchers to charters reflects a national switch by
Republicans that has helped bring the choice movement into the
mainstream.
 &HT;    The Clinton administration, always quick to jump on a popular
Republican idea, has been giving grants of up to $100,000 to
charters to hire community outreach staffs to attract students.
 &HT;    But even in the glow of newness, problems have surfaced in
Jersey City. Significantly, after nine years of state takeover
there, with all the innovations, if you look at the test results
for the 27 elementary schools, the school with the most
middle-class kids, P.S. 27 (63 percent free lunches), is at the
top, and the poorest school, P.S. 39 (94 percent free lunches), is
at the bottom.
 &HT;    And there is considerable correlation: The more free lunches,
the lower the test scores. The exceptions are schools such as P.S.
16 (84 percent free lunches) dominated by immigrants. While poor in
this country, they often came from middle-class backgrounds in
their homelands.
 &HT;    When I asked to meet a top eighth grader at P.S. 39 _ a
predominantly African-American school with many second-generation
welfare families _ the guidance counselor introduced me to Edward
Adu Jr.
 &HT;    Edward's family immigrated to Jersey City two years ago from
Africa. He is the P.S. 39 valedictorian and the only child accepted
to attend Academic High next year, Jersey City's elite high school.
 &HT;    In Ghana, his father was a skilled mechanic, and Edward attended
a private school where he took 13 subjects a day, learning English
and several other languages on top of his native Twi. He knows
little of America beyond P.S. 39. While he has stood on Jersey
City's docks and looked across the Hudson to Manhattan's
skyscrapers, he has never visited there.
 &HT;    When asked what has surprised him about America, he says, ``It
seems the schools in Africa are better than here.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``One of the neat things about being a commander,'' says Lt.
Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., ``is when you take rookies into space and
you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in
orbit. You never forget that.''
 &HT;    In October, if all goes as planned, Brown will fly his fifth
shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look,
not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory.
 &HT;    If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before
Ronald Reagan became president, he would have been 77, the age John
Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to
understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more
piece of math: We are now further away in time from Glenn's first
mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across
the Atlantic.
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch.
 &HT;    The record store down the street from the possibly segregated
hotel had yet to stock a Beatles album. Had the astronaut possessed
a more powerful periscope than he did, he still could not have
picked out a St. Louis arch or a World Trade Center to serve as a
guidepost below.
 &HT;    Not even Telstar, the early communications satellite, was in the
heavens to block his path. The capsule's progress through the skies
was relayed by teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride.
 &HT;    When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there was actual
ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A middle-age visitor to John Glenn's Senate office - one who
remembers Feb. 20, 1962, as a 10-year-old, and whose
elementary-school autograph book still bears the entry ``My hero is
John Glenn'' on a prefatory page _ finds it difficult even to ask
the question, Is this shuttle flight perhaps a reward for the
senator's unexpectedly partisan behavior during last year's
campaign-finance hearings?
 &HT;    After all, Bill Clinton is not without a say in NASA affairs,
and more than one observer saw Glenn acting as ``White House
defense counsel'' against the probings of Sen. Fred Thompson and
the Republican majority.
 &HT;    ``It's not true,'' Glenn says. ``I had not one single
conversation with the president or the vice president or any of the
people from the White House.'' The idea of sending an older person
into space has so much scientific validity that ``even if I wasn't
involved, I would be backing that,'' he insists, adding that he
would urge that they ``send somebody else.''
 &HT;    For all its public-relations value to NASA _ this is the biggest
manned-space story in years _ Glenn sticks resolutely to
medical-research terms in discussing his mission's origin and
meaning. His wife Annie says that ``he's always wanted to go'' back
into space.
 &HT;    But after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his own interest, and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    For 10 weightless days, Glenn will subject himself to a marathon
of geriatric experimentation. He will take pills to measure his
protein production, receive injections to calibrate the atrophy of
muscle and swallow miniature thermometers to help measure
temperature fluctuations during sleep.
 &HT;    He gives every sign of approaching these tests with the same
studiousness he exhibited toward all the esoteric physical
humiliations (the feet-in-ice-water test, for example) that
accompanied the first astronaut selections at the Wright Air
Development Center in Ohio 40 years ago.
 &HT;    His quick, soft speech betrays no diminished alertness. It is
only when you walk behind him, or fix your gaze on his right eye,
slightly more hooded than the left, that you can credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70.
 &HT;    It's a good thing he is, too, or he might not have got his new
assignment. Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in
1997 at age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of
Glenn's going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the
space program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went
into politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    When asked about Glenn's impending return to space, his close
Project Mercury friend Scott Carpenter, a lean and very fit 73,
smiles and says: ''I told him I'm going to be his backup again. And
this time he's going to come down with something.''
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition.
 &HT;    ``If World War II hadn't come along,'' Annie Glenn says, ``he
was either going to be a medical doctor or go into medical
research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way, comes his
chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings; some 1960's rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case.
 &HT;    When most of the Original Seven (Glenn was the oldest) were
flying their missions, the center was still under construction for
space personnel being transferred from Langley Research Center in
Virginia.
 &HT;    The new seven among whom Glenn spends time these days are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``They're better educated, and they're deeper into science.''
They're certainly a more diverse lot than the brush-cut,
all-Protestant test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along
with Pedro Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the
STS-95 crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years
ago became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out from the six other astronauts _ famously
raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men thought
they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is doing his
best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's ``John,''
not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    On a Friday afternoon in April, wearing the same blue knit shirt
as everyone else, he sits down at a conference-room table and, when
a visitor starts asking questions, easily defers to Brown.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago, and Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    With his busy senatorial schedule, Glenn will be in Houston for
some long weekends, spent 10 days there around Memorial Day and
will spend another 10 there around the Fourth of July, the whole
month of August and then most of the five or six weeks before the
flight.
 &HT;    Christopher Kraft, the retired but still no-nonsense flight
director of Project Mercury, who counts Glenn a close friend, says
that with all his obligations, Glenn's problem now is time: ``He
doesn't want to make a fool of himself. He's got to spend enough
time on it to know what the emergency procedures are.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, even if Discovery goes through a fraction of the
catastrophes that controllers keep simulating for Brown and his
cockpit crew, Glenn won't be part of the emergency improvisations.
In fact, he won't be on the flight deck at all. He'll be below, on
Discovery's middeck.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that it
is already being fitted with, and he knows that 10 days of
weightlessness, some of it free-floating, may induce not only a
loss of muscle and bone but also nausea _ certainly more of it than
he ever had the chance to experience during five hours strapped
into the seat of Friendship 7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return only adds to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral are already booked solid
for Oct. 29, and Brown, who says his mother usually greets his
mission assignments with quiet resignation, got a very different
reaction when he telephoned in February to tell her about this one:
``Is that the flight with Senator Glenn on it?''
 &HT;    ``Well, yeah.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, great!''
 &HT;    Whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's flight will also
begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the movement of
civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger, the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''
 &HT;    This fall, when the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the
science and public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the
shuttle's rocket boosters. This is especially so for the minority
of Americans old enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those
oldest citizens whose physical needs are the official justification
for Glenn's place on the flight.
 &HT;    At launch, emotion will trump all the mission's other meanings,
and anyone who has made the last 36 trips around the Sun with Glenn
will care about this aging astronaut for the same reason we cared
about Everest and the Moon: because he's there.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``One of the neat things about being a commander,'' says Lt.
Col. Curtis L. Brown Jr., ``is when you take rookies into space and
you see their face after the main engine shutdown and you're in
orbit. You never forget that.''
 &HT;    In October, if all goes as planned, Brown will fly his fifth
shuttle mission with one crew member who may have that same look,
not from the novelty of the experience but from distant memory.
 &HT;    If Charles Lindbergh had climbed into a cockpit two years before
Ronald Reagan became president, he would have been 77, the age John
Glenn will be when he makes his second spaceflight. Indeed, to
understand the peculiarity of this flight, it helps to do one more
piece of math: We are now further away in time from Glenn's first
mission than that mission was from Lindbergh's solo flight across
the Atlantic.
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch.
 &HT;    The record store down the street from the possibly segregated
hotel had yet to stock a Beatles album. Had the astronaut possessed
a more powerful periscope than he did, he still could not have
picked out a St. Louis arch or a World Trade Center to serve as a
guidepost below.
 &HT;    Not even Telstar, the early communications satellite, was in the
heavens to block his path. The capsule's progress through the skies
was relayed by teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride.
 &HT;    When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there was actual
ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 -0- 
 &HT;    A middle-age visitor to John Glenn's Senate office - one who
remembers Feb. 20, 1962, as a 10-year-old, and whose
elementary-school autograph book still bears the entry ``My hero is
John Glenn'' on a prefatory page _ finds it difficult even to ask
the question, Is this shuttle flight perhaps a reward for the
senator's unexpectedly partisan behavior during last year's
campaign-finance hearings?
 &HT;    After all, Bill Clinton is not without a say in NASA affairs,
and more than one observer saw Glenn acting as ``White House
defense counsel'' against the probings of Sen. Fred Thompson and
the Republican majority.
 &HT;    ``It's not true,'' Glenn says. ``I had not one single
conversation with the president or the vice president or any of the
people from the White House.'' The idea of sending an older person
into space has so much scientific validity that ``even if I wasn't
involved, I would be backing that,'' he insists, adding that he
would urge that they ``send somebody else.''
 &HT;    For all its public-relations value to NASA _ this is the biggest
manned-space story in years _ Glenn sticks resolutely to
medical-research terms in discussing his mission's origin and
meaning. His wife Annie says that ``he's always wanted to go'' back
into space.
 &HT;    But after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his own interest, and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    For 10 weightless days, Glenn will subject himself to a marathon
of geriatric experimentation. He will take pills to measure his
protein production, receive injections to calibrate the atrophy of
muscle and swallow miniature thermometers to help measure
temperature fluctuations during sleep.
 &HT;    He gives every sign of approaching these tests with the same
studiousness he exhibited toward all the esoteric physical
humiliations (the feet-in-ice-water test, for example) that
accompanied the first astronaut selections at the Wright Air
Development Center in Ohio 40 years ago.
 &HT;    His quick, soft speech betrays no diminished alertness. It is
only when you walk behind him, or fix your gaze on his right eye,
slightly more hooded than the left, that you can credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70.
 &HT;    It's a good thing he is, too, or he might not have got his new
assignment. Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in
1997 at age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of
Glenn's going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the
space program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went
into politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    When asked about Glenn's impending return to space, his close
Project Mercury friend Scott Carpenter, a lean and very fit 73,
smiles and says: ''I told him I'm going to be his backup again. And
this time he's going to come down with something.''
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition.
 &HT;    ``If World War II hadn't come along,'' Annie Glenn says, ``he
was either going to be a medical doctor or go into medical
research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way, comes his
chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings; some 1960's rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case.
 &HT;    When most of the Original Seven (Glenn was the oldest) were
flying their missions, the center was still under construction for
space personnel being transferred from Langley Research Center in
Virginia.
 &HT;    The new seven among whom Glenn spends time these days are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``They're better educated, and they're deeper into science.''
They're certainly a more diverse lot than the brush-cut,
all-Protestant test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along
with Pedro Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the
STS-95 crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years
ago became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out from the six other astronauts _ famously
raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men thought
they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is doing his
best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's ``John,''
not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    On a Friday afternoon in April, wearing the same blue knit shirt
as everyone else, he sits down at a conference-room table and, when
a visitor starts asking questions, easily defers to Brown.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago, and Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    With his busy senatorial schedule, Glenn will be in Houston for
some long weekends, spent 10 days there around Memorial Day and
will spend another 10 there around the Fourth of July, the whole
month of August and then most of the five or six weeks before the
flight.
 &HT;    Christopher Kraft, the retired but still no-nonsense flight
director of Project Mercury, who counts Glenn a close friend, says
that with all his obligations, Glenn's problem now is time: ``He
doesn't want to make a fool of himself. He's got to spend enough
time on it to know what the emergency procedures are.''
 &HT;    Nevertheless, even if Discovery goes through a fraction of the
catastrophes that controllers keep simulating for Brown and his
cockpit crew, Glenn won't be part of the emergency improvisations.
In fact, he won't be on the flight deck at all. He'll be below, on
Discovery's middeck.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that it
is already being fitted with, and he knows that 10 days of
weightlessness, some of it free-floating, may induce not only a
loss of muscle and bone but also nausea _ certainly more of it than
he ever had the chance to experience during five hours strapped
into the seat of Friendship 7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return only adds to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral are already booked solid
for Oct. 29, and Brown, who says his mother usually greets his
mission assignments with quiet resignation, got a very different
reaction when he telephoned in February to tell her about this one:
``Is that the flight with Senator Glenn on it?''
 &HT;    ``Well, yeah.''
 &HT;    ``Oh, great!''
 &HT;    Whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's flight will also
begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the movement of
civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger, the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''
 &HT;    This fall, when the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the
science and public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the
shuttle's rocket boosters. This is especially so for the minority
of Americans old enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those
oldest citizens whose physical needs are the official justification
for Glenn's place on the flight.
 &HT;    At launch, emotion will trump all the mission's other meanings,
and anyone who has made the last 36 trips around the Sun with Glenn
will care about this aging astronaut for the same reason we cared
about Everest and the Moon: because he's there.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Pretend for a minute that you're an alien, sent to Earth to
assess its suitability for takeover.
 &HT;    Right away you'd notice that the black earthlings and the white
earthlings tend to live apart; that they both worship particularly
large earthlings in open-air stadiums and that earthlings residing
outside the crowded urban centers broil sacrificial meats on little
outdoor altars.
 &HT;    Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant
things _ Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as
the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and
ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are
clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie
dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders
(many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into
their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie
whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and
for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while
contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations
with ... aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate
fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling
systems!
 &HT;    In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too
late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.
 &HT;    Such a weekly visitation does in fact take place in 90-odd
countries all over the globe. The force behind it is the Fox-TV
network and the producers of ``The X-Files.'' In five seasons, this
offbeat sci-fi series has more than doubled its ratings, and is now
watched by almost 20 million households (making it television's
third most popular drama), not counting those who also tune in to
the nightly reruns of old episodes.
 &HT;    But mere television-watching isn't the half of it. As Andy
Meisler, author of Volume 3 of ``The Official Guide to the
X-Files,'' one of a half-dozen or so reference books spawned by the
show, has said, ``You sometimes get the feeling that the actual
show is just an excuse for all the other stuff.''
 &HT;    The other stuff is the stuff that cults are made of. There are
now more than a thousand Web sites devoted to ``The X-Files,'' many
of them emitting the ozone whiff of spaciness that pervades the
show _ which is essentially about a shadowy department of the FBI
devoted to investigating extraterrestrials and paranormal
occurrences.
 &HT;    Among the sites are dozens specializing in ``fan fiction'' _
short stories that invent new plots and scenes for the show's two
main characters, the FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder _ and
even a feverish subgroup preoccupied with getting these two, whose
relationship on screen is famously platonic, into bed together.
 &HT;    There is also a Web site that collects sound files from the show
that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning.
``Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?'' for example, in
reverse becomes: ``Sky of fruit baskets with the
8-year-little-old'' _ an unmistakable reference, if you go in for
this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in
one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
 &HT;    The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out
paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROMs, posters,
postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the
franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later
this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments
introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make
perfect sense to first-time viewers _ if there are any left.
 &HT;    For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files expo, a sort of roadshow
and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing
throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with
clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The
atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor
surrounding ``Star Trek'' and its many conventions and big-screen
spinoffs.
 &HT;    Yet unlike ``Star Trek,'' ``The X-Files'' has accomplished the
transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in
prime time _ it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or
rerun quaintness.
 &HT;    Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been
spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of ``The
X-Files,'' which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of
Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, ``Kolchak: The
Night Stalker.'' Much of the attention has centered on the
so-called ``mythology'' of ``The X-Files'' _ roughly a fifth of the
117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and
ever-evolving serial tale of UFOs, alien abduction, unsavory
biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up
at the very highest levels.
 &HT;    The secret of ``The X-Files,'' or so the argument goes, is that
the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our
post-modern Zeitgeist _ our fear of government and cancer (which
are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing
fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities.
 &HT;    The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: ``The show's
original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country _ if
not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin Wall
down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be
a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody
once said, there are no easy villains anymore.''
 &HT;    For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling
case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less
paranoid, especially about their own government. We're fearful
these days not so much of political plots as of random evil _ the
sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by
weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our
children even.
 &HT;    The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then
to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast
metaforce.
 &HT;    Rather than probing our deepest fears, ``The X-Files'' cleverly
reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia
without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to
all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything
exactly but they're pretty cool all the same.
 &HT;    If ``The X-Files'' is about anything, it's really about
nostalgia _ for a time (which may never have existed, really) when
a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe
that could be comprehended.
 &HT;    That the ``The X-Files'' culties themselves don't necessarily
believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I
caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. ``Please,'' one visitor to
the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he
believed in government conspiracies. ``Just look at what's going on
in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts
together sufficiently to accomplish anything?''
 &HT;    This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity
material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky _
airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like _ but the
Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a
windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to
gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal
exam.
 &HT;    For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and
a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's ``Twilight
Zone''-inspired ``X-Files'' theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe
items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless
sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your
picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''
and the televised Watergate hearings. We probably could have
guessed. ``The X-Files'' is in a way a melding of '70s politics and
special effects. Carter's genius has been to show us what paranoia
looks like, and it turns out to be the best-looking thing on
television. Rain-slicked blacktop, looming trees, lots of ice and
fog and mist.
 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are
revealed as much by how they look as by what they do. The better
the haberdashery (as in the case of Well-Manicured Man, as he's
known), the more heinous the deeds. They all have a faintly jowly,
Nixonian cast to them, come to think of it _ even the possibly
well-intentioned fellow known as Deep Throat.
 &HT;    And it should be noted that originally, the most creepy of them
all, the deeply vile Cigarette-Smoking Man, didn't speak. He didn't
need to. The sight of him taking a drag on one of his ever-present
Morley's, inhaling so deeply that his eyes squinted, and then
letting the smoke leak from the corner of his mouth in snaky
gray-blue tendrils, was proof enough of his cancerous soul.
 &HT;    He lit up for the first time, we discovered last year, in a
self-congratulatory moment after successfully engineering the
assassination of JFK. (He was also, not surprisingly, behind the
death of Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rodney King riots.) And
after kicking the habit for a while, he went back to the weed when
his attempt at making a legitimate go as a freelance writer, under
the nom de plume Raul Bloodworth, predictably came to naught.
 &HT;    What ``The X-Files'' really demonstrates, you might say, is what
the world would be like if global politics were more like office
politics, where the bad guys are always the suits, and if the
cosmic set designer had been the sort of person who watched a lot
of '70s television and read a lot of Whitley Strieber.
 &HT;    It's a darkly beautiful world, lighted by periodic explosions
and fireballs, where even the bees and the trees and the ground
underfoot may be less than benign, and it's a world that seems to
fairly thrum with energy, however unearthly, and possibility.
 &HT;    For all its hipness, though, ``The X-Files'' also has an
old-fashioned noirish quality. The gadgets are far from
cutting-edge, and the sci-fi elements _ flying saucers,
poltergeists, giant sewer-dwelling worms and the like _ are the
stuff of drive-in movies. The show transports us out of our
confused post-Cold War era to a time when the various ills of the
world come from somewhere else, and are so large and so pervasive
and so vague that they defy understanding.
 &HT;    In this mythic realm, conspiracies and government evildoing
become not the object of outrage, except among a chosen few, but
merely a fact of life, no more alterable than the weather.
 &HT;    If the world of ``the X-Files,'' with its all-encompassing
conspiracies, is strangely comforting, it is also enervating. Many
of the people you encounter literally have no wills of their own.
They respond robotically to signals received by mysterious bits of
metal implanted in their necks.
 &HT;    Others are animated not by passion, for the most part, but
simply by power or the quest for knowledge. Scully and Mulder
aren't just cool; they tend to operate at a lower emotional
temperature than any characters I can remember, either on
television or in movies and books.
 &HT;    It's not simply, as has so often been noted, that they have
shown no sexual interest in each other, Scully and Mulder don't
seem lastingly keen on anyone else either, and their relations with
everyone tend to be almost clinically flat and empty of affect.
Mulder is practically a zombie (Scully has lately, in response to a
cancer scare, manifested an occasional semblance of an inner life),
and he leaves us with the uncomfortable feeling that this is the
price that being a believer exacts.
 &HT;    It's a little like becoming an artist _ you have to give up
everything else. Think of the sexless, pasty-skinned Lone Gunmen,
the obsessive conspiracy theorists who turn up occasionally to
furnish Mulder with a crucial bit of microfilm: they seldom go out
except at night. This theme of loneliness and disconnection may be
the hidden message of ``The X-Files,'' in fact _ the show's real
secret: that true belief, of whatever sort, requires too much
self-surrender, and chances are that any belief will be mistaken
anyway.
 &HT;    The truth is not, as Mulder would have it, ``out there,'' but
rather right here, on our TV screens. ``The X-Files'' has taught us
that it's more entertaining, and probably more epistemologically
sound, to believe in everything and in nothing at all.

 By CHARLES McGRATH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Pretend for a minute that you're an alien, sent to Earth to
assess its suitability for takeover.
 &HT;    Right away you'd notice that the black earthlings and the white
earthlings tend to live apart; that they both worship particularly
large earthlings in open-air stadiums and that earthlings residing
outside the crowded urban centers broil sacrificial meats on little
outdoor altars.
 &HT;    Eventually you'd pick up on smaller, possibly more significant
things _ Sunday evening, for example, and how in many households as
the hour of 9 approaches, the eating utensils are quickly and
ceremoniously cleansed and stored and the younger offspring are
clothed in loose-fitting cotton garments and then made to lie
dormant in darkened chambers, while the elders and the proto-elders
(many of them adorned with bits of metal on their teeth) drift into
their communications centers, as if in answer to the eerie
whistling music now emanating from their cathode-ray scopes, and
for the next 60 minutes or so remain motionless, enraptured, while
contemplating images of other earthlings engaged in negotiations
with ... aliens just like you, with the same long spatulate
fingers, the same greenish ichor coursing through their cooling
systems!
 &HT;    In such a case, you'd probably conclude that you had arrived too
late, and that the earthlings had already been colonized.
 &HT;    Such a weekly visitation does in fact take place in 90-odd
countries all over the globe. The force behind it is the Fox-TV
network and the producers of ``The X-Files.'' In five seasons, this
offbeat sci-fi series has more than doubled its ratings, and is now
watched by almost 20 million households (making it television's
third most popular drama), not counting those who also tune in to
the nightly reruns of old episodes.
 &HT;    But mere television-watching isn't the half of it. As Andy
Meisler, author of Volume 3 of ``The Official Guide to the
X-Files,'' one of a half-dozen or so reference books spawned by the
show, has said, ``You sometimes get the feeling that the actual
show is just an excuse for all the other stuff.''
 &HT;    The other stuff is the stuff that cults are made of. There are
now more than a thousand Web sites devoted to ``The X-Files,'' many
of them emitting the ozone whiff of spaciness that pervades the
show _ which is essentially about a shadowy department of the FBI
devoted to investigating extraterrestrials and paranormal
occurrences.
 &HT;    Among the sites are dozens specializing in ``fan fiction'' _
short stories that invent new plots and scenes for the show's two
main characters, the FBI agents Dana Scully and Fox Mulder _ and
even a feverish subgroup preoccupied with getting these two, whose
relationship on screen is famously platonic, into bed together.
 &HT;    There is also a Web site that collects sound files from the show
that, when played backward, turn out to reveal hidden meaning.
``Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?'' for example, in
reverse becomes: ``Sky of fruit baskets with the
8-year-little-old'' _ an unmistakable reference, if you go in for
this sort of thing, to Mulder's younger sister, Samantha, who, in
one of the show's key events, is mysteriously abducted.
 &HT;    The show's creators, meanwhile, have not neglected to churn out
paperback novels, a series of young-adult books, CD-ROMs, posters,
postcards and assorted tchotchkes. And they hope to extend the
franchise still further with a feature-length film (opening later
this week) that will supposedly expand on plot developments
introduced in this season's last televised episode but also make
perfect sense to first-time viewers _ if there are any left.
 &HT;    For 13 weeks this spring, the X-Files expo, a sort of roadshow
and revival meeting, wended its way across the country, drawing
throngs of the faithful and, not incidentally, priming them with
clips from the film in a portable, Dolby-equipped theater. The
atmosphere was more than a little reminiscent of the fervor
surrounding ``Star Trek'' and its many conventions and big-screen
spinoffs.
 &HT;    Yet unlike ``Star Trek,'' ``The X-Files'' has accomplished the
transition to cultdom while the show itself is still being shown in
prime time _ it's a cult without any apparent tinge of campiness or
rerun quaintness.
 &HT;    Almost from the beginning, a good deal of critical ink has been
spilled in an effort to account for the popularity of ``The
X-Files,'' which began simply as a chiller in the tradition of
Darren McGavin's old supernatural detective story, ``Kolchak: The
Night Stalker.'' Much of the attention has centered on the
so-called ``mythology'' of ``The X-Files'' _ roughly a fifth of the
117 episodes so far, which constitute an intricate and
ever-evolving serial tale of UFOs, alien abduction, unsavory
biological experimentation and government conspiracy and cover-up
at the very highest levels.
 &HT;    The secret of ``The X-Files,'' or so the argument goes, is that
the mythology taps into the most authentically anxious parts of our
post-modern Zeitgeist _ our fear of government and cancer (which
are practically interchangeable), along with our ongoing
fascination with the notion of extraterrestrial entities.
 &HT;    The program's creator, Chris Carter, has said: ``The show's
original spirit has become kind of the spirit of the country _ if
not the world. There is a growing paranoia. With the Berlin Wall
down, with the global nuclear threat gone, with Russia trying to be
a market economy, there is a growing paranoia because, as somebody
once said, there are no easy villains anymore.''
 &HT;    For the very same reasons, however, you could make a compelling
case that at no time in recent years have Americans been less
paranoid, especially about their own government. We're fearful
these days not so much of political plots as of random evil _ the
sort of unpredictable violence perpetrated by rogue states, by
weapon-toting militias with only a handful of members, by our
children even.
 &HT;    The show touches on these threats, but only glancingly, and then
to suggest that they're really manifestations of some vast
metaforce.
 &HT;    Rather than probing our deepest fears, ``The X-Files'' cleverly
reintroduces into our lives something like the feeling of paranoia
without the content, a pleasantly creepy frisson that awakens us to
all those thready webs of coincidence; they don't mean anything
exactly but they're pretty cool all the same.
 &HT;    If ``The X-Files'' is about anything, it's really about
nostalgia _ for a time (which may never have existed, really) when
a belief in global conspiracy held out the promise of a universe
that could be comprehended.
 &HT;    That the ``The X-Files'' culties themselves don't necessarily
believe that life is one dark plot was reinforced for me when I
caught up to the X-Files Expo in Miami. ``Please,'' one visitor to
the expo, a middle-aged airline pilot, said when I asked him if he
believed in government conspiracies. ``Just look at what's going on
in Washington now. What makes you think they could get their acts
together sufficiently to accomplish anything?''
 &HT;    This was in April, at the expo's halfway point. The publicity
material had promised sites that were appropriately spooky _
airplane hangars, abandoned military bases and the like _ but the
Miami expo took place in the Coconut Grove Convention Center, a
windowless, nondescript hall that more often plays host to
gatherings of gun and knife sellers and people taking the postal
exam.
 &HT;    For atmosphere there was a dry-ice machine pumping out fog, and
a sound system loudly recycling Mark Snow's ``Twilight
Zone''-inspired ``X-Files'' theme song: woo woo woo woo WOO woo.
The exhibits consisted of a pretty skimpy prop museum (wardrobe
items mostly: Scully's trench coat, Mulder's sleeveless
sweatshirt), and a number of stations where you could have your
picture taken with a camera that supplied a digitalized background,
so that it looked as if you were sitting right in Mulder's basement
office, say, or standing on a lonely, spooky stretch of blacktop
and experiencing an interval of what the show calls ``lost time.''
 &HT;    I did encounter a couple of authentic weirdos at the Miami expo
_ a man in the autograph line, for example, carrying what looked to
be a fetus in a jar _ and I spoke to a University of Miami
undergrad who told me he was pretty sure that all the governments
in Europe had recognized the existence of extraterrestrials.
 &HT;    I also talked with a young man, a student at Miami Dade
Community College who was wearing a Hebrew-lettered ``X-Files'' cap
of his own design.
 &HT;    ``This is a show I can relate to,'' he told me. ``Sometimes I'll
just see an episode and I'll be saying, `That's me!' Like the
episode about the cockroaches _ anybody who knows my character
knows about me and cockroaches. I also see a lot of Mulder in me. I
used to think maybe I wanted to be a physicist _ that was when I
was watching `MacGyver' _ but now I think I might want to join the
FBI.''
 &HT;    Most of the crowd _ a preponderance of high-school and
college-age kids, but lots of grown-ups too _ was clean-cut and
normal-seeming. As far as I could make out, the chief
distinguishing characteristic of the expo attendees, the only thing
setting them apart from the rest of the citizenry, was their
detailed, encyclopedic knowledge of ``X-Files'' mythology.
 &HT;    They were extremely curious about the black oil, for example _
that strange toxic sludge that may just be the squeezings, in
effect, of the Tunguska meteorite, or may be a petroleum-based form
of shape-shifting alien intelligence. And many were alert to the
show's Sophoclean subtext _ the vexed question of Mulder's true
parentage.
 &HT;    In truth, the ``X-Files'' mythology, which has evolved
accidentally, and partly in response to real-life exigencies
(Scully's disappearance during Gillian Anderson's brief maternity
leave, for example), defies mastery. Not even the show's writers
fully understand it. The narrative momentum is as much backward as
it is forward, continually revisiting old themes _ Samantha's
disappearance, UFO sightings, government experiments with tissue
obtained from smallpox vaccinations _ and uncovering additional
layers of duplicity.
 &HT;    You can't even be sure any longer who's dead and who isn't. That
icepick-like device that used to dispatch unwelcome aliens, causing
gook to seep from behind their ears, seems in retrospect to have
worked only temporarily. The Cigarette-Smoking Man, fatally wounded
a couple of months ago and exiled to a shack in Quebec, is now back
in Washington, plying his evil trade.
 &HT;    The new movie, it is said, will tie up a great many loose
threads and resolve some longstanding difficulties, but let's not
hold our breath. The show's constant revisitation of its own
material makes the reruns as valuable and as timely as the new
programs.
 &HT;    And except for Mulder, no one is really interested in getting at
the heart of things anyway. The true ``X-Files'' conspiracy is not
about who will rule the world. It's conspiracy for its own sake _ a
Penelope-like web constantly unraveling and then reknitting itself
_ and for the sake of making an otherwise random universe seem much
more weird and interesting.
 &HT;    Chris Carter, who is 41 and who edited a surfing magazine before
getting into television, grew up in Southern California, and among
his formative experiences, he has said, were horror movies,
programs such as ``The Twilight Zone'' and ``The Night Stalker''

 &HT;    ``The X-Files'' spends more on production values than do most
other hourlong dramas, and spends it in particularly original and
inventive ways. It's darker, shadowier and filmed from more unusual
angles than most movies, let alone TV shows.
 &HT;    Even the villains, those nameless middle-age men who not only
manipulate our government but also in effect run the solar system
from a mysterious, dark-paneled club on West 46th Street (it looks
a lot like the Council on Foreign Relations, actually), are

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Jody Williams opened the door of her office and looked in at an
alarming scene.
 &HT;    Everything from the furniture to Rolodexes, Coke bottles, coffee
cups, and spoons was missing, and holes had been punched in the
walls and ceiling. It was November 1989, and rebel forces in El
Salvador had launched their most serious offensive on the capital
in 10 years of civil war.
 &HT;    Williams' San Salvador office at Medical Aid for El Salvador was
among several humanitarian agencies that were sacked and robbed.
 &HT;    Williams, an intense and determined Vermont native, had no doubt
about who was responsible for the looting. Government forces had
long suspected that humanitarian groups were sympathetic to the
rebel cause, and Williams believed they had used the rebel
offensive as an opportunity to search the offices for propaganda
and weapons. When the fighting in the capital eased, she drove to
the headquarters of the Salvadoran military's high command, a drab,
cement-block building atop a man-made hill, overlooking a
shantytown of cardboard shacks.
 &HT;    Escorted into a sparsely furnished room, she stood face to face
with six colonels in camouflage, the leaders of the armed forces in
El Salvador.
 &HT;    ``I remember clearly thinking that if they could kill me, then
and there, for what I represented or for what they believed I
represented, they would,'' Williams recalls.
 &HT;    Williams wanted restitution for the damages and a written
apology. She left without getting either, but a few days later, the
chief of staff of the Salvadoran defense forces, Col. Rene Emilio
Ponce, did the unthinkable: He wrote a letter of apology, in effect
admitting that the government had sacked the office and noting his
support for Medical Aid for El Salvador's work.
 &HT;    ``You have no idea how important that letter was to us,''
recalls Mario Velasquez, Williams' boss at Medical Aid. ``We used
to call it the Golden Letter. With this letter, we gained the
respect of the military, so they were no longer messing with us.''
No one else in El Salvador had the courage to confront the
colonels, Velasquez says. ``Jody Williams did.''
 &HT;    Since her days as a young girl, when she defended her deaf and
schizophrenic brother from the tin cans and taunts of neighborhood
kids, Williams has cast herself as a foe of bullies and a Lone
Ranger for peace.
 &HT;    For years, she toiled in obscurity: first, trying to alleviate
the suffering caused by the ``Reagan-Bush wars,'' as she called the
conflicts in the '80s in Central America; later, in the job that
would win her world renown, as a top organizer of an international
coalition dedicated to the elimination of land mines around the
world.
 &HT;    In six years, the coalition that Williams helped assemble grew
from a handful of humanitarian groups into a campaign that
encompassed more than 1,000 organizations. It enlisted the support
of mine victims and mine-clearance experts, peace and disarmament
groups, sympathetic politicians, diplomats, four-star generals and,
most famously, the late Princess Diana.
 &HT;    To recognize this extraordinary effort, the Nobel committee in
Oslo, Norway, bestowed its Peace Prize last year jointly on
Williams and on the coalition that she helped build, the
International Campaign to Ban Land Mines. Two months after the
prize announcement, 122 nations signed an international treaty in
Ottawa banning the production, sale and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
 &HT;    ``Jody acted as the nerve center of the campaign,'' says
Susannah Sirkin, of Physicians for Human Rights, in Boston, one of
the six founding organizations of the campaign. ``She was driven by
a single-minded focus to keep this thing going, literally staring
down those who would stand in the way.''
 &HT;    But the same character traits that catapulted the now
47-year-old Williams to Nobel glory _ her brashness, bluntness and
lone-wolf style of leadership _ have made her a lightning rod for
controversy.
 &HT;    She has been attacked in the press by former colleagues as an
imperious self-promoter and as an out-of-control employee who
hogged all of the credit and half of the prize money. She's been
accused of betraying the ideals of the land-mine campaign and
flouting the wishes of the campaign's steering committee by putting
herself forward for the peace prize.
 &HT;    At the center of this unhappy drama is Williams' rift with her
former employer, Robert O. Muller, the head of the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, the Washington, D.C.-based group that hired
her to coordinate the land-mine campaign. Muller, whom Williams had
at one time described as her best friend and mentor, fired Williams
three days before the prize was announced. The dismissal was the
culmination of months of mounting tension between the activists.
 &HT;    ``Jody is the ultimate loner,'' Muller says. ``You can only go
so far by yourself. That's part of the problem. She doesn't work
well at all with a team.''
 &HT;    Williams, lashing back, accuses her former colleagues of
jealousy and sexism, because, as she told one reporter, ``girls do
all the work, boys want the recognition.''
 &HT;    One of the unspoken commandments of humanitarian and peace work
is: Thou shalt not seek celebrity. And if fame comes, renounce it
quickly. Otherwise, beware thy colleagues' wrath.
 &HT;    U.N. mediator Ralph Bunche understood the importance of humility
when he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for his efforts
to bring an end to the war between Arabs and Jews in Palestine. ``I
am one man working for the United Nations,'' he said, firmly
rebuffing suggestions that he was a hero. ``Without the U.N., I am
nothing.''
 &HT;    Williams, critics say, has failed the Bunche test miserably.
They say she drove to Vermont from her apartment in suburban
Virginia just before the Nobel recipients were announced, so that
she could greet the international press corps alone, far from her
Washington, D.C., colleagues. Williams, who notes that she'd been
fired three days before the Nobel announcement, says that she drove
to Vermont to celebrate her birthday.
 &HT;    Whatever her intentions, the choice of location made for
brilliant theater: She stood alone in her grassy yard near a beaver
pond, barefoot and wearing a black tank top, blasting the president
of the United States as a ``weenie'' for refusing to buck the
Pentagon and support a land-mine ban.
 &HT;    Many of the articles that ran in the next day's newspapers
portrayed Williams as a hard-charging, backwoods hero who, by
tapping into the Internet from her ``rustic farmhouse,'' had
single-handedly galvanized citizens to rise up against an insidious
weapon _ all in defiance of the United States, the world's sole
remaining superpower.
 &HT;    The story made good copy, but it was, at best, misleading. Many
people played critical roles in the success of the campaign,
including Thomas Gebauer, of the German group Medico International
and Muller, of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, who
conceived the idea; sympathetic politicians such as U.S. Sen.
Patrick Leahy, of Vermont and Lloyd Axworthy, the Canadian foreign
minister; Princess Diana, who focused international attention on
the cause; and hundreds of mine victims and mine-clearance experts
around the world.
 &HT;    But Williams _ who was an employee of Muller's foundation, which
paid her $70,000-a-year salary and travel expenses _ sees herself
as the key figure in the effort. ``It started with me,'' she
asserts, ``and five years later, there were 1,200 non-government
organizations in 60 countries involved.''
 &HT;    Williams also angered many colleagues by keeping her $500,000
share of the prize money, thereby violating another activists'
commandment: Thou shalt not get rich. And Williams' public
complaints about the $230,000 tax bill she faced struck a sour
note.
 &HT;    Critics say she could have donated her share of the prize to the
campaign or to land-mine victims. Instead, almost half of her prize
money will go to the U.S. Treasury and much of it will be spent by
the Pentagon, which has opposed the land-mine treaty from the
outset.
 &HT;    Muller, a former Marine lieutenant, who was determined to rid
the world of land mines, had been paralyzed below the waist in
1969, while shot through the chest, charging a hill in South
Vietnam. His anger and activist fire were forged during his
rehabilitation at the Veterans Administration medical center in the
Bronx, where he was appalled at the filthy conditions and despair.
 &HT;    He joined the antiwar movement and was thrown out of the 1972
Republican National Convention for attempting to shout down
President Richard M. Nixon. He led the campaign to secure financial
restitution for U.S. soldiers who were victims of Agent Orange and
headed the first delegation of American veterans to return to
Vietnam, in 1981.
 &HT;    He was the hero of the 1975 Vietnam documentary ``Hearts and
Minds'' and a real-life inspiration for the ``cool rockin' daddy''
of Bruce Springsteen's anthem, ``Born in the U.S.A.'' A man of
almost messianic charisma, Muller inspires fierce devotion among
his staff.
 &HT;    During visits to Cambodia in the 1980s, Muller was stunned by
the number of land-mine victims _ according to one recent estimate,
one out every 236 people in that country is an amputee _ and by the
appalling lack of care. Muller's organization, the Vietnam Veterans
of America Foundation, which he founded in 1980, set up a
prosthetics clinic in Cambodia, but the catastrophic toll exacted
by hidden mines convinced him that victim assistance was only a
Band-Aid for a problem that demanded much more.
 &HT;    All over the world, workers from humanitarian groups were
reaching similar conclusions. The Red Cross estimates that 24,000
people are killed or maimed by land mines each year, most of them
civilians and many of them children. According to the U.S. State
Department, there are between 80 million and 110 million land mines
buried in 71 countries around the world, most in developing
countries.
 &HT;    In October 1991, Muller and Thomas Gebauer, of the German aid
group Medico International, decided to try to unite numerous
humanitarian, development, and peace groups under the banner of an
international campaign. The goal, as framed by Muller and Gebauer,
was an international ban on antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    A month later, impressed by Williams' intensity and organizing
track record at Medical Aid for El Salvador, Muller asked her to
come on board as the campaign coordinator.
 &HT;    Within a year of the hiring of Williams, four other
non-governmental organizations _ Human Rights Watch, Handicap
International, the Mines Advisory Group and Physicians for Human
Rights _ joined the campaign. Together with Medico International
and Muller's veterans foundation, these organizations formed a
steering committee to provide direction to the effort to ban land
mines.
 &HT;    Volatile and self-assured, Williams had a famous exchange during
the Ottawa Conference, in 1996, a strategy session for banning land
mines that brought together representatives from 70 governments.
The head of the French delegation, Michel Declos, an Old
World-style diplomat, told the conference that France supported a
ban but reserved the right to use land mines when militarily
necessary.
 &HT;    Several delegates signaled for Williams to stand up and rebut
him. Leaning toward the microphone, Williams said that the
``distinguished representative'' of the French delegation could not
have it both ways: supporting a ban in peacetime but using mines in
wartime. His proposal, she said, was ``better than a stick in the
eye, but not much.''
 &HT;    It was an extraordinary moment: a member of a non-governmental
organization lecturing a diplomat. With Williams leading the
charge, other participants at the conference began denouncing the
French proposal. On the last day of the conference, Lloyd Axworthy,
the Canadian foreign minister, astonished everyone with a heady
challenge: He called on the nations of the world to return to
Ottawa in 14 months to sign an international treaty outlawing land
mines.
 &HT;    However, once close friends, Muller and Williams were barely
speaking during 1997, and the gulf between their strategies was
widening.
 &HT;    The two had very different world views. Muller believed that a
treaty to ban land mines would be a hollow victory without American
support, because the United States was the only country in the
world with the clout and credibility to persuade nations such as
Russia and China to sign on and to ensure adherence to the treaty.
Williams disagreed. The most important countries to have on board,
she believed, were nations that used mines: the Angolas and
Cambodias of the world. The United States could sign later if it
wanted.
 &HT;    The two also disagreed about tactics. Muller had hired a
lobbying team of pollsters and media experts, headed by former
White House aide Patrick Griffin. Williams called the group ``the
sleaze team.'' The campaign, she felt, was being cited as a new
model of diplomacy, one in which average citizens and
non-governmental organizations forced governments to agree to a
weapons ban. She did not think it needed a Beltway PR machine.
 &HT;    Muller thought Williams and her allies were naive about the way
Washington worked. Conservative members of Congress and Army
generals were not going to be swayed by grass-roots campaigning.
Still, he agreed that Griffin's work should be kept as low-profile
as possible.
 &HT;    On Oct. 7, 1997, Muller fired Williams officially. Three days
later, at 4 a.m., the phones at her Vermont home started ringing.
Williams and the campaign had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
In December, the historic Ottawa treaty was signed by 122 nations,
banning the use of antipersonnel land mines.
 &HT;    In May, in an important policy shift, the Clinton administration
announced that the United States will sign the Ottawa treaty as
soon as it finds alternatives to its mixed landmine systems. It has
set a goal of the year 2006.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, since the controversy over the landmine campaign and
the Nobel Prize hit the pages of the Los Angeles Times, the
Washington Post and The New York Times, Williams has been besieged
with requests for interviews. This is the last personal interview
she will be granting for a while, Williams promises; she will not
further indulge a ``media story gone amok.''
 &HT;    ``I'm not interested in talking about me,'' she says. ``Contrary
to what some in the campaign think, I'm not into being a famous
person.''
 &HT;    Williams says she will spend her time working as one of the
campaign's official unpaid ambassadors, formulating political
strategies and giving speeches to ensure that the treaty signed in
Ottawa is ratified, implemented and enforced.

 By ROYAL FORD  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    Watch Quania's eyes.
 &HT;    Dark beneath her broad forehead and furrows of braid, they
reveal nothing. She keeps them distant.
 &HT;    As the bus called ``the 28'' rumbles along Blue Hill Avenue
toward Grove Hall, Quania looks straight ahead. She does not watch
the chattering groups of other teen-age girls, doesn't look at
anyone's clothes or face, certainly doesn't cast a glance at any
boy sitting with a girl.
 &HT;    Later at Grove Hall, where a building of squat shops curves
around a corner, two girls face each other in a darkened doorway,
their backs to the doorposts. Quania's glance in their direction is
too stealthy to be seen: ``I almost looked over at them, but I
looked right back away,'' she says, her tone almost apologetic.
 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and co-author of the
recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be
partly a result of greater attention to the problem by police and
the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that
educators, social workers, judges and police are worried that if
the trend continues, girls might achieve a perverse equality in
crime, an achievement nobody would cheer.
 &HT;    Now Quania is in a program trying to stay out of violence and
help other kids do the same. But she knows it's not easy.
 &HT;    Time was, a teen-age girl living in bad circumstances did one of
two things: She either retreated into herself, becoming the
hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit
altogether, walking through the days full of pain and
submissiveness; or she got pregnant, because pregnancy meant escape
and, with another life dependent on her, a vestige of power.
 &HT;    Today, girls have a third way to go wrong: by striking out in
violence.
 &HT;    The triggers can seem trivial. A girl might attack someone she
thinks looks down on her clothes, her hair, her family. Somebody
sizes up her boyfriend, maybe. Or somebody looks as if she wants to
rise above their shared lot, by dressing well, studying hard,
refusing to hang in the neighborhood or joyride on the streets or
country roads.
 &HT;    Most girls who turn to violence are reacting to the same
circumstances that have long been blamed for breeding violence
among boys. They come from dysfunctional families, learning at home
about abuse: of their bodies, of drugs and alcohol, of their own
esteem. What they don't learn there they pick up on the streets.
They form cliques that a decade ago might have been merely vocally
abusive but today are assault squads.
 &HT;    This generation of girls spends many hours after school without
parental supervision. But what is new is that they do it in the
company of boys, and as the equals of those boys. Just as some boys
and girls hang together today in positive ways, as groups of
friends, not couples, so others hang together in destructive
pursuits.
 &HT;    ``They're acting like they do because of the way the boys
behave. They don't want the boys to have one up on them,'' says Joe
Mascaritolo, the assistant director at Madison Park
Vocational-Technical High School, in Boston. ``You see it more in
groups of boys and girls all being together, all trying to be
equals.''
 &HT;    But there is irony in this, says Sibylle Artz, a professor of
children and youth care at the University of Victoria, in British
Columbia. The girls who become violent and so feel they are
achieving power do it not by becoming powerful young girls but by
stepping out of gender, by acting like violent young men.
 &HT;    Part of the influence on girls is the music that many listen to,
as well as the movies, television shows, fashion ads and news
programs that emphasize power and violence. Artz points
specifically to music videos, which entered the culture shortly
before the first increase in violence among girls was noted.
Perhaps significantly, many videos portray women as powerful by
virtue of their potential violence.
 &HT;    Complaints about the effects of pop culture are not new, but the
level of violence among girls is rising just as girls are tuning in
to this culture in record numbers. In 1997, for the first time,
more girls bought CDs, records and tapes than boys. Li'l Kim, the
rap singer, calls herself the Queen Bitch and sings of sex and
excess _ to the sound of a gun being cocked.
 &HT;    Quania recalls a number with the refrain ``slice you up'' and
marvels that one song she loved by Master P turned out, once she
got past the beat and heard the lyrics, to be a recipe for
producing crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``These girls are not becoming violent out of thin air,'' says
Martha P. Grace, chief justice for the Massachusetts juvenile-court
system. They emerge from ``a constellation of parental neglect,'' a
world where they have ``either witnessed violence endlessly on TV,
in their home, or they have been violated by a parent or someone
else.''
 &HT;    ``Women judges may sometimes be the first women they encounter
who are not powerless,'' Grace notes. This is so even though women
today are more powerful than ever in business, medicine, the law,
the trades, sports and many other realms. Women in these roles
often exist beyond the ken of troubled teen-age girls. But a shadow
of that social shift has fallen across their world: Girls now see
they can rise in the world of violent crime.
 &HT;    Frenia learned most of her bad ways on the street, or in classes
where she wasn't always paying attention. Like Quania, she is
working hard to keep her own life in order and help others at the
same time.
 &HT;    To that end, eight teen-age girls are at ease, sitting around a
make-believe living room. Bone-Net, played by Charlene Johnson, has
invited her girlfriends in to watch TV, and they're finger-flicking
through the channels. The flashing images trigger memory and
reaction in each of the girls.
 &HT;    One by one, they rise on the makeshift stage in the cafeteria of
the Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, in Charlestown, Mass. Each
has a lesson in danger to present to an audience of her peers.
 &HT;    A young woman named Precious stands to tell of her dilemma: Her
friends Trisha and Toya are at each other, she says, and she is
worried that their vocal dispute will turn violently physical. Toya
has already threatened Trisha: ``You're that girl who was talking
bad trash about me,'' and ``I'm going to beat your behind,'' with
eight other girls to help.
 &HT;    Caught in the middle of impending violence between two friends,
Precious asks the audience what she should do. ``I don't want to
get cut up over nobody.''
 &HT;    Several hands shoot up immediately. Talk to your friends, one
student suggests. Tell them violence is no way to go, remind them
that they are friends. Get them to sit down and talk this out.
 &HT;    Precious's real name is La 'Toshia Leathers; she's a member of a
traveling troupe of high school students. The group puts on skits
illustrating some of the dangers teen-age girls face, then invites
the audience to talk about avoiding such pitfalls. Called teen-age
Girls InFormed, the troupe was put together by the Massachusetts
Prevention Center, at the Medical Foundation in Boston, and is
supported by the public school system.
 &HT;    A discussion such as this is one of several ways in which
schools and public officials are beginning to confront the problem
of escalating violence among adolescent girls. Some programs are
aimed specifically at them, while others that once targeted boys
have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

 &HT;    At 15, Quania Daniel, a sophomore at Boston English High School,
already has learned the danger of a misinterpreted glance _ a
glance mistaken for superiority or haughtiness, for a sneer at
another girl's appearance or for flirting with someone's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Here in Grove Hall, behind the Beulah Holmes Holiness Center, a
girl pulled a knife on Quania one night a few months back. It was a
confrontation sparked by a glance Quania might have cast _ though
she doesn't remember it _ at the Chez Vous roller rink up the
avenue.
 &HT;    When the knife came out, she walked away. Chicken, some girls
called her. Smart, she calls herself.
 &HT;    But the next night, she happened to run into the girl again at
Grove Hall, and this time they did fight, fist-to-fist _ ``up and
up,'' as Quania says, distinguishing it from fights with weapons or
fights where a group of girls jumps a lone victim. ``I didn't lose
that fight'' is all she will say about it.
 &HT;    She was lucky to have a fight end so cleanly. One of her
friends, tied by rumor to another girl's boyfriend, had her face
slashed with a box cutter just a block down from Doyle's, the
Jamaica Plain tavern where warm friendships and conviviality
abound.
 &HT;    Until about 10 years ago, teen-age girls seldom fought each
other _ even with fists. They did not carry knives and razors and
box cutters. They did not form roaming packs and attack other
girls. They did not fight with sticks, bats, bricks.
 &HT;    Today they do. And that has made the world of many girls like
Quania a terrain of fear, a place where caution is essential. The
threat is not just in the cores of cities. It exists in
Massachusetts at the Quincy Center MBTA stop; at a trailer park in
Concord, N.H.; at a school in York, Maine.
 &HT;    Violence by teen-age girls is not yet a deluge, but its steady
escalation, even as overall crime rates in the nation are falling,
is troubling.
 &HT;    Consider these recent crimes by girls:
 &HT;    In Roxbury, Mass., two 15-year-olds use razors to slice the arms
and forehead of a 16-year-old girl.
 &HT;    In Concord, N.H., four girls surround a 14-year-old girl as she
gets off a school bus at the mobile-home park where she lives and
beat her with baseball bats.
 &HT;    In Revere, Mass., a state trooper is brought down by a
15-year-old girl who jumps him from behind after he stops her
father for a minor traffic violation.
 &HT;    In Cromwell, Conn., two 18-year-olds are charged with using box
cutters to slash the necks of two other teen-age girls.
 &HT;    In Rhode Island, a girl who was 13 at the time of the killing is
sentenced to 45 years in prison for the murder of a 23-year-old
single mother she shot in the head in a fight over a man.
 &HT;    And in Springfield, Mass., a teen-age girl holds up a young
mother at gunpoint, then beats her victim's 18-month-old child with
the pistol.
 &HT;    Kathleen M. O'Toole, the state's secretary of public safety,
recalls that when she was a Boston street cop in the 1970s and
'80s, girls were arrested rarely, and then only for nonviolent
crimes such as shoplifting. In the mid-1980s, however, that began
to change, and the rise in violence has been steady.
 &HT;    Since 1987, according to the FBI, the number of violent crimes
committed annually by boys under 18 has risen from 51,653 to 78,853
_ a 53 percent increase. But that is less than half the percentage
increase among girls during the same period: Violent crime by girls
under 18 climbed 118 percent, from 6,418 incidents to 13,995.
Aggravated assaults were up 124 percent; robberies, 117 percent.
 &HT;    Guns are rarely the weapon of choice for girls _ at least for
now. They opt for less deadly weapons, such as razors, box- and
carpet-cutting knives, sticks, bats, fists. Before teen-age boys
turned to guns, sometime in the mid-1980s, they too used knives and
razors, and that leaves open the question of whether girls will
also turn to guns as the taboo on violent female behavior fades.
 &HT;    Still, the total number of girls committing violent crimes is
small compared with boys. Meda Chesney-Lind, professor of women's
studies at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and co-author of the
recent book ``Girls, Delinquency, and Juvenile Justice,'' cautions
that the perceived increase in teen-age female violence may be
partly a result of greater attention to the problem by police and
the news media.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, the shift has been perceptible enough that
educators, social workers, judges and police are worried that if
the trend continues, girls might achieve a perverse equality in
crime, an achievement nobody would cheer.
 &HT;    Now Quania is in a program trying to stay out of violence and
help other kids do the same. But she knows it's not easy.
 &HT;    Time was, a teen-age girl living in bad circumstances did one of
two things: She either retreated into herself, becoming the
hollow-eyed waif who said little in school and maybe even quit
altogether, walking through the days full of pain and
submissiveness; or she got pregnant, because pregnancy meant escape
and, with another life dependent on her, a vestige of power.
 &HT;    Today, girls have a third way to go wrong: by striking out in
violence.
 &HT;    The triggers can seem trivial. A girl might attack someone she
thinks looks down on her clothes, her hair, her family. Somebody
sizes up her boyfriend, maybe. Or somebody looks as if she wants to
rise above their shared lot, by dressing well, studying hard,
refusing to hang in the neighborhood or joyride on the streets or
country roads.
 &HT;    Most girls who turn to violence are reacting to the same
circumstances that have long been blamed for breeding violence
among boys. They come from dysfunctional families, learning at home
about abuse: of their bodies, of drugs and alcohol, of their own
esteem. What they don't learn there they pick up on the streets.
They form cliques that a decade ago might have been merely vocally
abusive but today are assault squads.
 &HT;    This generation of girls spends many hours after school without
parental supervision. But what is new is that they do it in the
company of boys, and as the equals of those boys. Just as some boys
and girls hang together today in positive ways, as groups of
friends, not couples, so others hang together in destructive
pursuits.
 &HT;    ``They're acting like they do because of the way the boys
behave. They don't want the boys to have one up on them,'' says Joe
Mascaritolo, the assistant director at Madison Park
Vocational-Technical High School, in Boston. ``You see it more in
groups of boys and girls all being together, all trying to be
equals.''
 &HT;    But there is irony in this, says Sibylle Artz, a professor of
children and youth care at the University of Victoria, in British
Columbia. The girls who become violent and so feel they are
achieving power do it not by becoming powerful young girls but by
stepping out of gender, by acting like violent young men.
 &HT;    Part of the influence on girls is the music that many listen to,
as well as the movies, television shows, fashion ads and news
programs that emphasize power and violence. Artz points
specifically to music videos, which entered the culture shortly
before the first increase in violence among girls was noted.
Perhaps significantly, many videos portray women as powerful by
virtue of their potential violence.
 &HT;    Complaints about the effects of pop culture are not new, but the
level of violence among girls is rising just as girls are tuning in
to this culture in record numbers. In 1997, for the first time,
more girls bought CDs, records and tapes than boys. Li'l Kim, the
rap singer, calls herself the Queen Bitch and sings of sex and
excess _ to the sound of a gun being cocked.
 &HT;    Quania recalls a number with the refrain ``slice you up'' and
marvels that one song she loved by Master P turned out, once she
got past the beat and heard the lyrics, to be a recipe for
producing crack cocaine.
 &HT;    ``These girls are not becoming violent out of thin air,'' says
Martha P. Grace, chief justice for the Massachusetts juvenile-court
system. They emerge from ``a constellation of parental neglect,'' a
world where they have ``either witnessed violence endlessly on TV,
in their home, or they have been violated by a parent or someone
else.''
 &HT;    ``Women judges may sometimes be the first women they encounter
who are not powerless,'' Grace notes. This is so even though women
today are more powerful than ever in business, medicine, the law,
the trades, sports and many other realms. Women in these roles
often exist beyond the ken of troubled teen-age girls. But a shadow
of that social shift has fallen across their world: Girls now see
they can rise in the world of violent crime.
 &HT;    Frenia learned most of her bad ways on the street, or in classes
where she wasn't always paying attention. Like Quania, she is
working hard to keep her own life in order and help others at the
same time.
 &HT;    To that end, eight teen-age girls are at ease, sitting around a
make-believe living room. Bone-Net, played by Charlene Johnson, has
invited her girlfriends in to watch TV, and they're finger-flicking
through the channels. The flashing images trigger memory and
reaction in each of the girls.
 &HT;    One by one, they rise on the makeshift stage in the cafeteria of
the Clarence R. Edwards Middle School, in Charlestown, Mass. Each
has a lesson in danger to present to an audience of her peers.
 &HT;    A young woman named Precious stands to tell of her dilemma: Her
friends Trisha and Toya are at each other, she says, and she is
worried that their vocal dispute will turn violently physical. Toya
has already threatened Trisha: ``You're that girl who was talking
bad trash about me,'' and ``I'm going to beat your behind,'' with
eight other girls to help.
 &HT;    Caught in the middle of impending violence between two friends,
Precious asks the audience what she should do. ``I don't want to
get cut up over nobody.''
 &HT;    Several hands shoot up immediately. Talk to your friends, one
student suggests. Tell them violence is no way to go, remind them
that they are friends. Get them to sit down and talk this out.
 &HT;    Precious's real name is La 'Toshia Leathers; she's a member of a
traveling troupe of high school students. The group puts on skits
illustrating some of the dangers teen-age girls face, then invites
the audience to talk about avoiding such pitfalls. Called teen-age
Girls InFormed, the troupe was put together by the Massachusetts
Prevention Center, at the Medical Foundation in Boston, and is
supported by the public school system.
 &HT;    A discussion such as this is one of several ways in which
schools and public officials are beginning to confront the problem
of escalating violence among adolescent girls. Some programs are
aimed specifically at them, while others that once targeted boys
have been expanded to include girls.
 &HT;    In some communities, teen-agers are recruited as peer leaders in
their schools; in others, officials have set up downtown drop-in
centers for troubled youths. Still other programs, such as teen-age
Girls InFormed, hope their cautionary tales will reach young people
before violence happens.
 &HT;    The audience on this afternoon, at least, appears to be engaged
in Precious' story. Later, other characters rise: Blue, whose real
name is Marilyn Jean, acts the part of a drunk, telling how she
forced a girl who didn't drink to slug down some liquor. ``It's not
my fault she choked on her vomit,'' she says. ``It's not my fault
she died.'' The audience groans in disapproval.
 &HT;    As the session continues, actors come forward to talk of date
rape, of more drinking, of more violence. They ask the audience to
respond: Who was at fault in the date rape? Should a drunken mother
be reported to the social service department? How do you stop
drinking? How do you stop fighting?
 &HT;    Today, Frenia is a peer leader for Teen Empowerment, a South
End-based outreach program with offices in three Boston high
schools: Madison Park, English and Dorchester. Peer leaders try to
help steer troubled youngsters away from violence by teaching them
to express their anger and frustrations in ways that are vocal, not
violent.
 &HT;    ``They learn violence at home,'' Frenia says. ``They aren't
respected and they end up not respecting themselves. And how are
you going to respect anybody else if you can't respect yourself?''
 &HT;    Teen Empowerment tries to teach self-respect by encouraging kids
to talk about what is troubling them, in casual gatherings after
school, without dictating solutions. Instead, a peer leader, such
as Frenia or Quania, uses her own experience to help peers work out
answers for themselves.
 &HT;    While programs such as these seem promising, no one is sure yet
what will work best. Yet the studies that Artz and others have
done, in both Canada and the United States, offer some clues to
what might work. It seems the skits presented by teen-age Girls
InFormed are useful because they present tangible problems, inspire
discussion and propose nonviolent options.
 &HT;    The issue is critical, because the question that logically
follows the surge in violence among girls is frightening: Will the
trend continue, mimicking the level of mayhem among boys?
 &HT;    Hopefully not. Moreover, girls appear to learn from one another
in ways that boys, long ingrained with the notion that
aggressiveness is natural, do not. Many are hoping this will be a
key to the battle.

 By PETER LIPPMAN  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In March, I became a prisoner in Kosovo, along with a group of
activists from Peaceworkers, a California-based organization that
monitors human-rights abuses and promotes nonviolent conflict
resolution.
 &HT;    I arrived in Kosovo as part of the Peaceworkers' delegation, at
the invitation of the Independent Student Union there.
 &HT;    We witnessed the brutality of the Serbian government in this
Albanian-populated province. And we noted the remarkable efforts of
Kosovo's Albanian citizenry to stave off disaster by engaging in
creative nonviolence.
 &HT;    In Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, we met the people who are
holding together the infrastructure of Albanian society _
professors, doctors, journalists and human-rights workers.
 &HT;    The dean of philology at Pristina's underground university told
us how, in 1991, the Belgrade regime had imposed an exclusively
Serbian-language curriculum. When the Albanian professors refused
to teach the curriculum, they were fired. The same thing happened
in the high schools. Teachers and professors soon set up a parallel
educational system in private rooms, basements and storefronts.
 &HT;    We visited an English class in an unheated, empty store. The
students sat on makeshift wooden benches, wearing their coats, hats
and gloves. The young teacher shivered as she gave a lesson in
prefixes: neo-liberalism, neo-colonialism, pan-Hellenic,
pan-Balkan.
 &HT;    All of the college-educated people we spoke with said they were
convinced that their conflict with the Serbian regime must be
resolved peacefully. One of our young translators was the most
eloquent. Asked how she felt about the Kosovo Liberation Army, she
responded, ``Did anyone ever win a war? You can take territory, but
everyone still loses.''
 &HT;    At the same time, many people are at the end of their patience.
A journalist said to me, ``Each night I go to bed knowing that the
police can break into my apartment and do whatever they want to my
family. This is psychological terrorism. Every parent is a
potential fighter.'' One student in the English class told us, ``If
the police hurt my father or my brother, I will have to fight.''
 &HT;    At the student union office, I looked at pictures of the victims
from Drenica, the region west of Pristina where Serbian police and
paramilitary units surrounded more than a dozen villages in late
February and massacred at least 90 people. I saw photos of the
bodies of old people, men, women and children. Many had been shot
at close range. Half of one woman's face was gone.
 &HT;    Later I watched the Serbian TV coverage. Only the male victims,
all of whom were termed ``terrorists,'' showed up on television.
 &HT;    We met a former Serbian politician who was forced out of his job
after he spoke against the regime when it took away Kosovo's
autonomy. We asked what would happen to him if he protested now
against massacres of Albanian civilians. ``Probably the same thing
that happened to the people in Drenica,'' he said.
 &HT;    Another Serb we met, a shopkeeper, said he had friends and
customers among the Albanians. He came close to tears when he
talked about the Albanian woman who used to take care of his
children. He told us he wished the Albanians would receive their
independence so that things could calm down.
 &HT;    But his mood changed when we brought up the recent massacre. ``I
knew some of those policemen who got killed,'' he said. ``In
America, what do you do with your terrorist problem? You hunt them
down and shoot them, right? I am just waiting to leave here.''
 &HT;    The Serb shopkeeper blamed the Kosovo Liberation Army for the
troubles in the region. But he also expressed hateful views of the
Albanian people generally.
 &HT;    ``The Albanians just think about sex and guns,'' he said. ``If
they have two wives and we have one, they can have 10 or 15
children, and we usually just have two. And they always make sure
to have lots of guns. The Albanians I know here in town are mostly
normal. But not those in the villages. Did you see the pictures of
the people who were killed? They looked like monkeys.''
 &HT;    At noon on Friday, March 13, my colleagues and I walked up a
muddy hill in Pristina to observe a protest. Demonstrators chose
the hillside location, among other reasons, because of its
inaccessibility except by foot. No cars could make a sudden attack.
The demonstration started earlier than announced, so the police
wouldn't have time to block it.
 &HT;    About 50,000 people stood among the houses on the edge of a
sloped field. They sang freedom songs, waved Albanian and American
flags, carried signs saying, ``Serbian Terror out of Kosovo'',
``NATO: S.O.S.'' and ``Drenica, We're with You''. Protesters made
speeches, and then the demonstration broke up. The crowd marched
down Qafa Street, renamed Yugoslav National Army Street by the
Serbian government.
 &HT;    We went to visit the Mother Teresa clinic, located in a small
house in the poor part of Pristina. It is the only free women's
clinic in Kosovo, staffed by doctors and nurses who donate their
time. One doctor told us about her surreal firing from the state
hospital in 1990 by a policeman wearing a doctor's white coat,
holding a gun in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other.
 &HT;    She also said another doctor was fired while operating on a
patient. When he insisted on finishing the operation, he was
handcuffed to a radiator and beaten. On days when traffic is not
disrupted by police actions, an average of 15 children are born in
the clinic. Because of space limitations, mothers who have just
given birth have only two hours to rest before they are sent home.
Women are often doubled up, two to a bed.
 &HT;    The day we visited was a slow one, because of the
demonstrations. There were only three newborns, tightly wrapped and
placed together in a bed with bottles of warm water between them.
Most women are giving birth at home now, the doctors said, and
there is anecdotal evidence of a big jump in infant mortality.
 &HT;    On Sunday, four days after we arrived, we watched more
demonstrations. One was scheduled to coincide with Catholic Mass.
There were no signs this time, just pictures of Mother Teresa.
Demonstrators also carried candles in honor of the dead at Drenica.
About 100,000 people walked around the town quietly. Seven young
men at the front of the line wore T-shirts that spelled
D-R-E-N-I-C-A.
 &HT;    Near the center of town the march stopped. An old man stepped
out and motioned everyone to be quiet. The silence of those
thousands of people was overwhelming. The man lit all the candles
of those in front of the line, and then walked away, lighting a
cigarette.
 &HT;    The next day, 20,000 women tried to march to Drenica with bread
in their hands. The police turned them back. Human-rights groups
and aid organizations were also prevented from reaching Drenica,
where terrified villagers hiding in the woods were reportedly
starving. The head of the International Red Cross in Pristina gave
up on relief efforts and left town after receiving death threats.
 &HT;    On Thurs., March 19, the students called another brief
demonstration. This time everyone was to bring keys and rattle
them, to symbolize unlocking the prison of military repression, a
tactic protesters used in Chile and Czechoslovakia. A half-dozen
policemen blocked the protest at a main intersection. Pistols,
grenades, and knives hung from their belts. The marchers all sat
down. Snipers stood on the rooftops. Two armored vehicles raced to
the scene, and 10 helmeted policemen got out. They filed around to
stand behind the seated protesters.
 &HT;    But what were they going to do to thousands of people who were
sitting down, with dozens of international journalists watching?
Nothing happened. The demonstrators rattled their keys and blew
their whistles. For half an hour unarmed men, women and children,
sitting on the pavement, prevailed over the police.
 &HT;    On the same day, a large Serbian demonstration took place. Word
spread that many busloads of people were brought into Pristina from
Belgrade, Nis and Kragujevac. We watched as a crowd of people
walked by carrying signs: ``Kosovo is the Heart of Serbia'';
``We'll Give our Head, But Not Serbia!'' _ and a swastika with the
words ``America'' and ``Germany'' over it.
 &HT;    Some Serbian marchers caught sight of my colleagues and me
standing near some journalists who were wearing plaid shirts and
carrying cameras. The marchers started yelling, ``Profiteers! Go
home.'' People sang the old song, ``Who's lying? Who says Serbia is
small?'' As we left, an old woman followed us, yelling, ``You
should be killed!''
 &HT;    I heard a piano when I arrived at my host's house to rest. The
14-year-old music student who lives there was practicing. I went in
to listen while he played Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, all three
movements, without sheet music. I was impressed, and asked him how
long he had been working on it.
 &HT;    He told me, ``Since the beginning of the year, only I haven't
had much time.''
 &HT;    Then he played Mozart's March Alla Turca, which sounded easy
after the Beethoven piece.
 &HT;    Our visit ended abruptly when my group was arrested, tried by a
``judge'' (more properly a magistrate) and sentenced to 10 days in
jail, all in the space of a few hours. I was apprehended a day
before my colleagues when I reached a checkpoint while trying to
leave Kosovo by bus for Sarajevo.
 &HT;    The police, not liking the fact that I had no evidence to show I
had registered my presence in Kosovo with the police, removed me
from the bus. They held me at the Mitrovica police station for
several hours, talking to me sometimes politely, and other times
rudely. Eventually they decided to send me back to Pristina. Two
armed policemen drove me back in an unmarked car.
 &HT;    During the entire detention and arrest incident, I was more
inconvenienced than scared because I believed I would soon be fined
and allowed to go on my way. When one of my guards conjectured that
I would be sentenced to 10 days in jail and then deported, I
thought he was trying to intimidate me. But I soon learned that he
was right.
 &HT;    And as my mother warned me before I went to Kosovo, ``In a war
situation, there's no one you can complain to.''
 &HT;    On entering the jail, I was not physically mistreated, just
yelled at for a long time by the guards. Some of them seemed to be
enjoying their opportunity to yell at an American. They asked me if
I wanted a haircut. I said no. Then they shaved my head and took me
to a cell.
 &HT;    I spent the night in the cell with seven Albanian men, ages 16
to 40. They had been arrested the same day as I was. It was clear
that the police had already been hard at work on a couple of them.
I shook hands with everyone except the two whose hands were too
swollen from pounding by nightclubs.
 &HT;    Two men adopted me, talked to me in a whisper, and told me how
to act in order to survive. I asked if we could speak openly. One
said, ``You can, but we can't.''
 &HT;    The police entered the room every half hour that night. Each
time, we had to jump up and form a line with our hands behind our
backs. One big guard was particularly mean. He asked the
16-year-old boy standing next to me a question. The boy answered in
Albanian.
 &HT;    The man slapped him on one cheek and told him to speak Serbian.
The poor kid didn't know much Serbian.
 &HT;    The guard slapped him hard on the other cheek. His hand whizzed
by my face. He asked the boy, ``Were you in the demonstration?''
The boy answered, ``Yes.'' Slap. The guard left, satisfied for the
time being.
 &HT;    I was arrested on a Friday, and the rest of my colleagues came
in on Saturday. Diplomatic pressure on the Serbian government
ensued. U.S. diplomats all the way up to Madeleine Albright were
making a clamor to high Serbian officials.
 &HT;    On Monday, we were suddenly taken out of the jail and driven to
the Serbian border with Macedonia. The Serbian government had made
a mistake in detaining us. The arrest gave us a special opportunity
to publicize our findings. After we were released, we held press
conferences in Skopje, Macedonia, and in Washington, D.C.
 &HT;    We were relieved to be out of jail, but sorry to be forbidden to
reenter the country for three years. The privileged Americans are
free, but for the Albanians, life goes on.
 &HT;    Albanians in Kosovo are close enough to Bosnia to know that no
amount of human suffering will necessarily force Western
policymakers to act. But every day I spent there, I heard the same
things: ``What is America going to do? NATO needs to wake up and
help us.''
 &HT;    Meanwhile, as the West cranks out ``strongly worded
statements,'' the atrocities continue. Serbian soldiers keep
pouring into Kosovo. They are setting up more checkpoints, and
violent attacks on Albanian peasants are not restricted to the
Drenica area, but are taking place all over the province. By now,
there are well over 40,000 refugees. Some even showed up in
Sarajevo.
 &HT;    As long as the conflict does not spill over the borders, sending
thousands more refugees into NATO countries, the West seems content
to keep its distance. But there will be more Drenicas. Madeleine
Albright's declaration that ``we will not rule out force'' and
pontification about an arms embargo on Yugoslavia are pathetic
gestures. It is getting very late for the Albanians.

 &HT;    Commentary: TQP: Total Quality Parenting
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat

<TEXT>
<P>
   I saw the first lemonade stand of summer the other day. I was on
my way to pick up our youngest son at a friend's house. As I turned
the corner onto his street, I saw a hand-painted cardboard sign,
taped to a stick and stuck in the ground: ``Ice Cold Lemonade, Big
Cup 50 cents, Little Cup 25 cents. Ice Cold Water, Big Cup 40
cents, Little Cup 10 cents.''
</P>
<P>
   How cute, I thought to myself. Nothing like hot, summer days and
enterprising little kids. It's a milestone of almost every child's
life.
</P>
<P>
   I pulled up closer to the stand and, sure enough, there was my
son and his friend, manfully minding shop over the card table that
held his mom's best Tupperware pitcher and an ice chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirsty?'' my son asked, running to the curb to meet me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the Big Cup,'' I answered grandly, digging into my
purse.
</P>
<P>
   When I handed over my 50 cents, he ran back to his friend and
shouted, ``That makes $2.75 for each of us!''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day's work. With the heat index at 108 degrees,
the two budding businessmen had a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder, why is $2.75 earned by standing in the suffocating
heat such a bonanza compared to the $5 a week we hand him for doing
his chores? He hardly takes note of those earnings, even though he
arguably has to work harder for them. No, the thrill comes from
planning, making and selling the product himself.
</P>
<P>
   It's no different for adults. This sense of ownership _ be it a
program at church, a product on the shelf or a marketing plan _
translates into the difference between participating in something
and caring deeply about it.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds me of the old joke about the ham-and-egg breakfast.
In producing it, the joke goes, the chicken is involved, but the
pig is committed.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure we want our commitment to go that far, but it does
make a point. For most of us to achieve any level of sacrificial
commitment, we must feel our input is valuable and essential.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, businesses were all abuzz about TQM, Total
Quality Management. It's pretty much the same philosophy described
above, practiced in the workplace. Small-group meetings are held
regularly among employees, their ideas and suggestions are sought
and implemented as much as possible. The message is loud and clear:
You are important to this organization, you make a difference, we
value you, we're listening to you.
</P>
<P>
   TQP should become the buzzword for all of us rearing children _
Total Quality Parenting. We should strive to make each family
member feel important, feel valued, know that his or her presence
makes a difference. Most important of all, perhaps, it would create
opportunities to listen, not lecture.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty easy trap to parent like an autocrat. After all,
that's what many of our parents did, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ask me why. I'm the parent, that's why. Just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'm not going to claim I've never said that to my
chidren, but I've tried not to. It belittles and demeans them. It
says, ``Your input on this doesn't matter to me. I don't care what
you think, and I don't even want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   I have a hunch many of us at times treat our co-workers and
friends with more courtesy and respect than we do our own family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Our son helped his friend close down shop for the day, hopped in
the car and proudly showed me his take-home pay. When you're the
youngest of three sons, it's easy for your accomplishments to get
overlooked. After all, two others already have been there and done
that.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of lemonade stands in my life, but until today I
hadn't seen this one _ the one that my son and his friend made. I
couldn't have been prouder of him, and I told him so.

WEBER BARBECUE BROUGHT 30 YEARS OF SEAR PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, they just don't build 'em like they used to. After just a
tad over 30 years, our Weber barbecue grill died.
</P>
<P>
   Basic black, charcoal-fired, grease-encrusted, patched-together,
jury-rigged backyard grill just bit the dust during this past
weekend's Father's Day cookout. Like many of us old-timers, its
legs gave out . . . separated from the body just as I was loading
it with some ribs and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   We managed to cook without spilling the meal _ not that we
haven't had to brush off some grass clippings, mulch, dirt and a
little gravel from previously spilled barbecues _ and left it
there, a burned-out hulk.
</P>
<P>
   There should be some sort of ceremony, some honor attaching to a
consumer product having lasted that long in this era of disposable
goods. We held onto it partly because we are from a time when
parents and grandparents recited: Use it up; wear it out. Make it
do or do without. And the Weber lasted a whole lot longer than my
'51 Chevy or '72 Olds, which we kept going out of sheer necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three decades, we've burned everything from hot dogs
to turkeys and rib roasts on that Weber grill. We resisted the urge
to get a fancy-shmancy, gas-fired, cast-iron grill, opting instead
to ingest a goodly amount of hydrocarbons from charcoal and starter
liquid as we did our part to augment global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Our family has barbecued out in the yard since just after ``the
War,'' sometimes called ``The Big One,'' when Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
sold some folding-leg, thin-gauge grills that looked like cheap
suitcases and lasted about two or three seasons. Barbecuing was
convenient because Dad always had a ready supply of what we called
``real'' charcoal that tin-benders used to heat their soldering
irons.
</P>
<P>
   I inherited our father's uniquely blue-collar method of starting
the backyard grill: a cup of gasoline torched with a well-aimed
lighted match. This has accounted, over the years, for those times
when I came to work on Monday mornings without eyebrows or with
drastically shortened mustache and beard.
</P>
<P>
   The Weber was a gift from a friend back in Illinois when we
lived not far from where Webers are made. Initially, like old
Fords, they came only in basic black, and two or three sizes. But
they were considered the Cadillac of backyard grills, and we
certainly put the miles on ours.
</P>
<P>
   We did burnt bratwurst offerings to the gods of summer and we
did a few overly ambitious turkeys and rib roasts . . . just to say
that we did it. But my all-time favorite has been the Father's Day
rib barbecue. Tradition held that the man of the house was allowed
to spend the entire day barbecuing pork spareribs.
</P>
<P>
   To do this properly, coals were banked to one side with the help
of a Weber coal rail, and one rack of ribs was cooked while the
others were heaped off to one side, absorbing the sweet smoke.
Depending on the trendiness of the market choice, chips of
mesquite, alder, cherry or other woods _ some soaked overnight in a
water bucket _ were added to the coals.
</P>
<P>
   It took all day and a dozen or so bottles of beer to cook the
Father's Day meal, by the completion of which the ribs looked like
what was left of a herd of cloven-hoof animals hit by an asteroid,
and the cook looked well-done. And last weekend's was no exception,
except the cook was sober.
</P>
<P>
   There were harsh winter days back in northern Illinois when I
wanted to prove that backyard cooking was not a summer phenomenon,
and so I fired up the ol' Weber in some gawdawful weather and near
'bout froze my buns off. It was so cold during some of those
cookouts that the main dish was cold by the time I'd rushed it back
into the kitchen to something less than rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of these cookouts was not a pretty sight. And
cleaning the grill became a chore to be avoided, so it was easier
to buy a new grill top every year. The buildup of grease and ash
and sauce was occasionally scraped off the bottom half of the Weber
globe.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, I replaced the original set of plastic
grill wheels with some slightly larger plastic lawnmower wheels.
The handles began to fall off. It was well beyond garage-sale
material; it was the Old Family Retainer, kept on for having served
so well for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   The old grill will go to the county transfer station. After an
appropriate period of mourning, we may look for another, no doubt
slimmer and younger, model. But it won't be the same.

 &HT;    
 By MARK SCHOOPS  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When the Harvard AIDS researcher Bruce Walker first learned
about the Berlin patient last September, he had one overriding
thought: Get a sample of his blood.
 &HT;    He dashed off E-mails to the scientists studying the patient and
then phoned his research associates, saying, ``You won't believe
what I just heard.''
 &HT;    Word of the unusual German case quickly spread to a support
group for patients in one of Walker's clinical trials at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Since then the group has
had an extra, invisible member: The Berlin patient, who is
discussed and analyzed almost as if he were actually present.
 &HT;    ``I've never met him, and I don't even know his name, but I've
followed his case,'' says one member of the group. ``He is what we
want to be.''
 &HT;    The source of all this excitement is a young German man who
became infected with the AIDS virus just over two years ago and
quickly started taking a combination of anti-HIV drugs. After just
six months of therapy, however, he ignored the advice of his doctor
and stopped taking the drugs.
 &HT;    When that happens, the virus ordinarily comes roaring back,
resuming its advance to full-blown AIDS. What makes the Berlin
patient so intriguing is that his virus hasn't come back. The most
precise tests detect no HIV in his blood and only trace amounts in
his lymph tissue, the major reservoir for the virus. He harbors so
little HIV that in order to detect it in one of its hiding places,
Dr. Robert Siliciano, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, had to redesign his assay, making it five times
as sensitive.
 &HT;    What little virus remains in the patient is fully capable of
reigniting an infection, so he is not cured. But his immune system
is apparently suppressing HIV without drugs. He has not taken an
AIDS pill in a year and a half.
 &HT;    The Berlin patient fascinates researchers, who hope that clues
to this singular case may lead to new treatments, especially for
those patients lucky enough to get an early diagnosis. At the same
time, researchers are terrified that news of his case might
encourage other patients to abandon their drugs, a rash decision
that virtually always frees the virus to continue its destruction
of the immune system and, possibly, mutate into drug-resistant
strains.
 &HT;    Indeed, another patient in Berlin _ infected at nearly the same
time and treated by the same doctor with the same drugs _ similarly
stopped taking his pills. Immediately, his virus reared up. The
overwhelming majority of AIDS doctors agree with Marcus Conant, a
veteran AIDS doctor in San Francisco, who says, ``If someone comes
to me and says, `I want to go off drugs,' I look him in the eye and
say, `You're nuts.'''
 &HT;    Nonetheless, two world-class labs have confirmed that the Berlin
patient's viral infection is being held in check, and a third is
scrutinizing his immune system. Their interest reflects a recent
shift in thinking about the disease.
 &HT;    At the last international AIDS conference, held two years ago in
Vancouver, Dr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS
Research Center in New York, projected a slogan onto the screen
that could have been a motto for HIV research at the time: ``It's
the virus!'' And, indeed, targeting the virus has led to a class of
antiviral drugs known as protease inhibitors, the primary force
behind a remarkable two-year decline in AIDS death rates.
 &HT;    No one is suggesting a retreat from this front, but as 10,000
researchers, doctors and advocates gather in Geneva June 28 for the
12th World AIDS Conference, the research focus is broadening from
simply attacking the virus to strengthening the immune system as
well. The Berlin patient, along with several similar, but less well
documented cases just now coming to light, are helping to spur this
shift.
 &HT;    Such cases are ``really pivotal for how we think about HIV,''
says Walker, an immunologist who obtained and analyzed the Berlin
patient's blood. ``What they're banging us over the head with is
that the immune system can control this virus.''
 &HT;    The renewed interest in the immune system comes at a time when
AIDS research has reached a plateau following the development of
protease inhibitors. Despite a presidential commitment to create a
vaccine, and despite the recent approval by the FDA to begin
large-scale testing of one experimental vaccine, there is
widespread sentiment that vaccine research lags behind drug
development.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, an estimated 16,000 people are infected with HIV
every day, and 90 percent of them live in developing nations that
can't afford the expensive new medications. At the same time, early
euphoria over protease inhibitors has been tempered by the
realization that they achieve a stalemate, not a victory. Cocktails
of two to four drugs can stop HIV from replicating and halt disease
progression but can't eliminate the virus, because it integrates
into the DNA of every cell it infects.
 &HT;    Scientists hoped that if HIV were paralyzed long enough, the
body might purge every infected cell. But that possibility dimmed
last year when three independent research teams found that HIV can
hide indefinitely in long-lived cells known as resting T cells.
 &HT;    So unless new strategies are developed, patients might have to
take their drugs for life. But the drugs can cause persistent
nausea and diarrhea, and frightening long-term side effects have
recently been emerging, including redistribution of body fat and
possible heart complications.
 &HT;    Moreover, the drugs currently fail to suppress HIV in as many as
a third of all patients, and that proportion may grow over time.
When drugs fail, it often means that the virus has mutated into a
strain that is resistant to many drugs, even ones the patient has
never taken, leaving few or no options for effective therapy.
 &HT;    ``We could be on a short-term euphoria,'' warns Dr. Ronald
Desrosiers of Harvard. If toxicities or drug resistance forces
enough patients off medication, he says, the two-year decline in
the AIDS death rate could prove short-lived. ``Ten years from
now,'' Desrosiers says, ``we could be back to where we were five
years ago.''
 &HT;    Yet despite their limitations, the drugs do pin down the virus,
at least for a while, thus providing a window of opportunity for
researchers to revive the overwhelmed immune system. Dr. Anthony
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md., says that it might not be necessary to
decrease the viral level to zero.
 &HT;    ``You may just need to get it low enough so that the immune
system can kick in and keep it in check,'' he says. Ho agrees:
``Control without eradication might be something we could call
remission.''
 &HT;    That's why the Berlin patient, who seems to fit precisely this
description, is so exciting to researchers.
 &HT;    ``What we're looking for,'' Walker says, ``are clues,
experiments of nature that will allow us to understand how to tweak
the immune system so that it can control the virus. And it's
patients like this guy in Berlin who will give us those insights.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    At 30, he is still a student, and he dresses like one: jeans, a
plaid shirt open at the neck and, on his wrist, one of those
colorful cloth bracelets from Mexico. He has short, alfalfa hair
and eyes that often look away, for he is almost painfully shy. He
has never before spoken publicly about his situation and _ fearful
of discrimination against both himself and his parents, who still
live in a small town in southern Germany _ he agreed to talk only
if his identity were concealed.
 &HT;    I met the Berlin patient in his doctor's office, and we walked a
few blocks through the heart of West Berlin's gay neighborhood to a
cafe, where he explained how he became a celebrated medical
mystery. It began on May 10, 1996, when he had sex that wasn't
safe. Three weeks later, he came down with what is called primary
infection syndrome, the fever, swollen lymph nodes and fatigue
signaling that HIV is gaining an initial foothold.
 &HT;    Heiko Jessen, a Berlin doctor with a large AIDS practice,
suggested an HIV test. On June 20, Jessen delivered the bad news.
``I could not move,'' recalls the Berlin patient. ``I didn't even
cry.''
 &HT;    Ten days later, the Berlin patient started on a cocktail of
three drugs _ the protease inhibitor indinavir, ddI and an
experimental and controversial drug called hydroxyurea. The amount
of virus in his blood quickly plummeted.
 &HT;    Then, less than three weeks after starting his medication, he
developed a testicular infection requiring an emergency
hospitalization. But he hadn't taken his HIV pills with him. So for
several days he didn't take his medicine, and his virus popped
back, though only to low levels. Restarting the drugs squelched it.
 &HT;    After that the Berlin patient took his pills religiously until,
about four months later, he started feeling weak and eating began
to make him vomit. He had contracted hepatitis A, which forced him
to interrupt his medication again.
 &HT;    When he recovered two weeks later, Jessen advised him to resume
taking his HIV drugs. Curiously, the virus didn't come back as it
had during his testicular infection.
 &HT;    But it wasn't the lab tests that ultimately persuaded the Berlin
patient to take the dangerous step of ending his drug regimen.
 &HT;    ``When the hepatitis stopped,'' he says, leaning forward, ``I
felt so healthy. I remember especially one evening. I was listening
to some music, and it was really, really cold _ it was November _
but I opened the windows and I was breathing and I thought: `My
body, it's OK. Everything's fine.'''
 &HT;    After that he took his pills only half-heartedly. ``One day I
took all of them,'' he laughs, ``and the next day it was only two,
and some days I really took nothing.''
 &HT;    Jessen calls his patient a ``dream boy.'' Indeed, he relies on
intuition and feeling more than logic and fact. And before becoming
infected, he had never known anyone with HIV, and no one close to
him had ever died. So he is totally sincere when he says he was
``not so surprised'' that his virus didn't come back, because ``it
was almost my will to become healthy.''
 &HT;    With 400 AIDS patients under his care, Jessen couldn't afford to
be so naive. When the Berlin patient admitted, just before
Christmas 1996, that he wasn't taking his medicine regularly,
Jessen told him, ``This is not a good idea.''
 &HT;    Jessen tried to bargain, proposing that his patient postpone his
decision for a few more months. ``But he said he had definitely
decided,'' Jessen remembers with resignation. ``What could I do?''
 &HT;    Yet Jessen realized that something fascinating was happening in
his patient. The virus should have already come back. Indeed, a
concurrent infection such as hepatitis normally stirs up HIV. So
Jessen said: ``You must come at least twice a month to the office.
You owe me that.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient has certainly fulfilled his debt to science,
according to Dr. Franco Lori, the principal scientist working on
his case and director of the Research Institute for Genetic and
Human Therapy in Washington and Pavia, Italy. Lori once joked that
the reason the Berlin patient has virtually no virus left is that
researchers have removed it all by drawing so much blood.
 &HT;    Yet he feels no larger debt, no new lease on life. ``I really
did not suffer,'' he says. ``Only the pills reminded me I was
ill.''
 &HT;    Lori first presented the Berlin patient's case at a September
1997 conference organized by the lab of Dr. Robert Gallo,
co-discoverer of HIV. Two similar cases had already been reported
in the British medical journal The Lancet, but many researchers
doubted those cases.
 &HT;    The lead scientist _ Dr. Jorge Vila, medical director at the
French drug company Compagnie de Developpement Aguettant in Lyons _
isn't well known to AIDS researchers. And Vila's two patients had
such small amounts of virus in their blood before starting therapy
that scientists even speculated that they might not have been
infected at all. (The Berlin patient had a substantial infection,
verified by two separate tests.)
 &HT;    But now there is growing evidence of more cases. David Ho
revealed in an interview that he is following two patients who,
like the Berlin patient, started treatment soon after they were
infected and then decided to stop therapy against medical advice.
 &HT;    Their virus, Ho says, has not returned ``in a detectable way
with traditional tests.'' He declined to give additional details
until he has studied them in more depth.
 &HT;    And Vila now says that he has eight additional patients who have
had no detectable HIV rebound three to 12 months after stopping
their medication. One was treated early, but the others are what
are known as A1 patients, meaning they have suffered no AIDS
symptoms and retain relatively strong immune systems.
 &HT;    All of them started therapy with blood tests showing HIV counts
of less than 10,000, a low number. None of these 10 new cases have
been formally presented in scientific conferences or journals. But
if they hold up, there could be 13 patients who are suppressing HIV
after stopping treatment.
 &HT;    ``That's not a trend,'' says Dr. Beatrice Hahn, a University of
Alabama AIDS researcher, ``but it's more than an anecdote. These
are some of the most important patients to study.''
 &HT;    The Berlin patient is the best documented of all, and clinical
trials are about to begin that, in essence, try to repeat certain
key elements of his case. As it stands, his luck is still
unexplained _ and still provisional.
 &HT;    ``I don't think the virus will come back,'' he says. ``We have a
German phrase for my situation, `uber den Berg','' over the hump.
``It's finished for me.''
 &HT;    Perhaps. But he must continue practicing safe sex because he
might still be infectious, and he went to his first HIV support
group only after he had stopped taking drugs and had suppressed the
virus. ``Once you are HIV-positive,'' he explains, less naive now,
``the virus is always in you.''

 By PHILIP CAPUTO  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    He sniffs the cigarettes first, draws them lengthwise under his
nose and then lights them one after the other, the smoke curling in
the soft bronze light that flows through his west window.
 &HT;    ``River light,'' the novelist John Cheever called that
luminescence peculiar to New York City mornings.
 &HT;    It does seem to rise off the Hudson before it enters the room
where Wei Jingsheng sits and talks about the regime that imprisoned
him for all but a few months of the last 18 years, before releasing
him into exile in November.
 &HT;    ``The Chinese Communist Party is indeed the evil empire,'' he
says, echoing President Reagan. ``If the Soviet Union was the evil
empire, then the Chinese Communist regime is an even greater one _
or at least a slyer one.''
 &HT;    That's a reference to the recent scandals involving the
satellite industry and campaign contributions by Chinese nationals
to the Democratic Party.
 &HT;    ``The Chinese government is continuously trying to spread its
influence and build its strength,'' he says. ''The Chinese
Communists have always used these methods. Perhaps only now with
this evidence will more Americans pay more attention to it, and to
their schemes. It should serve as a very clear warning.''
 &HT;    Under the circumstances, Wei says, President Clinton clearly
should have canceled his trip to China.
 &HT;    ``I believe Clinton, under these conditions, should not go.
Clinton has not said what he plans to say or do, so I feel that he
won't stray from the path of the wishes of the Chinese Communists.
If he doesn't say clearly what he will do, then I believe it is a
mistake to go under these conditions.
 &HT;    ``If he does finally appear at Tiananmen Square _ although I
think that would be a major political mistake _ then he should
state clearly his support for the struggle, his sympathy for those
who were killed and injured and his commitment to pressing for the
release of the democracy activists still in prison. If he doesn't
do these things, then his appearance may damage his standing in the
eyes of every single Chinese. He should not adhere to the
conditions attached by the Communists.''
 &HT;    The president's trip is a kind of benchmark for Wei, who, with
Wang Dan, a leading figure in the 1989 Tiananmen Square uprising,
shares billing as China's most famous dissident. Clinton's presence
in China, surrounded by his beaming hosts, provides a platform that
has been largely missing in Wei's seven months of exile. The
attention could help him press his campaign against Clinton's
policy of ``engagement'' and cement his position as the primary
spokesman for the dissidents. But it could just as easily backfire,
if his ideas are brushed aside or, as Beijing so fervently hopes,
dismissed as irrelevant.
 &HT;    Certainly, Wei is not silent; his recorded message to a crowd of
thousands in Hong Kong in early June _ commemorating the ninth
anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre _ made headlines
around the world. But the questions linger: How many are listening?
Whom does he speak for? And not just in the West, but in China as
well. More immediately, did Wei make the right decision when he
relented and accepted Beijing's offer of exile?
 &HT;    To most people, there would have been no choice whatsoever:
whether to remain in prison or to accept an offer of medical parole
and exile. But Wei is not like most people.
 &HT;    If he were, he never would have been imprisoned in the first
place, for the crime of speaking his mind. He never would have
endured, merely for refusing to recant his belief in democracy,
solitary confinement in a cell where a bright light burned 24 hours
a day, frequent beatings from other inmates and conditions so
abysmal that he lost a dozen teeth and contracted high blood
pressure, heart disease, arthritis and hepatitis during his two
separate incarcerations.
 &HT;    In 1995, at the beginning of his second prison term, he was made
an offer that few thought he could refuse: He would be freed if he
accepted exile in the United States. He had become an international
cause celebre and the regime of President Jiang Zemin wanted to be
rid of him.
 &HT;    He had written, besides his incendiary public essays,
impertinent (and often humorous) letters to Deng Xiaoping, China's
late paramount leader, and was now making Jiang his new pen pal.
 &HT;    Execution was one option, but Wei was too famous to be dealt
with so crudely. China wanted trade with the West, and
international respectability. Clearly, the only thing to do with
Wei was to export him. But he declined the offer, not once but
twice.
 &HT;    ``Wei didn't want to leave China because by being there, he
would be a player,'' explains Philip Cunningham, a journalist and
China scholar who edited a collection of Wei's prison letters to
Deng and Jiang. ``He wanted to be there even in jail rather than
free in exile because the danger of exile is that you become
irrelevant.''
 &HT;    But last fall, Wei finally accepted banishment. On Nov. 16,
1997, he was released from prison, taken to a Northwest Airlines
plane in Beijing and flown to the United States.
 &HT;    What made him change his stand? We are in the small but
comfortable apartment he occupies at Columbia University, where he
is a visiting scholar. He is a stocky man of about 5 feet 8 or 9
inches, 48 years old, with a full head of black hair. There is no
hint of gray. His youthful, robust appearance is miraculous,
considering what he has been through.
 &HT;    ``Two reasons,'' he answers through an interpreter. ``My health
was quickly deteriorating. So I had two choices. One was to leave
the country, the other to die in prison. I felt there was no reason
for me to die in prison for no worthy cause.''
 &HT;    Wei slips another Marlboro out of the pack and lights up. ``The
second, which is more important, is that in recent years, the
position of the Western countries toward the Chinese Communist
Party has been softening, which has dealt a blow to the confidence
of the Chinese people. It is important for me to come out and tell
Western governments the real situation, the realities in China and
what effective roles they can play, and also to convey what the
Chinese people would really like to say to the people of the
Western countries.''
 &HT;    That ought to be enough to keep 10 men busy. But after some
thought, Wei gives me a third reason: He hopes to coordinate the
activities of pro-democracy dissidents abroad.
 &HT;    In effect, he would become the leader of the dissident movement,
which could be far more difficult than persuading Western
governments to amend their China policies. The 500 or so active
dissidents in this country are hopelessly fragmented by petty
squabbles, jealousies and differences in opinion about how best to
deal with Beijing.
 &HT;    It's a difficult agenda for a man who has little support other
than his name and the enormous respect and good will it commands.
Columbia provides Wei with an office and clerical assistance, but
he does not teach or lecture on a regular basis. Rising at 9 a.m.,
he usually works late into the night, conferring with other
dissidents.
 &HT;    Wei is determined not to retire to the scholar's cloister, as
many other exiled dissidents have done. And yet, looking at him,
dressed in slippers, a beige cotton shirt and gray trousers held up
by black suspenders, his legs folded on a threadbare couch as he
sips tea and smokes and smokes, it is hard to picture him
maneuvering in the corridors of power.
 &HT;    He has tried, but to little effect. This winter, he traveled to
London, Paris and Brussels, where he lobbied the European Union to
ratify a U.N. resolution condemning China's human-rights record. In
the spring, after the 15-nation European Union voted not even to
introduce the resolution, much less to pass it, Wei embarked on a
12-nation, seven-week tour of European capitals, calling on foreign
secretaries and members of parliament to explain their decision.
 &HT;    He fared no better with the Clinton administration, which in a
reversal of longstanding policy, also withdrew support for the
resolution this year. And now, in a further disappointment, Clinton
is visiting China.
 &HT;    To Wei, there is no compromise with Beijing, no engagement and
no partnership.
 &HT;    ``Clinton has an opportunity. I want him to make his support for
human rights and democracy clear. If he does not do this, then he
will not help the movement and he will not help the standing of
himself and the United States in the eyes of the Chinese people. I
think that Clinton's use of the word `partnership' is completely
wrong, since the Chinese Communists use the word `enemy' in
describing the United States. I don't think the American people
want a partner like the Chinese Communists.''
 &HT;    When Wei speaks, his baritone barely changes inflection and,
whatever may be going on inside him, he gives an outward impression
of serenity. Yet the position he has staked out for himself is
nearly impossible. Here is a man without a political party or power
of any kind beyond the moral authority vouchsafed by his
sufferings, appointing himself roving ambassador for one-fifth of
the world's population, trying to shape American foreign policy. I
wonder if I'm in the presence of a Chinese Don Quixote, or a man
who could become to China what Vaclav Havel is to the Czech
Republic or Nelson Mandela is to South Africa.
 &HT;    There is a certain purity about Wei, but it's hard to tell
sometimes if it is the purity of an egomaniac or a saint. Others
have commented on Wei's saintly qualities: his lack of bitterness,
his heroic readiness to sacrifice himself on the altar of
principle, his unflagging composure.
 &HT;    But in time, I realize that Wei is neither saint nor egomaniac.
He is a man of integrity _ integrity in its fundamental meaning: He
is united within himself. God knows, he had plenty of time, in the
isolation of his cell, to think things through. He has emerged as a
man with a seamless confidence in himself and in the truth of his
ideas.
 &HT;    Wei has hundreds, if not thousands, of admirers and supporters
in the West. Among many Chinese dissidents, he is an icon. Even
those who disagree with his views on China are in awe of his
courage and his ability to write and argue in clear, direct,
forceful language.
 &HT;    But will that be enough? Now that Wei is out of prison and no
longer a myth, there are dissidents as well as Western diplomats
and scholars who think that his ideas are outdated and that Wei
himself, though unquestionably a hero, is a hero from a bygone era.
They question whether he is the right candidate to lead the
dissident movement and to convey realities in China to Western
leaders.
 &HT;    They say that Wei, having been isolated for so long, clings to
views and rhetoric frozen in the amber of the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The more Wei speaks out, the more he reveals that he doesn't
know the current situation,'' says Merle Goldman, a professor of
Chinese history at Boston University and an expert on the dissident
movement. ``Through no fault of his own _ he was in prison for all
but a few months of the last 18 years _ he has no clear idea what
is going on in China or abroad.''
 &HT;    The China of the 1990s is not the China of the 1970s under Mao,
she notes. A rudimentary democracy has taken hold at the village
level, where elections have been held this year. Although open
dissent is still prohibited, citizens privately criticize the
government in ways that would have been unthinkable 25 years ago.
It is a much more prosperous and at least somewhat freer country.
 &HT;    When I mention to her that Wei has said that ``millions of
workers and peasants in China are truly starving,'' she exclaims,
``That's not true!'' and adds that Wei's penchant for injudicious
comments like that could undermine his credibility.
 &HT;    Wei's defenders say it's too early to judge him, after only a
little more than seven months in exile.
 &HT;    ``We're honoring him for his courage, not necessarily because
he's an astute politician,'' says Robert Bernstein, the founding
chairman of Human Rights Watch. ``We don't know about that yet. Wei
has sacrificed for his ideas and deserves a chance. Besides, it
never hurts to put pressure on the regime.''
 &HT;    Chen Xiaoping, a 36-year-old former journalist and law professor
now studying at Harvard, was forced to leave China because of his
pro-democracy activities. He says the youngest dissidents _ of whom
Wang Dan is the most prominent _ almost literally don't understand
the language that Wei speaks.
 &HT;    When Wei gave a talk at Harvard, Chen says, ``Some students
asked him: `Where are you coming from? This is traditional, not
modern discourse.' He was talking like somebody from the Cultural
Revolution.
 &HT;    ``Wei is too old,'' Chen adds flatly. ``In jail for 18 years,
and because he was in prison for such a long time, he cannot
understand the modern China.''
 &HT;    The obvious implication is that the 29-year-old Wang, who was
serving an 11-year sentence when released to American doctors this
spring, understands China better _ the China, that is, of young
entrepreneurs bearing cell phones instead of Mao's little red book.
Wang's opinion on Clinton's visit does seem to be more nuanced than
Wei's.
 &HT;    ``I feel extremely uncomfortable when I think about President
Clinton walking on Tiananmen Square,'' Wang says. ``But I
understand that United States policy toward China should represent
the interests of the American people. I just hope it also
represents the moral standards of the American people.''
 &HT;    Aware of the force his words carry in the dissident community,
Wang, who is spending the summer at Harvard, adds diplomatically:
``Both Mr. Wei Jingsheng and I believe that to promote a peaceful
transformation toward democracy in China, international influence
is crucial.''
 &HT;    Almost no one disagrees with Wei's objectives: building a China
where people aren't arrested without charges and tortured in
prison, where workers trying to organize independent labor unions
aren't crushed and freedom of speech and expression are not
repressed.
 &HT;    Besides, as Bernstein points out, it's not as though the younger
dissidents are accomplishing any more than Wei.
 &HT;    ``They aren't getting results either,'' he says. ``Of course
there's more economic freedom. Of course the party is giving ground
politically _ it has no choice.''
 &HT;    The difference between Wei and his loyal critics is in figuring
out how to get there from here. For Wei, the correct approach _ the
only approach _ is to get tough. But this does not mean the
complete suspension of relations, says Xiao Qiang of the
organization Human Rights in China.
 &HT;    ``We don't want to fall into the trap of isolation versus
engagement,'' he says. ``We want a strong and effective
human-rights policy, on an equal footing with trade and security
policy.''
 &HT;    Wei puts it more succinctly. Dealing with China, he says, is
like dealing with a ``scoundrel on the street'': the nicer you are,
the more likely you are to get mugged.
 &HT;    But he will lose credibility if he doesn't catch up on all that
happened in the world while he was in prison. In the words of
Cunningham, Wei's editor, Wei may not be a ``first-class
intellectual,'' but of all the prominent dissidents, he has ``the
appeal and spirit, the personality and the charisma, all the
credentials to unify that fractious movement.''
 &HT;    It does neither himself nor his cause any good to paint Jiang's
China in the chiaroscuro pigments of Mao's China, where people,
literally, were forced to devour their children.

STRINGS OF DESIRE: TACOMA GUITARS INSTUMENTS ARE IN DEMAND

 By KRUTI TRIVEDI  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Weyand, president of Pacific Music in Redmond, Wash., must
answer the same question day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Customers enter his guitar store. They look around, imagine
themselves on the next cover of Rolling Stone and pick up one of
the more than 200 guitars in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, they stumble over to what Weyand says is his
best-selling brand _ Tacoma Guitars.
</P>
<P>
   And then they ask the question: ``Tacoma Guitars _ is it really
in Tacoma?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the top four makers of acoustic guitars in the United
States, Tacoma Guitars is tucked into the side of the road a little
past a Boeing plant, but the 60,000-square-foot facility is
officially in Tacoma, south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months since its inception, the subsidiary of Korean
piano maker Young Chang has broken into an industry dominated by
longtime giants.
</P>
<P>
   It started making a profit when it celebrated its first birthday
six months ago. Revenue for this year is expected to be about $4
million to $5 million, according to John Hawkins, director of
company sales and worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue of Music &AMP; Sound Retailer rates three models
of Tacoma Guitars among the best 10 acoustic guitars sold for more
than $700.
</P>
<P>
   No other guitar manufacturer has as many on the list, and two of
the three Tacoma Guitars models are the least expensive of those
listed.
</P>
<P>
   Local retailers say Tacoma Guitars are in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Tacomas go, they come in and they go out as quickly
as I can get them,'' Weyand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold them to all walks of life,'' said Jimmy Thomas,
manager of American Music in Fremont. ``I have guys who work at
Microsoft who have them in their office because it's a good way to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Tacomas cost $479 to $2,200. It may seem pricey, but it's still
less than most custom guitars, which, according to Ron Reed, sales
manager at Dusty Springs in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood, can
cost as much as $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like buying a tailor-made suit as opposed to an
off-the-shelf suit,'' said Stephen Davies, president of Stephen's
Stringed Instruments in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Off the shelf seems to be working just fine for Tacoma Guitars'
customers. The company is planning to manufacture between 11,000
and 12,000 units this year, and usually has about 2,000 guitars on
back order. Hawkins just hired a second shift of workers to keep up
with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars' mass production techniques turn out a guitar far
quicker than the weeks to years it takes to make a custom guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very high-tech company in a very low-tech business. It
allows us to sell guitars at a much better value,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   While the company employs 85 people, it relies on computers for
many tasks. For example, a machine cuts the wood used in the
guitar. Many custom guitar makers cut the wood themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars also uses a machine to suck out the excess glue.
Custom makers often remove the glue by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mass production does have its disadvantages, according to custom
guitar makers. Davies _ whose company makes electric guitars, not
acoustics _ says mass production has some shortcomings regardless
of the type of guitar being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to, no matter what, put out cookie-cutter
instruments,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have two pieces of wood from the same tree, but they
can be different'' in sound, Reed said. By inspecting each piece of
wood, he said custom makers optimize sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins emphasizes that his guitars are the best quality guitars
produced at a specific, midlevel price range.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than machinery to their success, said George
Gruhn, owner of Gruhn's Guitars in Nashville, Tenn., who has been
involved with the company from the time it was formed.
</P>
<P>
   And the beginning was all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars already had a facility for making guitars and
easy access to much of the wood it would need for those
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Young Chang America Timber, whose parent company is the piano
maker Young Chang Korea, was located in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, it opened a facility next to the timber company,
where it started making guitars for other guitar companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, President J.C. Kim decided it made sense
for the facility to start making its own brand-name guitars.
</P>
<P>
   He hired John Hawkins to be its director of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, who had been in the music industry for more than 20
years, left Tacoma's Illinois-based competitor Washburn Guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins linked up with Gruhn, one of the world's authorities on
vintage guitars. Gruhn already was well known for selling guitars _
his own shop has more than 700 guitars on the floor _ but he wanted
to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   Gruhn wanted a guitar that used a different design. Hawkins was
looking for just that.
</P>
<P>
   A unique design, he reasoned, would help the company break into
the guitar business and compete with other manufacturers that had
decades of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they produced a small guitar, the Papoose, tuned at
the higher note A instead of E, at which most guitars are tuned.
</P>
<P>
   The Papoose, like its successors, uses voiced support bracing, a
special bracing system that Hawkins says improves sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a comma-shaped sound hole in the upper right hand
side of the body instead of a round sound hole in the middle of the
guitar body.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences didn't stop with design.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars didn't send its new product to stores and then
pore over the sales results. Instead, Gruhn was given about 50
Papoose guitars in November 1996. He handed them out to musicians
he knew, entertainers such as Ricky Skaggs and Bela Fleck. Soon
enough, Hawkins said he had proof his idea was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists all pretty much gravitated toward it,'' Hawkins
said. ``The word we got back was, `This is great. Do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The move was a smart one. Gruhn said new companies often find it
difficult to get recognition from customers and dealers. By giving
guitars to musicians, Tacoma Guitars targeted a younger audience
that was used to buying guitars based on name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to go for whatever their idol is playing,'' Gruhn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to continue expanding. Six more models will
debut next month, bringing the company's count to 23.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Weyand will stop having to answer the same question
every day.

CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS URGE CAUTION AMID SURGE OF DROWNINGS

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Summer is here and officials are reminding
people who want to cool off that a serene swim at the beach can
turn to terror in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, six people died in three separate drowning
incidents in the San Francisco area.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards are rare despite a massive, El Nino-bred snowmelt
that has turned creeks and rivers into turbulent highways of death.
Ocean beaches _ with few exceptions _ are made hazardous by
pernicious rip currents that can suck a swimmer or a wader into
deep, cold water far from shore.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, two women and a 13-year-old boy were swept to
their deaths at Ocean Beach in San Francisco. The women, believed
to be in their early 30s, were apparently wading when they were
pulled away from shore by an unusually potent riptide.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was knocked over by a wave later that day. He
disappeared into the water.
</P>
<P>
   Two men, said to be good swimmers, disappeared into the Napa
River after a speedboat in which they were passengers was struck by
a wave and overturned. The search for David Snowden and Jeff
Emerson, in their early 20s, was abandoned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Four teen-age girls wading in Niles Creek near Pleasanton were
caught in a perilous undertow. Three escaped, but the fourth,
17-year-old Stacey Feuychieng Saechin of Richmond, drowned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three rafters drowned Monday in the Cosumnes River,
where the rapids were so intense they ripped the victims' clothing
off.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine people have died in rafting accidents in Northern
California since last week. Investigators attribute the accidents
to cold, fast water and debris-filled rivers _ the result of runoff
from the Sierra Nevada snowpack.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, five people were killed on noncommercial
rafting trips, said David Johnson of the state Department of
Boating and Waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The record for such fatalities was in 1993, when 12 people died,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching those numbers very quickly, and the season
has just started,'' he said. ``It's pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The rivers will subside when the snowpack disappears later this
summer. But beaches will always be treacherous, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only place we actually encourage people to swim is Stinson
Beach (in Marin County), and we encourage that only when lifeguards
are present,'' said Tracy Fortmann of the Golden Gate National
Recreation District, which manages many beaches _ including Ocean
Beach _ in San Francisco and Marin.
</P>
<P>
   She said 10 people drowned at Ocean Beach in the past 10 years,
although in some stretches of one to four years no drownings were
recorded there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocean Beach is one of the most notorious beaches in California
because of the fact that large volumes of water from the northwest
that are generated by wind swells and storms hit Ocean Beach,''
said Matt Ehmann, a Park Service ranger. ``And they are unabated by
any land masses.''

</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-SUIT (Washington) _ An appeals court lifts the
preliminary injunction against Microsoft, meaning that the company
is again free to market its Internet Explorer browser with Windows
95. The court also dismisses from the antitrust case the special
master, Michael Lessig of Harvard, who had been accused by
Microsoft of being biased against the company. By Joel Brinkley.

   &UR; China &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PIRACY (Shanghai) _ The authorities have begun a crackdown
on many of the illegal activities that are ordinarily tolerated
these days, like the sale of pirated video and music compact disks.
The fight against piracy of software, music and movies, an issue
that loomed large in China-U.S. relations a few years ago, has been
pushed in the background and is unlikely to be raised seriously
during President Clinton's visit, even though it remains as rampant
a problem as ever. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-MISSILES (Washington) _ As Clinton prepares to leave for
China, Senate votes on a measure to shift satellite licensing
authority back to the State Department from the Commerce
Department; a House hearing into sensitive technology transfers to
China continues; and several Capitol Hill news conferences are held
criticizing China's record on human rights and other issues. By
Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-VISAS (Washington) _ China cancels visas of three
reporters from Radio Free Asia, upsetting the administration and

   CHINA-PEONY (Shanghai) _ The latest developments in the ``Peony
Pavilion'' contretemps, with a Chinese dance company's plans for a
U.S. and world tour blocked. By Seth Faison.

   We are also considering stories on Clinton's press treatment in

pass his ``anti-crisis'' package of economic measures to satisfy
the IMF, setting stage for new political confrontation. By Michael
R. Gordon.

   KOREA-SUBMARINE (Tokyo) _ South Korea protests the incursion of

bottom. By Nicholas D. Kristoff.

1980s to conduct illegal counterterrorism against armed Basque
separatists.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   SCI-AIDS-REPORT (Geneva) _ U.N. officials on Tuesday painted one
of the gloomiest pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first
recognized in 1981. In its first country-by-country analysis,
released on the eve of the 12th international AIDS conference, they
said that 30 million people were now infected with HIV, the AIDS
virus, and that the majority were doomed to die because they live
in countries that cannot provide adequate health care. HIV now
infects one in four adults in two African countries, Botswana and
Zimbabwe. HIV-infection rates exceed one-third of the adults in
some major African cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in
pre-natal clinics. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (``w'' code)
</P>
<P>
   CENSUS-APPOINT (Washington) _ President Clinton names a new head
of the Census Bureau, and Republicans immediately make it clear
that they will use his confirmation hearings as a new battleground
in the war over administration's plan to estimate the nation's
population using statistical sampling. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Developments in Kenneth Starr's
investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   (See also REPORTERS-PROSECUTORS, below.)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ The appropriations committee on
Labor and HHS is making a frontal attack on the president's agenda,
cutting spending on Head Start, summer jobs, energy assistance,
education initiatives and other programs. Democrats say, now that
the tobacco bill is dead, Republicans are trying to take money
anywhere they can. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   WETLANDS-DEVELOP (Washington) _ The Army Corps of Engineers
proposes a new permitting system to make it easier for developers
to gain permission to build houses, offices and shopping malls on
wetlands. By John H. Cushman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL GENERAL &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   REPORTERS-PROSECUTORS (Undated) _ It is one of the least talked
about corners of journalism: the relationship of reporters and
their prosecution sources. But the debate in recent days over how
much and what kind of information the independent counsel Kenneth
W. Starr gave reporters about his investigation of the president
has put an uncomfortable spotlight on the ties between journalists
and prosecutors, which often lead to information, and sometimes, to
misinformation. By William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-FIRES (Dateline to kum) _ Desert-like dryness and heat have
led to one of the worst outbreaks of wildfires in Florida in more
than 50 years. The blazes have destroyed more than 100 homes and
structures, damaged an estimated $10 million in commercial timber
and left a smoky haze in cities such as Jacksonville, Daytona
Beach, Tallahassee and Orlando. The dry conditions have caused an
additional $100 million in damage to corn, hay, soybean,
watermelon, peanut, cotton and tobacco crops. By Mireya Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   MAYORS-CONFERENCE (Reno, Nev.) _ A reporters notebook on the
conference of mayors. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   HANTAVIRUS (Denver) _ The Hantavirus is back. El Nino has
brought increased vegetation and lots of deer mice. Two people have
died. By James Brooke.

<P>
   &UR; Other financial &LR;  (``f'' code)
</P>
<P>
   TEMP-EXECS (Undated) _ Many executives are signing up to be, in
effect, temps. They go into a company as a high-ranking executive
for a short period to fix problems for a daily rate. In short, they
like to make changes and move on, rather than manage a stable
situation or languish in the hierarchy of some larger corporation
worrying about office politics. The use of so-called interim
managers is not new, but with companies facing more pressure from
shareholders to act quickly, and with the process of finding a new
chief executive growing more complicated and involved, demand for
temporary help at the highest levels is growing.

COMPANY HELPS WORKERS GET INSIDE LOOK AT PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hunting for a job is a lot like being in fifth
grade. You keep hearing this voice: ``Do your homework. Do your
homework. Do your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   It was annoying then and it's annoying now, but every job
hunting guru will tell you that understanding a company and an
industry is crucial, especially when you're applying for a job. You
want to know what you're getting into _ or, in some cases, stepping
into.
</P>
<P>
   You know the usual tools, but now there's something new to call
on, at least for major employers and high-profile industries, such
as investment banking, management consulting and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Vault Reports of New York publishes employer profiles _ some
longer than 50 pages _ plus industry guides based on more than
25,000 surveys and interviews with workers. The industry guides
generally are $35, and company reports cost anywhere from $25 for a
large one to $5 for a three-page ``snapshot.'' Details are
available at www.vaultreports.com or 888-562-8285.
</P>
<P>
   The reports don't just tell you that Microsoft makes software
and Intel does something with chips; they offer comments about what
the company does, how to get hired and what employees consider to
be strengths and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel expects you to speak your mind and express your
viewpoint,'' one person says in the 144-page high-tech industry
guide (all the sources in Vault Reports are anonymous). ``But once
a decision is made, you must back it 100 percent and do what you
can to make your project a success. Office politics and project
sabotage is not tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The section on Intel mentions strong advantages like paid
sabbaticals and stock options, and warns about boring meetings and
cramped cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people like the locations of the offices, but I am in
Chandler, Ariz., and I can't wait to move,'' one worker says.
``It's a big desert full of scorpions, including my manager.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry guide looks at more than 30 high-tech companies,
giving you a flavor for what it's like to work at each. Although
many companies, including Intel, are regarded as among the best
places in America to work, both the positive and negative comments
can help you understand whether you would fit in _ and might raise
some questions worth asking in a job interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hewlett-Packard can pick and choose the best applicants, but
its focus on teamwork and communication strongly affect its hiring
practices,'' Vault says. ``Antisocial engineers who get along
better with their hard drives than their neighbors should probably
seek employment elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, it adds, ``As pleased as H-P employees are with the
quality and integrity of their co-workers, they say `the office
atmosphere deters interaction between them.' In fact, at a company
where job satisfaction is extremely high, the lack of social
contact between workers is one of the biggest complaints.''
</P>
<P>
   For each company, the guide has an information box with the
basics, including a few ``uppers and downers'' about working there.
Sometimes the uppers are a little trivial, like free soda at Excite
or ``cute boxes'' at Gateway 2000, and Vault Reports needs more
consistency in listing the uppers and downers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``industry instability'' was a downer for Yahoo,
which specializes in searching the World Wide Web, but was not
listed for Excite, which also specializes in searching the Web. And
the only company described as having an ``uncertain future'' was
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some comments can open your eyes or make you think of
questions. Bay Networks' listing says it has on-site fitness
facilities and ``inter-office clashes,'' Broderbund's says it has
flex time and a ``high turnover rate,'' and IBM's mentions health
benefits to partners of gay and lesbian employees.
</P>
<P>
   One serious weakness is that there is little objective data,
like a checklist of which benefits are offered by which companies.
Is IBM the only company offering health benefits to partners of
gays and lesbians, or just the only one that had an employee
mention it to Vault? The reader has no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Vault gives you insight that you might not find anywhere
else. And it makes homework a lot more fun than it was in fifth
grade.

WEBER BARBECUE BROUGHT 30 YEARS OF SEAR PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boy, they just don't build 'em like they used to. After just a
tad over 30 years, our Weber barbecue grill died.
</P>
<P>
   Basic black, charcoal-fired, grease-encrusted, patched-together,
jury-rigged backyard grill just bit the dust during this past
weekend's Father's Day cookout. Like many of us old-timers, its
legs gave out . . . separated from the body just as I was loading
it with some ribs and chicken.
</P>
<P>
   We managed to cook without spilling the meal _ not that we
haven't had to brush off some grass clippings, mulch, dirt and a
little gravel from previously spilled barbecues _ and left it
there, a burned-out hulk.
</P>
<P>
   There should be some sort of ceremony, some honor attaching to a
consumer product having lasted that long in this era of disposable
goods. We held onto it partly because we are from a time when
parents and grandparents recited: Use it up; wear it out. Make it
do or do without. And the Weber lasted a whole lot longer than my
'51 Chevy or '72 Olds, which we kept going out of sheer necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three decades, we've burned everything from hot dogs
to turkeys and rib roasts on that Weber grill. We resisted the urge
to get a fancy-shmancy, gas-fired, cast-iron grill, opting instead
to ingest a goodly amount of hydrocarbons from charcoal and starter
liquid as we did our part to augment global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Our family has barbecued out in the yard since just after ``the
War,'' sometimes called ``The Big One,'' when Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co.
sold some folding-leg, thin-gauge grills that looked like cheap
suitcases and lasted about two or three seasons. Barbecuing was
convenient because Dad always had a ready supply of what we called
``real'' charcoal that tin-benders used to heat their soldering
irons.
</P>
<P>
   I inherited our father's uniquely blue-collar method of starting
the backyard grill: a cup of gasoline torched with a well-aimed
lighted match. This has accounted, over the years, for those times
when I came to work on Monday mornings without eyebrows or with
drastically shortened mustache and beard.
</P>
<P>
   The Weber was a gift from a friend back in Illinois when we
lived not far from where Webers are made. Initially, like old
Fords, they came only in basic black, and two or three sizes. But
they were considered the Cadillac of backyard grills, and we
certainly put the miles on ours.
</P>
<P>
   We did burnt bratwurst offerings to the gods of summer and we
did a few overly ambitious turkeys and rib roasts . . . just to say
that we did it. But my all-time favorite has been the Father's Day
rib barbecue. Tradition held that the man of the house was allowed
to spend the entire day barbecuing pork spareribs.
</P>
<P>
   To do this properly, coals were banked to one side with the help
of a Weber coal rail, and one rack of ribs was cooked while the
others were heaped off to one side, absorbing the sweet smoke.
Depending on the trendiness of the market choice, chips of
mesquite, alder, cherry or other woods _ some soaked overnight in a
water bucket _ were added to the coals.
</P>
<P>
   It took all day and a dozen or so bottles of beer to cook the
Father's Day meal, by the completion of which the ribs looked like
what was left of a herd of cloven-hoof animals hit by an asteroid,
and the cook looked well-done. And last weekend's was no exception,
except the cook was sober.
</P>
<P>
   There were harsh winter days back in northern Illinois when I
wanted to prove that backyard cooking was not a summer phenomenon,
and so I fired up the ol' Weber in some gawdawful weather and near
'bout froze my buns off. It was so cold during some of those
cookouts that the main dish was cold by the time I'd rushed it back
into the kitchen to something less than rave reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of these cookouts was not a pretty sight. And
cleaning the grill became a chore to be avoided, so it was easier
to buy a new grill top every year. The buildup of grease and ash
and sauce was occasionally scraped off the bottom half of the Weber
globe.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, I replaced the original set of plastic
grill wheels with some slightly larger plastic lawnmower wheels.
The handles began to fall off. It was well beyond garage-sale
material; it was the Old Family Retainer, kept on for having served
so well for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   The old grill will go to the county transfer station. After an
appropriate period of mourning, we may look for another, no doubt
slimmer and younger, model. But it won't be the same.

STRINGS OF DESIRE: TACOMA GUITARS INSTRUMENTS ARE IN DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary Weyand, president of Pacific Music in Redmond, Wash., must
answer the same question day after day.
</P>
<P>
   Customers enter his guitar store. They look around, imagine
themselves on the next cover of Rolling Stone and pick up one of
the more than 200 guitars in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, they stumble over to what Weyand says is his
best-selling brand _ Tacoma Guitars.
</P>
<P>
   And then they ask the question: ``Tacoma Guitars _ is it really
in Tacoma?''
</P>
<P>
   One of the top four makers of acoustic guitars in the United
States, Tacoma Guitars is tucked into the side of the road a little
past a Boeing plant, but the 60,000-square-foot facility is
officially in Tacoma, south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18 months since its inception, the subsidiary of Korean
piano maker Young Chang has broken into an industry dominated by
longtime giants.
</P>
<P>
   It started making a profit when it celebrated its first birthday
six months ago. Revenue for this year is expected to be about $4
million to $5 million, according to John Hawkins, director of
company sales and worldwide marketing.
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue of Music &AMP; Sound Retailer rates three models
of Tacoma Guitars among the best 10 acoustic guitars sold for more
than $700.
</P>
<P>
   No other guitar manufacturer has as many on the list, and two of
the three Tacoma Guitars models are the least expensive of those
listed.
</P>
<P>
   Local retailers say Tacoma Guitars are in high demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Tacomas go, they come in and they go out as quickly
as I can get them,'' Weyand said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've sold them to all walks of life,'' said Jimmy Thomas,
manager of American Music in Fremont. ``I have guys who work at
Microsoft who have them in their office because it's a good way to
relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Tacomas cost $479 to $2,200. It may seem pricey, but it's still
less than most custom guitars, which, according to Ron Reed, sales
manager at Dusty Springs in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood, can
cost as much as $8,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like buying a tailor-made suit as opposed to an
off-the-shelf suit,'' said Stephen Davies, president of Stephen's
Stringed Instruments in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Off the shelf seems to be working just fine for Tacoma Guitars'
customers. The company is planning to manufacture between 11,000
and 12,000 units this year, and usually has about 2,000 guitars on
back order. Hawkins just hired a second shift of workers to keep up
with the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars' mass production techniques turn out a guitar far
quicker than the weeks to years it takes to make a custom guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very high-tech company in a very low-tech business. It
allows us to sell guitars at a much better value,'' Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   While the company employs 85 people, it relies on computers for
many tasks. For example, a machine cuts the wood used in the
guitar. Many custom guitar makers cut the wood themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars also uses a machine to suck out the excess glue.
Custom makers often remove the glue by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Mass production does have its disadvantages, according to custom
guitar makers. Davies _ whose company makes electric guitars, not
acoustics _ says mass production has some shortcomings regardless
of the type of guitar being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to, no matter what, put out cookie-cutter
instruments,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have two pieces of wood from the same tree, but they
can be different'' in sound, Reed said. By inspecting each piece of
wood, he said custom makers optimize sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins emphasizes that his guitars are the best quality guitars
produced at a specific, midlevel price range.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more than machinery to their success, said George
Gruhn, owner of Gruhn's Guitars in Nashville, Tenn., who has been
involved with the company from the time it was formed.
</P>
<P>
   And the beginning was all-important.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars already had a facility for making guitars and
easy access to much of the wood it would need for those
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Young Chang America Timber, whose parent company is the piano
maker Young Chang Korea, was located in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, it opened a facility next to the timber company,
where it started making guitars for other guitar companies.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, President J.C. Kim decided it made sense
for the facility to start making its own brand-name guitars.
</P>
<P>
   He hired John Hawkins to be its director of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins, who had been in the music industry for more than 20
years, left Tacoma's Illinois-based competitor Washburn Guitars.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins linked up with Gruhn, one of the world's authorities on
vintage guitars. Gruhn already was well known for selling guitars _
his own shop has more than 700 guitars on the floor _ but he wanted
to try something new.
</P>
<P>
   Gruhn wanted a guitar that used a different design. Hawkins was
looking for just that.
</P>
<P>
   A unique design, he reasoned, would help the company break into
the guitar business and compete with other manufacturers that had
decades of experience.
</P>
<P>
   Together, they produced a small guitar, the Papoose, tuned at
the higher note A instead of E, at which most guitars are tuned.
</P>
<P>
   The Papoose, like its successors, uses voiced support bracing, a
special bracing system that Hawkins says improves sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a comma-shaped sound hole in the upper right hand
side of the body instead of a round sound hole in the middle of the
guitar body.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences didn't stop with design.
</P>
<P>
   Tacoma Guitars didn't send its new product to stores and then
pore over the sales results. Instead, Gruhn was given about 50
Papoose guitars in November 1996. He handed them out to musicians
he knew, entertainers such as Ricky Skaggs and Bela Fleck. Soon
enough, Hawkins said he had proof his idea was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The artists all pretty much gravitated toward it,'' Hawkins
said. ``The word we got back was, `This is great. Do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The move was a smart one. Gruhn said new companies often find it
difficult to get recognition from customers and dealers. By giving
guitars to musicians, Tacoma Guitars targeted a younger audience
that was used to buying guitars based on name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to go for whatever their idol is playing,'' Gruhn
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to continue expanding. Six more models will
debut next month, bringing the company's count to 23.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe Weyand will stop having to answer the same question
every day.

 &HT;    CLINTON'S CHINA TRIP RIVALS WOODROW WILSON'S IN LENGTH, IF NOT
POLITICAL RISK
 &HT;    With CHINA-DIG-$ADV24; CHINA-HISTBOX-$ADV24
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ President Bill Clinton arrives here Thursday to
kick off the longest presidential visit to any country in 79 years,
a voyage overshadowed by controversy and underscored by limited
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Since President Woodrow Wilson steamed to Paris in 1919 to
midwife the creation of the ill-fated League of Nations, no
American president has made such a long and extensive tour of a
single foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is sure to be trailed by Congressional criticism of his
policies, from human rights to technology transfers. But his
nine-day trip carries limited stated ambitions and is not likely to
put him at the same risk that Wilson took -- and lost.
</P>
<P>
   The idealistic Wilson spent more than two months negotiating in
France, then for his trouble got a congressional thumbs down on
American membership in the new international assembly he was
convinced could insure world peace.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other lengthiest presidential sojourns also were to
China. President Richard Nixon ended a quarter century of hostility
with the Chinese during his seven-day visit in 1972, and President
Ronald Reagan made a six-day trip in 1984 that was perceived as
mainly symbolic. However, it led to an unprecedented era of warming
in the two nations' relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip is caught in a cross-current of pressures.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, China's Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan called on
Clinton to end U.S. sanctions that were imposed after the Chinese
army violently suppressed the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy
movement.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, new measures were introduced in Congress to put
more punitive measures on China, including prohibiting U.S. visas
to any Chinese official who engaged in human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   This ancient capital of imperial China is an ideal place for
Clinton to open his nine-day tour at 7:30 p.m. China time (7:30
a.m. EDT) on Thursday. During the Tang Dynasty in 900 AD, Xian
(pronounced Shee-an) welcomed foreign dignitaries with the same
pomp and color that will greet the First Family Thursday when
drummers, pipers and lavishly-costumed dancers perform before the
romantic backdrop of the walled old city's south gate.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, Xian is not the focus of a single Congressional
gripe over administration policy. Nor has it been the seat of
government for the last 1,100 years, so the President can put off
for a couple days the talks with China's steel-willed leaders that
isn't expected to produce much substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there's a ceremonial significance,'' said Charles Wu,
the general manager of IBM China Co., Inc., speaking about the
potential impact of Clinton's trip. ``It may even surpass the
results the Reagan visit was able to generate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wu said he would be surprised at any big immediate
breakthroughs, such as clinching an agreement that would allow
China to enter the World Trade Organization (WTO). That has been
one of China's major goals of the visit, and negotiators from the
two sides were still plugging away at it this week.
</P>
<P>
   He would be happy, Wu said, if Clinton's tour creates sufficient
good feelings for the Chinese to ``shorten the cycle times'' for
U.S. companies to get approvals to conduct and expand operations
here.
</P>
<P>
   On the Chinese side, weapons expert Shen Dingli, director of
international programs at Shanghai's Fudan University, said he
believes the Americans also will be denied a priority item on their
wish-list -- China's signature on the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR).
</P>
<P>
   China had provisionally accepted the missile regime when it
prohibited transfer or sale to another country of missiles with a
range more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) and capability to carry
weapons of mass destruction. The updated protocol applies to
missiles of any range, which China has resisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``A missile can deliver warheads, conventional or
nuclear-tipped. A jet can also deliver bombs. So why only restrain
missiles and not other types of delivery techniques?'' he asked,
referring specifically to the U.S. F-16 fighter jets that America
sometimes sells abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You (Americans) can afford not to export missiles because you
can export warplanes, even to a part of China,'' said Shen, raising
another, and probably the primary, reason the Chinese are unwilling
to join the MTCR. Refusal is a bargaining tool to get the Americans
to stop selling F-16s to Taiwan, the island province that broke
away from China after the communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One potential agreement Shen cited is the addition of a
verification article to the protocol on biological weapons control.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington talk also has focused on the likelihood of both
sides agreeing to de-target nuclear missiles aimed at the other.
</P>
<P>
   And in Beijing a proposal is circulating for stabilizing the
precarious nuclear arms situation in the Indian subcontinent after
both India and Pakistan exploded nuclear weapons last month.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would end sanctions against Pakistan -- a friend of
China -- and give the country incentives to sign the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. The assumption is that helping Pakistan
upgrade its conventional weapons capability would convince it to
freeze its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Whether deals are struck or not, one clear aim of the White
House is sending Americans a new view of fast-changing life in
China, which the administration hopes would dilute criticism of
Clinton's policy of engaging with China despite its continuing poor
record on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   From here Clinton heads to Beijing for three days, with official
talks only scheduled for a few hours Saturday. There's free time to
extend discussions, when Clinton isn't climbing the Great Wall or
giving speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the presidential entourage departs for Shanghai,
then spends the day Thursday in the misty mountain splendor of
Guilin before heading on to Hong Kong that night. He departs China
on Friday night in time to be on American soil on the Fourth of
July.

<P>
   XIYANG, China _ This village was aghast in 1974 when farmer Yang
Zhifa accidentally dug into the vaults of terra cotta warriors, the
2,200-year-old Chinese time capsule that some call ``The Eighth
Wonder of the World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents scolded me, my wife also scolded me,'' Yang
recalled Tuesday. ``They said that I had broken a statue of a
god.''
</P>
<P>
   People around here have long since forgiven this 61-year-old
peasant with age-worn cheeks and tobacco-colored teeth.
</P>
<P>
   He's become a tourist attraction for visitors to the nearby city
of Xian, and he sits for hours at a local artifacts shop here
signing autographs for lines of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Yang's fame is likely to go global. Yang disclosed
that he has been invited to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton and
tell him about how his trusty shovel helped open an archaeological
attraction that rivals the Greek Parthenon and Egypt's Valley of
The Kings.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the terra cotta warriors museum, Wu Yonqi,
confirmed that Yang is likely to meet Clinton. ``Many visitors like
to meet the discoverer,'' Wu said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum director also disclosed that China is preparing a
special honor for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Wu said the museum staff has erected a red carpeted staircase
that will allow the Clintons to become the first foreign visitors
since 1993 to descend into the 700-foot-long underground ``Pit No.
1'' that contains the most perfectly preserved of the 7,500 terra
cotta warriors.
</P>
<P>
   Queen Elizabeth and President Ronald Reagan were granted access
to the same pit floor in the 1980s. But then in 1993, the pit where
the warriors stand was closed to all outsiders to avoid the risk of
damaging the artifacts, Wu said. Recent tourists and state visitors
have viewed the warriors only from an elevated platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``After careful consideration, we've decided to make an
exception for President Clinton,'' said Wu. ``The special staircase
(into the pit) will be removed immediately after his visit.''
</P>
<P>
   What Yang the Discoverer is preparing to tell Clinton is a
modern legend -- one that has been confirmed by Chinese
archaeologists as being authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1974, Yang was one of 400 members of the Xiyang
``production team,'' as villages were then called. Conditions on
their farm commune were grim because of a four-year dry spell, Yang
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They needed someone to drill a well because the wheat needed
water very much, so they asked me and another man,'' Yang recalled.
They struck water on their first try and were told to drill a
second well.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sunny day in March when Yang and his partner noticed
something odd. After digging for two days, they struck a layer of
red dirt they thought looked baked. ``I was confused,'' he said.
``Here, the earth is yellow.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, around midday, ``my shovel hit something,'' Yang
remembered. ``We thought it was a piece of pottery because it was
open at the top, like a vase.''
</P>
<P>
   They had dug through the top of an earth-and-wood structure
built by China's first emperor, the ruthless visionary Qin
Shihuang, who conquered eastern China's warring states in hopes of
building an empire that his descendants would rule for 10,000
years.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to achieve eternal life in an underworld of his own
creation, Qin has long been portrayed by historians as dragooned
tens of thousands of artisans to craft an underground city as his
tomb. Some chroniclers claimed it was complete with a bronze floor
and with rivers made of flowing mercury. Hundreds of workmen were
allegedly murdered later to keep the secret of what was inside.
</P>
<P>
   Though Qin's fabled city of the afterlife hasn't been fully
excavated, Yang stumbled on something in 1974 that will be hard for
any later discoverer to match.
</P>
<P>
   It was the buried war machine that Qin planned to command in his
next life: an army of bigger-than-life-sized terra cotta figures,
complete with chariots and swords and bronze arrows tipped with
lead poison.
</P>
<P>
   Yang foresaw none of this when his shovel hit the first
warrior's neck. All he could tell was that this was a very
strange-looking pot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started digging from the neck to the shoulders, the
earth became very soft, easier to dig.''
</P>
<P>
   Digging quickly, they soon uncovered an almost-intact terra
cotta warrior. They accidentally broke the left leg during the
digging, but they did manage to uncover the head that had gotten
separated from the neck. They also found a buried trove of ancient
bows and bronze arrows.
</P>
<P>
   The village was just 200 meters away, and word began to spread
when the two peasants walked home to eat lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Around the middle of that first day Yang and his partner decided
it would be best to lift the statue out of the hole so they could
go on with their task of well-digging.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't lift it. (The warriors weigh from 240 to 660
pounds each.)
</P>
<P>
   Yang and his partner decided to hack the terra-cotta statue into
pieces with their shovels. ``We had to break it into parts, so we
could lift it onto the surface,'' he said. ``Then we went on with
our digging.''

   After lunch, villagers slipped away from the fields to gawk. It
wasn't long before someone talked with an elderly woman neighbor
who believed in Buddhism. She immediately warned that this was
probably a buried figure of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
   That's when village opinion turned against Yang and his partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was not good to break a god,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Yang's boss at the ``production team'' intervened.
He reported the strange discovery to cultural officials in Lintong
County, who ordered Yang to send in the statue fragments for
analysis. The pieces filled three big wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   The well hole was turned over to the archaeologists, who were
given urgent orders to excavate the site without delay. Yang was
told to dig a third well 150 feet away, and this time he struck
water.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after the discovery of the first warrior, the Chinese
public was allowed into a big hangar-like museum structure that by
now holds hundreds of terra cotta warriors, lined up in solemn rows
to battle on behalf of the spirit of Emperor Qin.

   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton's nine-day trip that he
embarks on today to the People's Republic of China -- and returns
on July 3 _ is one of the longest single-country trips ever taken
by a modern-day American president.
</P>
<P>
   It is exceedingly rare for a president to spend so much time in
one country when there are no across-the-table negotiations,''
Henry Graff, a presidential historian at Columbia University said.
Historically, he said, such lengthy trips are limited to
``specific'' major policy dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of the longest single-country trips ever
taken by U.S. presidents:
</P>
<P>
   _ President Woodrow Wilson's trip to France from March 14 to
June 18 in 1919; where World War I ended with a peace treaty signed
at Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   _ President Richard M. Nixon's trip to China lasted seven days,
from Feb. 21-28, 1972 to establish relations with China.
</P>
<P>
   _ President Harry S Truman's trip to Potsdam, Germany from July
16 to Aug. 2, 1945 -- following the surrender of Germany in World
War II -- to decide the fate of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   _ President Franklin D. Roosevelt's trip to Yalta, Ukraine from
Feb. 4 to Feb. 11, 1945 for the Yalta Conference among the ``Big
Three'' -- Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and
Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin -- which positioned the allies against
Germany and later divided Germany into zones of occupation.

LANDLORDS MISS A CHANCE TO CASH IN ON MAN'S BEST FRIEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CORRIE M. ANDERS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ OK, so you're a landlord with a vacant
apartment, and a potential renter knocks on your door, holding the
leash on a massive Great Dane. You immediately envision a 150-pound
Godzilla wreaking havoc in your nice apartment.
</P>
<P>
   You don't much care for dogs in your building in the first
place, but you might have been swayed if it had been a Pekingese,
Chihuahua or some other little pooch. But no way this prospect at
the front door is getting the apartment, even if the dog is as
sweet as Marmaduke.
</P>
<P>
   That bias against large dogs is the prevailing attitude among
landlords around the country. Because of it, many owners are
missing an excellent chance to get premium rents while endearing
themselves to a largely untapped market of dog lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment owners who do accept dogs often have weight
limitations _ usually 20 pounds or less. That limit eliminates many
favorite breeds even though the rationale for the pet policy may
not have merit, according to Rob Foellinger, an apartment
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could explain to me where we got the idea we should
accept or reject pets based on weight. Why not do height? Let's do
color of eyes. It doesn't make any sense,'' said Foellinger,
president of MarkeTactics Consulting Group in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Foellinger surveyed 1,200 veterinarians, animal
trainers and humane societies to get a feeling for which canines
were most likely to cause damage in an apartment and which were
most likely to do well in an apartment. The response from 400 pet
professionals showed many landlords were barking up the wrong
breed.
</P>
<P>
   The best breeds for apartments were fairly large animals such as
retrievers, Dalmatians and collies, and only one on the top 10 list
was under 20 pounds. Small dogs dominated the worst 10 list,
including terriers, Pekingese, Chihuahuas and miniature poodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about temperament,'' said Foellinger, who has a
Dalmatian, ``but a lot of small dogs we welcome with open arms
suffer from separation anxiety, they bark all day, they're very
territorial and are more apt to bite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big dogs will drive you nuts, too,'' Foellinger said, ``but
try to get a golden retriever to bite anyone. His idea of a good
time is to lick five burglars at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Because ``no dog'' signs are as prevalent in cities as in the
suburbs, Amanda Kennedy considered herself super fortunate to find
an apartment in San Francisco, where there are so few rentals
available that landlords have carte blanche over whom they choose.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 45 days before Kennedy found an owner that would
accept her and Levi, her nearly 100-pound black Labrador. ``He's a
couch retriever. He's very calm and laid back,'' said Kennedy, an
art director. ``Unfortunately, landlords don't ask for pet
resumes.''
</P>
<P>
   They should. Apartment operators who cater to residents with big
dog outperform their competitors. Their apartments rent quicker,
they have fewer vacancies and they can charge higher rents,
according to apartment operators.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Greenhill Village apartments in Columbus, Ohio, which
runs huge ads that announce: ``We accept large dogs with good
credit; owners also welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 90 percent of the 228 units are rented by pet
lovers who pay $25 a month extra for their animals, which include
Great Danes, Labs and German shepherds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a difference in what a large dog or a small
dog does regarding damage,'' said Ana Morera, manager of the
apartment complex. ``All dogs scratch things up, but we don't have
that many problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Avalon-Bay Apartment communities, a national real estate company
that operates more than 35,000 luxury apartments on both coasts, is
taking an experimental look at studies showing large dogs may make
good house pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're testing that right now in five buildings,'' said John
Pringle, a company executive. ``If it's true, we'll probably modify
some of our pet policies to allow them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most landlords, however, remain skeptical. Dogs can appear
intimidating, assault the olfactory and auditory senses and even
drive away potential renters.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Carrico, a San Francisco apartment investor and property
manager for landlords on both sides of the doggy fence, said he
encourages a cats-only pet policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not worth it,'' he said. ``It's just amazing how
much trouble there is'' with dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Barking, for one, which can be especially odious when owners are
away. Carrico tells the story of a vacant apartment he tried to
rent in a four-unit building where the three other tenants owned
dogs. ``Every time a (potential) renter would go in the building,
it sounded like they were walking into a kennel. It took quite a
while to rent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some animals left unattended for too long chew on doors or use
the carpet as their faux fire hydrant.
</P>
<P>
   That problem also makes landlords reticent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get that smell in your carpet, it seeps from the
carpet into the concrete slab,'' said Steve Epcar, a principal of
Ventana, a property management firm in San Mateo, Calif. ``It's a
smell that _ short of a fire _ you'd never get out of the unit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors can be problematic as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Labrador lays a big bomb and a Chihuahua doesn't,'' said
Mark Abrahams, regional property manager in Sacramento, Calif., for
FPI Management. ``If everyone were more conscientious and picked up
after themselves, I think owners might be a little more likely to
increase the size limit,'' said Abrahams, who handles 1,000
apartments in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   If an owner allows pets, Carrico said his firm screens both the
applicant and the animal. ``We ask to meet the dog. That puts the
person on notice that we really care,'' Carrico said, ``but the dog
can't tell us if the owner cleans up behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   When she applied for a small, Victorian apartment two years ago,
Kasie Maxwell said, her San Francisco landlord met not only
Gabriel, her 140-pound Great Dane; but also her two cats, two
turtles and four birds.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell was well prepared for her move from Oregon. She had
letters of praise about her menagerie from previous landlords, two
in-house pet sitters and her veterinarians. These references and
luck, she said, helped her get the apartment two days after her
arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel died of cancer last year, so the 500-square-foot
apartment seems larger, but there's no chance she'll settle for one
of those little tykes as a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small dogs are really annoying,'' she said. ``I had a neighbor
in the building who had small dogs and they were yapping all day. I
couldn't wait till she moved out.''

   SCI-AIDS-REPORT (Geneva) _ U.N. officials on Tuesday painted one
of the gloomiest pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first
recognized in 1981. In its first country-by-country analysis,
released on the eve of the 12th international AIDS conference, they
said that 30 million people were now infected with HIV, the AIDS
virus, and that the majority were doomed to die because they live
in countries that cannot provide adequate health care. HIV now
infects one in four adults in two African countries, Botswana and
Zimbabwe. HIV-infection rates exceed one-third of the adults in
some major African cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in
pre-natal clinics. By Lawrence K. Altman.

for a short period to fix problems for a daily rate. In short, they
like to make changes and move on, rather than manage a stable
situation or languish in the hierarchy of some larger corporation
worrying about office politics. The use of so-called interim
managers is not new, but with companies facing more pressure from
shareholders to act quickly, and with the process of finding a new
chief executive growing more complicated and involved, demand for
temporary help at the highest levels is growing.

   ARLINGTON, Texas - A seemingly out of place, throwaway line in a
nationally syndicated baseball column by Peter Gammons has set off
alarms throughout the country that trouble is brewing between
Diamondbacks managing general partner Jerry Colangelo and Manager
Buck Showalter.
</P>

   Before the rumor continues blazing across the nation, let's get
one thing straight: There is absolutely no rift between Colangelo
and Showalter.

   ``I don't think there's anyone I respect, trust or feel closer
to than Jerry Colangelo,'' Showalter said. ``To even respond to
this is ridiculous, because it almost gives it credence. It's so
far from the truth, it's not even worthy of a response.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of this sordid tale is that national radio
personality Jim Rome, who has quite a cult following, mentioned the
alleged problems on his show, further spreading the false talk.
</P>
<P>
   The item on the Diamondbacks was sandwiched between a Chicago
White Sox note and another about Jim Leyritz, deep in Gammons'
weekly notes column. This is how it appeared in Sunday's ``Boston
Globe'':
</P>
<P>
   `` There is constant speculation about the White Sox front
office, much of it fueled by Kenny Williams's self-promotion. And
you may not want to invite Jerry Colangelo and Buck Showalter to th
e same cocktail party. Tricks of the trade: Granted, Jim Leyritz is
a good hitter ''.
</P>
<P>
   Gammons, reached Monday night at his Massachusetts home, said
the short item was intended as a joke and that his newspaper, the
highly respected ``Boston Globe,'' edited out the second half of
his statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a joke about when things go wrong,'' Gammons said.
``That's why I picked a cocktail party. Neither would go to a
cocktail party because they'd never leave their job; they're so
obsessed with what they have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in baseball have been taking so many shots at these
guys (Colangelo and Showalter). It was a joke and the rest of the
item got cut.''
</P>
<P>
   At first it seemed like such an insignificant note that it would
not merit a response from the Diamondbacks. But with the
speculation running rampant, it's time to cut this nonsense off
before it becomes a wild fire and some people have Showalter on the
street, suitcase in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Showalter may be one of the most solidly
entrenched managers in the game today. He is arguably the most
powerful manager, with as much say over personnel decisions as
top-ranking managers such as Atlanta's Bobby Cox or St. Louis' Tony
La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo handpicked the meticulous Showalter from a pool of
potential candidates who would have lined up at any corner for a
chance to manage Arizona's expansion entry.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in baseball knew the Diamondbacks were not going to
cower and play the small-market role; that this was a club that was
going to shoot out of the gate, guns ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   This was a club that said it was going to be a big-time player
and immediately followed their big talk by signing Jay Bell, Andy
Benes, Willie Blair and Matt Williams for a combined salary of
$111.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   They were also going to be able to back up the big salaries with
what amounts to a river of revenue. What manager wouldn't want an
opportunity to have a big payroll to play with?
</P>
<P>
   Still, the false innuendo stung a bit, especially with all the
other potshots the Diamondbacks have had to put up with since
before the expansion draft, even if some of them were
self-inflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Gammons item appeared, Diamondbacks General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr., made a point of calling Colangelo, who has been
vacationing in Europe and is set to return to Phoenix tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laughed when I read him the line,'' Garagiola said. ``He
asked, `Where do people get this stuff from?' It was the only
appropriate reaction. The unfortunate part is that it's like trying
to un-ring a bell. There's absolutely zero to this one.''

worrying about office politics. The use of so-called interim

shareholders to act quickly, and with the process of finding a new
chief executive growing more complicated and involved, demand for
temporary help at the highest levels is growing.

CHILE TIES CAMEROON, 1-1, BRAZIL UP NEXT  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ When Chile had survived a contentious 1-1 draw
with Cameroon Tuesday and advanced to the second round of the World
Cup, its players removed their jerseys and tossed them into the
crowd, shedding their shirts and 36 years of unfulfillment and
humiliation in soccer's world championship.
</P>
<P>
   After a frustrating wait of nearly four decades, however,
Chile's promotion may be a meager reward. Its next opponent, on
Saturday, happens to be Brazil, the defending champions and the
same team that eliminated Chile when it last advanced in the World
Cup in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were many jeering fans in La Beaujoire Stadium
who believed Cameroon should have advanced, not Chile. It was a
riveting, free-flowing match, and a decidedly rough one. It
concluded with severe criticism by Cameroon Coach Claude Le Roy of
the referee and the get-tough refereeing policy of Sepp Blatter,
the newly elected president of FIFA, soccer's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Two Cameroon players were sent off with red cards and the
Indomitable Lions finished the match with only nine men on the
field. But the play that enraged Le Roy occurred in the 59th minute
with the score tied at 1-1. Francois Oman-Biyik ricocheted a blast
off the right post that skittered into the net, apparently giving
Cameroon a 2-1 lead and renewing the brilliance that the forward
had demonstrated with a short-handed goal to defeat Argentina in
the 1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the referee, Laszlo Vagner of Hungary, waved off the goal.
He ruled that Cameroon forward Patrick Mboma had fouled Chile's
Ronaldo Fuentes as the two players challenged for a header pass
that Mboma placed at Oman-Biyik's feet. The foul ruling seemed
harsh on what appeared to be a routine play. And the decision was
hugely important because Cameroon (0-1-2) needed a victory to
advance, while Chile (0-0-3) needed only a tie.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Le Roy stood dumbfounded, his hands on his
hips. Another Cameroon official could not restrain himself and
screamed and gestured apoplectically at Vagner as he left the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what football is all about, I hope Mr. Blatter was
watching,'' Le Roy said. ``I cannot understand why the referee
refused the goal. There wasn't a shadow of a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his team was ``shocked'' and that that ``I'm sorry we
were eliminated, especially on a decision that was an incompetent
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Le Roy also rebuked Blatter's call last week for more vigilant
refereeing and for the issuance of red cards for every tackle from
behind. The Cameroon coach said that while Blatter was an excellent
administrator, he ``should stick to administrative tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not commit a foul,'' Mboma said. ``I can't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, though, Cameroon's desperate assertiveness and
mesmerizing creativity was undone by needless fouls. If the Mboma
penalty was questionable, others were not.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th minute, Cameroon's Rigobert Song tripped Chilean
forward Ivan Zamorano, taking his legs out and drawing a stern
warning from Vagner. Twelve minutes earlier Song had been issued a
yellow card for another overly aggressive tackle. This time Chile
was awarded a free kick and midfielder Jose Sierra curved a
wickedly perfect left-footer just under the crossbar and inside the
right post from 25 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon tied the score 10 minutes after halftime when Mboma
headed a cross from Oman-Biyik over Chilean defender Pedro Reyes
and goalkeeper Nelson Tapia. But the Indomitable Lions could not
keep their composure. Three minutes earlier, Song had been given a
red card for raking Chilean forward Marcelo Salas across the face
with an elbow as they chased a ball down the sideline. And in the
89th minute, midfielder Lavriano Etame ran Salas down from behind
and kicked him in the legs, drawing another red card.
</P>
<P>
   As it had in its two previous draws, Chile could not hold a
lead. But it does advance for the first time since it hosted the
World Cup in 1962 and finished third. And finally, its fans can
began to forget the disappointments of the past _ the 1962 ``Battle
of Santiago'' brawl with Italy. The refusal of the Soviet Union to
play a 1973 qualifying match in Santiago, saying the stadium had
been used to torture political prisoners. The feigned injury by
goalie Roberto Rojas in a 1989 qualifier that got Chile banned from
the 1994 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advancing to the second round is enormously important to us,''
said Chile's coach, Nelson Acosta. ``It was a complex, difficult
game. When Cameroon played with 10, we were afraid things would
turn against us as they did in the other matches.''

</P>
<P>
   COOKING-SCHOOLS (New York) _ A pile of carrots, turnips, onions,
shallots, lettuce leaves and potatoes lay on a stainless-steel
table at the French Culinary Institute's teaching kitchen. My
mission, on this first day of La Technique, the institute's basic
course for amateur chefs, was to turn those vegetables into
textbook examples of the basic French cuts. My goal was to test the
basic-skill courses offered by New York's top cooking schools: the
French Culinary Institute, Peter Kump's School of Culinary Arts and
the culinary arts division of the New School. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-CIA (New York) _ It used to be that if you wanted to
become a chef, you were expected to go to cooking school in Paris.
There you learned classic technique, the organization of the French
kitchen, and discipline under the critical eye of French
instructors. And when you returned to America, you were practically
guaranteed to land a job at a top restaurant. But over the last
decade, the culinary world changed. Cuisines fused, and American
kitchens were transformed from French food factories into dens of
creativity. Nowhere is the break with the past clearer than in a
comparison of the most influential school in the United States, the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., with its
counterpart in France, Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-GRADS (New York) _ By the time Matthew Laux completed a
two-year program last March at the New England Culinary Institute _
after paying nearly $40,000 for an education that encompasses all
aspects of the food service industry _ he had earned his reward: a
job at Trois Jean, a New York bistro, where he peeled and chopped
vegetables 12 hours a day, six days a week. For this, he received
the munificent sum of $65 a shift. The food service industry is
booming nationally, and students who complete a culinary school
education will almost certainly have a career ahead of them. But
they may not have a life. By Eric Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   NY-CIPRIANI (New York) _ To most New Yorkers, the name Cipriani
means just the boutique restaurant in the Sherry-Netherland that
his father, Arrigo, opened in 1985 and where they serve the Bellini
cocktails invented at Harry's Bar in Venice (started by Giuseppi
Cipriani's grandfather in 1931). But that profile is about to get a

<P>
   COOKING-SCHOOLS (New York) _ A pile of carrots, turnips, onions,
shallots, lettuce leaves and potatoes lay on a stainless-steel
table at the French Culinary Institute's teaching kitchen. My
mission, on this first day of La Technique, the institute's basic
course for amateur chefs, was to turn those vegetables into
textbook examples of the basic French cuts. My goal was to test the
basic-skill courses offered by New York's top cooking schools: the
French Culinary Institute, Peter Kump's School of Culinary Arts and
the culinary arts division of the New School. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING-CIA (New York) _ It used to be that if you wanted to
become a chef, you were expected to go to cooking school in Paris.
There you learned classic technique, the organization of the French
kitchen, and discipline under the critical eye of French
instructors. And when you returned to America, you were practically
guaranteed to land a job at a top restaurant. But over the last
decade, the culinary world changed. Cuisines fused, and American
kitchens were transformed from French food factories into dens of
creativity. Nowhere is the break with the past clearer than in a
comparison of the most influential school in the United States, the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., with its
counterpart in France, Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. By Amanda Hesser.

   COOKING-GRADS (New York) _ By the time Matthew Laux completed a

job at Trois Jean, a New York bistro, where he peeled and chopped
vegetables 12 hours a day, six days a week. For this, he received
the munificent sum of $65 a shift. The food service industry is

SPACE ... THE BUSINESS FRONTIER: NASA, UH FORM TEAM ON SPINOFFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KAREN SANTOS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tang and Velcro are probably two of the most
well-known spinoffs of the U.S. space program.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than 25 years that NASA has commercialized
innovations designed for the special rigors of space, most were
licensed directly to various existing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping its innovations can give birth to and support entire
companies, NASA and the University of Houston recently formed a
business incubator.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator will help create business strategies and find
funding for new businesses based on NASA spinoffs, as well as other
innovations brought to it by individuals and companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the UH-NASA Technology Commercialization Incubator has
focused on 15 innovations, said Judy Johncox, director of
technology management at UH and temporary director of the
incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Here are just a few:
</P>
<P>
   _ A water filtration system using ultraviolet radiation instead
of chlorine. It could be used in sewage treatment plants or in home
purification systems. It is advantageous because ultraviolet rays
do not leave residue, while chlorine does. Over time, chlorine
exposure can lead to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A testing procedure for herpes that will detect the disease
sooner than other methods. The test uses a modified chemical
reaction process that needs only a small amount of genetic material
to make many copies. That, in turn, allows for an easier and
quicker diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The test is projected to detect the disease within a few hours
instead of the usual two to three days at present.
</P>
<P>
   _ A method that would allow blood to be stored in a refrigerator
for up to 72 hours before it is processed or analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   This will be useful to small medical labs and remote medical
facilities, which often do not have the tools for proper analysis
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pressure sensor that is only two inches square. Such a
device might help in deploying air bags during an auto collision.
</P>
<P>
   Current air bag systems can only detect front-end collisions,
and the sensors in these systems are expensive. New air bag systems
may be equipped with side-impact bags, which would require more
sensors, and the patented pressure sensor being developed for
market by the incubator might help reduce the cost of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is no set time frame for the release of these products,
Johncox said. Many are still in development and could be released
six months to a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 15 products under consideration have patents or
have patents pending.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently no businesses within the incubator. However,
both Johncox and Arthur Vailas, vice president for research at UH,
said they would begin searching for companies for the incubator in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good thing for Earth-based spinoffs of NASA
research,'' Vailas said. ``The university has a good view for
evaluating technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The university will draw upon students in its graduate business
program and the resources of its small business development office
to help show future businessmen what is vital to the birth and
development of their company.
</P>
<P>
   Vailas said the university also will draw upon the knowledge of
faculty at other colleges with which it is affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has a history of spinning off products.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Velcro and Tang, the technology used to shield
the space shuttle from the sun's heat is used to keep race car
drivers cool inside their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid cooling garment worn by astronauts has been adapted
to help people born without sweat glands to eliminate excessive
body heat. Also, some people with multiple sclerosis, for example,
have found that the suit relieves their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also developed the bioreactor, which keeps human and other
cells alive during space experiments. It's now being used in cancer
research in studies of tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
   The technology transfer department at Johnson Space Center in
Houston licenses products to be developed for consumers, said James
Cameron, who works for the NASA department.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Cameron's department helps evaluate the technology,
its commercial potential and its patentability.
</P>
<P>
   After a product is identified as a potential consumer item, and
a patent application has been filed, the product is shown to
potential licensees.
</P>
<P>
   An upfront fee of up to $10,000 as well as royalties are
charged. If a product makes a few million dollars, royalties are no
longer collected. Cameron said a large majority of the profit,
about 97 percent, usually is kept by the licensee.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator is different in that it will spin off new
businesses from NASA technology, and allow inventors to develop
their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually have someone technical who wants to develop
technology, who doesn't want a business plan,'' a common mistake
among technology start-ups, Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference is that UH is a class act; it has all the
resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UH had formed an alliance with NASA in 1986, to develop a
process that used molecular beams to put a layer of chemicals just
a few atoms thick onto silicon and other crystals used in producing
microchips.
</P>
<P>
   Johncox said development of certain technologies will be
assigned to faculty members whose research complements the function
of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Johncox said she hopes that ``we will be a vehicle ... to
commercialization'' for many innovations. ``This is not just a NASA
vehicle, or a University of Houston vehicle, it's also important to
the city and the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The incubator will be funded for three years by a $1.2 million
grant from NASA. UH is currently looking for other sources of
funding so it can continue its research after three years. Johncox
said it probably will seek funding from the National Science
Foundation, a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a model which spreads across the country,'' Vailas
said.

WASHINGTON ISN'T SO BAD AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Money magazine chose the nation's capital this
month as the ``best place to live'' in the Northeast, eyes rolled.
Imagine that _ a political city continually embarrassed by its
resident president, Congress and mayor actually being considered
desirable!
</P>
<P>
   This indeed is something remarkable to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   But putting political occupants aside _ which is a good place to
put them _ the city itself has always been a more user-friendly
place than New York. And no other East Coast urban rivalry matters.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city of gracious parks, sweeping avenues, world-class
museums and historic monuments as well as of men and women. We who
are resigned to official Washington's perennial infamy cheer the
magazine's bold pick.
</P>
<P>
   It is finally our turn to stick it to those uppity New Yorkers.
The competition between the Big Apple and the federal seat of
government for cultural, social and economic pre-eminence has been
a stand-off for decades. New Yorkers, however, have been more
aggressive in defending their miserable, overcrowded existence than
Washingtonians have in countering our unflattering image.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities are simultaneously alike and different.
</P>
<P>
   Local scandals in both places are equally horrifying, and public
schools are equally inferior. But both cities offer top-drawer
cultural opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The economies of both depend heavily on strangers who come to
see the sights and be generally looked down on as cash cows to be
tolerated but never accepted.
</P>
<P>
   New York fawns over the celebrities of fashion and finance, and
Washington, over public officials and television stars. New York
houses the United Nations, with which it occasionally feuds over
parking and threatens to send out to sea. Washington harbors
Congress and the White House, two institutions with which it is
continually at odds and can never get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers are certain about the superiority of their views;
Washingtonians never know what they think until they take a poll.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic is worse in New York, although Washington is catching
up. One day New York will come to a screeching halt in a massive
city-wide traffic gridlock, but Washington will always be in
motion, somehow.
</P>
<P>
   New York is no longer as dirty as it once was. Washington is
still dirty, but it was never as bad as New York in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's restaurants are now as elegant and expensive as New
York's, although a glass of Merlot is not yet $12, as it is in at
least one tony Manhattan hotel.
</P>
<P>
   All this matters because there are no East Coast competitors in
our urban league.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia? Hug the Liberty Bell and you've done the town.
Boston? If you don't know a Kennedy, you're nobody. Albany? The
excitement left with Nelson Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   After some really lousy years, the District of Columbia is
thrilled to finally be recognized as someplace special, with more
to offer than violence and crime.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-convict who is our mayor, Marion Barry, virtually ruined
the city by stuffing local jobs with incompetent cronies, posturing
about racism whenever he was legitimately challenged and ignoring
basic services such as plowing snow off the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress finally gave most of his authority to more
accountable managers, and he has announced he will not seek
re-election. Hooray.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is better, if not yet all the administrative details.
The pot holes are still here, as are the long lines required to
renew drivers' licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But real estate sales have revived, and tourism is thriving. New
store chains are invading the inner city. A new sports arena is a
hit. The Kennedy Center is enjoying packed houses, after years of
ups and downs. The FDR Memorial is attracting even more visitors
than the Vietnam War Memorial, the previous top draw.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, New York City surged ahead after Rudolph
Giuliani was elected mayor and immediately tackled graffiti,
panhandlers, thugs and other grubby, irritating aspects of daily
city life. But since his re-election, he's been cracking down on
jay-walking pedestrians, rude taxi drivers and inconveniently
located street venders, looking so dictatorial in the process that
he is losing public support.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is even vying with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
for the dubious honor of being klutz of the month. He is building a
$15 million bunker in which he and a few hand-picked aides can hide
in case of terrorists, hurricanes and bombs. The mayor will be
saved, but everybody else outside his inner circle gets to rely on
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   This emergency center is cleverly situated on the 23rd floor of
a downtown building, which does not leap to mind as a secure
location in a dangerous emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Barry is still a lot lower on the totem pole of respect than
Giuliani, but Washington will be rid of him soon.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's capital, of course, is burdened not simply with a
comic mayor but with hordes of high-ranking political hooligans who
help give the place a bad name. Voters elsewhere in the country
confuse the innocent locals with the transients who occupy the
marble corridors on Capitol Hill and the secret power centers in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It is a heavy burden to bear, but the seat of government must be
SOMEWHERE. President Clinton once acknowledged at a press
conference that he thought the Washington ``atmosphere is sort of
abnormal.'' (Thoughtfully, he said abnormal and not subnormal.)
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to live in or visit a beautiful city that can
hold its own with the other great capitals of the world, you'll do
what most of us do. We ignore the present human foolishness and
enjoy the sights and sounds that provide us pleasure and reflect
our nation's history.

   CHINA-CLINTON (Beijing) _ At home, President Clinton's fortunes
may wax and wane, but here, on the eve of his first state visit to
China, he is already a star. Not only in the official press but
also among elements of the intelligentsia, he is being lionized as
a great statesman who had the wisdom to change his mind about China
_ turning from his early attack stance to his current policy of
engagement. Clinton's great global vision, it seems, ranks him
right up there with that all-time great strategist, Richard Nixon,
who will ever be revered here for reviving ties between the United
States and China. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ALBANIANS (Klina, Serbia) _ The gong of church bells
summoned the Serbs up to the weed-choked cemetery with its ancient
stone crosses, marble tombs etched with the faces of the departed,
crooked iron gates and gnarled trees. During the tolling, the open
coffin of Oliver Zaic, 17, his face waxy with the pallor of death,
was carried through the dusty streets, lifted through a hole in the
cemetery fence and borne up the steep hill. He was killed in his
garden, his family said, as he tried to protect his widowed mother
and 10-year-old sister Marica from ethnic Albanian rebels who in
recent days have begun to attack and kidnap Serbian civilians in an
apparent effort to drive them out of their villages in the
overwhelmingly Albanian province of Kosovo. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-REPORT (Geneva) _ AIDS is hitting Africa so fiercely that
it now rivals history's greatest and deadliest epidemics _ plague
in the Middle Ages and influenza in 1918-1919, United Nations
officials said here today. They also said the AIDS epidemic will
worsen before it improves. The overwhelming majority of the 30
million people infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, are doomed to die
because they live in countries that cannot provide adequate health
care. By Lawrence K. Altman.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-ECON (Moscow) _ President Boris Yeltsin summoned Russian
legislators to a public meeting on Tuesday and demanded that they
adopt a rash of new measures to restore the confidence of foreign
investors. The extraordinary session was intended to impress the
International Monetary Fund, which is beginning new negotiations
over billions of dollars in additional financing. But Yeltsin also
warned the Communist-dominated parliament: ``If the package of
bills in the government is not approved, other measures will be
taken.'' By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PEONY (Shanghai) _ After a day of last-minute efforts to
negotiate a compromise that would permit a local opera company to
travel to New York City to perform a classic Chinese opera, ``The
Peony Pavilion,'' as a centerpiece of the Lincoln Center Festival
next month, cultural officials here continue to block the project.
The director of the Shanghai Bureau of Culture instead insisted
that the company's modern staging of the work was inappropriate for
foreign viewers and would not be permitted to travel. Coming just
days before the arrival of President Clinton, who is scheduled to
land in China on Thursday evening, the artistic controversy now
threatens to sour an otherwise optimistic atmosphere that has been
carefully planned by Chinese and American officials for the visit,
which includes three days in Shanghai beginning June 29. By Seth
Faison.

</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-IRS (Washington) _ Republican leaders appeared likely
to cut the holding period for investors to get favorable capital
gains tax rates by pushing the measure onto a bipartisan bill
overhauling the Internal Revenue Service. The move was an effort by
Republicans to take advantage of the White House's apparent
reluctance to get into a partisan fight over the IRS bill, which
passed both the House and Senate by overwhelming margins and is one
of the few major pieces of legislation likely to come out of
Congress and be signed by President Clinton this year. By Richard
W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-SPEND (Washington) _ Setting Congress on a collision
course with President Clinton, a House panel proposed slashing the
President's education initiatives as well as the annual financing
for home-heating oil for the poor. The proposal provides
substantial increases for the National Institutes of Health and the
Centers for Disease Control. At the same time, it takes a
$2.6-billion bite out of Administration priorities, cutting
education spending and eliminating programs that provided summer
jobs, helped pay heating bills and provided tutors for low-income
families. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

   MICROSOFT-SUIT (Washington) _ In a victory for the Microsoft
Corp., a federal appeals court struck down two previous decisions
against the company by the judge who is overseeing the government's
current Microsoft antitrust case. Although Tuesday's appellate
decision involved a separate Microsoft case, the ruling throws into
question a significant portion of the Justice Department's pending
suit against the company, which is scheduled for trial this fall
under U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Jackson. By Joel Brinkley.

</P>
<P>
   As little as a year ago fortune finally seemed to be smiling
upon Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was vigorously recovering from the deep recession of
1995-96, and was on the way to its highest yearly expansion since
1981. Employment was up; even wages had stopped falling and were
beginning to rise.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the mid-term congressional and gubernatorial
elections had placed Mexico firmly on the road to democratization.
The results were not contested, and the ruling PRI lost its
absolute majority in the lower house, while the opposition picked
up several victories in state races.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the win in Mexico City saw Cuauhtimoc Cardenas, the
symbol of resistance to the prior government of Carlos Salinas de
Gortari, elected mayor by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   Disquieting trends persisted: In Chiapas, peace negotiations
remained stagnant; in Guerrero, new guerrilla groups surfaced; in
the cities, a crime wave was met by a collapse in law enforcement;
and in government, President Ernesto Zedillo, surrounded by a
remarkably mediocre team, seemed out of touch with Mexico's new
balance of forces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were stronger grounds for optimism than in many
years and skeptics, such as this writer, seemed increasingly wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Today, even the naysayers seem to have fallen short in their
pessimism. Although foreign perceptions remain upbeat _ fortunately
and blindly _ in Mexico there is a widespread sense that the
country is adrift. Economic, social, political and psychological
trends add up to an unease and foreboding uncommon even by
traditional Mexican standards. Just about the only note of optimism
stems from the national soccer team's exceptional performance in
the World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo wanted at all costs to avoid the sixth-year, end-of-term
jinx that has befallen every Mexican president since Luis
Echeverrmi in 1976. In fact, he is on the verge of succumbing to a
last-year-in-office crisis two and a half years before his
administration ends.
</P>
<P>
   The ominous signs are everywhere. On the economic front, the
plunge in oil prices is wreaking havoc with Mexican public
finances. Oil still accounts for nearly 40 percent of government
revenues. The president was forced to acknowledge that a third,
hefty cut in domestic spending is probably inevitable, given the
current glut in world oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican stock exchange index has fallen almost 20 percent in
five weeks in peso terms, and an additional 5 percent in dollars;
the currency dropped below the nine-peso-to-the-dollar barrier and
shows no sign of strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this dismal showing is inspired by international trends
_ the Asian crisis, the current squabble with Washington over
Operation Casablanca and the United States' unabashed and
unannounced intrusion into Mexican territory to carry out a
money-laundering sting. Local factors are also at play _ for
example, the banking crisis and the government's failure to
convince the Congress to pass the $65 billion bailout bill over to
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, opposition congressmen are reluctant to do
Zedillo's bidding, in this regard, and even PRI legislators are
wary of backing their president. The reason is obvious. The
government claims it had no choice but to buy off the newly
privatized banks' bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the Congress never formally authorized the
bailout; meanwhile, the evidence of corruption, insider trading,
crony-capitalism and self-lending by the ``new bankers'' is
mounting. Pressure from abroad for transparency and disclosure in
national accounts grows by the day, but Zedillo cannot deliver. The
Congress will not bail him out on the bail out, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for nervousness and dismay is bloodier, and far
more disturbing to Mexico as a nation. In one week, incidents in
Guerrero and Chiapas showed how precarious the situations are
there, and how unprepared the Mexican security and armed forces are
for the type of policy the government is intent on pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   On a Monday, in the small Guerrero town of Ayutla, the army
surrounded a small schoolhouse where a dozen guerrillas were
spending the night. They opened fire, with scant or no warning,
killing 12 Mixteco ``presumed combatants.'' The army suffered no
casualties. There was little evidence of the guerrillas returning
fire and soon, the Mexican press began to point to a cold-blooded
execution, rather than a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, in the Chiapas village of El Bosque, local
police forces backed by the army moved in on one of the 40 or so
``autonomous townships'' set up by the Zapatista rebels. The
ostensible purpose of the 1,000-troop assault was to ``reestablish
the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Villagers apparently defended themselves with shotguns, hunting
weapons and sticks and stones. Government forces replied with
mortar and automatic-weapons fire. Eight villagers were killed; the
army suffered one dead and several wounded. Reports began to
surface that the eight dead had been executed after the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential elections are still two years away, and Zedillo's
term concludes on Dec. 1, 2000. The question is whether the current
storm clouds herald the beginning of the traditional last-year
crisis _ or are the country's present travails merely a pebble in
the road to be quickly left behind? One can hope for the latter,
but should expect the former.
</P>
<P>
   Although previous experience and Zedillo's obsession with
preventing a debacle should suffice to avoid a full-fledged
economic meltdown, a combination of recession, gridlock, violence
and political turmoil is more likely.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a classical, big-bang type of crisis similar to those
in 1976, 1982, 1987-88 and 1994-95, Mexico may be entering a new,
prolonged period of political instability and economic fragility.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a case of fortune smiling on anyone.

MANY QUESTIONS HANG OVER CLINTON TRIP TO CHINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Among the many clouds hanging over President
Clinton's historic visit to China this week, one in particular may,
for many Americans, be the darkest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Clinton administration, swayed by the Democratic Party's
largest donor, change export policy and aid a U.S. satellite firm
that may have helped China improve its nuclear missiles? And, did
China actively try to influence the 1996 U.S. elections with
illegal campaign donations?
</P>
<P>
   The questions bring curt denials from administration officials,
but Republicans on Capitol Hill spent much of last week trying to
keep the public's attention focused on those issues as Clinton
prepared to travel to the Asian giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would not be involved in any kind of sale that in
any way jeopardized our national interests,'' said Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright in appearances before House and Senate
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have accused the administration of twisting export
policy to favor a campaign donor whose company was under
investigation for providing China with information that could have
improved its Long March missiles. And, they repeatedly accused
China of conspiring with Democrats to funnel money into campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of both issues is the China Aerospace Corp., a
state-owned offspring of the Red Army.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1970s, China Aerospace has operated a commercial
venture using its Long March rockets to boost into orbit satellites
owned by international customers.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of mishaps, five in four years, prompted increasing
international pressure in 1996 for the firm to improve the
reliability of its rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are now looking at two decisions President Clinton
made. In March 1996, Clinton moved the authority over satellite
export control from the State Department to the Commerce
Department, which regulates so-called ``dual-use technology.''
</P>
<P>
   This February, Clinton also granted, despite objections from the
Justice Department, a waiver of a satellite launch ban to Hughes
Electronics and Loral Space &AMP; Communications Ltd., allowing them to
use China Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, at the time, was investigating whether
Loral illegally provided missile technology to China Aerospace
following the 1996 explosion of a Long March rocket carrying a
Loral satellite. Justice objected to the February waiver,
contending it could undermine any case against Loral.
</P>
<P>
   Administration critics argue the information provided by Loral
could have been used by China Aerospace to improve the guidance
systems of not only the Long March rockets, but other missiles
armed with nuclear warheads pointed at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we export a satellite to China and pay the Chinese
government to launch it, we are directly or indirectly enhancing
the ability to improve its space and military launch capability,''
said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Loral is owned by Bernard Schwartz, a major Democratic
contributor who was the party's largest donor at $1.3 million since
1995. Schwartz has denied any attempt to influence the waiver
decision with campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials note that President Bush granted nine
launch waivers while in office to President Clinton's 11. And, they
point to a 1993 letter signed by 30 California House members, 16 of
them Republicans, protesting the launch ban, noting the satellites
are guarded and no transfer of technology is possible.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., called on Clinton to delay
his trip until the questions about the Loral waiver and the
decision to move satellite export control to the Commerce
Department were answered.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' investigation into China's alleged attempt to
influence U.S. election in 1996 was rejuvenated last month when a
central figure changed his story and told of receiving money from a
former Red Army officer.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Chung, a California businessman who pleaded guilty to
making illegal campaign contributions, told Justice investigators
that in August 1996 he received $300,000 from Liu Chaoying, a top
executive at China Aerospace International Holdings, a China
Aerospace subsidiary, and gave at least $35,000 of it to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Chung provided the first piece of evidence connecting the
Chinese government to illegal contributions. He previously denied
any such connections, but the businessman had likened the White
House to a subway where tokens were needed to get inside. Chung
visited the White House more than three dozen times despite
warnings from national security officials who labeled him a
``hustler.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, there were reports that Chung told investigators that
Democratic Party officials asked him to solicit illegal foreign
donations.
</P>
<P>
   China President Jiang Zemin repeatedly has denied any attempt to
divert funds to U.S. candidates. China Aerospace officials first
suggested Liu spent her own money but later denied that she had
given Chung any funds. Last week, another China Aerospace official
said the $300,000 came from a Hong Kong businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's indictment was one of three secured by a special Justice
Department task force investigating the campaign irregularities for
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Also under indictment are Maria Hsia, accused of money
laundering in connection with a Buddhist Temple fund-raiser
attended by Vice President Al Gore, and Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie,
the former Little Rock, Ark., friend of the president's. Trie and a
friend are charged with 15 counts in a scheme to divert foreign
money to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of others also are under investigation, including John
Huang, a former Democratic Party fund-raiser who raised $3 million
in 1996 from the Asian community. The party returned $1.6 million
raised by Huang because it could not determine the money source.
Huang, a Chinese-born American citizen, previously worked for the
Riady family's Lippo Group based in Indonesia.

 &HT;    Vanbiesbrouck back in Panthers' picture
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If new coach Terry Murray gets his way, the Florida Panthers'
search for a goaltender could end where it began _ with John
Vanbiesbrouck.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, who praised Vanbiesbrouck Sunday during the news
conference to name him coach, apparently has encouraged his
brother, General Manager Bryan Murray, to renew efforts to work out
a deal with Lloyd Friedland, Vanbiesbrouck's agent.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides spoke for the first time in months late last week,
according to an NHL source. The meeting was apparently at Terry
Murray's urging. Bryan Murray said no negotiations were conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry thinks John is a good goaltender,'' Bryan Murray said
Monday. ``He said it (Sunday) and again today _ he feels you have
to have a good goaltender to win in this league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that strengthens John's position (to sign with
Florida) or not, but it does confirm that he likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Vanbiesbrouck, who can become an unrestricted
free agent July 1 if he's not signed, has been anticipated for
months, since negotiations stalled with the two sides about $1
million apart per season.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck is asking for$4.5 million per season, while the
Panthers are offering $3.5 million. The top two goaltenders in the
free-agent market, Curtis Joseph of Edmonton and Mike Richter of
the New York Rangers, are both seeking about $7 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's plan has been to protect Kevin Weekes in Friday's
expansion draft and hope to pick up another up-and-coming
goaltender in a trade with Nashville, which can select up to five
goaltenders.
</P>
<P>
   But the protected lists released Monday revealed that four teams
_ Los Angeles, San Jose, Boston and Anaheim _ protected two
goaltenders apiece, thus shortening the list.
</P>
<P>
   Among those protected were the Sharks' Steve Shields and Kings'
Jamie Storr, both of whom Murray had considered.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list of unprotected goalies were backups Jamie
McLennan of St. Louis, Craig Billington of Colorado, Kevin Hodson
of Detroit and Mike Dunham of New Jersey. None has ever spent a
full season as a No. 1 NHL goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Murray said Sunday that the decision on keeping
Vanbiesbrouck would ultimately fall to Bryan Murray, President Bill
Torrey and owner Wayne Huizenga.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had clear memories of Vanbiesbrouck's
spectacular playoff run two years ago. One of the teams Florida
beat during that run was the Philadelphia team coached by Murray.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how he played,'' Murray said. ``(The Panthers)
beat the Flyers, and I think he was the reason why.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the goaltending situation Sunday, Bryan Murray said,
``The three of us (the two Murrays and Torrey) have to sit down and
talk about that. We have to find out if Terry's satisfied and go
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, he added, ``All along our interest in John was very
clear, given the right opportunity, the right contract.''
</P>
<P>
   If Vanbiesbrouck goes to free agency, the Panthers' biggest
competition for his services could be the New York Islanders, who
traded backup Eric Fichaud over the weekend, leaving them with only
Tommy Salo and 19-year-old prospect Roberto Luongo.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck made $2.2 million last season in the final year of
a three-year contract. As has generally been the case when he was
up for a new contract, he had a subpar year, finishing 29th in the
league with a 2.87 goals-against average and an 18-29-11 record.
</P>
<P>
   The first player selected by Florida in the 1993 entry draft,
Vanbiesbrouck is one of only six remaining original Panthers. He
will turn 35 in September. Friedland is seeking a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Vanbiesbrouck was left unprotected in the expansion draft, as
were Joseph, Richter and Philadelphia's Sean Burke. But since all
will be free to sign with any team after July 1, there's only one
reason Nashville would select any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Since a team that loses a goaltender this year doesn't have to
expose one in next year's expansion draft, a team like New York
could persuade the Predators to take Richter, then compensate them
for the trouble, re-sign him and not have to risk losing him next
year.

 &HT;    For Jordan, that was Zen, and this is now
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Jackson jumps on a motorcycle signed by Chicago Bulls one
and all, drives away from the team's practice facility in Zen
farewell and everyone assumes an NBA dynasty now lies in ruins?
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   Spare me.
</P>
<P>
   The kingdom and glory of professional basketball in Chicago will
collapse only when a team dethrones the Bulls by beating them on
the court, or when Michael Jordan retires again (see as source:
Heat coach Pat Riley, who has insisted as much for many, many
years).
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Jackson was anything other than an
excellent coach and master motivator while directing his team to
six titles in matching sets of three during the 1990s, but the
Bulls' future will be in good and secure hands with George Karl or
Roy Williams or Dean Smith or some other Carolina Blueblood running
things... as long as Jordan is around.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill is spinning out of control in Michaeltown these
days, and the best guesses on Jordan's considerations concerning
his future are exactly that _ guesses.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Carolina Blueblood item, for example, is
rooted in the notion that Jordan, who, of course, is out of the
Carolina Bluebloodline himself, will continue to wear Tar Heel
practice shorts under his Chicago game trunks only if he is allowed
to name Jackson's successor.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of all this BS (Bull Speculation), there
existed five possibilities; 1) Jordan would play for Jackson in
Chicago; 2) Jordan would play for someone else in Chicago; 3)
Jordan would play for Jackson somewhere else; 4) Jordan would play
for someone else somewhere else; 5) Jordan would quit.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has removed the ``both-in-Chicago'' scenario from the
list, and does not seem inclined at this time to pursue another
coaching job. What that means is Jordan's pie chart of
possibilities now includes only three slices, and playing somewhere
else for someone other than Jackson seems remote. Let's put that
one at 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So, does Jordan stay in Chicago with a new head coach?
</P>
<P>
   Or does he quit?
</P>
<P>
   Says here it's 60-30 favoring Jordan's return to his very own
Sweet Sixteam in pursuit of a seventh championship, and a first one
without Jackson. And maybe without superstar sidekick Scottie
Pippen, too, and a whole bunch of other free-agent Bulls as well.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   For the simple reason that Jordan craves a challenge. If one
isn't handy, he'll create something. He wants the chance to again
defend a championship, and might even enjoy having a new cast of
compatriots with whom to undertake the effort.
</P>
<P>
   What if, for the sake of argument, the Bulls were able to shed
themselves of enough salary _ see ya' Scottie, see ya' Dennis
Oddman, see ya', see ya', see ya' all other dollar drainers not
named Jordan _ and land New Jersey's Jayson Williams and Detroit's
Jerry Stackhouse while keeping Toni Kukoc and Ron Harper?
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and those four guys would form a nice starting lineup,
huh?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he should quit. He should walk away and stay away and not
worry about how the NBA learns to breathe without Air. He should
leave in concert with Jackson and in ultimate demonstration of
their mutual allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   But can he satisfy himself, as he insists he can, with what has
already been accomplished?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as usual, does Jordan see another summit?
</P>
<P>
   He knows he can't spell zenith without Z-E-N, but would love to
prove he can get there without it.

CHILE ADVANCES TO SECOND ROUND AFTER 1-1 DRAW WITH CAMEROON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds information in 2nd graf about suspended Chilean players ) 
 (JT)  
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ When Chile had survived a contentious 1-1 draw
with Cameroon Tuesday nd advanced to the second round of the World
Cup, its players removed their jerseys and tossed them into the
crowd, shedding their shirts and 36 years of frustration and
humiliation in soccer's world championship.
</P>
<P>
   After a frustrating wait of nearly four decades, however,
Chile's promotion may be a meager reward. Its next opponent, on
Saturday, happens to be Brazil, the defending champion and the same
team that eliminated Chile when it last advanced in the World Cup
in 1962. In addition, Chile will play without three starters _
Francisco Rojas, Moises Villarroel and Nelson Parraguez _ who
accumulated two yellow cards during the first round.

 &HT;    Michael Jordan sounds like a man who's staying
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Michael Jordan wore no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 45 minutes after his expected arrival, he emerged, flanked
by two uniformed police officers, from a back entrance at the
Austin Convention Center. He was nattily dressed in a burnt orange
pullover shirt, light khaki slacks and ... white cotton socks.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes stayed behind, presumably because they were golf
cleats. He'd already played 20 at the Great Hills Golf Club and was
at the turn before being transported by a white limousine to Barton
Creek Country Club for the back 18.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball royalty's preeminent member might have been casually
dressed _ this is Austin, after all _ but this wasn't a case of the
emperor wearing no clothes. Anyone with six rings on his fingers
qualifies as fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   Fully satisfied? Hardly. Golf's his love, basketball's his life.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine for Kobe Bryant and Grant Hill to be like Mike, but
they're not Mike. We're not as interested in the next Michael
Jordan as we are the current Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As Dallas Mavericks forward Michael Finley said at a recent
charity basketball clinic, ``The only slippage in his game is he
doesn't dunk as much as he used to. But that's not slippage. Half
of the players in the NBA want him to stay because of what he does
for the game. The other half wants him to leave so they have a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since MJ and those coattail-riders put the Utah Jazz out of
their misery in six games a week ago for the Chicago Bulls' sixth
NBA championship in eight seasons, this country has become obsessed
with his retirement. Get out now while you're on top, the experts
tell Michael, before you tarnish our memory of you as the best
basketball player in the history of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more selfish? Why are we so eager to send the
Michael Jordans and John Elways out to pasture before they're
ready? Can't we just revel in their still-spectacular skills? If
their decline is too precipitous, their play will determine that.
MJ could play at this level another _ what? _ two, three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Are we too scared to see our heroes stumble? Can we not accept
their legitimate challenge to rise above the encumbrances of
advancing age and more youthful rivals?
</P>
<P>
   For every floundering Willie Mays or Johnny Unitas far past
their primes, we should salute the Cal Ripken Jrs., Paul Molitors
and Reggie Whites as they continue to bring credit to their sports
with an enviable work ethic and lasting legacies.
</P>
<P>
   We are so consumed with interest in Jordan, the kids wanted to
know everything about him, from the size of his shoes (13) to the
brand of gum he chews (in the playoffs, Doublemint). We can't get
enough of MJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue to play,'' MJ said, ``but I want to
continue with the same guys I've played with. If not, it's been
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 35, should forget us and do what he wants to do. Play if
he wants to play. Retire if that makes him happy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 730 campers flocked around MJ as he fielded their
questions for half an hour. The once-wide circle tightened around
him like animals after their prey, adolescents practically pawing
at his pant legs, thrusting hands toward him to physically touch
his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   As 8-year-old camper Taylor Oran said, ``He should stay if he
wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Gutierrez, a lanky 14-year-old wearing a red No. 23 Bulls
jersey and one of his 16 pairs of Jordan shoes, thinks MJ's ``too
good to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzz-headed Kirby Wottrich from West Ridge Middle School said if
MJ is as fatigued as he said he was from this season's 103 games,
he should ``maybe play half a season.'' If so, make it the last
half, MJ.
</P>
<P>
   Thrall's Janice Mitchell, a brown-eyed seventh-grader, wants
Jordan to ``prove to the world he can win without Phil Jackson,''
his coach until he officially resigned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decision came as news to MJ, who said he would
consider it a rumor until he heard it from Phil. Jordan once said
he wouldn't play for another coach, but the ebullient tone in his
voice suggests he's not the least bit ready to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   He adamantly insisted he won't return to baseball and will not
fantasize about the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   MJ could follow Larry Bird into the coaching ranks or be a
player-coach, but he said he doesn't think he has the discipline to
handle that. ``But I can't ever say never,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, like Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wrestle, and I don't watch a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't his departure leave the NBA in disrespectful hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy the game,'' he said. ``And there are a lot of
young players in the league who still need some lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   MJ left behind more hints that he'll remain in the league than
he does defenders in his wake. He said he hopes Scottie Pippen and
Rodman return, adding, ``And there's a strong possibility they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he wanted to leave these youngsters with the advice of
listening to their parents and teachers ``if I don't see you again,
but I'm pretty sure you will.''

 &HT;    Money talk: Whatever you do about stocks, don't panic
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Most experts agree on how to deal with a stock market
as high and as tippy as this one. Don't do anything, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Their rationale is a sound one: Nobody knows when the market
will decline. Nobody knows how low it will go or how long it will
stay down in the horse latitudes. But everyone knows it will come
back, and eventually the advance will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of studies back this up. One, published by Van Kampen
American Capital, showed the average bear market lasts eight
months. The average recovery lasts a bit more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody questions the Ibbotson Associates' studies, now
covering more than 71 years, which demonstrate investors get much
higher returns from stocks than from other forms of investment. The
most recent figures, through the end of May, gave big-company
stocks a score of 11.1 percent, compared with 5.8 percent for
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Less publicized studies, such as those cited in the
illustration, demonstrate the damage you can do to yourself by
hopping in and out of the stock market. If you try to dodge the bad
days, you'll probably miss a bunch of the good days, too.
</P>
<P>
   With that said, there are plenty of investors who worry about
getting creamed in the stock market. Even if they're saving for
retirement 20 years from now, they fear they're going to get hurt
by the bears right now.
</P>
<P>
   That worry can be more compelling than all the statistics on
Wall Street. Indeed, one of the risks in investing is fear. What
happens if the market goes down and you can't stand the pain? Are
you going to sell out, hoping to cut your losses even as you make
them real?
</P>
<P>
   If you are profoundly worried, there are a couple of things you
can and should do. The first is to examine carefully how much pain,
and how much uncertainty, you can bear. The second is to act on
what you discover, preferably slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Step one is what insiders refer to as establishing your risk
tolerance. It's a parallel to the first law of hang gliding: Never
fly higher than you're willing to fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy, mainly because risk aversion is an individual
thing and a subjective one. For married couples, it's a much more
complicated, two-individual thing. It's the eternal balancing act
for investors: how much return you want or need vs. how much
uncertainty you're willing to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is a bit of mind-gaming. It goes like this: Think
about the retirement savings you have invested in stocks. Suppose
today is the day the stock market drops 20 percent. Subtract 20
percent from your family's savings. Are your hands shaking? Are you
willing to wait for a better day tomorrow? Or do you want to sell
those faithless stocks and hole up in CDs forever?
</P>
<P>
   For an insight just a shade more informative, you can go on the
Internet and search out a number of risk tolerance quizzes. The
results are at best rough ideas, but they can help stimulate your
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I would avoid the ones that require you to submit
your answers and wait for a scoring from the company. Sounds too
much like a sales call to me. You can find reasonably good ones at
http://www.mcdonaldfunds.com
</P>
<P>
   /risk.htm and http://www
</P>
<P>
   .strong-funds.com/aci/planner
</P>
<P>
   .cgi?planasset.
</P>
<P>
   Other alternatives involve more systematic efforts at education.
If you have a 401(k) or other retirement plan at work, the office
that manages your plan may well have informative booklets on
dealing with stock market volatility. If you use a stockbroker or
mutual fund manager, that agency may offer free literature. If you
have a decent library, look for the books numbered 332, check in
the indexes under ``risk,'' and read what you need.
</P>
<P>
   Step two may be a timely one, even if you haven't discovered new
depths of stock fright. This is the action step, referred to by
pros as rebalancing your account.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you put half of your 401(k) contributions into a stock
fund, a fourth of it into a bond fund and a fourth into a money
market fund. But you've decided that's too risky. You would rather
rebalance, cutting stocks back to 40 percent and boosting bonds to
35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose you want to maintain 50 percent in stocks, but the
booming market has outrun your bonds and money market fund. Stocks
now make up, say, 65 percent of your account, and you find that too
risky.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, you can decide whether to do it all at once or
gradually -- the approach favored by most experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise clients to take their future contributions and put
them in the sector that they want to add to,'' said Mike Gerken,
senior vice president of investment manager Waddell &AMP; Reed. ``You
make it a process, rather than making it an event. You can't time
the market.''

<P>
   That slow-and-easy approach avoids any sales charges, as well as
lowering the chances of selling a big block of stock on a bad day
in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, don't panic. The point of this whole exercise is to
reduce your exposure not to stocks but to panic. ``There's no
reason for it,'' said Gerken.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he suggests declines could be a good thing for steady
investors. ``If an investment made sense for you yesterday and
prices go down today, it makes even more sense to invest some more
today,'' Gerken said.

 &HT;    Pincay's skills have eroded, but his chase of Shoemaker goes on
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ During a week in June, jockey Laffit Pincay rode in
promotions at tracks in Kentucky, Iowa and Texas, but did not win
in 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But he raced three days that week at his home track, Hollywood
Park, and won three times. That made it a good week.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is the most honored rider in the history of horse racing,
the only person (owner, trainer or jockey) ever to win five Eclipse
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   But winning three times in a week isn't a regular occurrence
anymore for Pincay.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he won 380 times, more than any rider in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he won just 75 races.
</P>
<P>
   At 51, Pincay is fighting the record book and the calendar
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to become the all-time winningest jockey, but he is
running out of time. Every day, the owners and trainers of the best
horses in California tell Pincay that his hour is past. They tell
him by not letting him ride their horses any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't great, he would be gone,'' said trainer Richard
Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pincay goes on.
</P>
<P>
   He travels across the country, to Iowa, Texas and Kentucky,
chasing Willie Shoemaker's record of 8,833.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay is 210 short of that.
</P>
<P>
   At the present rate, he won't catch Shoemaker this century.
</P>
<P>
   Was Ahab more obsessed?
</P>
<P>
   ``You need goals in your life, no matter what age you are,''
Pincay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got plenty of time. As good as I feel, I can ride until
I'm 60.''
</P>
<P>
   But at 60, who will give him horses to ride?
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker, who retired in 1990, rode until he was 58. But after
50, his phone stopped ringing. ``The trainers want the young
bulls,'' Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay's primary workplace is Southern California, one of the
most competitive areas in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Riders from the top of the national money list, like Gary
Stevens, Kent Desormeaux and Alex Solis, get the best California
mounts. Pincay gets the dregs. It is rare for him to be offered
work in a stakes race any more.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay could get better horses at a smaller track. But he will
not uproot his family. Pincay and his wife, Jeanine, have a
4-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of competing in eight races a day, as he did when he led
the nation in earnings seven times, Pincay has a busy afternoon if
he gets three mounts. And the horses he rides are seldom favorites.
</P>
<P>
   He finished last on a 34-1 shot in Kentucky last week. You won't
catch Gary Stevens or Jerry Bailey on a 34-1 shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay has 19 Kentucky Derby starts, but none since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   When Pincay was voted into the Racing Hall of Fame in 1975,
Desormeaux, the 1998 Kentucky Derby winner, was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Pincay is not at the track because he needs the money.
His total purses won are close to $200 million. His share is 10 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
   But Pincay has paid his dues. He has broken his collarbone 11
times. He sustained three cracked ribs and a fractured pelvis in a
fall last year.
</P>
<P>
   The concern about injury is a constant for Pincay's wife. ``I
come home, I hold my breath while I listen to the messages on the
answering machine, until I find out nothing has happened at the
track,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Eddie Delahoussaye is one of Pincay's oldest California
competitors. ``The only way he is going to retire,'' said
Delahoussaye, ``is if he gets hurt or sick. Or if people just stop
riding him.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that if you wanted to become a chef, you were
expected to go to cooking school in Paris. There you learned
classic technique, the organization of the French kitchen and
discipline under the critical eye of French instructors. Words like
souffle, galantine and fricassee trickled into your vocabulary, a
chef's knife became an extension of your hand.
</P>
<P>
   And when you returned to the United States, you were practically
guaranteed to land a job at a top restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last decade, the culinary world has changed.
Cuisines fused, and American kitchens were transformed from French
food factories into dens of creativity. Restaurants began relying
on local produce and a home-grown sensibility. And as they
prospered, they created a new demand for chefs that a handful of
schools abroad could not satisfy. Cooking schools have since
sprouted all over this country _ there are now almost 800 _ and
French cuisine is only part of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when we go out to eat, the dishes we order more often
reflect the values of schools like the Culinary Institute of
America in Hyde Park, N.Y., or Johnson &AMP; Wales in Providence, R.I.,
than of any revered Paris institution. Consider the July issue of
Food &AMP; Wine magazine, which hails the 10 new chefs it considers the
best in the country: seven were trained in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere is the break with the past clearer than in a
comparison of the Culinary Institute, the most influential school
in the United States, with its counterpart in France, Le Cordon
Bleu in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Le Cordon Bleu has not wavered in its allegiance to French
cooking _choux pastry and beurre blanc are as much in its blood as
ever, and its cuisine focus remains purely French.
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Institute teaches that, too, but it is more
interested in introducing students to the world of cooking, the
business of running a restaurant and even how to cope with it all,
with classes like stress reduction and personal health.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's campus is on a hill, high over the Hudson River
in what was a Jesuit seminary before cooks wielding whisks
descended upon it in 1972. Today, there is no mistaking you are at
a cooking school. The names of the buildings read like
advertisements for the food industry. The General Foods Nutrition
Center houses one of the school's four restaurants, which are
staffed by students and open to the public. The Conrad N. Hilton
Library is filled with cookbooks and a kind of sidewalk of the
stars, lined with clay handprints and photos of chefs like Jeremiah
Tower and Eric Ripert.
</P>
<P>
   It also houses the Danny Kaye Theater (yes, the entertainer),
which looks like a university lecture hall, except that instead of
a podium there is an up-to-the-minute demonstration kitchen,
complete with overhead mirrors and television screens displaying
close-ups of the stove and preparation area.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 7:30 a.m., the campus crawls with some 2,100
students, knife cases in tote and toques bobbing. In 36 spacious
and modern teaching kitchens, the air is filled with the sounds of
mixers whirring, knives tapping on cutting boards and the
occasional roar of an instructor. Some students are fresh-faced,
right out of high school, some are grayish, an unusual mix with an
average starting age of 23. Yet there is a powerful feeling of
solidarity: everyone is here to cook.
</P>
<P>
   The 103-year-old Le Cordon Bleu looks a bit worn in comparison.
It is squeezed into a narrow building in a quiet residential area
of the Left Bank in Paris. The classrooms are less modern and
smaller than the Culinary Institute's. But the atmosphere is more
personal, with a student-to-instructor ratio of 10 to 1, compared
with 17 to 1 at the Culinary Institute. There is no library and no
restaurant, not even a school cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   But Le Cordon Bleu doesn't aspire to a campus environment. A
temple is more like it, with students as worshipers who have made
the pilgrimage to learn the secret of cooking and to take it back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' said Lindsay Gott, a student from San
Francisco, ``it's Paris, and the enthusiasm about food that's here,
you feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly something the Culinary Institute lacks. Tucked
away in upstate New York, it suffers like many other campuses, from
insularity. Students have little exposure to real restaurants.
There is a wine club, an ice-carving club, even a cigar club, but
few field trips to restaurants in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The institute applies a university philosophy to its curriculum,
too. There are a 21-month program for an associate's degree and a
38-month program for a bachelor's degree. As cooking schools go,
that is a lengthy commitment. (Le Cordon Bleu's program lasts nine
months.) But students at the institute are earning a college degree
_ an associate in occupational studies or a bachelor of
professional studies _ approved by the state Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, just to be a great culinarian isn't enough,'' Tim
Ryan, the senior vice president of the school, said, ``People need
to have the business acumen, the business skills.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   So bachelor's degree candidates must complete courses in cuisine
and pastry, management, economics and psychology. ``We do want to
stress balance and healthier living, so people stay healthier,
livelier and in touch with their creative forces,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Students also spend four weeks at the school's recently opened
Greystone campus in St. Helena, Calif., visiting wineries,
restaurants and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The bachelor's program, a school spokesman said, is a response
to the change in perception of chefs. In census polls during the
1970s, a chef was considered a domestic servant. Today, chefs are
categorized as professionals.
</P>
<P>
   There are no such notions to put to rest in Paris, where being a
chef has a long tradition of respect. Le Cordon Bleu's
three-semester program is carefully designed for students to master
just one thing: French technique.
</P>
<P>
   Students _ whose average age is 26 _ are first taught the
fundamentals, from technique to palate education. The second
semester focuses on French regional cooking, and the third refines
skills and lets students unleash their own creativity on classic
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Never do instructors teach how to run a restaurant. ``We don't
play with academics,'' Andre Cointreau, president of the school,
said, ``We are only dealing with hands-on culinary training at the
highest level.'' Many prefer this to learning how to fold napkins
and calculate the cost of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really care about cooking,'' said Frankie Carl, 45, a former
homemaker from New York City in her final semester. ``I don't care
about the business side of it. I'd hire someone for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Institute tries to keep up with the restaurant
industry. In its baking kitchens are installed stone-deck ovens
like those used in many bread bakeries, and the school has added
instruction on slow-fermentation breads made with organic flours, a
big departure from the hotel rolls taught at most cooking schools.
(Le Cordon Bleu still uses a convection oven.) And in the St.
Andrew's Cafe, the school's light-cuisine restaurant, students are
taught to use a wood-fired pizza oven and rotisserie.
</P>
<P>
   In the classrooms, though, students are merely introduced to
emerging cuisines of the world. As part of the core curriculum, for
instance, students take an Asian cuisine course that lasts only
seven days: three days for Chinese cooking, three days for Japanese
and one for Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greystone campus, in the former Christian Brothers Estate
winery, the school offers continuing-education courses ranging from
wedding cakes to food writing to ``fire, spice and the global
grill.''
</P>
<P>
   This is where Le Cordon Bleu suffers most in comparison. The
French school sniffs at trends and completely ignores fads. Though
it has added a wine course, cheese instruction and a few
continuing-education courses, there have been no major shifts over
recent years in the way it teaches classic technique. Patricia
Gastaud Gallagher, the academic director, says the school is paying
more attention to seasonal ingredients, but a class being taught in
April was making lamb tart using tasteless winter tomatoes and
cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Le Cordon Bleu seems frozen in time. A brochure
showcases pulled-sugar works and fish en gelee. It is difficult to
imagine such antiquities enticing anyone to become a chef.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the school has a waiting list and has just opened a fourth
outpost, in Australia, adding to those in London, Tokyo and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Le Cordon Bleu's greatest strengths are its site and its short
program. Some students _ especially career-changers _ value how
quickly one can earn a degree and the total immersion in the food
culture of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The grand diplome in cuisine and pastry can be earned in 12
months, including a 3-month restaurant internship. And in that
year, the student will come out with a thorough understanding of a
cuisine. Not just any cuisine, but one whose techniques form the
base of most Western cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Institute's approach _ introducing students to the
world of cooking, rather than mastering it _ is both the school's
edge and its fault. Students see what the culinary world has to
offer but it is merely a starting point, like any undergraduate
program.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are an aspiring chef that starting point will be a
decisive influence on the shape of your career. You may no longer
need to go to France to learn to cook, but if you want to serve
foie gras dusted with five-spice powder in Los Angeles, New York
and Tokyo, you may need to stay here to learn how to do it.

WINE OF THE WEEK: BENZIGER SYRAH 1995, CALIFORNIA CENTRAL COAST.
ABOUT $16. 
(JT)

<P>
   There are fanatics who say California, given its predominately
warm climates, should forget about cabernet sauvignon and merlot
and concentrate on hot-climate grapes like syrah, grenache and
mourvedre. That's never going to happen, but if it were to, we
could make do quite nicely with wines like this one.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Bien Nacido Vineyard in Santa Maria, where much of the
fruit in this wine originated, is in a relatively cool climate; the
Shell Creek vineyard, which provided the rest of the grapes, is in
a hot climate. The combination makes for a complex, intriguing
blend. The wine, which includes 4 percent petite sirah _ an
entirely different grape from syrah _ spent 16 months in oak. It
should improve with another year or two in the bottle and last, oh,
maybe a decade after that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent sunny morning, Giuseppe Cuomo arrived at
Mezzogiorno restaurant in SoHo a little before 9 o'clock. From his
van, he unloaded a 30-pound pillow of cow's milk curd, toted it
into the restaurant, nodded to the kitchen staff and started to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Changing into chef's whites, he scrubbed his hands and forearms
like a surgeon. Then, with a few deft stokes of a chef's knife, he
cut the big mound of white curd into chunks and pushed them through
a chitarra, a stainless steel device that cuts the curd into small
pieces. The pieces dropped into a huge stainless steel bowl, and
Cuomo covered them with hot water, forcing the curd to release its
whey.
</P>
<P>
   Using his hands and a wooden paddle, Cuomo worked the whey: He
pushed it, pulled it, salted it and kneaded it until it became a
stretchy, satiny blob _ a blob that he was turning into mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   Mezzogiorno, Tribeca Grill, Bice and Naples 45 are among the
restaurants that want handmade fresh, moist, tender mozzarella that
tastes and smells as pure as it looks. They all rely on the
early-morning visits of Cuomo, a traveling mozzarella maker. His
family has practiced this craft for three generations in southern
Italy, and Cuomo, 52, continued the tradition after he moved here
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mozzarella, it needs to be fresh,'' he said, defining fresh as
a maximum of two days old. Yes, he could make mozzarella in large
batches at his home in New Jersey and truck it into the city, but
that would be a loss for both the diner and the cheese, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On and off trucks, lost time, changes in temperature.'' He
rolled his eyes as he considered the potential for culinary
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to work the whey. ``The trick is to keep it pliable
and smooth,'' he said. ``If it's in water too long, the cheese
loses too much of its butterfat and gets rubbery.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of readiness _ a precise moment perceptible to
Cuomo _ he pulled it from the water and, with the help of a kitchen
assistant, stretched it into a long braid, squeezing out the water.
Pulling off handfuls (the word mozzarella is from mozzare, meaning
``to tear''), he fitted some into molds that looked like shallow
bread pans, and shaped others into balls, knots and braids _ and
several beguiling little birds. In all, he makes about 300 pounds
of mozzarella a week for each of six restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, mozzarella has become one of America's
favorite cheeses, second only to cheddar. But most mozzarella made
in this country is processed in blocks that are sealed in plastic
and sold in supermarkets. For connoisseurs, there are alternatives
provided by artisans, many of them Italian, who like Cuomo supply
restaurants, Italian delis and specialty food shops like Fairway,
Todaro Brothers and Balducci's in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They usually make fior di latte, cow's milk mozzarella, though
their colleagues in southern Italy also make fior di bufala, from
the milk of water buffaloes. The more delicate fior di bufala is
about twice the price, and many swear it is the finer of the two.
Cuomo prefers cow's milk mozzarella, though his family is from a
small town near Salerno, in the heart of buffalo mozzarella
country.
</P>
<P>
   Besides salads and pizza, fresh mozzarella cut in small pieces
can be added to pastas _ tossed in at the very end so it just
starts to melt but does not become stringy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooking fresh mozzarella would be a travesty,'' said John
Taylor Martin, a food writer who lived in Liguria for two years.
``My Italian friends ate mozzarella almost every day in the summer
but only two ways _ tossed with hot pasta at the last minute, or in
insalata caprese.''
</P>
<P>
   Insalata Caprese, or salad of Capri, is the familiar combination
of tomato slices, mozzarella and fresh basil, lightly dressed with
olive oil, salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fairly recent invention, created in the early 1950s at
the Trattoria da Vincenzo in Capri. It was made then, as it is now,
with fior di latte, ripe tomatoes and two local products: wild
arugula and a pinch of dried wild oregano. Vinegar, which would
overwhelm the flavor of delicate, fresh mozzarella, is never used.
</P>
<P>
   For those who happen to catch the ingredients together at their
peak of freshness, life is good. ``Yellow, rubbery processed
mozzarella and hothouse tomatoes are unacceptable,'' Faith
Willinger, a food writer who has lived in Italy for 23 years, wrote
in ``Red, White and Greens'' (HarperCollins, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   With some crusty bread, insalata Caprese can be an appetizer, a
singularly satisfying lunch or, on a sweltering summer night, an
instant, reviving supper.

MASTER CHEF: VEGETABLE TARTS, DAZZLING AND FILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH MADISON WITH MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A chef working in a vegetarian restaurant, as I did in my days
at Greens in San Francisco, is always searching for a centerpiece
for the plate, something with enough substance _ visually and in
actual heft _ to pull the dish together. For me, vegetable tarts
were often the answer. A wedge of tart surrounded by a multicolored
salad, for instance, looks dazzling and is filling, too. Sometime
in 1980, I started refining the tarts I served.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a tart dough, like pie dough, is dense and brittle. But
I began to use yeast. It was my way of lightening the crust; it
requires much less fat than other crusts do and is naturally
airier. And it turned out to be a better complement for the
filling: A yeasted crust is crisp on the outside but tender on the
inside, a subtle transition to the delicate interior mixture. It's
also a lot easier to work with, more supple and less likely to
tear.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've reached far beyond the Roquefort-based
vegetable concoctions that I used at first as fillings. Often, for
instance, I use fruit. Those containing a lot of juice, like plums,
are an especially good match, since this dough absorbs moisture
better than a standard pie crust. You can also roll out this
malleable dough to make a free-form crust of any size or shape,
from individual tarts to great big ones. The only trick to it is to
remember that this dough must be rolled thinly, to a thickness of
about an eighth of an inch, or else it will turn, not surprisingly,
into bread.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, I like to rely on our first local crop of
green leafy vegetables. The bulk of the mixture here is spinach and
chard, complemented by an assortment of unexpected greens _ herbs
like cilantro, parsley and dill are perfect and can result in a
wild and fresh, unforgettable combination.
</P>
<P>
   But really, the choice is yours. When I was in northern Italy
last spring, I saw vegetable pies made with spinach, asparagus,
leeks and even wild greens like borage and chicories. (I cover my
tarts with dough lids, so many people are going to argue that I
should be calling them pies, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The tart should be served just slightly warm or at room
temperature; it needs resting time to set up well. In fact, it
stores beautifully overnight, and there's nothing better for a
picnic.
</P>
<P>
   GREEN HERB TART WITH YEAST CRUST
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup warm milk or water
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons soft butter or olive oil, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   3 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup minced scallions, the whites plus about 1 inch of greens
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup chopped fresh dill leaves
</P>
<P>
   8 cups trimmed and roughly chopped spinach, thickest stems
discarded
</P>
<P>
   4 cups trimmed chard, the stems chopped finely, the leaves
coarsely
</P>
<P>
   1 cup ricotta
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces feta cheese, optional
</P>
<P>
   Zest of 1 lemon, minced.
</P>
<P>
   1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in milk or water. In large bowl,
combine liquid with hefty pinch of salt, 1 egg and 6 tablespoons
butter. Add flour gradually, beating with wooden spoon; when dough
is too stiff to work with the spoon, knead by hand until smooth,
adding small amounts of flour as needed. Put dough in lightly
buttered or oiled bowl, cover, and let rest for about an hour. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Place rest of butter in large skillet, and turn heat to
medium; when it is heated, add scallions and herbs; cook, stirring,
5 to 10 minutes, until soft. Remove, and set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Add spinach to skillet with 1/4 cup water; cook, stirring,
until spinach wilts; remove to colander. Repeat process with chard.
When spinach and chard cool slightly, press them gently to remove
moisture; do not squeeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Combine greens and herbs with ricotta, feta if you're using
it, lemon zest, and salt and pepper. Beat remaining eggs lightly,
and stir all but 2 tablespoons into greens mixture. Preheat oven to
375 degrees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. When dough is ready, cut off a little over a third. On
lightly floured surface, roll larger piece of dough 1/8-inch thick
and 14 inches in diameter. Lightly butter or oil an 11- or 12-inch
tart pan with removable rim. Drape dough into pan; trim so that an
inch hangs over rim all around. Roll out rest of dough to diameter
of just under 12 inches (it should fit just inside rim). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Pile greens mixture into tart, and then top with dough lid.
Fold excess dough from bottom piece onto top piece, pleating or
rolling as you like. Brush lightly with reserved beaten egg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Put tart on baking sheet, and bake for 35 minutes. Remove rim
from tart pan, and bake for 10 minutes more to brown the sides.
Serve hot, at room temperature, or cold. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: At least 10 servings. &QL;

 By ERIC ASIMOV    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the time Matthew Laux completed a two-year program
in March at the New England Culinary Institute _ after paying
nearly $40,000 for an education that covers all aspects of the food
service industry _ he had earned his reward: a job at Trois Jean, a
New York bistro, where he peeled and chopped vegetables 12 hours a
day, six days a week. For this, he received $65 a shift.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, peeling and chopping was not all Laux was expected to
do in the restaurant's garde-manger, or cold-foods station. He also
assembled vegetables into salads; he whisked vinaigrettes; he
artfully positioned cold appetizers and desserts on plates, and he
did whatever else he was told, since in a restaurant kitchen,
``No,'' is not an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty weird profession,'' Laux, 22, conceded. ``I
didn't really know how hard it was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a few would-be chefs who enter the dozens of American
culinary schools envision owning their own restaurants. They can
practically taste a future in which grateful diners swoon over
their meals, race to bookstores to buy their cookbooks and then
head home to watch their cooking programs on television.
</P>
<P>
   The food service industry is booming nationally, and students
who complete a culinary school education almost certainly have a
career ahead of them. But they may not have a life.
</P>
<P>
   As it is with Little Leaguers who dream of playing one day in
Yankee Stadium, the fantasies of culinary students can melt like
butter in a hot pan the first time they set foot in a restaurant
kitchen and are handed a sack of potatoes to peel and slice. Not
only are grandiose visions at risk, but even tamer hopes fade _
things like going on dates, marrying, having children.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-hour workweeks are typical for lowly recent graduates,
whose glamorous tasks at the bottom rung of the kitchen ladder may
include picking the cartilage from pounds of crab meat, removing
liver and membranes from mounds of lobster shells so they can be
boiled for stock or squeezing the flesh out of countless pea skins
for soup. In the best kitchens, perfection is the standard, and
those hapless souls whose work is not quite up to snuff can expect
invective rather than understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Their environment is physically demanding. They spend their time
sweating before stoves or freezing in walk-in refrigerators, or
maybe doing both. And the pressure is intense, especially as orders
fly in during peak meal hours. For this, new graduates can expect
to earn perhaps $20,000 to $30,000 a year, which doesn't go very
far, especially with school loans to repay.
</P>
<P>
   ```You're out of the easy school _ now you're at the hard
school,''' Serge Madikians recalls being told when he began working
this month at the Monkey Bar in Manhattan. But Madikians, freshly
minted from the French Culinary Institute in New York, said he was
happy to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the high of completing school, I realized I was just
beginning a long process of gaining an understanding of ingredients
and food,'' said Madikians, who hopes one day to open his own
restaurant, cooking Persian food through the prism of the French
techniques he has learned. ``A humbleness came, and I said, `Let's
start at the bottom of the totem pole.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than many, Madikians, 36, seems to understand how far down
the bottom is. He was earning $47,000 a year as assistant director
of intergovernmental relations in the New York City Buildings
Department when he enrolled in culinary school with the vague idea
of one day investing in a restaurant. But two weeks into the
program, he was hooked on cooking. ``I loved it,'' he said. ``The
smells, the light, the noise made me really feel alive.''
</P>
<P>
   To pay for school, he cashed in his city retirement plan. Now,
though he makes $9 an hour and has no medical or dental insurance,
``I see this as paying my dues.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The time spent paying dues can vary tremendously. Typically, a
young chef can expect to spend up to a year in an entry-level job,
though those identified as talented can move up more quickly,
within a few years passing through the various stations of the
kitchen _ grill chef, saute chef, fish chef, saucier _ with the
hope of becoming sous-chef, the executive chef's chief assistant. A
sous-chef can expect a decent but not extravagant wage _ maybe
$30,000 to $65,000 _ and is also in a position to land his own
kitchen at another restaurant. Spending too long in one position
can be a sign that your talents lie elsewhere _ waiting tables, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   But not all novice chefs are passionate enough about the
restaurant life to tolerate the hardships. Laux left Trois Jean for
a short stint doing similar work in the huge main kitchen of the
Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan, where dozens of workers
prepare meals for as many as 3,000 people _ when the Tony Awards
roll around, for example. He said his job there, which ended last
week, paid better and was far less stressful. ``There's so many
people, it's not all riding on me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he is off to Belize to be the chef at a small resort. But
he questions whether he has the drive to work in restaurants much
longer, and is considering more manageable areas of the industry,
like catering or working as a private chef.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ruhlman, a writer, has experienced firsthand the
culinary student's struggle to live in a world bounded by steaming
caldrons and zucchini peels. For his book, ``The Making of a Chef''
(Henry Holt, 1997), Ruhlman joined a class at the Culinary
Institute of America and chronicled the evolution from novice to
cook. He saw seasoned chefs picking out those who would be
successful by looking for an attitude, which he described as an
``insane, angry, furious drive for perfection.''

   ``You need this anger, this ferocity,'' Ruhlman said.
``Otherwise you're not going to survive. The work is so hard that
this anger has to be there. You get mad, and it's the only way to
get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger may be the only recourse when you're ``in the weeds,'' as
chefs call the nightmare of not being prepared when orders come
pouring in and you fall behind and can't see your way out. Ferocity
may lie behind reports that one famous French chef prods his
workers with a fork to get them to go faster. Intensity and
purposefulness drive chefs to be demanding rather than
compassionate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas Keller made me eat a raw tuna membrane,'' Ruhlman said,
recalling a visit to the famous chef of the French Laundry
restaurant in Yountville, Calif. ``I asked him why he was removing
it, and he made me eat it. He said, `Sometimes you have to know the
truly terrible to avoid it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Young chefs sometimes liken the busy dinner hours to combat,
with all the adrenalin frenzy, and subsequent release, of battle.
``There are times when I am completely overwhelmed, completely out
of control,'' said Scott Wyant, a 25-year-old graduate of the
Culinary Institute of America who has been cooking at Olive's in
Boston for six weeks. ``I'm in the weeds and think I'll never get
out. Then an hour later, I wonder, `How did I do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   As rewarding as it seems at the end of the night, Wyant is
already planning alternatives. ``I definitely want to get out of
the restaurant business,'' he said. ``The hours are ridiculous, and
it takes a toll. I love the industry _ don't get me wrong _ but
there are a lot of other aspects to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from other cooking jobs, as in corporate dining rooms,
private homes or catering companies, positions abound for culinary
school graduates. Sue Hoss, 31, who graduated from the New England
Culinary Institute in 1997, is an assistant editor at Cuisine, a
cooking magazine in Des Moines. She still occasionally dreams of
owning her own restaurant, but appreciates having a relaxed
workweek and nights and weekends off.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Borgstrom, 36, a 1997 graduate of the Culinary Institute
of America, cooks on the corporate jets of Joseph E. Seagram &AMP;
Sons, a job that takes her from Tel Aviv to Tokyo. Money is rarely
an object, and she can splurge on expensive Kobe beef if the urge
strikes. Sometimes, though, she misses the energy of the restaurant
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then my mom reminds me of the 14-to-16-hour days I used to
work,'' she said, recalling her grueling internship in a restaurant
in France.
</P>
<P>
   Internships, which most culinary schools require as part of
their curriculum, give students a taste of restaurant life. Beyond
that, the schools try to temper their student's initial
expectations. ``I think everyone has delusions of grandeur, and
they want to open their own restaurant right away,'' Ms. Borgstrom
said. ``Believe me, they try to dissuade you from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gulley, 29, also a 1997 graduate of the Culinary Institute
of America, is now a product manager at Digital Chef, an online
retailer of food and cookware, earning about $50,000 a year. His
first taste of restaurant cooking sent him in another direction.
``I'm very inspired by cooking, but I prefer doing it on my
terms,'' he said. ``Working eight or nine hours on a hot line
pumping it out _ I have tons of admiration for people who do do it,
but it's not what I see myself doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allure of the kitchen wafts ever outward. Dan
Petrilli, 38, was a loading-dock foreman, but quit to attend the
New York Restaurant School. He graduated in 1997 and he now works
as a line cook at the Grill Room, Larry Forgione's restaurant in
the World Financial Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot more money with the teamsters than I am now,''
Petrilli said. ``I'm putting in 15-hour days, but I love what I do.
I'm one of the fortunate ones that can say that.''

CAMPAIGN CASH, CURBING COUNSELS AND GOOD GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAT TRULY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few parting thoughts while tip-toeing toward the exit:
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance _ Folks, the republic is in trouble because the
moneychangers have occupied the temple. Remember the bankruptcy
legislation that just passed in the House? Those in the consumer
credit business, especially companies promoting credit cards, gave
$6.7 million to politicians in the last year, knowing they would
seek legislative help.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies, knowing Congress would become involved in
anti-smoking legislation, gave $4 million to Republicans and $1
million to Democrats since January 1997 (that's just nationally;
they gave more at the state level). On the other side, health
groups divided $1.367 million between the two parties, and trial
lawyers gave $774,000. The parties' congressional committees have
raised $60-odd million for 1998 ($42 mil for the GOP alone). And
that is on top of the six- and seven-figure war chests of
individual incumbents. All of it derived from public-spirited and
disinterested sources, of course. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   You _ Mr. and Ms. American _ have a stake in every issue before
Congress. Were you able to give millions? Was your voice heard as
loudly? Is a Congress that receives this much money actually likely
to do anything about soft money political contributions? Can you
spell d-a-m-n-t-h-e-p-u-b-l-i-c?
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsels _ There will be rare instances when they
are needed, and at those times they will need a high degree of
independence, but the law has to be changed to limit the range of
accusations referred to an independent counsel. Does anyone
remember what rationalization was used to begin a counsel
investigation of Whitewater? A device originally seen as a way to
avoid political influence in important investigations has been
reduced to the status of a political tool employed unnecessarily
for partisan reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Language _ The bilingual education fracas somewhat obscures the
real point, which should be that however it is achieved, every
citizen of this country should be functional in English.
</P>
<P>
   A bilingual education proposal working its way through Congress
(it recommends immersion programs) was amended the other day. It
had said that it is ``imperative'' that every person in the United
States know English. Now it says every person ``should have a
command of English.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the other day I was at a fast-food joint when two city
employees came in. One guy ordered breakfast for himself and then
ordered for his companion, who spoke Spanish but not English. I've
seen that happen all too often. Perhaps the standard should be that
everyone in the United States should attain a sufficient
``command'' of English to be able to order his or her own breakfast
at Jack-in-the-Box. Is that too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   Guv'mint _ As much as we might wish otherwise, we have to have
it. The idea should not be to starve it to death but to make it
work efficiently and frugally. Nor should it be confused with
business, as in campaign flapdoodle such as, ``I promise to run
government like a business.'' Business and government have
different roles. The only real difference between Democrats and
Republicans is about the purpose of government beyond defending our
shores and building roads (both of which they pretty much agree
about). Democrats seem to think government is there to protect the
masses from everyone else. Republicans seem to think it is there to
protect everyone else from the masses.
</P>
<P>
   And finally _ As might be expected with a populace so
independent-minded, there always has been an American tendency to
pull apart (New England almost seceded from the union in 1814,
years before the Suthrun Confederacy). As a people, we seem to need
an external challenge to bring Americans together.
</P>
<P>
   We need an enemy _ a believable threat from outside _ to give us
common purpose. We had it in World War II. Then the Soviet Union
provided this for 40-something years. No current bad guys really
fill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, as we tend to do after dealing with an emergency,
we look for enemies at home. Looking, we discover them all around
us. Some of them (modernism, for instance; immigrants, for
instance) always were there but were overshadowed by Russian
rockets aimed at Fargo, N.D., and San Angelo, Texas. Others we have
had to invent to replace political labels like ``soft on
communism.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why we are where we are at the end of the 20th
century: We're so strong, economically and otherwise, that we have
no immediate, credible external threat to our existence. So we must
invent our own.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Stay the course. Keep this nation's fundamental,
long-term human mission in mind. And this, too, shall pass. Of
course, it would pass faster if Uruguay or Liechtenstein would just
threaten us with destruction.
</P>

BY THE BOOK: `EVERY GRAIN OF RICE'  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE HAMLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the photograph on the jacket of ``Every Grain of Rice''
(Clarkson Potter, $25), Annabel Low and Ellen Blonder resemble the
striking daughters in ``Eat, Drink, Man, Woman,'' Ang Lee's film
about the supreme relevance of food in Chinese life. Their new
book, a family memoir and cookbook, makes the comparison even
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The authors were raised as sisters, although they are aunt (Ms.
Low) and niece (Ms. Blonder), born 16 days apart. The children of
Chinese parents, they grew up in California, where they still live,
as close now as when an extended immigrant family shepherded them
into a new, American life.
</P>
<P>
   But the girls were never allowed to forget their Chineseness.
Legends, superstitions and wisdom were fed to them in generous
amounts. What must have been tremendous hardship is glossed over in
the book; what remains are memories of a happy family life, filled
with nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   The women, now 48, have families and careers: Ms. Low is the
benefits manager of a major corporation, Ms. Blonder a designer and
illustrator, whose enchanting watercolors are among the book's
pleasures. But something got lost along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the time we spent helping in the kitchen while we were
growing up, we missed that next step of mastering the recipes on
our own,'' Ms. Blonder writes. ``We can teach our daughters how to
deal with corporations, but we couldn't pass down the simplest
technique for dealing with a taro root.''
</P>
<P>
   So the women consulted their relatives, cooked with them and
gathered 120 recipes, for both everyday and festive dishes. Rice,
of course, is given its full due. As children, the authors were
told to eat every grain of rice and that any grain left over would
reappear as a freckle on the faces of their future husbands.
</P>
<P>
   The family celebrated Chinese and American holidays with
pan-fried prawns in ketchup sauce, turkey jook, steamed eggs with
clams, sesame spinach, long-life noodle soup and fried rice
country-style, made with pungent shrimp sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Are all Chinese families so adept in the kitchen? I suspect not.
The recipes have too many subtle tricks that make a world of
difference. And they are meticulously written, perhaps because the
authors had to learn the dishes from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Following their directions for simple steamed fish, for example,
was a humbling lesson. Caught up in the grilling decade, I had
almost forgotten how delicate and sweet, how perfect, a freshly
caught steamed fish can be. And stir-fried flank steak with green
tomatoes is as clever and good as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   These dishes are a joy to cook, not only for their ultimate
goodness but also because the authors and their families are so
much a part of each dish. I plan to join them, via their recipes,
for at least part of the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SIMPLE STEAMED FISH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From ``Every Grain of Rice'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 30 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1{ or 2 pounds whole, scaled fish like red snapper, rock cod,
large flounder or black bass; or a thick chunk of striped or black
bass
</P>
<P>
   1 1{-inch piece of ginger, peeled and cut in fine slivers
</P>
<P>
   1 scallion, trimmed and sliced in thin strands lengthwise
</P>
<P>
   2 cilantro sprigs, leaves only (optional)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   4{ teaspoons soy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   1. Rinse the fish. Pat dry, then place in a heat-proof dish.
</P>
<P>
   2. Set a rack in a pot and add water to a depth of 1{ to 2
inches. (If you use a steamer, fill half the lower tier with
water.) Bring to a boil. Set dish on rack (or on upper tier of
steamer) and steam over high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, depending
on the thickness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   3. Test for doneness by poking a chopstick or sharp knife
through the thickest part of the fish. It should flake easily and
look opaque all the way to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   4. When fish is done, use a turkey baster or spoon to discard
any accumulated liquid.
</P>
<P>
   5. Sprinkle ginger, scallion and optional cilantro over fish.
Heat oil in a small skillet. Add soy sauce and heat for a few
seconds. Pour mixture over fish. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

`STRANGERS' ASSESSES IMPACT OF LATINO IMMIGRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ In churches, on playgrounds and in supermarkets
across the country, the growing presence of immigrant and
American-born Latinos is altering our society.
</P>
<P>
   Booming end-of-the-century immigration has fueled the Latino
population rise and ignited a national debate stoked by cliches and
misguided fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers Among Us: How Latino Immigration is Transforming
America,'' a new book by Washington Post immigration reporter
Roberto Suro, reaches beyond the overheated rhetoric to examine and
explain this controversial phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by excellent reporting, shrewd analysis and compelling
human stories, Suro unravels the why's and how's of Latino
migration to the United States. He sorts out the history of this
shift and the changes and challenges it brings to our country.
</P>
<P>
   In his reporting, Suro interviewed countless immigrants,
policymakers, academics and opinion leaders around the United
States to present a thorough and balanced examination of
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   As the American-born son of a Puerto Rican father and an
Ecuadorean mother, Suro treats the subjects of his stories
humanely.
</P>
<P>
   But his background doesn't stop him from presenting the harsh
realities and warning of potentially dire consequences facing U.S.
society if serious steps aren't taken to manage immigration and
integrate those already here so they do not become a permanent
underclass of working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Suro notes that Latino immigration to the United States exploded
in the 1980s fueled by civil wars in Central America, an economic
crisis in Mexico and a growing American demand for cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   He persuasively argues that illegal immigration spiraled
relatively uncontrolled over the last 30 years because U.S.
officials consistently adopted convoluted, weak compromises rather
than risk the fallout of establishing effective controls.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration control laws, he writes, have failed. ``No effective
or lasting agreements have been reached when it comes to spending
government money, risking economic disorder or taking political
heat in order to control the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   But Suro's book isn't filled with dry analysis. Powerfully
detailed portraits emerge of the many enclaves and distinct peoples
making up this new America.
</P>
<P>
   From Cuban Miami, ``the only barrio with a country club,'' to
the middle-class Mexican suburbs of Los Angeles, to the decaying
New York ghettos of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, to the tightly
woven network of Guatemalans in Houston, he presents a fascinating
tapestry of divergent and separate Latino-American worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Suro makes the point that the experience of Latino America is
far from the ``melting pot'' that absorbed Europeans and the Irish
into the American mainstream after the waves of immigrants landed
on Ellis Island.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos are not a single, cohesive people that can be classified
easily by race, he emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos include native-born citizens and immigrants from more
than a dozen nations. Even among compatriots, they differ from one
another by skin color, economic class, immigration status and their
ability or inability to speak English. These factors and more
create a pecking order among Latinos that separates one group from
another.
</P>
<P>
   Suro's tours of the various barrios illustrate this
fragmentation and help to explain why some immigrants succeed
against the odds and others remain in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges that cannot go unmet without severe social
repercussions is the growing competition and tension between
African-Americans and Latinos, Suro writes. The two groups are now
vying for ``jobs, neighborhoods and political clout'' in many
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a struggle between those already left behind by society
and newcomers who arrive with many disadvantages,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Suro is also concerned about the decay of the barrios and the
future of the enormous population of first-generation
Latino-Americans born of immigrant parents.
</P>
<P>
   He writes: ``Poor and low-skilled immigrants come to the United
States expecting to live at the bottom of the economic ladder, but
their children need patience, tolerance and investments to ensure
they have access to economic mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   For the barrios on the fringe, Suro advocates ``more bank
lending, small-business programs, public transportation and, of
course, better schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He decries the current anti-immigrant backlash that portrays
immigrants as a drain on taxpayers who must be stopped from
accessing public resources as the real threat to the country's
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exclusion will create a new kind of underclass of people who
live and work here and pay taxes but who are cut off from the
institutions and programs designed to give poor people a minimal
sense of security and to guarantee that there is a limit to misery
in America,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But while Suro believes access and opportunities should be made
available to those already here, he takes a hard line on illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   He favors imposing strict controls on the borders, penalties
that bar arrested undocumented crossers from future entry and
subjecting sending countries to a certification test that renews
economic aid based on cooperation to stop illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Suro concludes that the future of American society
will be determined in good part by how it copes with Latino
immigration. The outcome is yet to be defined, but Suro is
confident of this: ``At this point, we can be certain that more
Latinos will head north, that the United States will change them,
and that they will change the United States.'' &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SUNSET LIMITED &QL; 
 &UR; James Lee Burke (Doubleday, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   What can you say about Burke? That he sometimes overwrites but
does it with such flair that you not only forgive him, but enjoy
yourself in the process? That his descriptions are rich and his
characters authentic? That he's one of a handful of writers who
give the detective novel a good name? In his new book, Cajun
detective Dave Robicheaux _ Burke's alter ego _ investigates a
series of events that include a rape, an apparent suicide, several
murders and the ugly racial history of the deep South. Through all
of it, Burke weaves the mystery of the 1956 crucifixion of a labor
organizer named Jack Flynn, whose grown children have returned to
New Iberia, La., bringing their father's memory with them. The
twists are novel, the connections complex. It's all rooted in the
violent past, which is never really dead, Robicheaux knows, if you
choose to deny its existence. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; GARY COOPER: AMERICAN HERO &QL; 
 &UR; Jeffrey Meyers (Morrow, $26)
</P>
<P>
   He was, in the beginning, just a handsome cowboy from Montana.
That changed when he got to Hollywood. Cooper was shy, but as his
friend Richard Widmark noted, he also was ``catnip to the ladies.''
Other people put it more crudely (we really, really wish we could
tell you Clara Bow's exact words on the subject), but the bottom
line is that he got around and had a good time. His long series of
mistresses included the ribald Bow, Marlene Dietrich (she baked
cakes for him), Carole Lombard, Tallulah Bankhead, Patricia Neal,
Grace Kelly (``Listen,'' Neal said of Kelly, ``she slept with them
all.'') and Ingrid Bergman. Between conquests, he made movies, got
married, had a much-loved daughter, converted to Catholicism and
became friends with the likes of Ernest Hemingway. Read about it in
this amiable, if not terribly deep, biography. Cooper became ``the
icon of our longing for lost purity and innocence,'' Meyers says.
``His visual and spiritual force defined the classic American
hero.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE PROUD HIGHWAY &QL; 
 &UR; Hunter S. Thompson (Ballantine, $19.95)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is this collection of letters written by
Thompson from 1955 to 1967. That's right. The book is nearly 700
pages long (and pricey), and he's not finished yet. Thompson wrote
great, entertaining letters, even when he was apologizing for his
notoriously skewed behavior or haggling with editors over money.
Here is a partial list of his correspondents: Joan Baez, Tom Wolfe,
Lyndon Johnson (whom he scolded for the Vietnam War), Allen
Ginsberg, Norman Mailer, Charles Kuralt, Herb Caen and Ken Kesey.
The secret of this book, however, is not just that he wrote letters
but that he was deeply aware of their pending importance. He knew
that someday you might want to read the odd jottings of his early
life, so he made carbon copies of each letter, 20,000 in all (for
every one included here, editor Douglas Brinkley says, 15 were
cut). They are an offbeat record of a decade of American life by
one of the most entertaining bad boys of them all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BITING THE DUST &QL; 
 &UR; Margaret Horsfield (St. Martin's, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Are you among those people who throw body blocks at their front
doors rather than allow unexpected visitors to see into the debacle
beyond? Well, come sit here by Horsfield, because she'd like to
hear what you have to say. Her subject is housecleaning _ why we do
it, how we do it and how we feel about it. This is a book about our
attitudes toward dirt. Included are chapters on how our mothers
influence the way we clean (or don't), the history of cleaning
(squalor goes back a long way), germs, appliances and the high
standards they forced on us, domestic consumerism and the effects
of advertising on it, bugs and other vermin (and the cleaning
frenzy they set us to), ``clean freaks'' and professional cleaners.
And, oh yes, men _ there's a short chapter on them near the end, in
which Horsfield concedes that there might be a ``Mr. Clean''
somewhere in the world, but she hasn't met him yet. If you finish
her book and want more, there's ``Other People's Dirt'' by Louise
Rafkin (Algonquin, $17.95), about Rafkin's adventures in the
housecleaning trade. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; READING PEOPLE &QL; 
 &UR; Jo-Ellan Dimitrius (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   She helped pick the jury that acquitted the police officers
accused of beating Rodney King. She helped pick the jury that
acquitted O.J. Simpson. With all due respect to her track record,
we were not far into this book before we could not bear to read
another sentence of it. Dimitrius has written nearly 300 pages of
tips on how to ``read people,'' how to take in ``the hundreds of
bits of information available to you,'' process them and (begin
itals) enlarge (end itals) (italics hers) those few traits that are
most important, separating good information from silly details. We
have seen her on television talk shows and found her charming and
interesting. Some things, it seems, are just better in sound
bites. &QL;

VENETIAN RESTAURATEURS TO RAISE PROFILE AT LANDMARK RAINBOW ROOM
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was about 4 p.m. Giuseppe Cipriani had been on the
go since midmorning and had not eaten any lunch. When he spied a
plate of bread and salami in a kitchen at 55 Wall St., a landmark
building his company is converting into a hotel, he asked for it to
be sent to his office. He munched eagerly, gulping cups of dense
espresso, and asked for another serving.
</P>
<P>
   Late evenings often find him sharing a table with friends at
Downtown, the restaurant he opened two years ago in SoHo, but there
he typically jumps up from his plate of risotto every few minutes
to greet someone with kisses on both cheeks or to consult with the
staff. No wonder he's as slim as a breadstick.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cipriani, 34, heads an international company with 1,200
employees, his business style _ zipping between midtown and Wall
Street in a private car _ is as whirlwind and off-the-cuff as the
scavenged lunch or casual supper.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the name Harry Cipriani usually means the boutique
restaurant in the Sherry-Netherland that his father, Arrigo, opened
in 1985 and where they serve the Bellini, the white peach juice and
sparkling wine cocktail invented at Harry's Bar in Venice (started
by Cipriani's grandfather in 1931).
</P>
<P>
   But that profile is about to get a lot higher.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani International has just succeeded in beating out some
extremely heavy-duty competition for a $4 million-a-year lease on
the Rainbow Room, to start in January.
</P>
<P>
   The soaring, domed Great Hall at 55 Wall St., one of the
grandest banquet settings in the city, has been booked since
February. A Harry Cipriani restaurant is to open there in August,
with outdoor terrace seating overlooking Wall Street. The 140-room
Cipriani Wall Street Hotel is to follow on the upper floors in
early 1999. Cipriani has also signed leases in the restored Grand
Central Terminal for two restaurants, one to be called Midtown, and
a private dining room. The are also restaurants in Buenos Aires and
Venice, and a line of food products, soon to include a
single-serving Bellini.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose you could call me the CEO of the company,'' he said
with a warm smile. ``When you go to big corporations and ask them
for money they want you to have a title,'' he added in his ever so
slightly hesitant English that has a soft, Venetian accent.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the Cipriani stamp that New Yorkers are about to
see more of? Their restaurants are known for a certain clubby
quality _ for young, beautiful people in SoHo, for older, more
affluent beautiful people uptown. Regular customers bask in the
warmth of an attentive staff that some first-time visitors might
not find welcoming enough. The food, including the famous
carpaccio, tends to be refined and pricey, a style of Italian
cooking that Cipriani admits has ``always had the worst reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Ciprianis seem genetically programmed to
attract the right clients, who then become friends and business
associates. That, in a nutshell, is how Harry's Bar in Venice got
started and achieved its worldwide renown. And it's a technique
that continues to open doors and bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, when Cipriani learned that 55 Wall Street, the grand
limestone building that was built in 1842 as the Merchants Exchange
(and later expanded by McKim, Mead &AMP; White), was available, he
approached Sidney Kimmel, the chairman of the Jones Apparel Group
and a frequent customer at Harry Cipriani, to help him finance it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Seppi told me about the Wall Street property,'' Kimmel
said, ``I agreed to meet him at 9 the next morning, and by 3
o'clock we had a deal. I did no due diligence, but I loved the
idea.'' Kimmel is now a partner in Cipriani International.
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani said that when his 15-year Rainbow Room lease begins,
on Jan. 1, he planned to close the main room for one month, then
open it to the public only on Friday nights, for Sunday brunch and
one Saturday night a month with guest chefs. The rest of the time
it will be booked for private functions. (It's used that way much
of the time now.) At lunch time, it will remain a private club.
Giuseppe Marangi, who has been at Harry Cipriani, is to oversee the
food. The floor below will continue to be used for parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainbow and Stars cabaret will disappear. The room is to
become an elegant restaurant, which Cipriani would like to turn
over to another operator to manage and lure a chef of the stature
of Alain Ducasse and Nobu Matsuhisa. Other plans (perhaps a cabaret
or night club) are still being hatched for other parts of the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Zagat, the publisher of the Zagat surveys, who calls the
Rainbow Room ``New York's crown jewel,'' was critical of the
Ciprianis taking over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it,'' he said. ``You need someone very theatrical,
and they basically just run restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   And in New York, loyalty to Joseph Baum, who revived the Rainbow
Room 10 years ago and whose lease is expiring, runs high.
</P>
<P>
   The Cipriani approach appealed to Jerry Speyer, the president of
Tishman-Speyer, co-owners and the operators of Rockefeller Center.
Speyer wants to make Rockefeller Center _ and the Rainbow Room _
places that will attract New Yorkers, not just tourists. ``A small
restaurant for dining and a large space for catering is what New
Yorkers want today,'' Speyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a little tired,'' Cipriani said of the Rainbow
Room. ``The service is a disaster. But it's an American institution
that has to be treated with respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``These places, 55 Wall Street, the Rainbow Room and Grand
Central station, are historically beautiful properties,'' he
continued. ``Maybe I'm attracted to them because I grew up in
Venice, where everything is historic and beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   And being a Venetian, he keeps a boat moored at 23rd Street in
the East River. He tries to find time to use it on weekends,
especially when his two children, 8, and 10, are visiting from
Milan (where they live with his former wife).
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is not used to its water,'' he said. ``I would love
to see Canal Street a canal again so you could get across town in a
boat.''

GARLIC IN ANOTHER GUISE: AS A BASE FOR SOUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garlic bulbs are at their juiciest, least sharp and least bitter
at this time of year. When long-cooked, garlic is mild and sweet,
not aggressive; even those who are put off by raw garlic's strong
taste will find this broth deliciously smooth.
</P>
<P>
   It is versatile, too, because it can be eaten on its own with
the addition of just a few ad-hoc ingredients. Consider some
jalapeno pepper, cilantro and lime juice; diced tomato, chopped
parsley, matchsticks of zucchini and thinly sliced basil; cooked
peas and small leaves of spinach; lemon grass, curry leaves and
lime juice, or anything else that appeals to you. Traditional
additions, in quantities determined by the cook's imagination, are
poached eggs with croutons, or egg drops (for stracciatella) and
thin slivers of Serrano ham, or tomatoes and stale bread, or
broccoli rape.
</P>
<P>
   As for soups that one can create using the broth as a base, here
are three that will please vegetarians and meat-eaters alike:
</P>
<P>
   The first takes advantage of vegetables in season now: peas and
asparagus (or fiddlehead ferns). They shine in all their freshness
with little competition from the other ingredients. This soup is
pretty, with its dots of white and green. And what is amazing is
that the garlic does not overpower these seemingly delicate
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   I always make at least double the amount called for in the
curry-tomato soup recipe. It can be served hot before a big-salad
lunch, or cold before a summer dinner of grilled fish or roast
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients in the mixed vegetable potage can vary as summer
progresses, and leftovers are just fine. I usually scan the
refrigerator to see what I have on hand before I go shopping. It is
amazing what can happen to a slightly wilted bunch of watercress or
some cooked carrots from last night's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This is the comforting soup that Europeans _ particularly the
French _ have lived on from about the 15th century to our own
times. I like to make it in large quantities because it freezes and
reheats well. For added richness, stir in some butter just before
serving.
</P>
<P>
   GARLIC BROTH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 small heads garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, optional
if the broth is served as a soup on its own.
</P>
<P>
   1. Smash the garlic heads, separating the cloves. Smash and peel
the cloves, and cut in half lengthwise. If necessary, remove the
green germ that grows through the center.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan, warm the oil over low heat. Stir in the
garlic, and cook, stirring often, for about 20 minutes or until the
outside is translucent and the garlic is soft. Do not let the
garlic brown.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add 9 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and
simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes. The garlic will be very tender.
If using the broth on its own, season to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 cups.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHT SOUP WITH PEAS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   5 cups garlic broth (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds peas in the pod, shelled (2 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Tip from 1-pound bunch of medium asparagus, reserving the stems
for another use (or 1/4 pound fiddlehead ferns, well washed).
</P>
<P>
   1. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of the broth to a boil with
the rice. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium saucepan, add half of the peas to the remaining
broth, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 5
minutes. Strain, reserving the liquid.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a blender, puree peas with a little reserved liquid. Whisk
together remaining liquid and the puree. Season with salt and
pepper. The soup can be made ahead up to this point and
refrigerated for up to 2 days.
</P>
<P>
   4. Return the soup to the stove, and bring to a boil. Stir in
the remaining peas (and the fiddleheads, if using). Return to a
boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 3 minutes. Add the rice, and
simmer for 2 minutes longer. If using the asparagus instead of the
ferns, add them and the rice after the peas have simmered for 3
minutes. Simmer for 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   CURRY-TOMATO SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sweet paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups canned Italian plum tomatoes, pureed with their juice
</P>
<P>
   2 cups garlic broth (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons plain yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over low heat. Stir in
the onion, and cook until the onion is limp and completely
translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir in the curry powder and the
paprika, and cook, stirring constantly, for 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stir in the tomato sauce and broth. Bring to a boil. Lower
the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Stir in the salt. The soup can
be made ahead up to this point. Refrigerate for 2 hours or
overnight if serving cold, or reheat.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stir in lemon juice and pepper. Top each serving with 2
tablespoons of the yogurt.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   MIXED VEGETABLE POTAGE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 3/4 pounds spinach, stemmed and washed well
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds mashing potatoes, peeled, halved lengthwise and cut
crosswise into 1/4-inch-thick slices
</P>
<P>
   12 medium carrots, peeled and cut crosswise into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2 medium onions, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   10 cups garlic broth (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   9 teaspoons butter (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1. In a tall stockpot, bring all the ingredients, except the
salt, pepper and butter, to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for
30 minutes, or until each of the vegetables is easily pierced with
the tip of a knife.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pass the soup through the medium disk of a food mill, or skim
the vegetables out of the liquid, and pulse them to a coarse puree
in a food processor. If using a food processor, recombine the
vegetables and the liquid. Season with salt and pepper. The soup
may be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bring to a simmer. If desired, stir a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of
the butter into every portion just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 4 quarts.

 &HT;    LEGISLATION AIMS TO PUT HIGH SCHOOLS ON TEEN TIME
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move sure to wake up the youth vote, a
California congresswoman plans to introduce legislation Wednesday
encouraging high schools to start later in the morning so teenagers
can sleep in longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for high schools to sychronize their clocks with
their students' body clocks so that teens are in school during
their most alert hours and can achieve their full academic
potential,'' said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren, a mother and education advocate, will unveil her ``Zs
to As'' bill at a Capitol Hill press conference where she will be
joined by several sleep researchers who support putting high
schools on teen time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puberty changes the body's sleep cycle in such a way that
teenagers stay alert later at night and are sleepier in the
morning,'' said William Dement, a Stanford University professor and
chairman of the National Sleep Foundation's Government Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shift in their biological clocks makes it difficult for
them to fall asleep early enough at night to get all the sleep they
need for an early class,'' Dement said in a prepared statement.
``As a consequence, many adolescents are severely sleep-deprived,
which often leads to serious academic, behavioral and psychological
problems as well as a greatly increased risk for accidents and
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Research also shows a direct correlation between a good night's
sleep (about eight and a half hours for teens) and good grades.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, local school districts _ not Congress _ set school
hours. However, Lofgren's legislation would encourage high schools
to start later by providing a federal grant of up to $25,000 to
cover administrative and operating costs resulting from the change.
</P>
<P>
   The National Sleep Foundation, an independent, nonprofit
organization that promotes public understanding of sleep and sleep
disorders, recommends that high schools start classes at 9 a.m. or
later.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren said that additional social problems would be addressed
by changing a typical 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. schoolday to 9 a.m. to
4 p.m. That would reduce the hours that children are without
parental supervision after school. FBI statistics show that about
half of all violent juvenile crime occurs between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Many school administrators have argued that the later hours
reduce the time for after-school activities such as sports, band
and academic clubs.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers say theres a biological basis for all those
teenagers stubbornly clinging to their pillows while exasperated
parents pull them from bed to get to school by 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are waking up and going to school at a time when their
brains are still in the nighttime mode,'' said Mary Carskandon, a
sleep researcher at the Brown University School of Medicine. ``Even
in second period, they are not ready to learn, not ready to be
engaged in education.''

MAGIC WITH QUICK MARINADES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might think that you don't have the time to marinate meat or
fish before grilling it, but it's time-consuming only if you think
a marinade has to tenderize.
</P>
<P>
   As far as I'm concerned, there are only two goals in marinating
before grilling: to add flavor and to promote browning and
crispness. Neither of these requires long soaking, although dunking
the meat or fish while the grill heats contributes to a slightly
greater penetration of flavor. (If you really have no time, simply
smear the food with the sauce as it is going on the grill.)
</P>
<P>
   Which flavor to add is a matter of taste. My favorite is soy
sauce, complemented with garlic and ginger; for best flavor, each
of these should be fresh, rather than powdered.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to promote browning. Anything with sugar browns
quickly _ often too quickly, as you know if you've ever slathered a
piece of chicken with barbecue sauce before grilling it. That's why
ketchup forms the basis of so many commercial barbecue sauces; it
contains so much sugar (or, more likely, corn syrup), that it
browns in a flash. Honey works better in my sauce. It has a clean
sweetness and contributes stickiness and heft, allowing the sauce
to adhere better to the food. Molasses is also good, and so is
hoisin sauce, a kind of Chinese ketchup that contains a great deal
of sugar but also soy.
</P>
<P>
   The final ingredient is acid, not to tenderize the meat but to
balance sweetness. Lime goes best with soy, but almost any acidic
liquid will do, from lemon juice to white vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   That's it: soy and spices for flavor, honey for browning, body
and sweetness, and lime for acidity. There are ways to make this
sauce more complex, as listed below. But even in its simple form,
it perfectly enhances naturally tender meats like steak, burgers,
boneless chicken breasts or thighs, tuna and swordfish, all of
which can be turned in the sauce before putting them on the grill.
Longer-cooking meats, like bone-in chicken, should be cooked within
10 minutes of doneness before basting with the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a safety tip: to avoid bacterial contamination,
marinade that was applied to raw food should not be brushed on
again during the last few minutes of cooking, nor should it be used
as a sauce unless it is boiled for a few minutes. And, as always,
marinade brushes and other utensils that are used with raw food
should not be used again near the end of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERFECT SOY-GRILLED STEAK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 30 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   \ cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon peeled and minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon peeled and minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey, molasses or hoisin sauce
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lime
</P>
<P>
   1 16- to 24-ounce boneless steak (rib-eye, skirt or strip), or
one 24- to 32-ounce bone-in steak (rib-eye or T-bone).
</P>
<P>
   1. Start a charcoal or wood fire or heat a gas grill; the fire
should be hot and the rack no more than 4 inches from the heat
source. Mix together the first 6 ingredients; taste and add more of
anything you like. Turn the steak in the sauce once or twice, then
let sit in the sauce until the grill is hot.
</P>
<P>
   2. Turn the steak one more time, then place on the grill; spoon
any remaining sauce over it. For rare meat, grill about 3 minutes a
side for steaks less than an inch thick. For larger or more done
steak, increase the time slightly.  &QL; 
Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Make a Good Thing Even Better &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Many ingredients can be added to this basic marinade for grilled
meat or fish to heighten its flavor. Add too many at once, however,
and you run the risk of muddying the taste. Some possible
additions:
</P>
<P>
   Mustard: 1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sesame or other roasted nut oil: about a teaspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter or tahini (sesame paste): about a tablespoon.
(Some sesame seeds or finely chopped peanuts are good, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Minced onion, chopped scallion or shallots.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared horseradish (about 1 tablespoon) or wasabi powder
(about 1 teaspoon).
</P>
<P>
   Minced zest of a lemon, lime or orange.
</P>
<P>
   Minced cilantro or shiso: about 1 tablespoon, plus more for
garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Ground cumin (up to a tablespoon) or coriander (up to a
teaspoon) or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Minced jalapeno, crushed red chilies or Tabasco or other hot
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Worcestershire or fish sauce (nuoc mam or nam pla, sold in most
Asian markets): about a tablespoon.

<P>
   AIX-OPERA-FESTIVAL (Aix-En-Provence, France) _ Amid Europe's
ever more crowded calendar of summer musical happenings, the slow
demise of the opera festival in this bucolic southern French city
went largely unnoticed. In its heyday, in the 1950s and 60s, when
it reintroduced Mozart to France, le tout Paris would flock here
every July. But in recent years, even for dedicated opera lovers,
Aix was increasingly overshadowed by Salzburg, Bayreuth,
Glyndebourne and other festivals more offbeat, glitzy or
crowd-pleasing. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   KAUFFMANN-FILM-CRITIC (Undated) _ Sixteen years into his
marathon run as the film critic for The New Republic, Stanley
Kauffmann sat down in 1974 to write an essay to answer the two
questions he was most often asked: How many films do you see in a
week? And don't you get bored? Zero to 12 and no, Kauffmann
answered in that essay, ``Why I'm Not Bored.'' A film may be
boring, but the idea of going never is. Boredom is incompatible
with hope, Kauffmann wrote, and hope is more of a constant in film
than in virtually any other art in America. By Janny Scott.

<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   X-FILES-FILM (Undated) _ The ``X-Files'' film has brought us two
things that the television show had not: the Barbie-as-Scully and
Ken-as-Mulder collectible dolls, each with its own little FBI
badge. Merchandising has nothing to do with the film's many
convoluted plots, but money has everything to do with what happened
to ``The X-Files'' in its leap from television to the movies. By
Caryn James.
</P>
<P>
   GONE-WITH-THE-WIND (Undated) _ ``Gone With the Wind'' is still
generally accepted as the most widely seen motion picture ever to
come out of Hollywood. When its estimated income is adjusted to
reflect the increase in ticket prices over 59 years, it is still
one of the biggest-grossing movies in history, topped only by a
handful of others, including the newest champion of champions,
``Titanic.'' By Vincent Canby.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL-SWEDISH-BALLET (Undated) _ The Royal Swedish Ballet,
celebrating its founding in 1773, held a highly successful 225th
anniversary festival this month. This showcase of performances in
Stockholm, was enhanced by an international lecture series. By Anna
Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TANGLEWOOD-FESTIVAL (Undated) _ The Tanglewood Music Center in
Lenox, Mass., the most prestigious summer training institute for
young musicians in the United States, has just begun its 49th
season, and much attention will be focused on Seiji Ozawa, who, as
music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, oversees artistic
matters at the center. Over the last two summers, Ozawa fomented a
shakeup, which provoked angry, noisy resignations from respected
leaders of the center: the pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher, who
had been artistic director for 12 years, and the pianist Gilbert
Kalish, who had served on the faculty for nearly 30 years, the last
12 as chairman. By Anthony Tommasini.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-CONCERT-MUSIC (Undated) _ A venerable article of faith
holds that American concert music ``came of age'' after World War
I. Previous American composers, we are told, were second-rate
clones of German teachers. Virgil Thomson called the music of
George Chadwick, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, Amy Beach
and other prominent turn-of-the-century Americans ``a pale copy''
of ``Continental models'' and reckoned their scale of achievement
``a sort of adolescence.'' By Joseph Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   OPERAS-80s (Undated) _ The scarcity of good new operas in the
present decade _ unless something remarkable happens more than once
during the next year and a half _ makes all the more striking how
much was achieved in the 80s. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BRANDY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The appeal of ``Never Say Never,'' the
second album by the teen-age rhythm-and-blues singer Brandy, lies
not in her inventing anything new but in her delivering familiar
pleasures with all the accessories. And she can really sing. For a
performer who just turned 19, Brandy seems to have a grown-up
control freak's attention to detail, and it has served her career
well. By Dimitri Ehrlich.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM-CONGDON-ART (Milan, Italy) _ Taking the measure of
William Congdon, who died April 15 on his 86th birthday, proves
tricky. As a painter associated with the New York School, the
cluster of Abstract Expressionists who shook up the art world in
the late 1940s and 50s, Congdon distinguished himself with his
spirited cityscapes of New York and Venice, often rendered in thick
strokes of black and gold. By Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-ART-MUSEUMS (Undated) _ For some, the ``culture
wars'' between liberals and conservatives have been at best a
sideshow. The main event (it's been going on since the Renaissance)
has been the struggle between artists and politicians. Artists
understand that creativity invites destruction. Politicians prefer
to snack on sweetness and light. Victoria Newhouse's new book,
``Toward the New Museum'' (The Monacelli Press), offers a shrewd,
biting account of one of the most conspicuous fields in which this
struggle has been joined in recent decades: the architecture of art
museums. By Herbert Muschamp.

NEW CENSUS NOMINEE SUPPORTS CONTROVERSIAL SAMPLING METHOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Optional ending included) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday nominated New York
social scientist Kenneth Prewitt to head the Census Bureau, an
agency mired in a political and legal controversy as it tries to
get an accurate reading for the year 2000 population count.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy centers around the bureau's proposal to use a
statistical accounting method in addition to its standard head
count in an effort to include U.S. citizens _ mostly minorities _
who either do not receive or fail to complete a survey that will be
sent to every U.S. household in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, who maintain a head count is the only
way the Constitution allows the census to be taken, are leery of
allowing the Clinton administration to use statistical sampling to
estimate the number of minorities, a traditionally strong voting
bloc for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP-dominated House has sued the Census Bureau to block the
sampling method, arguing that the Constitution's call for an
``actual enumeration'' of the U.S. population requires a head count
and prohibits other calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said statistical sampling yields the most accurate
results by accounting for people census takers might miss. Without
the use of statistics, the 2000 Census might result in another
inaccurate count, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has said it failed to count 8 million people,
mostly minorities and children, in the 1990 survey.
</P>
<P>
   An accurate count is vital because the government uses census
data in deciding how to distribute federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high stakes, it is unfortunate that Census 2000 has
become prey to partisan disagreements,'' Prewitt said at a news
conference announcing his nomination. ``These differences place
Census 2000 at risk by delaying the bureau's preparation for the
enormously complex task of accurately counting the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three federal judges this month heard arguments for
and against the constitutionality of statistical sampling from
lawyers for the Census Bureau and House, respectively. The judges
have yet to rule, and whatever they decide will likely be appealed
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt, 62, said he has used statistical sampling in collecting
data for the New York-based Social Science Research Council, of
which he is president, and in his five years as director of the
National Opinion Research Center in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific sampling is used widely,'' Prewitt said.
``Sampling, if properly used, can contribute to a more accurate
census.''
</P>
<P>
   If Congress or the courts prohibit the use of statistical
sampling, Prewitt said he would still press ahead to ``conduct the
most accurate and cost-effective census possible.'' Prewitt, whose
nomination still must be confirmed by the Senate, also pledged to
work closely with Congress to ensure the bureau remains a
``nonpartisan agency obligated by law and guided by professional
traditions'' to present objective data at a reasonable cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley, in whose department the bureau
resides, also defended statistical sampling as a way to achieve an
accurate count of the U.S. population. Daley said past surveys that
relied solely on head counts yielded inaccurate results to the
misfortune of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equality before the law and one person, one vote are at
stake,'' Daley said in introducing Prewitt. ``We are proud of the
scientific plan developed by the professionals at the Census
Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton defended the plan to use statistical sampling
during his visit to Houston this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should all want the most accurate method,'' Clinton said in
the Hispanic enclave of Magnolia Park in east Houston. ``An
inaccurate census distorts our understanding of the needs of our
people, and in many respects, therefore, it diminishes the quality
of life not only for them, but for all the rest of us as well.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A pile of carrots, turnips, onions, shallots, lettuce
leaves and potatoes lay on a stainless-steel table at the French
Culinary Institute's teaching kitchen. My mission, on this first
day of La Technique, the institute's basic course for amateur
chefs, was to turn those vegetables into textbook examples of the
basic French cuts: juliennes, paysannes, chiffonnades and the
nearly invisible specks known as macedoines.
</P>
<P>
   No problem.
</P>
<P>
   I sized up the carrot in front of me, set to work and, with a
deft slice, removed the tip of my left thumb.
</P>
<P>
   This was not in the course description.
</P>
<P>
   My goal, rather than self-mutilation, was to test the
basic-skills courses offered by New York's top cooking schools: the
French Culinary Institute, Peter Kump's New York Cooking School and
the culinary arts division of the New School. In a city where you
can find a course on everything from flirting to klezmer playing,
it is no surprise to find that the amateur chef with higher
aspirations, or even the fumbling beginner, can find professional
help. In the past, a small army of chefs and caterers took in small
groups of students and passed along their skills. With the
restaurant boom of the past 20 years, however, the private tutors
have largely been replaced by schools that have a more or less
formal curriculum, with many courses designed for nonprofessionals.
</P>
<P>
   They are doing a thriving business. The New School has more than
tripled its enrollment in the past decade. In 1995, Peter Kump had
to add on a second location, doubling its capacity. ``Enrollment is
going up all the time for these kinds of classes,'' said Gary
Goldberg, the executive director of culinary arts at the New
School. ``There is a whole generation that knows about food, but
does not know how to cook it.''
</P>
<P>
   All three schools offer a range of courses. But for the
ambitious amateur, or the hopeless duffer who needs a good
grounding in the basics, the schools have developed the culinary
equivalent of an undergraduate survey course: programs that promise
to transform toast-burners and roast-ruiners into reasonably
competent home chefs in a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the catalog descriptions, the courses sound quite similar.
But after attending 10 hours of classes at each school, I
discovered marked differences. A lesson on sauteing can mean that
students watch the stove as the instructor explains what's
happening. Or it might mean that they dice up vegetables, grab a
pan and go to work, with the results subject to a searching
critique.
</P>
<P>
   My bleeding thumb brought on intense feelings of nostalgia for
the New School's gentle introduction to the rigors of the kitchen,
Fundamental Culinary Techniques.
</P>
<P>
   One evening a week, for eight weeks, about a dozen students rang
the doorbell at a nondescript townhouse on Greenwich Avenue, just
west of Seventh Avenue South. They headed downstairs to the New
School's dining room and small kitchen, where the instructor,
Stephen Schmidt, waited, sleeves rolled up and knife in hand.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three hours, the class sat on tall stools around
the kitchen counter and, a little like a studio audience called up
onstage during a Food Network show, watched and listened as Schmidt
worked his way through the components of the evening's meal,
explaining as he went along. We came, he cooked, we feasted.
</P>
<P>
   As his text, Schmidt used photocopied chapters from his cookbook
``Master Recipes: A New Approach to the Fundamentals of Good
Cooking.'' (A former restaurant chef, he also contributed several
chapters to the revised ``Joy of Cooking.'') Taken together, the
recipes constituted a tour of the cooking basics.
</P>
<P>
   The bill of fare one evening included sauteed lamb chops with a
mustard and caper deglazing sauce, roast beef rib with Yorkshire
pudding and horseradish sauce, roasted brussels sprouts, mashed
potatoes, potato and brie gratin, and roasted potatoes. Lots of
material there. From time to time, Schmidt would hand around some
paring knives or potato peelers, and students would do a little
slicing and dicing, but the emphasis was on demonstration, not
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Students could learn as little or as much as they liked. There
was no exam, no diploma or certificate to work toward and no
pressure. Schmidt would reinforce his lessons by throwing out
questions _ ``Why did I just put the Yorkshire pudding in the top
of the oven?'' _ and awarding a verbal ``gold star'' if anyone came
up with the correct answer (oven heat travels from the top down).
</P>
<P>
   This easygoing style seemed to suit the students in my class,
who were in their late 20s and early 30s and, in most cases, were
taking their first tentative steps in the kitchen. The course costs
$570, plus a $145 materials fee.
</P>
<P>
   If you listened and took notes, there was a lot of useful
information floating around the room. A stick of salted butter has
about a teaspoon of salt. A slice of bread makes about a quarter
cup of bread crumbs. A peach does not ripen once it has been
picked, so feel it and smell it before you buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Schmidt communicated the sense that
cooking is partly trial and error, and most of the time, a lot of
fun. With great enthusiasm, he tested a tip offered by a British
friend, who had scolded him for not shaking his parboiled potatoes
in the pan before roasting them.
</P>
<P>
   He gave it a try during one class and found that, sure enough,
shaking roughened the surface of the potatoes just enough so that
butter adhered to them more evenly, resulting in a perfect crunchy
crust. The message was clear. Food is a big subject. We're all
students. Proceed without fear.
</P>
<P>
   For wobbly beginners, the New School is the place to go. It
offers an easy, welcoming introduction to the art of cooking, in a
sociable environment. Home chefs who cook fairly regularly will be
frustrated by not getting to roll up their sleeves and get dirty,
but for novices, a little hands-on experience each week is probably
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The introductory course at Peter Kump's cooking school is called
Techniques of Fine Cooking 1, but it is better known by the
clipped, no-nonsense name Tech 1. Presented in five classes of five
hours each, at a cost of $295 plus a $190 materials fee, it is
designed to present the techniques that underlie most recipes,
rather than the recipes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Tech 1 plunges right into the hurly-burly of chopping and
mincing almost from the first moment of the first class, which
started with a preparation for gazpacho. The students, who were
instructed to show up with a professional-quality paring knife,
chef's knife, apron and dish towel, got a brief lecture on kitchen
utensils, cookware and proper left-hand positioning when using a
knife _ left thumb tucked behind the fingers, fingers curled
inward, knuckles resting against the knife to support and guide it.
Then they jumped right into the business of chopping. When the
vegetable massacre was finished, the class moved on to blanching
and sauteing, and how to make a properly emulsified vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The third-floor kitchen at 307 East 92nd St., reached by a
near-vertical staircase, was small, with just enough room for two
work tables, two sinks and two stoves. (It will shortly be a thing
of the past, as nearly all the instructional programs relocate to
three floors at 50 West 23rd St. by the end of the year.) The eight
members of the class divided into four-person teams at each table
and shared the work by consensus, making sure that everyone got a
decent chance to truss a chicken or shake the saute pan with that
chefly snap of the wrist that sends the vegetables on a controlled
flight path up over the pan and safely back in.
</P>
<P>
   The course covered a fair amount of ground, set forth in a
three-ring binder filled with recipes, information on techniques
and ingredients, study questions like ``In roasting, what role does
fat play?'' (it keeps the meat moist), and a lesson plan for each
class. Our instructor, Melanie Underwood, formerly a pastry chef at
the Four Seasons and a sous-chef at the Plaza, introduced each new
step with a short demonstration and then turned the students loose
to reproduce her efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the atmosphere was relaxed, Ms. Underwood managed to
push the class along through the day's program with remarkable
efficiency, circulating between the tables to keep an eye on each
student's progress, offering a word of encouragement here,
correcting a mistake there, and fielding questions. In a class that
ran from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. there was no lunch break. When hunger
pangs became crippling, students would drift over to pick at a
communal plate of crackers, cheese cubes and fruit. The reward came
at 3 p.m., when, as at the New School, the students gathered to eat
the day's experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The class was a mixed bunch in most respects, but sex was not
one of them. I was the lone male, a singularity explained by the
class' daytime hours. Night classes are typically two-thirds
female, one third male, with heavy representation from Wall Street
and the financial markets, where it seems that cooking now counts
as one of the desirable manly arts. The members of my class, a
heavily international group, was a little older than the New School
team and a little more focused on techniques and principles.
</P>
<P>
   Tech 1 managed to retain some of the fun factor and the sociable
atmosphere of the New School's course while putting the students
through a reasonably demanding, workmanklike regimen. This is the
course for beginners and low-level intermediate cooks who want a
fairly ambitious, structured experience and have the energy to do
focused work for five hours at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   At the French Culinary Institute, the joking stops. The school,
which is dedicated to turning out professionals trained in the
classic French techniques, retains the feel of a professional
school, or perhaps a military academy, even in La Technique, its
22-week course for ``serious amateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are issued a chef's jacket stitched with their name and
the school motto (``Qualite, Discipline, Realite''), a scarf and a
pair of black-and-white-checked chef's pants. They are outfitted
with a set of professional knives and a red plastic toolbox filled
with implements like a balloon whisk, a whetstone and a pastry bag.
With 22 weeks of class work to come, it's hard not to think of boot
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Technique kitchens are so spacious and well equipped that in
a smallish class, like ours, each student had his own
stainless-steel work station _ correction, poste de travail _ four
burners and an oven. The tuition is no joke either: this fall, it
will jump from $3,960 to $4,290 for 22 five-hour sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Alison Muir, the instructor, was a former chef who had been
tested in the fires of La Varenne cooking school in France, and she
brought French rigor and perfectionism back with her. Although the
recipes provided in the three-ring notebook that served as our
textbook came with precise measurements, real chefs, we were told,
measure by eye, and we should get used to doing the same. Those who
did not make the grade would not get their certificate of
completion.
</P>
<P>
   Graduates of La Technique, which devotes an entire lesson each
to stocks and sauces, eggs, potatoes, fish, shellfish, consommes
and marinades, pastry, and each of the major meats, are eligible to
enter the intermediate level of the professional program, although
no more than five percent do. ``In the professional course, I yell
at people, and they have to call me chef,'' she said. ``You can
call me chef, or Alison, whatever you like. Otherwise, the courses
are pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   I'll say. That first day, my thumb swathed in a hundred layers
of gauze, I played a desperate game of catch-up, racing against the
clock to produce my quota of acceptable dice, mini-dice,
microscopic dice, paper-thin slices and confetti-size bits. I left
class in a lather, dreading Lesson 2.
</P>
<P>
   But, like most of my classmates, I found the knife work easier
in the second week, although Ms. Muir pointed out that no one had
yet executed a respectable julienne. For the first hour, we refined
our vegetable cuts and struggled to master the art of tournage,
which required us to render carrots, turnips and potatoes into an
attractive football shape, in sizes ranging from a peanut M&AMP;M
(bouquetiere) to a little finger (chateau). Turned vegetables look
attractive on the plate, and they cook more evenly in the pan.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get good at this, fill up a bowl with vegetables and sit
down in front of the TV,'' Ms. Muir said. ``It's very relaxing. I
start remembering my dreams, and one of these days I'll probably
start channeling the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour into the tournage, I developed a painful blister on
the second joint of my right thumb. My vegetables looked like
primitive arrowheads. Carrots were the worst, intractable little
orange pillars with an infuriating tendency to chip rather than
accept a smooth curve. But the rest of my cuts, Ms. Muir said,
showed a 50-percent improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Next, using all four burners, we went work on cooking the
vegetables: steaming (a l'etuve), boiling and shocking in ice water
(a l'anglaise), glazing without browning (glacer a blond), and
glazing until the sugar in the pan caramelizes and turns the
vegetables dark brown (glacer a brun). The goal was to have all the
vegetables emerge at the same time, ready for assembly on the
plate, with a pea-filled artichoke heart as the centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what happened. With all burners blazing, I managed to
pull it all together just as the clock wound down. The dish looked
pleasing, edible and colorful. It passed inspection, with one minor
demerit. ``You didn't French your beans,'' Ms. Muir pointed out.
True. I had forgotten to slit the beans and remove their seeds. But
that was a lot better than opening a vein in front of the whole
class. For one fleeting moment, I was a real chef.
</P>
<P>
   This is the course for the few, the proud, the brave, a
full-tilt workout for keen amateurs who want to take their game
several levels upward, or perhaps even get a whiff of what it feels
like to be a professional. Hint: It feels like hard, hard work.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The mercury rose to 102 degrees in Tallahassee, Fla., on Monday,
bringing the number of days that the city has reached or exceed 100
degrees this month to nine. The extreme heat will continue
Wednesday across the Southeast and southern plains as burly high
pressure remains steadfast. Temperatures will climb to 100 degrees
in many areas from South Carolina to Texas. Spotty thunder will
bring relief to parts of the Florida peninsula and Gulf Coast as
inland-penetrating sea breezes lift the torrid air into towering
cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms will also form from eastern Pennsylvania to
Virginia as a disturbance trudges through the region. With winds
aloft weak, slow-moving thunderstorms will produce localized
flooding. An onshore flow of cool, moist air will promote coastal
low clouds from Maine to Virginia while morning clouds will yield
to afternoon showers in interior New England. Western New York will
turn sunny and less humid.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will develop from North Dakota to Michigan
as a flow of warm, muggy air aloft overruns cooler air at the
surface. Changing wind directions with height will impart rotation
to some of the storms, increasing the risk for hail and isolated
tornadoes. Spotty thunder will also erupt in the late afternoon
heat from Iowa to western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a cold front will invade the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies, accompanied by showers and chilly air. The
Southwest will be sunny and seasonably warm, though coastal clouds
will plague California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Double Record
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Melbourne, Fla., registered a record morning low of
68 degrees, which was followed by a record afternoon high of 97.
Both records are attributed to a strong high pressure zone over
Florida. High pressure systems produce currents of sinking air,
which dry upon descent through the atmosphere. The resulting ample
sunshine causes the heating of the ground by the sun, and the
consequent heating of the air by the ground, to be maximized. At
night, the absence of clouds and significant water vapor allows for
the day's warmth to escape readily into space.

GROWING OLDER WITH CONRAD IS A WONDERFUL THING TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the initiation eight years ago of these weekly literary
sermons, my reading has been given more to old stuff than to new.
It seems harder nowadays to manage time for reading; but when I do
manage, my greater inclination is to seek out a classic title. It
may be a work I failed to read despite earnest intention, or it may
be a book I read when I was much younger, and now find to be a
quite different book because I am a quite different person.
</P>
<P>
   I know I once inhaled youthful pride in being a precocious
reader, but reading prematurely is not always a good thing. In my
teen years, not yet savvy for reading between the lines, I
certainly wasn't ready for Joseph Conrad. I tried, though. I went
the full distance with ``Lord Jim'' and ``Victory'' and started but
couldn't get into ``The Nigger of the Narcissus.''
</P>
<P>
   An English major in college could not avoid Conrad, but I faked
the issue, reading mostly ``about'' his novels and passing on other
people's critical opinions as my own. I left Conrad alone until the
1979 movie ``Apocalypse Now'' prodded my belated reading of ``Heart
of Darkness,'' the great novella it paraphrases. That led in turn
to an investigation of Conrad's short stories, most of them
masterful _ ``The Secret Sharer'' perhaps above all.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after commencing this series, I felt obligated to write
about Conrad. I hoped to articulate my mixed feelings about his
work. For preparation, I reread ``Victory'' with heightened
understanding and appreciation; read again and this time finished
``The Nigger of the Narcissus''; read ``Nostromo'' for the first
time; and although I now warmed to Conrad, I resisted for a while
another look into ``Lord Jim.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s Richard Brooks' film of ``Lord Jim'' with Peter
O'Toole and James Mason was a consensus flop and, I thought, a
failure on all counts. The movie persuaded me (wrongly) that ``Lord
Jim'' is Conrad's most famous work for being the most
philosophically pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   However, prose style is unphotogenic, rendering it almost
impossible to capture the essence of Joseph Conrad on film. He has
to be read, and finally I was cajoled by a Conrad admirer into
giving ``Lord Jim'' another chance. Reread I did; and now I'm in
camp with those who rate it a great novel.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it great? Let me count the ways. It involves the reader
into the heart and mind and soul of the tormented protagonist. The
narrative detailing a young man's desperate quest for spiritual
peace has pulsating vitality. Jim's obsession is to atone for an
act of instinctive cowardice that will haunt the rest of his life;
and Conrad's stylistic grace is so appropriate for a tale that
suggests a biblical parable.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkable man was the Polish-born Teodor Josef Konrad
Korzenowski. He was a 21-year-old sailor on a British merchant ship
when he first made acquaintance with the English language he was
destined to glorify. In 1886, he became a naturalized British
subject as Joseph Conrad. With the publication of ``Almayer's
Folly'' in 1895, Conrad was a first novelist at age 38; and when he
died in 1924, he was the author of 18 books, had also co-written
two novels with Ford Madox Ford, and had secure reputation as one
of the world's great authors.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad has literary kinship with Herman Melville and Jack
London. Like them, he is often characterized as a man's writer.
Strong is his appeal for readers who crave adventure. Also like
Melville and London, Conrad is concerned with moral dilemmas. His
protagonists almost invariably are men being tested _ by God and
conscience _ in circumstances of great peril.
</P>
<P>
   And still I'm faking it, having not read nearly enough of Joseph
Conrad. In those sedentary years ahead, I hope to read ``Almayer's
Folly'' and its sequel, ``An Outcast of the Islands.'' And ``The
Secret Agent.'' And ``The Shadow Line.'' And ``The Rescue'' ...

WOMEN AT WORK: HERE'S A WAY TO TAKE THAT CLASS AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps you've always wanted to learn more about investing or
launching a business. Maybe you've wanted to meet other women in
management but never thought you had time because of work, family
and other responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that class you've been postponing is only a phone call
away. In May, Elyse Killoran launched Women's University. Also
known as Women's U., it is thought to be the first virtual
educational community exclusively for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm creating a sandbox where other people come to
play,'' said Killoran, a Long Island mother and former teacher.
`It's one way to move beyond where we are and do it in a supportive
community.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of colleges are offering on-line classes.
Women's U. is different in that its courses are not for credit or
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, someone signs up for a course, most of which are one to
four sessions and cost under $45. Participants join the class by
dialing a phone number at a designated time to connect with the
teleclass leader and classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way for women to bring other women into their
homes,'' Killoran said. ``Not only is it extremely convenient,
there's a real ability to talk because you are not distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Reynolds, an instructor from Phoenix who does corporate
training, said people often sign up for courses at work but don't
attend because they can't take time from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Women's U. they can do it...on their own phone, even if
they travel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially concerned about the Women's U. format but
found that people were more willing to open up and take risks
because they were talking with people they didn't know well.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope the courses will not only be informative but
will give women the opportunity in our fast-paced, technologically
driven world to connect with other women. In a sense, they want it
to become the coffee klatsch of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to tap into women's desire to connect, but
it will keep it convenient by tapping into the telephone,'' said
Carol Gerrish, one of the instructors, who has her own consulting
business. ``It is lonely and exhausting to be one of the few women
in the corporate boardroom, and it is lonely and exhausting to be
one of many women in front of the computer terminals. Working women
are looking for balance. They are looking for reward that goes
beyond the monetary.''

COMBINING PASSIONS, SOMMELIER USES WINE LABELS TO DEPICT OPERA
SCENES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wine has always been the first love of Valentino Monticello, a
sommelier at Harry's Bar in London for 18 years. But art and music
follow soon after, and Monticello has found a way to combine these
passions. Using wine labels, he makes collages that depict opera
scenes involving wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In opera,'' he said, ``you have many, many songs about people
drinking wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing labels from the region or country in which the scene
takes place, he cuts the labels to form figures, props and scenery.
For instance, in a scene from La Boheme, a woman's skirt is made
from a 1970 Petrus label, the stage curtains from Veuve Clicquot.
</P>
<P>
   Each collage takes Monticello several months to complete and
incorporates as many as 800 labels. There is no drawing; every last
detail is cut from labels.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, I bought a lot of wine because of the
label,'' said Monticello, 65. ``But now, because many producers
know what I'm doing, they send me labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Monticello, who has no formal art education, plans to make
collages for many of the winemaking regions or countries in the
world. He has chosen 64, and said he is almost halfway through. He
expects to complete the project in two years.
</P>
<P>
   He does not sell or display his work, which has received some
notice in European magazines. He stores them all at his home in
London, saving them to be photographed and, he hopes, to be
published as a collection when he is finished.

 COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star

<P>
   The card came in the mail, giving a telephone number I should
call immediately for important information about my car. The make
and year of the vehicle were printed on the card.
</P>
<P>
   It had an official look, so I laid it aside _ but then promptly
forgot it altogether.
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, the second card came.
</P>
<P>
   ``REMINDER,'' it said in large type. ``Please call at your
earliest convenience...Have this card and your manufacturer's
warranty booklet in hand when calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, there was a problem. Perhaps the automaker had
discovered a defect that would cause the machine to self-destruct
at a speed over 45 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   I rang the number on the card, and a woman answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you today Mister Goose... Goose...?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind,'' I told her. ``What are you selling?''
</P>
<P>
   When they start out by asking how you are, you know there's a
pitch coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to talk with you about our extended warranty plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have a warranty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh.'' She sounded crushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where did you get my name?'' I asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``From your state motor vehicle bureau. We bought it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's crazy,'' I said. ``I can't believe my own state is
selling me.''
</P>
<P>
   I hung up, then, and telephoned the license bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not true,'' said the woman there. ``Absolutely not!
Nobody can get your name without a special code. It would cost them
thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   So I called the first people back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The motor vehicle bureau says you're nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let you talk to my supervisor.''
</P>
<P>
   The supervisor came on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state says they didn't sell me,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they did. All but eight or 10 states do it. We're
entitled to your name under the Freedom of Information Act.''
</P>
<P>
   I called the state capital for the motor vehicle bureau again,
and this time I got someone who actually knew something.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wrong about the Freedom of Information Act,'' she said.
``It's the state Sunshine Law. The records are public.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if some direct mail or phone marketing outfit
comes around wanting the dope on you, it's illegal for the state to
say no.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more,'' said the lady, ``we can't keep them from
/{reselling/} you. And we know some of them do. The only way to
prevent it is when you buy or renew your plates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do I do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells on the license form.''
</P>
<P>
   I dug my pink copy of the renewal application out of an
envelope. And sure enough, there were the instructions on the back
of the application. Not very prominently displayed, mind you, but
they were there.
</P>
<P>
   Release of your motor vehicle records for commercial use can be
restricted, the instructions said, by completing form DOR-4673.
</P>
<P>
   Provided you happened to notice that paragraph in small type.
</P>
<P>
   And just by chance have a DOR-4673 lying around handy.
</P>
<P>
   Or know offhand where to get one.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you may as well be advised that the state
legislature, in its infinite wisdom, has written a law that allows
you, me _ everyone _ to be bought, sold or traded like pork bellies
or any other commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that government for you, working night and day on behalf
of us all?

`JUNK FOOD': SEAMY LOWLIFE IN ORDERLY TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (JT)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just true of New York, Los Angeles or Miami. Every
naked city has a million squalid stories hatching under its smog.
``Junk Food,'' Masashi Yamamoto's collage of urban vignettes
unfolding simultaneously over a single day insists that even nice,
orderly Tokyo has a fetidly seamy lowlife.
</P>
<P>
   This icy little movie has the exploitative feel of a
can-you-top-this sampler of urban maladies, all viewed with an
unnerving detachment. Some of its scenes are little more than
snapshots of dramas whose backgrounds and details remain
unexplained. Others are fuller portraits of people in serious
trouble who lash out with a lethal fury that seems totally out of
proportion to what sets them off.
</P>
<P>
   The film's attitude of studied nonchalance is established in the
opening scene (shot in video), in which a blind elderly woman (the
director's mother, Shizuko Yamamoto) is awakened by a clock radio
and methodically begins her day with a Buddhist prayer, then slowly
ambles to a convenience store to shop for groceries. Little does
she know of the sordidness surrounding her.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the movie switches from video to film, and we've
entered the desperate world of Miyuki (Miyuki Ijima), a heroin
addict and possible prostitute waking up with a male companion (who
may or may not be a client) whom she cajoles into letting her tie
him up. Once he is tethered, she strangles him to death with a
cord, then flees the murder scene. Who he is and why she kills him
are questions that are never addressed.
</P>
<P>
   For much the rest of her part of the film, Miyuki, who turns out
to be married with a day job in an office, frantically scours the
city for drugs, getting into one humiliating scrape after another.
In the movie's ugliest scene, she is viciously beaten by a paranoid
drug dealer who then takes pity on her, injects her with heroin,
and makes love to her.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that distinguishes ``Junk Food'' from other
contemplations of urban sleaze is the absolute out-of-the-blue
savagery exhibited by its characters and the way sex often triggers
the violence. The most coldblooded among the movie's nasty people
is a shady Pakistani businessman named Cawl (Ali Ahmed), who slits
the throat of his Japanese girlfriend when she contemptuously
refuses to marry him, then meets with the Pakistani friend who
helped subsidize whatever business he's in and shoots him in an
argument over money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk Food'' contrives some pungently seedy settings for its
characters to writhe around in. The rooms in which Miyuki arranges
her date's unexpected rendezvous with death suggests a dripping
subterranean plumbing facility with a bed plunked in the middle.
The movie tries so aggressively to evoke urban seediness that it
ends up feeling surreal. ``Junk Food'' is not a film to be trusted.

 Seaboard aims at hogging pork market  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICH PALMER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seaboard opened its plant in December 1995. The plant reached
double-shift capacity in mid-1997, just in time to see its
increased capacity feed into a mountain of domestic meat hitting
the market. At the same time, Asian economies were spinning out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an 8 percent increase in slaughter last year,'' said
Steve Meyer, director of economics for the National Pork Producers
Council. ``That is a huge increase in pork production.''
</P>
<P>
   Pork producers such as Seaboard were encouraged to expand, Meyer
said, because wholesale prices were up in 1996 and 1997, grain
prices were down and retail pork prices were at record levels. Pork
sales of $13.2 billion last year at the farm level were a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion was coming from a lot of places, not just from
Seaboard,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with the plant hitting full capacity, Seaboard's
income from pork reached $54.3 million, up $51.2 million from 1996.
This year will be more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   According to Seaboard's financial report for the quarter that
ended March 31, its pork sales increased by $16.8 million in the
first quarter compared with the first quarter of 1997, reaching
$121.7 million. But increased sales did not translate into greater
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gross income'' for the pork operations was $1.5 million, a $9
million free fall from $10.5 million it reported in the same
quarter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman declined to comment beyond the company's financial
statement.
</P>
<P>
   McGlone, at Texas Tech, is impressed with how quickly Seaboard
has grown but is unimpressed with its skill of operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are known to have some production challenges, to be
kind,'' McGlone said. ``You probably have to chalk that up to
growing too fast. They have had more environmental challenges than
others in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaboard settled a complaint in Oklahoma in February by agreeing
to pay an $88,200 fine and improve its disposal of dead hogs. The
Oklahoma Department of Agriculture had proposed a $102,000 fine
after inspections at 44 Seaboard hog farms in November found dead
hogs on the ground or spilling out of trash bins.
</P>
<P>
   A release from the company and the state said, ``While Seaboard
Farms believes the fine is disproportionate with the alleged
violations and that there was no threat to the environment or
public health, it elected to resolve the matter so it could
continue building a positive working relationship with the
Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is loath to talk about the fine. The state and the
company agreed the release would be all that would be said. He
explained that the company's written plan always had been to take
dead hogs to a rendering plant within 24 hours of dumping them.
Sometimes the rendering plant is down or a truck is out of
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals die,'' Hoffman said. ``We have 30,000 animals die a
month. A system of 24-hour delivery to a rendering plant is unheard
of in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The publicity from the complaint provided political momentum for
those who wanted Oklahoma to tighten controls on corporate hog
farms. The state last month passed new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Seaboard's plan to expand in Kansas also resulted in the Kansas
Legislature writing into law regulations specifically governing hog
farms. The meat of the law contains environmental regulations, such
as required distances between pig farms, homes and wildlife
refuges.
</P>
<P>
   It also requires the state departments of Agriculture and Health
and Environment to create plans for things such as odor control,
dead animal disposal and waste disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said Seaboard could live with the new regulations. While
there has been opposition to its plans for its new plant, there has
been support from people who realize the company is bringing new
vitality to the areas it invests in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This growth has been unprecedented by our company, but we have
done well,'' Hoffman said. ``Our company recognized this was an
area attractive for animal processing. We have taken a bold step
away from what this market has done before. We think the future for
pork is great.''

BUT DO YOU RECALL DONDER OR DONNER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Is the correct name of Santa's reindeer Donner or Donder?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.K., Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Donder, according to Clement C. Moore's 1823 poem, ``A
Visit From St. Nicholas.'' Moore introduced the idea that Santa had
eight named reindeer pulling his sleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some linguistic sense to opting for Donner over
Donder,'' Barbara and David P. Mikkelson write on the World Wide
Web urban legend site www.snopes.com. ``Blitzen'' and ``donner''
are German words meaning thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Donner comes from the songwriter who added
Rudolph to the reindeer team. The 1949 song ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed
Reindeer'' by Johnny Marks and Gene Autry changed Donder's name.
The name Donner was popularized after millions of copies of the
song were sold.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the Dead Milkmen?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.A., Elmwood Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: The band amicably split up in 1994 after 11 years, pledging
to reunite only ``for funerals and rare TV appearances,'' according
to the ``Dead Milkmen Newzletter''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touring for 10 years was beginning to wear a bit thin on us,''
band member Dean Clean wrote on the group's official Web site,
which he maintains. ``You try doing two laps around the country
every year in a small van with six people and all your gear!''
</P>
<P>
   To contact the group, write to the Dead Milkmen, Box 58152,
Philadelphia, PA 19102-8152, or visit the Web site
www.deadmilkmen.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Frank Sinatra's first wife, Nancy, ever remarry?
</P>
<P>
   _ S.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Nancy Sinatra, 81, has not remarried.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1951 divorce from Frank stipulated that until she did
remarry, she would receive one-third of the singer's gross income
up to $150,000, and 10 percent of the gross above that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinatras had three children during their 12-year marriage:
Nancy in 1940, Frank Jr. in 1944, and Tina in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Frank Sinatra had his marriage to Nancy annulled before
marrying his fourth wife, Barbara Marx.

NEWCOMER PAT GREEN HARKS BACK TO WAYLON, WILLIE AND THE BOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Pat Green isn't in any hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Not to become a big-deal country singer like his heroes Jerry
Jeff Walker, Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   Not to move from Waco, where he grew up, to Austin or some other
Lone Star music hub.
</P>
<P>
   Not even to finish lunch at George's, Waco's long-standing
home-cooking mecca where, on a recent weekday, he sat in a booth
and talked leisurely about his career, which so far has included
two CDs and a growing rep as a young country singer to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like congestion,'' says Green, a 26-year-old San
Antonio native who has become a solid draw in clubs from Texas A&AMP;M
University to Texas Tech University to Texas Christian University.
``I'm small-town, no doubt about it. You can go to Austin and hit
traffic at 9 p.m. on a Sunday night. I don't need that.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's easygoing manner is borne out by his music, hard country
that bears much resemblance to the ``outlaw'' movement wherein
Nelson, Walker and Waylon Jennings found their greatest success.
Green sings about his craft, about his love of good friends and
small towns, in music that is heavy on fiddle, mandolin and pedal
steel guitars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like positive songs,'' he says. ``The song's the important
thing _ not who's good-lookin' or has a full-size cutout of them
with a Miller Lite in their hand in the record store. I'd like to
see a re-emergence of the Willie and Waylon days, when everything
coming off the radio didn't sound the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all of the Texas country heroes of the '70s, Green sounds
most like Walker _ which is understandable because it was Walker's
classic 1973 ``Viva Terlingua!'' album that made him want to play
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Green first heard Walker in high school; he loved the earthy
quality of the music and the songs, and he was hooked. By the time
he left Waco to attend Texas Tech in the fall of 1990, he had a
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only goal I ever had that came to fruition was that I told
myself I would learn to play guitar when I went to college _ and I
did,'' he says. ``I annoyed the hell out of my roommates. I never
had one lesson. I bought a James
</P>
<P>
   Taylor songbook and learned _ his chords force your hands to do
things they're not used to doing, and I loved his finger-picking.''
</P>
<P>
   That led to Wednesday-night get-togethers, which led to playing
a campus club, Dash Riprock's, and writing songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written one song, `Family Man,' and then it was a
flood,'' he says. ``I was writing every day. I had 21 years of
experience I wanted to capture.''
</P>
<P>
   By April 1994, Green had formed a band that played a lot of
Walker, Haggard and Robert Earl Keen _ and was hitting the clubs.
Hearing all the instruments, he says, made it easier to write
songs.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1995, he released his first CD, ``Dancehall Dreamer,''
and was becoming a serious draw. The same young country fans who
liked Keen, Jack Ingram and Charlie Robison liked him, and he found
himself opening for Nelson and Chris LeDoux, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People indoctrinate their families to this music,'' he says.
``Their dad loved Willie 20 years ago and now they love him, too.
We all have our own styles _ our own experiences and way of telling
a story _ but I don't think Texas guys get as wrapped up in stardom
as Nashville people. We don't go hide on our bus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George's Bar'' was recorded in April 1996, a month after Green
moved back home to Waco. These days, after years spent as a
bartender or waiter, he's performing full time; this August, he
will have his first headlining show at Billy Bob's Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he'll release his third CD, a live recording
drawn from shows this spring in College Station and Gruene. The CD
features older songs and three new ones, including a cover of Joe
Ely's ``Me &AMP; Billy the Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   And from there, he says, there are plans for more shows, more
songs and plenty of time to relax and enjoy life. Green never
figured he would become a big deal _ which he may, and soon _
because he really doesn't see himself as a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get past all the `Hey, this guy's a star' stuff, it
boils down to, `We're regular people,' '' he says. ``I go to the
Gap and buy my blue jeans and put 'em on one leg at a time like
anybody else. What I do isn't any more amazing than the guy that
works at the grocery store. We're just folks.''

   It's the Official Late Show With David Letterman Web site
(www.cbs.com), created by Worldwide Pants and CBS News Media, and
packed with late-night comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release announcing the launch of his site, Letterman

RACE FOR JUSTICE: IS `HATE CRIMES' LAW HEADED DOWN WRONG ROAD?

<P>
   Ever since the body of James Byrd was found, last week, in
pieces on a road in east Texas, the authorities have been
struggling to bring charges to reflect the horror of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder'' seems too pat: Byrd was chained to a truck and
dragged for almost three miles. Besides, in Texas (even in Texas),
simple murder does not carry the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd was black, apparently murdered by racists; so there is
a call for this killing to be labelled a ``hate crime,'' for which
the punishment is death by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law recognizes a hate crime, and beefs up the penalty
accordingly, whenever a victim seems to be picked on because of his
race, color, religion or national origin.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few prosecutions of this sort: in 1996, 27
offenders received ``enhanced'' sentences. But politicians from
both parties, as well as President Clinton, would like to see the
law extended to cover sexual orientation, gender and disability.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the notion of stiffening punishment when
discrimination is involved may seem fair enough. Hatred can be
infectious: if one man is seen to beat up a black, another may copy
him.
</P>
<P>
   And to kill a man for something he cannot help, such as his
race, seems much worse a motive than to kill him because he is
rich, or successful, or owes you money.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all that, the notion of ``hate crimes'' is flawed, and
not only in terms of justice. Rather than helping _ as the shaken
folk of Jasper, Texas, clearly suppose _ to heal America's racial
and other divisions, it may instead perpetuate them.
</P>
<P>
   To grasp the difficulty with hate crimes, suppose that Byrd was
white. Suppose he was killed by three drunken white youths who, to
while away an evening, thought they would indulge in a little
aimless violence. Such things happen. Would that killing have been
less awful? Of course not; yet hate-crime law says that it would
have been.
</P>
<P>
   The ghastly violence of the act is not seen as the nub of the
problem (and the nub, indeed, of America's problem). Instead, race
is.
</P>
<P>
   Once race _ or religion, or gender _ is introduced into the
equation, this naturally colors the motive for the crime in the
eyes of the criminal-justice system. Yet crimes may have several
motives, or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   A robbery of a white by a black, for example, may be purely for
money. Who is to judge whether race-hate was there and, if so, how
much there was?
</P>
<P>
   The issue should not be avoided; but neither should it be given
the importance the law now attaches to it.
</P>
<P>
   This is so even when the hatred seems explicit, as it does in
the Byrd case. The men who have been charged with the killing were
known white supremacists, who left Nazi paraphernalia at the scene.
Yet it is not a crime to hold such opinions, loathsome as they are.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of ``hate crime'' may be, in effect, an extra penalty
imposed on people whose views are offensive, as well as their
actions. Ironically, it makes the justice system pick on them
simply because they are different.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks may well protest that they, in particular, need extra
sympathy from the law. There is a widespread belief that blacks are
not treated fairly by the police or by judges; that they are more
readily arrested for drug offenses, more often given the death
penalty for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies support this view. But even if bias exists in the
system, the remedy cannot be to introduce racial weighting _ or,
indeed, weighting of any sort _ into the concept of justice for
all. &QL;

VIERI LEADS ITALY OVER AUSTRIA AND INTO SECOND ROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SOC-WORLDCUP-CHILE-1STLD) 
(JT) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. DENIS, France _ Teams score goals, players don't score
goals. This was the message Christian Vieri was putting out this
week as all of Italy debated its next starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri, a bruising forward who plays for Atletico Madrid, comes
out of the first round with four goals, including the first one
Tuesday, as Italy held off Austria, 2-1, to advance to the second
round of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Baggio came off the bench late to tap in a goal and
Andreas Herzog scored a penalty kick in injury time to give Austria
a brief hope.
</P>
<P>
   By finishing first in its group, Italy will play the
second-place team from Group A in Marseille on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian team is so deep that debates about the lineup are
inevitable. Tuesday, the Italian coach, Cesare Maldini, was able to
use the lineup he had originally wanted, a tandem between
Alessandro Del Piero, the nimble forward from Juventus of Turin,
and Vieri, who formerly played for Juventus before opting for
Spanish pesetas last season.
</P>
<P>
   DelPiero has been recuperating from a thigh injury, and was not
able to start until Tuesday. Because he and Baggio are considered
to be the same type of player, there was no room for the creative
Baggio in the starting lineup Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri now has 4 goals, tying him with Gabriel Batistuta of
Argentina. Italy is rolling _ but at a cost. Three minutes into the
game, Italy lost its strong young defender, Alessandro Nesta, to a
twisted right knee when he was fouled by Heimo Pfeifenberger. Nesta
is expected to be out for the remainder of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   When Nesta was removed, off the bench came ancient Giuseppe
Bergomi, 34 years old, known in Italy as Zio Beppe, or Uncle Joey.
Bergomi was on the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cup teams but was
dropped in 1994 and continued to play a quiet defensive position
for Inter of Milan. He was called back to the squad after a
seven-year hitch, as Cesare Maldini preferred to have a mature
player holding up the end of the bench. Tuesday Bergomi swept the
area in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Del Piero and Vieri tried to recreate the teamwork
they had enjoyed on the Italian Under-21 team (then coached by
Maldini) and also at Juvenus.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alessandro, I have good rapport, good intensity,'' Vieri
had said. ``I have never worked with Roberto before, but I regard
them as two champions. For me, it changes nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero and Vieri worked intricate little passes in open
space, but they could not produce a goal in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes into the second half, Del Piero took a free kick
from the left side, 18 yards out. The ball hooked, and Vieri
elevated himself above Tony Polster of Austria and headed the ball
into the corner. Having given Italy the lead, Vieri was taken out
for Filippo Inzaghi in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians were then saved twice by their goalkeeper, Gianluca
Pagliuca. In the 65th minute, Arnold Wetl fired from a melee in
front of the goal and Pagliuca tipped the ball with the thick
fingers of his right glove, sending the ball spinning into the air
before he hauled it to his chest. Six minutes later, Mario Haas
blasted a shot that Pagliuca snagged with one hand.
</P>
<P>
   At 72 minutes, with Del Piero winding down, the coach used
Baggio as his third and final sub, a puzzling move considering that
Baggio is often removed late in the game when his team has a lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maldini's confidence was rewarded when the new tandem of Baggio
and Inzaghi set up several fast breaks. In the 89th minute, Inzaghi
sent a crossing pass that Baggio converted, and then Baggio offered
his slender back for a celebratory ride.
</P>
<P>
   Austria scored, the third time it had scored in injury time in
this World, but Italy held on to avoid Brazil, which finished first
in its group. Or, as the captain, Paolo Maldini, put it: ``I think
Brazil is happy, too.''

   NEW YORK _ The hungry hordes that spill onto Wall Street at
lunch time have a new option. Mangia's fourth cafe in Manhattan has
just opened at 40 Wall St. Hot sandwiches, like soft-shell crab,
and entree salads topped with beef or seafood have been added to
Mangia's bright Mediterranean-accented menu.
</P>
<P>
   In about a month, beyond the cafe area's booths and tables, the
rest of the space will open, with Mangia's popular antipasto buffet
expanded to include more than 75 items. There will also be hot food
and pizzas, all in a setting of inlaid marble floors, polished wood
and even a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacker's Boon
</P>
<P>
   Planning a hiking or camping trip this summer? Reynolds Metals,
which makes Reynolds Wrap, has introduced Hot Bags, heavy-duty foil
cooking pouches that can be filled with food and go directly on a
grill. Though they are mainly for backyard grills and oven use,
they are convenient for backpackers. Fish, chicken, corn and spare
ribs can be cooked in them, but without much liquid, as they are
not leakproof. A package of three is around $3.25.

   Fiji Islands in a Bottle
</P>
<P>
   With all the bottled waters on supermarket and deli shelves, why
would anyone bother selling water transported all the way from the
Fiji Islands in the South Pacific?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the taste. Fiji Natural Artesian Water, a newcomer
in a decorative square plastic bottle, is a soft, delicious,
smooth-tasting water that comes from a tropical aquifer fed by
rainfall on the main island of Viti Levu. It makes excellent coffee
and tea.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the long voyage, a 1.5-liter bottle costs about the same
as other imported waters, less than $2 in supermarkets.

<P>
   The new edition of ``Wine Country Passport,'' a booklet-size
guide to New York state wineries, has just been published, and it's
bigger than ever, with 125 wineries listed by region, along with
hours, events, maps, an explanation of types of grapes and tips on
wine storage and wine appreciation for beginners. It is $1 from

including well-made baked goods like small quiches, rustic apple
tarts, buttery fruit tarts and pain au chocolat stuffed with
Valrhona chocolate. The breads and tender doughnuts have a homemade

who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or

scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

CALIFORNIA TRIES TO TAME AN ITALIAN GRAPE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   European winemakers like to say that grape vines must suffer to
make good wine. Which may explain why, in northern Italy, the best
sangiovese grapes are the result of a protracted struggle between
the vines and the hardscrabble Tuscan hills.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted to the lushness of California, the same vines burst
forth like prisoners suddenly released from the meanest of jails,
growing in an unwanted profusion of fruit and leaves. Well-tended
cabernet vines may produce two tons of grapes an acre in
California; uninhibited sangiovese can push out 12 tons or more.
Sadly, the wine pressed from these ebullient vines is usually poor
stuff _thin, watery and acidic.
</P>
<P>
   This has not stopped California's incurably optimistic vintners.
``We tame the vines,'' Glen Salva of Atlas Peak Vineyards, in the
Napa Valley, said the other day. ``We cut them back 40, 50, even 60
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   As winemakers and grape growers have come to understand the
grape, the market for sangiovese has begun to grow. As late as the
1970's, there were not even a dozen California sangioveses on the
market. Today there are more than 50, as well as a hundred or more
growers who find wineries eager to buy their sangiovese grapes.
Ferrari-Carano, Mondavi, Flora Springs, Coturri, Silverado,
Lockwood, Renwood, Swanson, Shafer, Staglin, Sterling, Atlas Peak
and Altamura are some better-known California wineries producing
sangiovese. Leonetti Cellars in Washington State also makes it.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, California sangioveses resemble other
California wines more than they do Italian wines made from the same
grape. They are fuller-bodied, softer and richer, yet keep the
distinctive sangiovese taste. The best are truly attractive wines.
They are just very different in style. Perhaps easygoing is a way
to describe them.
</P>
<P>
   To an Italian winemaker, the name sangiovese is not enough to
identify a wine. Which sangiovese, he wants to know. The grape
reaches its apogee in Tuscany, where it plays a starring role in
Chianti; in Montalcino, where it's called brunello, and in nearby
Montepulciano, where, as either sangiovese or prugnolo, it produces
Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Sangiovese's different names are more
than marketing ploys. They signify different clones of the grape,
clones that can produce very different wines. One variant,
sangioveto, is hailed by some winemakers as being far superior to
sangiovese itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sangiovese is hardly limited to Tuscany. Around Bologna, it is
known as sangionvese di Romagna; in Umbria, it shows up in the wine
known as Torgiano; in Emilia-Romagna and on the plains south of
Rome, it produces millions of gallons of nondescript wine for quick
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, at a conference on sangiovese at San Felice,
near Siena, I watched Tuscan winemakers sample California versions
of their wine. Their praise was guarded. They didn't know what to
make of the Californian approach.
</P>
<P>
   Italians and Californians may not agree on style but they do
share one thing: a fondness for blending sangiovese with cabernet
sauvignon and, on occasion, merlot. Chianti has always been a
blend: about 80 percent sangiovese, plus canaiolo, a red grape, and
trebbiano, a white. About 20 years ago, some producers began to
blend in cabernet sauvignon, even when the authorities refused to
allow the resulting wine to be called Chianti. Some winemakers went
overboard, making all-cabernet wines and predicting that
traditional varieties like sangiovese were obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Tuscany continues to produce excellent cabernet and merlot but
the Tuscans also have been rediscovering their traditional
varieties, sometimes producing superb single-grape wines from
sangiovese or sangioveto, sometimes enhancing them with cabernet.
Antinori's Tignanello is a blend of mostly sangiovese with some
cabernet sauvignon. Badia a Coltibuono's Sangioveto de Coltibuono
is, as the name implies, made entirely from the sangioveto grape.
</P>
<P>
   California winemakers operate in much the same way. Some produce
single-grape wines. Others blend because even after severe crop
thinning, sangiovese can produce a light wine and the cabernet can
give it more body and color. Staglin Vineyards' elegant Stagliano,
which is 100 percent sangiovese, can match the best of the Tuscans.
So can Shafer Vineyards Firebreak, a sangiovese-cabernet sauvignon
blend.
</P>
<P>
   Chianti remains one of the best wine buys, with many Chianti
classicos at $20 or less. Ruffino's Chianti Classico Aziano 1996 is
about $9; Castellare di Castellina's Chianti Classico, $13.
California sangioveses generally cost 30 percent more than their
Italian counterparts. Three reasonably priced examples, by
California standards, are Swanson Winery's 1995 at about $24,
Silverado Vineyards 1995, $20, and Flora Springs 1996, $16.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to assume that California sangioveses will
continue to improve. But except for the few mentioned here, most
are indifferent wines when compared with other California and
Tuscan red wines. Unless you are a California fanatic, there is no
reason to drink so-so sangioveses when there are dozens of
excellent little Chiantis out there for less than $10.

CHILE ADVANCES TO SECOND ROUND AFTER 1-1 DRAW WITH CAMEROON  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating; adds information in 2nd graf about suspended Chilean
players)   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ When Chile had survived a contentious 1-1 draw
with Cameroon Tuesday and advanced to the second round of the World
Cup, its players removed their jerseys and tossed them into the
crowd, shedding their shirts and 36 years of frustration and
humiliation in soccer's world championship.
</P>
<P>
   After a frustrating wait of nearly four decades, however,
Chile's promotion may be a meager reward. Its next opponent, on
Saturday, happens to be Brazil, the defending champion and the same
team that eliminated Chile when it last advanced in the World Cup
in 1962. In addition, Chile will play without three starters _
Francisco Rojas, Moises Villarroel and Nelson Parraguez _ who
accumulated two yellow cards during the first round.

   One Sunday morning the pastor noticed little Johnny was standing
staring up at the large plaque that hung in the foyer of the
church. The young man of seven had been staring at the plaque for
some time, so the pastor walked up and stood beside him and gazing
up at the plaque he said quietly, `Good morning son.`
</P>
<P>
   `Good morning pastor` replied the young man not taking his eyes
off the plaque. `Sir, what is this?` Johnny asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Well son, these are all the people who have died in the
service`, replied the pastor. Soberly, they stood together staring
up at the large plaque. Little Johnny's voice barely broke the
silence when he asked quietly, `Which one sir, the 8:30 or the
10:30?`

 &HT;    Flavor-infusing water smoker is one hot item
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the 77 million Americans who own a grill, not everyone just
puts on a funny hat and burns hot dogs over an open flame. A full
10 percent of grill owners _ nearly 8 million people _ have decided
to invest in a second piece of outdoor cooking equipment: a water
smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, smoke cooking is catching on like never
before. ``Smoking is definitely a trend,'' says Donna Myers, a
spokeswoman for the Barbecue Industry Association. ``Sales of wood
chips and chunks have far more than doubled in a 10-year period.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that all this wood is going into smokers. Backyard chefs
throw wood into charcoal grills to give extra flavor to steaks and
chops. They also risk setting off alarms by smoking foods in
covered pots on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   But water smokers are a hot-ticket item around the country, with
annual sales of 2 million units. Water smokers look like a covered
canister, with a heat source (either charcoal or electric) in the
bottom, a water pan in the middle and a rack or two for cooking
meats on the top. You place the wood chunks near the heat source,
and the smoke filters up, mingling with the steam that cooks the
meat. Unlike dry smokers, where the wood burns in a separate
tinderbox, water smokers are relatively small and inexpensive.
``Somebody who has never smoked can go out and get a water smoker
from $40,'' says Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jamison, author with wife Cheryl Alters Jamison of ``Born
to Grill'' (Harvard Common Press, $27.95), recommends getting an
entry-level electric model. ``They cost a little over $50, but are
better and cheaper in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bishop, writing up a comparative testing of water smokers
in the food magazine ``Cook's Illustrated,'' came to the same
conclusion; the variations of charcoal heat make for longer cooking
times, and there's more chance the fire will burn out if you forget
to add charcoal or burn the food if it gets too hot.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop tested several makes and models and gave his top score to
the Meco Water Smoker 5030 XElectric Combo, a fairly inexpensive
($80) model with a door for adding more wood during cooking and an
adjustable heat gauge.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, bought the first electric smoker I laid
eyes on: the Brinkmann Gourmet Electric Water Smoker, which cost
$59.85 at Home Depot. (By the way, a source at Home Depot's
corporate office said that sales of water smokers in Atlanta remain
good but are not higher than in recent years. In the South, we've
apparently reached smoke saturation.)
</P>
<P>
   I love my new smoker. The first batches of both pork shoulder
and baby back ribs were successful. The rack of ribs _ seasoned
with a basic spice rub and painted with a sweet bottled barbecue
sauce _ disappeared in a family feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   I've been playing around with the water smoker enough to offer
some tips, techniques and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   -- The wood: Use chunks of aged hardwood (hickory and mesquite
are the most common packaged varieties), soaked for at least 20
minutes in water. Place four fist-size chunks near the heating
element. Some people recommend replenishing the wood partway
through, but I thought one dose added all the smoke flavor I
wanted. Also, some sources say you can wrap the dry wood chunks in
foil with holes poked in it instead of soaking it. That sure didn't
work for me.
</P>
<P>
   -- The water pan: The manufacturer claims that the water pan
should be replenished every two or three hours. I found that the
water easily lasts six hours, so you can cook ribs or a pork picnic
shoulder without any sloshy fuss.
</P>
<P>
   -- The rub: Stick to a good, basic rub. Just for the heck of it,
I tried cooking ribs seasoned with every kind of spice mixture,
from Moroccan ras-el-hanout to Indian tandoori masala, and I can
tell you there's a reason beyond religious injunction that Indians
don't make tandoori pork: It tastes awful.
</P>
<P>
   -- The sauce: A good homemade barbecue sauce in the fridge is
all the incentive you need to fire up the smoker. But bottled
sauces are easy enough to doctor up. Just be wary of ``hickory''
flavored sauces, which usually have a nasty bite from liquid smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Most bottled sauces contain a hefty component of high-fructose
corn syrup, which is not necessarily a bad thing, according to
Atlanta food scientist Shirley O. Corriher, author of ``Cookwise''
(Morrow, $28.50). Corn syrup is what she calls a ``reducing sugar''
that helps meat brown more delectably at a lower temperature. She
recommends adding a shot of Karo syrup to your favorite homemade
barbecue sauce recipe. She also suggests adding a whole, finely
cut-up lemon to sauce as it's cooking. Any scientific reason? ``No,
it just tastes good. And my momma made her barbecue sauce like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Time and temperature: If you can adjust the temperature of
your smoker, you should barbecue pork at 225-250 degrees. At that
temperature, ribs take four to five hours and a pork picnic
shoulder takes six to seven. If the cooker runs hotter, you can
still make good barbecue. Pork is ready when it reaches an internal
temperature of 160 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   -- Water-smoking a pork shoulder: A whole pork shoulder,
weighing 18-22 pounds, is the cut that championship barbecue teams
prepare during contests. For the home market, the shoulder is cut
into two pieces: The piece around the shoulder blade is called the
``Boston butt''; the shank end is called the ``picnic shoulder.''
The butt is fattier, and therefore juicier, while the picnic is
more attractive and easier to cut. I'd go with the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the layer of skin and fat, except for the portion around
the shank, and coat the meat liberally with a rub or spice paste.
If you want the meat tender enough to pull, that requres some work.
Jay Duke of the Grillmasters, a championship pork barbecue team
from Americus, says you need to tend to it every hour during the
smoking. ``We recommend mopping it or basting it with lemon juice
or salt water to add the flavor to the meat. Every time you open
the grill to look and see how things are going, you always want to
add something to the meat to keep it from drying out. We also take
a sterile cloth and lay it on the meat.'' The sign of good pork
shoulder, says Duke, is the ``bark'' of seasoning and browned meat
that forms on the surface. The ``smoke ring'' is the layer of meat
under the bark that turns pink from smoke penetration.
</P>
<P>
   If that's too much work, simply let the meat smoke until the
internal temperature registers about 165 degrees. Let it rest for a
few minutes at room temperature when it comes out of the smoker,
then slice it thinly against the grain. Remember, the easiest way
to break down tough meat fibers is to slice through them properly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Water-smoking pork ribs: Whether you're cooking baby back
ribs or spareribs, you need to remove the membrane along the back
by loosening it with a knife, then pulling it off with your
fingers. Also, trim off any excess fat or filaments. Cut the ribs
into half racks. Sprinkle the convex surface of the ribs liberally
with rub, but contrary to the name, don't rub it in.
</P>
<P>
   Place the ribs on the smoker racks and smoke for about 3 hours,
until the meat begins to pull away from the bones. Remove the ribs
and place them on individual pieces of foil, and sprinkle a mild
vinegar (cider or Japanese rice wine) over the top. Wrap them fully
and return to the smoker to finish cooking, about another 1 1/2
hours. At the end unwrap them and paint them with sauce. You can
either serve them immediately or return them to the smoker for a
few minutes to encourage the sauce to crust.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Caring friends at hospital fix the highway to my heart
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So one night, lacking anything more exciting to do, I had a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   And then, asked the cardiologist, what did you do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Finished reading `Angela's Ashes,''' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a miserable book,'' said the cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
   So we talked about that and other books for a while, and he
explained that he was going to run a wire up an artery to my heart
and find out what was what. Easy, painless and I could go back to
work in four hours, unless ... unless something was blocking the
blood to my heart, and it turned out something was.
</P>
<P>
   A covey of young people, nurses and technicians, were making me
welcome, enveloping me in a warm blanket, giving me coffee, my
first of the day, and making little jokes about why they couldn't
find a vein in my arm that would do for drawing blood. (Finally a
young man named Greg did find one, and we cheered and called him
Dr. Vein.)
</P>
<P>
   The day wore on, and I was having a pleasant time in the J.B.
Fuqua Heart Center at Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta, reminiscing a
little about the days when Mr. Fuqua served in the Georgia
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Come midafternoon, they stuck a balloon in that highway to the
heart to nudge the roadblock aside, and the operation was over. The
artery they used runs from a thigh, and that leg got awfully tired
of being immobilized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm tired,'' I explained to a nurse. ``My back hurts.
I've got to move.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You move that leg,'' said a fierce little woman, ``you'll
bleed to death, and I'll get fired!''
</P>
<P>
   I lay still and brooded over which would be worse.
</P>
<P>
   She and her colleague pounded on my leg to get it back together,
I suppose, and I whined that my back hurt and finally they gave me
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   When I awakened, the sun was shining and I could put on my
clothes and go home. I hesitated to take my old body away from
them. My doctor and his young assistants had taken such an interest
in it.
</P>
<P>
   But all good things come to an end and they have plenty of other
bodies with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   While I chatted and made jokes with his staff, the doctor
performed four similar operations, and for all I know he kept doing
them into the night. It seems there are a lot of us with chunks of
cholesterol lodged in that road to the heart, and taking care of it
is no more trouble than sweeping floors or scrubbing pots. (Your
back gets tired doing those things, too.)
</P>
<P>
   It's funny it never occurred to me that I would have any trouble
with my heart. It has performed reliably all these years, but you
never know, and there certainly seems to be a high incidence of
heart trouble out there.

<P>
   I walked down the hall at Piedmont Hospital reading the names of
doctors who specialize in the heart. There must be hundreds of
them.
</P>
<P>
   This particular operation, a balloon angioplasty, had not been
developed when my mother died in 1976. I wonder if it would have
saved her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That pain,'' she told me over the phone, ``is back.'' Not
wanting to go back to the hospital, she got back in her bed and
willed herself to die. I wish she could have known my warm and
caring friends at Piedmont Hospital.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

 &HT;    Now that it's hot outside, start your summer feast inside and
work your way to the back yard
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By John Kessler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My Weber Barbecue Kettle hasn't been looking so good lately. The
rubber stopper that holds one of the wheels in place is long gone,
so I have to be careful when moving it. Likewise, the side supports
are warped beyond usefulness, and only a taut band of packing tape
keeps the spindly legs from collapsing. When guests come over for a
back-porch cookout, they eye the bandaged, tippy, smoldering kettle
nervously, as if at any moment they may need to fling down their
paper plates and wineglasses and go running for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't yet burned down the balcony, so I remain loyal to my
10-year-old Weber. Up to now, I've used it primarily as a high-heat
grill _ a device for crusting salmon fillets and butterflied legs
of lamb over a direct, sizzling flame.
</P>
<P>
   But what about barbecue? What about indirect heat, ambient wood
smoke and the low-and-slow cooking necessary for ribs and pork
shoulders? What about everything the manufacturer claims you can
accomplish with a kettle?
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. With barbecue I've had less luck, or perhaps less
inclination. Following the game plan, I'm supposed to set up a
small pile of charcoal on one side, place the meat on the other
side, and then work hard for my meal tending the coals and
adjusting the air vents over the course of six hours. All this work
for at most two racks of ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there must be a way to start ribs cooking indoors, then
transfer them to the grill for a final application of char.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison, authors of the newly
released ``Born to Grill'' (Harvard Common Press, $27.95), know the
smoky pleasure of honest barbecue as well as anyone but also know
the myriad tricks people try to pseudo-barbecue ribs at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to people who boiled them and microwaved them and
did all this stuff,'' says Cheryl over the phone from her home in
Santa Fe, N.M. ``But we felt like it took a lot of flavor away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jamisons found they could conjure up a good facsimile of
barbecued baby backs by wrapping them in foil, roasting them in a
medium oven, refrigerating them thoroughly and reheating them over
a hot grill. Unlike recipes for braised or boiled ribs, these cook
as they should, in constant contact with a spice rub, so, as Cheryl
notes, ``you get more of that flavor soaked into the meat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' she adds, ``you get that official thing called the
Maillard reaction.'' She is referring to the browning of the ribs,
first in the oven, and then on the grill. The chemical reactions
that make meat brown (collectively called the Maillard reactions
for the French chemist who first documented them) yield a
particularly complex and delectable array of flavors when the meat
starts cooking at a low temperature and in contact with sugar, such
as the little bit the Jamisons put in their barbecue rub. The
flavors of slowly browned meat are half of what we crave in
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the other half is the flavor of smoke. Since the
ribs won't spend long enough on the grill to get a major shot of
smoke flavor, the Jamisons introduce it via chipotle (smoked ripe
jalapenos) that they put in their barbecue sauce as well as their
spice rub.
</P>
<P>
   I love their technique. And I love the possibilities. With ribs
cooking for several hours in the oven, why not throw in a pot of
old-fashioned baked beans as well? And while I'm at it, a batch of
homemade Parker House rolls is easy enough to assemble, and so much
better than the cottony white bread everyone expects with barbecue.
As long as I'm not an all-day slave to the grill, I can cook up a
storm in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheryl Jamison and I discuss the possibilities of indoor/
</P>
<P>
   outdoor barbecue on the phone, Bill Jamison listens in, not
adding much to the conversation until I ask if their technique
would work on a pork shoulder as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we call a compromise,'' he said matter-of-factly.
``But, you know, if you really want to barbecue _ really barbecue _
you can get one of those little water smokers for $30 to $40.
People use 'em all the time. They're great.''
</P>
<P>
   They are?
</P>
<P>
   With a sinking feeling, I knew that I was about to enter the
second phase of my career as a backyard barbecuer. Move over,
Weber.

 &HT;    Cherries are at their sweet peak
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Cynthia Hizer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the early cherry crop coming from rainy California has
been a bust this year, Northwest growers are looking at a promising
season. Look for the peak season to start now for sweet cherries _
Lamberts and, later, the Bing _ and to continue through late July.
The demand for cherries is exceeding the supply right now, with
Japan sweeping up most of the supply at prices that most Americans
wouldn't consider paying.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry season is short and commands plenty of promotions. Bings
carry the show and sell the most. The round Bings are
mahogany-colored at the peak of ripeness, while the smaller and
heart-shaped Lamberts are a crimson red.
</P>
<P>
   Sour cherries, those prized for pies, mostly come from Michigan
rather than the Northwest. And few of them make it to Georgia as
fresh fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Most stores still sell cherries in bulk, and most customers
still like to pick out their own fruit, hunting for the darkest and
prettiest cherries. Other stores are experimenting with prepackaged
fruit, but it adds to the already high cost of the fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, cherries don't lend themselves to store sampling. The
reason is the pits _ literally. People spit them out or drop them
on the floor, creating a dangerous situation.
</P>
<P>
   Other produce
</P>
<P>
   -- What's new: The heat is causing problems for cucumbers and
beans, and many supplies that get to the stores will show decay.
</P>
<P>
   -- Best buys of the week: Commercial Georgia sweet corn
(supersweet), Georgia peaches.
</P>
<P>
   -- Peak season: Local squash, and most of the Southern peas are
in (zipper, pink, black-eyed, purple hull), especially at the State
Farmers Market. Also California Long White potatoes, Vidalia
onions, squash, zucchini, bell peppers, banana peppers (hot only),
okra, Florida okra, turnip greens, cabbage, grapes, California
melons, strawberries, watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   -- Iffy: Spinach, cucumbers, pole and snap beans.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expensive: Beans, cucumbers, snap beans, pole beans,
specialty melons, raspberries and blackberries.
</P>
<P>
   -- Going, going, gone: Florida citrus.
</P>
<P>
   -- At farmers markets: Sweet onions, garlic, green tomatoes,
greens (lamb's quarters, spinach, collard greens, rapini, kale),
cocozelle zucchini, pickling cucumbers, commercial and organic
sweet corn, organic blueberries, wild blackberries, herbs, honey,
farm eggs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Meat, poultry, seafood: Boneless, skinless chicken breasts,
sirloin tip roast, Alaskan salmon, catfish fillets.
</P>
<P>
   Two quick cherry ideas
</P>
<P>
   During their fleeting season, it's hard to beat fresh cherries
eaten right off the stem. But for a little variety, here are a
couple of other fast ideas to try:
</P>
<P>
   -- Frozen cherry treats: Freeze pitted sweet cherries on cookie
sheets. When frozen, pack in freezer bags. Eat out of hand as a
quick sweet snack or drop into iced tea, lemonade, seltzer or white
wine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cherry-peach compote: In a skillet over medium-high heat,
melt 1 tablespoon butter; add 6 peeled and sliced peaches and 1/4
cup pitted cherries. Cook, shaking pan often, 2-3 minutes. Sprinkle
with 1 or 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Remove
from heat and serve over vanilla ice cream. Makes 4-6 servings.
</P>
<P>
   CHERRIES
</P>
<P>
   -- Price: Prices shouldn't top $3.49 a pound for premium
cherries, with some store specials a little less for smaller sizes.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nutrition: A 3 1/2-ounce portion has 70 calories and little
fat. Cherries are a good source of fiber and potassium as well as
vitamins C and B complex.
</P>
<P>
   -- Selection: Look for bright or dark red cherries that are
shiny and plump, with firm stems. Lighter fruits are more tart.
Avoid fruit that is shriveled or has soft or brown spots.
</P>
<P>
   -- Storage: Loosely wrap cherries in paper towels and place in a
plastic bag, unwashed. Refrigerate up to 3 days.
</P>
<P>
   -- Uses: One pound of unpitted cherries makes about 2 cups
pitted. Use fresh for out-of-hand eating or use in pies, cobblers,
cakes, relishes, meat sauces or salads.

 &HT;    COLUMN:`A family tradition' with all the furnishings
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue Ridge, Ga.-- It was a classic Saturday lunch: fried fish
(bluegills), jalapeno hush puppies, potato pancakes and coleslaw.
Charles Abernathy, the orchestrator and chef for this feast, had
gathered his family _ and invited mine.
</P>
<P>
   After lots of fun chat, we sat at the two tables covered with
red and white checkered oilcloth and fell onto our plates and into
semi-silence _ savoring some of the best food you'll find in any
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not a restaurant; it was a furniture store _ the
52-year-old family business, Charles' Home Furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we'd enjoyed this meal recently, we were familiar
with the Abernathys' graciousness: Stop by around 11:30 and maybe
get offered lunch or a snack between conversations about
handcrafted wood furniture made at the shop in back of the
building.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Charles proved to be not only a wood man,
but a food man, too. He enjoys people enjoying food: ``It's a
family tradition.'' He hands out candy to fellow worshippers at
First Baptist Church in nearby Epworth because ``it makes people
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   And, after Lyn and I had visited the store a few times, he
surprised us by offering stalks of celery for the road, asserting
that, in addition to being a good healthy snack, celery causes you
to use more calories digesting it than it puts into your body.
That'll work, I said to myself. Eat enough celery, and you can do
serious damage to other foods.
</P>
<P>
   We'd have to eat a whole lot of celery to compensate for the
calories consumed on the day of Charles' special feast (prepared at
the nearby family home). We had planned the fish fry one day when
we were sitting around talking about food and how much Charles
loves to cook. This meal, it turned out, was one of his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   One taste told us why. The Abernathys _ Charles' wife,
Marguerite (a painter and calligrapher, she expresses her artistry
on paper and canvas rather than in the kitchen), sons Allan (a
local radio personality) and James and James' wife and son, Sandy
and Justin _ knew the meal well and could practice moderation. But
Lyn and I, along with our daughters, Leslie and Petria, threw
moderation off the mountain. OK, I can only speak for myself, as my
plate was the only thing I saw for almost an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The bluegills were fried the way I remember them at family
gatherings in Meridian, Miss., where we used to catch them _ as
Charles does today. Just hard enough to give you a golden crunch on
the outside and a succulent white moistness on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the hush puppies were browned and crispy outside,
perfectly mealy and moist within. You chew on one, and just as you
savor the flavor of onion, the jalapeno kicks in. Hot puppies.
Thankfully, Charles eschews added sugar, a bad practice embraced by
too many restaurant cooks.
</P>
<P>
   The potato pancakes added a culinary touch familiar to many
families; my mother used to fry the leftover mashed potatoes for a
side dish _ or a main dish during the many hard times we went
through.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, times were good. They rolled on to dessert,
Marguerite's icebox lemon pie with Graham cracker crust. ``I
suppose you want a small piece,'' she said teasingly to Allan.
</P>
<P>
   Deadpan, he shot back: ``Some things we don't joke about.''
</P>
<P>
   First time I'd ever been too full to laugh after a big meal at
the furniture store.

 &HT;    Mixing flours gives rise to wheat biscuits
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)

<P>
   Many home cooks looking for a healthier breakfast treat or who
simply love the taste of whole wheat have experimented with whole
wheat biscuits, only to discover that simply replacing regular
flour usually won't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Whole wheat flour has a different texture and consistency. So
making a whole wheat biscuit can be tricky. Mildred Lynch of
Smyrna, Ga. wanted a recipe that was tried and true. Stella Jones
of Ellenwood, Ga. came through. Jones said she's tried several
recipes but likes this one best. It uses a mixture of regular and
whole wheat for a light texture.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LONDON _ Did Dick Williams moan, ``Water, water everywhere and
what a place to sink!'' as he dived from the Titanic on that
abysmal April night in 1912?
</P>
<P>
   We shall never know, only that Williams astoundingly didn't
sink. Keeping his head above water, a neat trick for a Harvard man,
he actually outfloated Leonardo DiCaprio, star of the wettest movie
since ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' and went on to win a Wimbledon title
in doubles eight years later. Not to mention the US singles titles
of 1914 and 1916.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture is ever the topic at Wimbledon, where an inordinate
amount of it frequently appears during the last week of June and
the first of July when a lot of people are trying to win a tennis
tournament. Since this tournament is played on an archaic substance
called grass _ a mystery to most of those involved _ the tendency
of the host All England Lawn Tennis &AMP; Croquet Club to masquerade as
a Brazilian rain forest at the whim of every passing cloud makes
tennis a pastime somewhere between treacherous and impossible.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the liquid intake of the tourney, approaching that
of Nicolas Cage in ``Leaving Las Vegas,'' nearly caused Wimbledon
to join the Titanic. Memories of 1997 were rife Tuesday as the
tournament was subdued by patches of mad and frantic drizzle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanderers in the mist managed to complete a few matches, such
as Martina Hingis beginning the defense of her crown, 7-5, 6-3,
over Lisa Raymond. And another winner, the almost forgotten US Open
champ Patrick Rafter, who says at last he's got the message.
</P>
<P>
   Since beating Greg Rusedski to rule Flushing Meadow nine months
ago, Rafter has herniated. What else would you expect for a young
fellow suddenly lugging a continent _ Australia _ around on his
shoulders? That's the burden he won by reviving the hopes of the
ex-world conquerors, the Down Under-takers. Last of that tribe to
perform what had become an annual ritual _ plundering America _ was
John Newcombe back in the year of OPEC tyranny and gasoline-pump
lineups, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Many very wet evenings have been spent on that far-off island
toasting ``Our Pat,'' and hailing his restoration of the Aussie
style: full-speed ahead serve-and-volleying in an era of baseline
topspinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of expectations after the Open,'' Rafter
says. ``I couldn't relax out there, and I started losing.''
</P>
<P>
   His win over a Swiss qualifier, No. 146-ranked Ivo Heuberger,
6-1, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, is hardly cause for nonstop waltzing to
``Waltzing Matilda'' back home in Queensland. But when he says,
``I've got my happiness back,'' the tribe is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness Tuesday was Rafter in full volleying, smashing cry,
and it overflowed the celebrated graveyard, Court 2, where,
regardless of stature or name, a honcho is always at risk from a
long-shotter. Didn't No. 281 Doug Flach inter No. 3 Andre Agassi
there two years ago, and No. 98 Nicolas Kiefer likewise undo No. 3
Yevgeny Kafelnikov last year? Heuberger had his chance to make the
embalming honor roll.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 33,688 crowding the grounds, 2,300 packed 2, an overgrown
closet, to scream for Rafter and keep him going when he lost the
third set.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, who rose to No. 2 after starting 1997 at No. 62, has
receded to No. 6, barely playing above .500 after Flushing. But
he's on a six-match streak, his hottest trot since the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure after the US Open was tremendous, a lot of it
self-inflicted,'' Rafter says. ``But I think I started to turn it
around last week when I beat Andrei Medvedev at Rosmalen'' (a
grass-court tuneup in the Netherlands) ``and went on to win the
tournament. That was important coming in here, to know I could win
a tournament again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to relax. I realized that just because I won the US
Open I couldn't expect to win everything, and I think the people at
home realized it, too. I got the message at Rosmalen.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tangible message, a tough fax from his Aussie
predecessor as US champ, Newcombe, now the Australian Davis Cup
captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it said is between me and Newc,'' says Rafter, ``but it
was a kick in the bum. There was a fine line. I could've snapped
and thrown it in the bin, or taken it aboard. They were facts, and
I took them. Things I needed to do. I'm glad he sent it. It helped
me relax. I don't feel like I'm carrying Australia any more.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rafter, one of the few who understands grass, can make a
genuine stab at the title, will we learn Newcombe's settling words?
Were they: ``Don't spill the beer, Patrick. We don't need another
flood''?

 &HT;    It's official: Plant-based diet smart
 &HT;    FREELANCE STORY. TO BE USED BY COX PAPERS ONLY. NOT TO BE USED
BY NY TIMES WIRE.
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 25: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Cynthia Hizer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association is considered the official
word on nutrition in America. It wasn't very long ago that it
didn't think much of vegetarian diets and was positively thumbs
down on vegan diets. The four food groups might have been updated,
but meat and dairy were still the foundation of a healthy diet.
</P>
<P>
   It was groundbreaking news in 1993, then, when the association
presented an official position paper on vegetarian diets. While it
stopped short of a full-fledged endorsement, at least it said that
vegetarian diets were healthful and nutritionally adequate when
properly planned.
</P>
<P>
   Now the association has revised that position with an even
stronger, more positive message, noting that: ``vegetarian diets
are nutritionally adequate and provide health benefits in the
prevention and treatment of certain diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the ADA:
</P>
<P>
   -- Vegetarian diets offer disease-protection benefits because of
their lower saturated-fat, cholesterol and animal-protein content
and, often, higher folate concentrations (which reduce serum
homocysteine levels), antioxidants such as vitamins C and E,
carotenoids and phytochemicals.
</P>
<P>
   -- Not only is mortality from coronary artery disease lower in
vegetarians than in nonvegetarians, but vegetarian diets have also
been successful in arresting coronary artery disease. Total serum
cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are
usually lower in vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   -- Vegetarians tend to have a lower incidence of hypertension
than nonvegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   -- Type 2 diabetes mellitus is much less likely to be a cause of
death in vegetarians, perhaps because of their higher intake of
complex carbohydrates and a lower body mass index.
</P>
<P>
   -- Vegetarians have lower incidences of lung, colorectal and
colon cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The position paper offers much more, and you can read the entire
piece at www.eatright.org.
</P>
<P>
   Above is a vegetarian recipe that wins high marks for nutrition
and taste.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Vegetable Pizzas
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 30 minutes Cooking time: 45
minutes
</P>
<P>
   As the vegetables cook, they turn into a juicy melange, perfect
for spreading on a pizza. Japanese eggplant has a thin skin and
doesn't need to be peeled, so it's a good choice for this easy
pizza.
</P>
<P>
   2Japanese eggplants, cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2yellow onions, cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   2red bell peppers, diced
</P>
<P>
   3cups mushrooms, thickly sliced
</P>
<P>
   4teaspoons dried basil (8 teaspoons fresh)
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/2teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1cup roasted red peppers, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1cup chopped tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   4garlic cloves, crushed
</P>
<P>
   6whole-wheat pitas
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Place eggplants, onions, bell
peppers and mushrooms in a single layer in one or two large baking
dishes. Toss with 3 teaspoons of the basil and the cinnamon,
coriander and salt. Bake until eggplant is fork-tender, about 30
minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the roasted red peppers with the tomatoes, garlic and
remaining teaspoon basil.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the pizzas, spread a layer of the pepper-tomato
mixture on a pita. Top with a generous layer of the roasted
vegetables. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining
pitas. Bake for 15 minutes. _ From ``Garden Cuisine'' by Paul
Wenner (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14)

 &HT;    Fame, by George
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get past the looks of George Clooney. Past those eyelashes over
the dark eyes, and the jutting jaw, and that fraction of an inch of
perfectly even beard stubble that would look slovenly on most guys
but on him just looks great; get past all that and there is the
ambivalence of George Clooney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird,'' he says, ``the work you have to do to stay
somewhat normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He has one more season to go as Dr. Doug Ross on ``ER,'' the
most popular series on TV. He has a new movie opening Friday, ``Out
of Sight,'' based on an Elmore Leonard novel. He has an essay in
the premiere issue of Brill's Content, the new media watchdog
magazine, in which he takes on the press for succumbing to the
taint of the tabloids. The star of the fourth ``Batman'' movie is
no longer caped, but still a crusader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a day goes by, literally not a day, that there isn't some
story about me in some newspaper that's completely wrong. I read I
was at Cindy Crawford's wedding, sitting on the beach talking to
Richard Gere. I'm reading this in New York, thinking, 'Wow! Was I
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney loves to talk, and he can be serious and analytical one
moment, charmingly self-deprecating the next, as he circles the
strange notion of celebrity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like actors complaining how miserable their life is,''
he says. ``I'm very well paid and I love what I do. But if you
spend a day walking around with me, you'd rethink whether you want
to be me. You can be walking through an airport and here comes some
17-year-old with a video camera, and he starts making fun of your
female assistant to get a response. He wants me to go, 'Screw you,'
and shove him, and that's the clip they'll play over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that it's cool to be in what he calls the
famous club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a kind of society of people you become friends with.
There's something fun about walking down the aisle at an awards
show and you see James Woods. You're part of the famous club. You
automatically know each other 'cause you're famous: 'Hey James, how
ya doin'?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those types of things really crack me up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' is Clooney's fifth film, and his fifth attempt
to establish himself as a box-office heavyweight movie star as
distinct from a TV star. ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' didn't do it, nor
did ``The Peacemaker'' or ``One Fine Day'' and certainly not
``Batman &AMP; Robin,'' which he laughs about now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I buried the franchise,'' he says, grinning, eyes
flashing. ``This time I'm not wearing any rubber (suit), which I
think will be the key,'' he says of ``Out of Sight.'' In the movie,
Clooney plays a career bank robber, a charming loser who has a
problematic romance with a U.S. marshal, played by Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to happen,'' says Steve Soderbergh, Clooney's
director in ``Out of Sight.'' ``He just hasn't gotten the right
part yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on that list where about four or five people have to go,
'Nah, I'm too busy.' Then I get it,'' Clooney says, referring to
the path of scripts that determines the pecking order in the club.
</P>
<P>
   Until he gets the right part, Clooney will continue with the
show that got him into the club, ``ER.'' Clooney knocked around
forgettably in TV shows for years, playing Roseanne's boss in that
sitcom's first season (shaggy haired, he made little impression), a
neighbor on ``The Facts of Life'' and a tough on an old sitcom
named ``E/R.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists his departure from ``ER'' after next season is not
ingratitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm honoring a contract that was for five years.
It's better for a show like that to rejuvenate itself regularly,
get in some fresh blood.'' He says it's unlikely Doug Ross will
die, because he's told the producers he'd willingly come back for
occasional guest shots.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule for the past two years, making movies and ``ER''
simultaneously, has been a killer, seven days a week almost every
week. For ``Out of Sight,'' filmed in Florida and Detroit, he would
film for four to five days, fly back to Los Angeles to do his
``ER'' scenes, then fly back to the movie set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this year Doug probably had more stories and time than
in any other season,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is well-known as a prankster on the ``ER'' set, dropping
prop baby dolls and pretending they're real, smearing a goo called
SurgiLube on phones that cast members are about to answer. On the
set of ``Out of Sight,'' Albert Brooks, who plays a millionaire
robbery target of Clooney's character, was his mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's notorious,'' says Anthony Edwards, who plays Dr. Mark
Greene, Ross' best friend, on the series. ``When George is in the
next scene, he'll keep everybody laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   There will come a day, Clooney notes with what borders on glee,
when his membership in the famous club will be revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to see me on TV or in a movie, you do that. And
when you don't, I will go away. Which I will eventually. There are
very few Paul Newmans in the world. I'm doing dinner theater in
about 10 years. In the end, I'm gonna end up on 'Hollywood
Squares.'''
</P>
<P>
   If he never plays Batman again, and it's doubtful he will, maybe
he could play the Joker. If he could get past his looks.

Exhibition, a national juried competition in outdoor sculpture, and
an indoor exhibit, ``Post-Modern Potluck,'' featuring the colorful
quilts of Betty Bivins Edwards. Theater offerings will include
staged readings of ``A Night at the Algonquin'' and ``The Inferno
of Dante.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the festival is offering a ``Family Series''

</P>
<P>
   A children's visual arts workshop July 13-17 will focus on

</P>
<P>
   -- Mountain lures: Nearby are attractions such as Grandfather
Mountain, the Blue Ridge Parkway, Watauga River white-water rafting

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

CLIPPERS AT THE HELM 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clippers are in control of the 1998 NBA draft. Is there any
wonder why things are out of control? Karl Malone likes to go
driving with a state cop. The Clips prefer Mr. Magoo.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure what Donald Sterling's brain-dead brain trust is
going to do, but you can be sure that, down the road, it either
will be the wrong choice or it will bring a calamity on the
franchise. That's the Clipper Way.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to 1988, the last time the Clippers controlled things.
They had the first pick, just as they do today. They actually did
the right thing and drafted Danny Manning. You already know that
story.
</P>
<P>
   A holdout. A torn ACL after only 26 games as a rookie. Traded to
Atlanta for Dominique Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, despite their tortured history, the Clippers managed
to go another full decade before again securing the first pick
overall.
</P>
<P>
   They've blown other big ones _ they wouldn't be the Clippers if
they hadn't _ but now they've come to the dilemma facing every
team: two players at the two most critical positions, one developed
(by current NBA standards, anyway) and one who is, as they say,
getting there (again, by current NBA standards). All we know is
that the player will be named Michael.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling likes names and he likes local heroes. Mike Bibby, to a
certain extent, is both. He is a name with an NBA pedigree. Papa
played in the NBA and at UCLA (even more important), and coaches at
Southern Cal. Bibby fils has worked out nowhere else, per order of
his agent, David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   The omnipotent Falk wants Bibby in Los Angeles. Sterling and
Falk dined Tuesday; what do you think they talked about? And why
would Falk even bother if he knew the Clippers were committed to
Bibby? The Clippers face the dilemma of either crossing Falk or
caving in to him.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi, meanwhile, has risen faster than mercury on
a hot day and was getting a lot of votes on mock drafts for the No.
1 pick. Ordinarily, the Clippers wouldn't consider Olowokandi
because they have Ike Austin on their roster. But Austin is a free
agent and the Clips have yet to hold onto a single free agent of
note. You don't hear the Clippers mentioned when the topic turns to
``Future Homes of Ike Austin.'
</P>
<P>
   And yet, who knows when the next big man will surface? We all
thought Tim Duncan was the last one. Now along comes the Kandi Man.
They aren't comparable in skill, but no one doubts that Olowokandi
can be a top 10 center within several years. How can you turn away
from that?
</P>
<P>
   Watching all of this with more than passing interest is
Vancouver, which has been getting offer after offer for the No. 2
pick. Those offers have more contingencies than a real estate deal;
almost all are based on the assumption that the Clippers will take
Bibby. We even hear that the Celtics have dangled Ron Mercer and
their own choice.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers do take Olowokandi, there's a chance Vancouver
might pass on Bibby, even though the Grizzlies need a point guard.
They also need a power forward and a shooting guard and believe the
talented Paul Pierce is the latter. Not drafting Bibby would also
cover the rear end of general manager Stu Jackson, who drafted
flameout Antonio Daniels last year at No. 4. Daniels made Chauncey
Billups look like Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   After that, we know only the names of the next handful of
players. They are being slotted, reslotted, and slotted again in a
wacky game of musical chairs. Pitino wasn't kidding when he said
that the No. 10 pick could turn out to be as good as the No. 1
pick. The No. 10 pick could be the No. 1 pick. Well, not quite. But
you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a unique draft,'' Pitino said. ``Normally, you know 1
through 5 or 1 through 8. But 10 could be as good as 1 and 12 could
be as good as 2. I see a big dropoff after 13.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot of trade talk, including an interesting one
that had the Lakers offering Nick Van Exel to Boston, even up, for
Travis Knight. LA's thinking was that it could dump the unwanted
Van Exel as well as reclaim Knight's faltering career. The Celtics
would be rid of Knight's contract and could either reroute Van Exel
or keep him; he has only one year left on his contract. Boston
apparently did not want to do the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of trade possibilities will be blunted by cap reality:
Only a couple of teams (Toronto, the Clippers) have any real cap
room to absorb contracts in return for just a pick. (Vancouver, for
instance, has little cap space.) Most of the teams who envision
having cap room won't have it until July 1, when David Stern will
drop the hammer and the nuclear summer will begin.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have been trying to unload any or all of their many
inedibles, packaging them with something enticing (Antoine Walker
was thrown into at least one proposal) to make the other guy bite.
No one has yet. Pitino said Monday there was only a 15 percent
chance he'd move the pick. If he does, remember he also said there
was a 10 percent chance he'd move Walker.

LAWMAKERS URGE CLINTON TO ADDRESS TOUGH ISSUES IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, a
bipartisan group of lawmakers urged him Tuesday to speak out
against human rights abuses and religious persecution, warning that
he will end up ``on the wrong side of history'' if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., one of the harshest critics of
Clinton's China policy, warned that the president's planned visit
to the site of a bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in
1989 will ``remove the shadow of Tiananmen Square from the
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi held up a white two-foot statue of the ``Goddess of
Democracy,'' a replica of the statue that was torn down during the
Tiananmen Square massacre that left hundreds dead. She called on
the president to meet with political dissidents and families of
victims of the crackdown during his 10-day visit so he won't signal
his approval of the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi claimed that Clinton is allowing the Chinese government
to control his visit and, as a result, ``he will miss his
opportunity to stand with the Chinese people in their fight for
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this pattern continues throughout the president's trip, he
will be remembered for standing with China's authoritarian regime _
and will, indeed, find himself on the wrong side of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi and other critics of the administration's policy of
reaching out to China spoke at a news conference in an U.S. Senate
office building. The president departs Wednesday and returns to
Washington on July 3 after visiting five Chinese cities. On
Saturday, the president will participate in a welcoming ceremony on
the edge of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the second Chinese city on
his itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., decried a decision by the Chinese
government to revoke the visas of three U.S. reporters who work for
Radio Free Asia who had planned to travel with Clinton this week.
Radio Free Asia, which is funded by the U.S. government, broadcasts
to China and has often outraged Beijing by reporting on human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson has proposed legislation that would deny travel visas
to Chinese officials involved in any religious persecution or
forced-abortion policies, end U.S.-backed loans to China and modify
U.S. policy on satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   However, Senate leaders agreed to postpone consideration of any
legislation hostile to China until after Clinton's returns home.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who said his own father fled
persecution from Russia, urged Clinton to call for the release of
people imprisoned because of religious practices.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone added: ``I am very worried that the symbolism of the
visit to Tiananmen Square will be so powerful it will validate the
government's efforts to suppress human rights there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., told Clinton as he extends
the ``hand of friendship,'' to remember that ``friends don't let
friends murder and torture and imprison innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Clinton should speak ``forcefully and openly about
forced abortion and sterilization, organ harvesting from executed
prisoners, religious persecution, forced labor camps, and the
denial of freedom of speech, association and the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, president of the conservative Family Research
Council, said in an interview that Clinton's visit ``will be
incredibly demoralizing to those people in China who have resisted
the attempts of the Chinese government to stamp out political and
religious liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Chinese political prisoner Harry Wu said Clinton's China
policy ``is based on commercial interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu said in an interview that pictures of Clinton at Tiananmen
Square will be interpreted by the Chinese as sending the message
that ``we are stable, we are in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew Liu, executive director of the China Strategic Institute, a
Washington think tank, said in an interview that the Chinese will
watch television broadcasts of Clinton's trip to read whether he
``cares for money, trade or for something else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be able to read very subtle messages as to whether
Clinton is showing whether he submits to the Chinese will,'' he
said, adding that the Chinese press has communicated that
``Americans care for money, not democracy.''

<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

FINANCE MINISTER TRIES TO REASSURE MARKETS, BANK INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's finance minister tried to calm the financial
markets Tuesday and avert a further selloff in the shares of a
large bank, as the government moved a step closer toward
establishing a system to help restructure failed banks.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's leaders are working out the details of what they're
calling the Total Plan to tackle $600 billion in bad and doubtful
loans infecting the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan has taken on a special urgency because of reports that
Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest financial
institutions, is in trouble. The market has driven down its stock
down by more than 60 percent in the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit is reportedly seeking a rescue merger to help
stabilize its business. The bank has denied the reports, as well as
accounts of merger discussions, but said Tuesday that it was
working on a restructuring plan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's anemic banking system is considered an underlying cause
of the malaise that has afflicted the world's second-largest
economy, severely weakened the yen and stock market, and played a
role in the broader economic problems confronting much of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. delegation visited Tokyo last week to discuss Japan's
predicament after both countries took the unusual step of buying
yen and selling dollars to strengthen the Japanese currency. But
the yen has started to weaken again, and Tuesday the stock market
fell 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Government leaders, one after another, expressed assurances
Tuesday that Long-Term Credit's depositors, lenders and
counterparties in financial transactions would not suffer losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope depositors and investors feel assured about their
assets,'' said Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit's stock price fell to a record low of 62 yen
Monday, from more than 200 just a couple of weeks ago. Tuesday, it
was the most heavily traded stock, closing at 71 yen, up 9 yen.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto also tried to reassure
depositors and investors Tuesday that the government would maintain
financial stability. He said the government would take ``drastic
measures to resolve the bad loan problem and will completely
protect sound borrowers.''
</P>
<P>
   A high-level group of ministers and members of the dominant
Liberal Democratic Party on Tuesday approved an overall proposal
for the Total Plan, which will be submitted to a special
parliamentary session shortly after Upper House elections July 12.
The group also endorsed the idea of establishing a ``bridge bank,''
and will work out the details by July 2.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge bank would take over the assets and liabilities of
banks facing bankruptcy and have the ability to lend money, so that
the borrowers of failed banks would not be hurt. Critics say unless
the plan is properly structured, the bank could just keep expanding
if the number of bankrupt banks increased. &QL;

 By LESLIE EATON 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT WINS COURT VICTORY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. scored gains Tuesday on both the
legal and legislative fronts, sending its stock to a record high.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals here quashed an
injunction that barred Microsoft from forcing computer makers to
bundle its Internet browser with the Windows 95 operating system,
the software giant's allies on Capitol Hill launched a drive to
derail a broader Justice Department antitrust suit by denying it
extra funding.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the appellate court found that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had ``erred procedurally'' last
December ``in entering a preliminary injunction without notice to
Microsoft and (had erred) substantively in its implicit
construction of the consent decree on which the preliminary
injunction rested.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also effectively fired Harvard University law
professor Lawrence Lessig, whom Jackson had brought in as a
``special master'' in the case to weigh technical issues. Microsoft
had claimed Lessig was biased and that he had been granted too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the appointment was ``either a clear
abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly nonexistent
discretion.'' But it did not find Lessig to be biased.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Justice Department joined 20 state attorneys general
in mounting a much broader antitrust case against Microsoft, one
that charged the firm with abusing its near-monopoly power over
operating systems for personal computers to seek control of the
Internet and other markets.
</P>
<P>
   With that wider case set for trial Sept. 8, the judges wrote
that the government ``may well regard further pursuit of this case
as unpromising, especially given the alternative avenues developing
in its recently launched separate attacks on Microsoft's
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of that admonition, the government must now decide
whether to appeal to the full appellate bench or directly to the
U.S. Supreme Court. ``We are disappointed with the Court of
Appeals' decision in the consent decree case,'' the department said
in a statement. ``We're reviewing the opinion to assess our
options.''
</P>
<P>
   At corporate headquartes in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft spokesman
Greg Shaw termed the judicial decision ``a great day for
consumers.'' He said it ``affirms the central principal Microsoft
has been defending, that every company should have the freedom to
improve its products and integrate new features on behalf of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock surged on the good news, rising to a new record
level of $100.75 a share, thereby raising the value of co-founder
Bill Gates's holdings in the company to some $57 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's friends in the Senate moved to deny the
antitrust division additional funds it had sought for its growing
case load.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C.,
succeeded Tuesday in getting a Senate appropriations subcommittee
to yank $9 million that had been requested by Justice Department
Antitrust Division chief Joel Klein _ on top of the $98.3 million
in the original Clinton administration budget.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, however, declined to include a Microsoft-backed rider
that urged Klein's staff ``to take special care to not make public
statements or release any evidence in its possession'' because such
``practices have the explicit effect of creating prejudicial
pretrial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Deletion of the funds will be tested again on Thursday when the
full Approprications Committee meets to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the day that Microsoft will release Windows 98 for
general sale. As the successor operating system to Windows 95, the
new software integrates the browser even more deeply than the code
to which the government already objects.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT WINS COURT VICTORY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. scored gains Tuesday on both the
legal and legislative fronts, sending its stock to a record high.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals here quashed an
injunction that barred Microsoft from forcing computer makers to
bundle its Internet browser with the Windows 95 operating system,
the software giant's allies on Capitol Hill launched a drive to
derail a broader Justice Department antitrust suit by denying it
extra funding.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 decision, the appellate court found that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had ``erred procedurally'' last
December ``in entering a preliminary injunction without notice to
Microsoft and (had erred) substantively in its implicit
construction of the consent decree on which the preliminary
injunction rested.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also effectively fired Harvard University law
professor Lawrence Lessig, whom Jackson had brought in as a
``special master'' in the case to weigh technical issues. Microsoft
had claimed Lessig was biased and that he had been granted too much
power.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said the appointment was ``either a clear
abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly nonexistent
discretion.'' But it did not find Lessig to be biased.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Justice Department joined 20 state attorneys general
in mounting a much broader antitrust case against Microsoft, one
that charged the firm with abusing its near-monopoly power over
operating systems for personal computers to seek control of the
Internet and other markets.
</P>
<P>
   With that wider case set for trial Sept. 8, the judges wrote
that the government ``may well regard further pursuit of this case
as unpromising, especially given the alternative avenues developing
in its recently launched separate attacks on Microsoft's
practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of that admonition, the government must now decide
whether to appeal to the full appellate bench or directly to the
U.S. Supreme Court. ``We are disappointed with the Court of
Appeals' decision in the consent decree case,'' the department said
in a statement. ``We're reviewing the opinion to assess our
options.''
</P>
<P>
   At corporate headquartes in Redmond, Wash., Microsoft spokesman
Greg Shaw termed the judicial decision ``a great day for
consumers.'' He said it ``affirms the central principal Microsoft
has been defending, that every company should have the freedom to
improve its products and integrate new features on behalf of
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock surged on the good news, rising to a new record
level of $100.75 a share, thereby raising the value of co-founder
Bill Gates's holdings in the company to some $57 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft's friends in the Senate moved to deny the
antitrust division additional funds it had sought for its growing
case load.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C.,
succeeded Tuesday in getting a Senate appropriations subcommittee
to yank $9 million that had been requested by Justice Department
Antitrust Division chief Joel Klein _ on top of the $98.3 million
in the original Clinton administration budget.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, however, declined to include a Microsoft-backed rider
that urged Klein's staff ``to take special care to not make public
statements or release any evidence in its possession'' because such
``practices have the explicit effect of creating prejudicial
pretrial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Deletion of the funds will be tested again on Thursday when the
full Approprications Committee meets to consider the request.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the day that Microsoft will release Windows 98 for
general sale. As the successor operating system to Windows 95, the
new software integrates the browser even more deeply than the code
to which the government already objects.

   SHANGHAI, China _ After a day of last-minute efforts to
negotiate a compromise that would permit a local opera company to
travel to New York City to perform a classic Chinese opera, ``The
Peony Pavilion,'' as a centerpiece of the Lincoln Center Festival
next month, cultural officials here continued to block the project.
The director of the Shanghai Bureau of Culture insisted that the
modern staging of the work was inappropriate for foreign viewers
and would not be permitted to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Coming days before the arrival of President Clinton, who is
scheduled to land in China on Thursday evening, the artistic
controversy threatens to sour an otherwise optimistic atmosphere
that has been carefully planned by Chinese and American officials
for the visit, which includes three days in Shanghai beginning on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Redden, director of the Lincoln Center Festival, flew to
Shanghai on Monday to try to reach a compromise with Shanghai
officials so the opera would not have to be abandoned. Although the
contract between Lincoln Center and the Kunqu Opera Company does
not technically involve the Bureau of Culture, its officials have
exercised unwritten authority to step in and make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After an inconclusive meeting Tuesday, the director of the
Bureau of Culture, Ma Bomin, reissued a statement made last week
declaring that extensive revisions of the opera's script were still
necessary before it could be approved. It also accused the director
hired by Lincoln Center, Chen Shi-Zheng, of introducing ``feudal,''
``ignorant'' and ``pornographic'' elements into the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Redden was more conciliatory, apparently hoping for a
last-minute breakthrough even as that possibility seemed
increasingly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still hope that we can somehow break the logjam, but I do
not have anything positive to report,'' Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-part production is scheduled to begin on July 7, with
nightly performances through July 12. The six parts are then to be
compressed into a weekend marathon, scheduled to begin on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The opera company's containers packed with six tons of elaborate
sets, props and costumes are still stranded at Shanghai
International Airport, where a cargo flight scheduled for last week
was unexpectedly blocked.
</P>
<P>
   (At Lincoln Center, Janice Price, the vice president for
marketing and communications, said that ``Thursday is our drop-dead
date'' for departure of the cargo if the production was to open as
planned on July 7. The opening night is already sold out, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   (But she said it was possible that the production could begin
later and be extended past the scheduled close of the festival, on
July 26. One complicating factor, she said, was sufficient
rehearsal time between the six-day presentation and three-day
marathon.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the most stunning aspects of the fracas is that plans to
perform a 400-year-old Chinese opera in the United States reflect
the innocuous, nonpolitical sort of cultural exchange that China's
government is trying hard to promote. Showcasing elements of
China's endlessly complex culture is something its leaders
generally prefer to talk of human rights or nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Yet the standoff over ``The Peony Pavilion'' is a reminder of
the considerable political power still wielded by a small band of
ultraconservative officials in this nation despite all the
liberating social and economic changes under way here. Many of
these officials control cultural and media affairs in the
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than promoters of artistic performances, cultural
officials often view themselves as the last guardians of Communist
Party ideology, outdated and unpopular as it is with most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ms. Ma objected to elements of the unorthodox staging
of the opera introduced by Chen. It was not political content that
offended Ms. Ma but rather the innovative way that he approached
the opera, a 55-scene extravaganza that he wanted to stage in its
20-hour entirety.
</P>
<P>
   Chen insists that his interpretation of the opera recreates the
original spirit of the work written by Tang Xianzu in 1598 and lost
over the years as the genre deteriorated, becoming so stilted and
lifeless that relatively few Chinese viewers could enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   His staging appeared to be a singular success, with the audience
at a dress rehearsal in Shanghai this month responding with
laughter and raucous applause.
</P>
<P>
   Even The People's Daily, the principal Communist Party
newspaper, published an enthusiastic review on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such an open theatrical environment, the audience is struck
by a richly interesting picture of life of ordinary people in the
Ming Dynasty,'' the reviewer wrote. ``This opera is intoxicating
from the opening moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Other official comment also reflected broad approval from the
authorities, before Ms. Ma stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, China's minister of culture, Sun Jiazheng,
went out of his way to cite the coming performance of ``The Peony
Pavilion'' in New York as a prime example of cultural cooperation
to be celebrated during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the day the New China News Agency reported
Sun's comments in Beijing, cultural officials in Shanghai opened a
personal attack on Chen, who grew up in China and moved to the
United States in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In commentaries published in Shanghai's three major state-run
newspapers, the cultural officials sharply criticized Chen, often
in stilted and sometimes xenophobic language common to Chinese
Communist Party oratory, accusing him of pandering to foreigners,
aggrandizing his artistic vision and ignoring sacred traditions.
</P>
<P>
   While the original opera is wildly suggestive, a scene of
lovemaking between a man and a ghost occurs behind a screen,
without any nudity onstage. As Chen likes to point out, the
eroticism of the opera is refined by modern standards, just as it
was in the works of Shakespeare, Tang's contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between cultural bureaucrats like Ms. Ma and an
innovative director like Chen represent a distinct clash between
old and new in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Culture relies on faithful copying of well-known
performance methods, and insists on a respect for or at least a
passive acceptance of authority.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, young artists like Chen stress creativity,
individual thinking and experimentation. It is no surprise that his
interpretation of ``The Peony Pavilion'' appears to enjoy virtually
unanimous support from actors young and old in the opera company,
including its head, who has a leading role in the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma, an experienced singer of Peking Opera before she became
an official in 1986, now heads one of the most conservative
branches of the Shanghai government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ma stresses the need for better control over cultural
affairs, even though the government continues to cut financing for
the arts and is even starting to ask for corporate sponsors for
cultural affairs it can no longer afford to finance itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not be surprised if artistic troupes appear,
named after specific companies,'' Ms. Ma told Liberation Daily last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Ma's way of making her views public over the last week
relied on old-fashioned party indirectness and obscurity, not that
it fooled anyone. When she released a statement on Saturday
criticizing Chen, she did so without signing any official's name,
instead using the ``Kunqu Opera Company Performance Group,'' as
though the actors from ``The Peony Pavilion'' were voicing the
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But no actors stepped forward to claim any such view, and the
fax number printed on the statement was from the Bureau of Culture.

   NEW YORK _ Music, dance, the spoken word and film are on the
menu as the performing arts festival called ``Celebrate Brooklyn!''
begins at 7:30 p.m. Thursday with a performance by the Cajun dance
band Beausoleil Avec Michael Doucet at the new Prospect Park Band
Shell, at Ninth Street and Prospect Park West. The 20th anniversary
season of ``Celebrate Brooklyn!'' which runs through Aug. 22,
continues on Friday with an evening of Eric Bogosian's monologues,
and on Saturday with the salsa of El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.
Admission is free, although a $3 contribution is suggested.

   NEW YORK _ For all who thrill at the look and lore of the
motorcycle, the place to be starting Friday is the Solomon
Guggenheim Museum on Fifth Avenue at 89th Street, where a new
exhibition called ``The Art of the Motorcycle'' opens for a run
through Sept. 20. During that time, in an installation designed by
the architect Frank Gehry, more than 100 motorcycles will be on
display in the Rotunda and Tower Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The show, organized by Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim
Foundation, chronicles the evolution of motorcycle technology and
design and puts the motorcycle in a cultural and historical
context. The display ranges from the German-made Hildebrand &AMP;
Wolfmuller of 1894 to the high-concept motorcycles of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Square Deal
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time doesn't always fly when you're waiting in line,
but it hardly seems that 25 years have passed since TKTS, the
Theater Development Fund's discount ticket booth, opened. Although
the booth in Duffy Square on Broadway at 47th Street began its
365-day-a-year operation on June 25, 1973, the anniversary party
has been scheduled not for Thursday but for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   John Lindsay was mayor when TKTS began, and after the sale of
nearly 35 million discounted tickets with revenue of $670 million
for thousands of Broadway and Off Broadway shows, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani has proclaimed Saturday TKTS Day. For those in the ticket
line from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., the celebration will feature
performers from shows like ``Chicago,'' ``Titanic'' and ``Forever
Tango,'' as well as a live band playing tunes from musicals and a
raffle of 250 free tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In Tribute
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shelley Winters will be honored for half a century on
screen when the Hollywood Film Festival gives her its Lifetime
Achievement Award on Aug. 10. Ms. Winters, who was strangled by
Ronald Colman in ``A Double Life'' (1948) and seduced by Montgomery
Clift in ``A Place in the Sun'' (1951), won Oscars for her
performances in supporting roles in ``The Diary of Anne Frank''
(1959) and ``A Patch of Blue'' (1965).

IN CHINA, CLINTON IS LIONIZED AS A GLOBAL VISIONARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., see related CHINA-PIRACY, CHINA-VISAS, CHINA-MEDIA,
CHINA-U.S.-ECON, CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-MISSILES.) 
(ps) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ At home, President Clinton's fortunes may wax and
wane, but here, on the eve of his first state visit to China, he is
being lionized as a great statesman who had the wisdom to change
his mind about China _ turning from his early attack stance to his
current policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's great global vision, it seems, ranks him right up
there with that all-time great strategist, Richard Nixon, who will
ever be revered here for reviving ties between the United States
and China.
</P>
<P>
   The adulation of Clinton was evident on Tuesday afternoon at the
monthly salon of the XSH Book Club, in its headquarters in the
middle of a park in northwest Beijing. The directors of the club _
which markets books at a discount to its thousands of members
through catalogues and seminars like the one on Tuesday _ assembled
foreign policy experts and a few dozen Chinese journalists and book
lovers to discuss three major American titles recently published in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Clinton's ``Between Hope and History: Meeting
America's Challenges for the 21st Century'' (Random House, 1996), a
summary of his political philosophy written with William Nothdurft.
This month, the book went into its second printing in China after
the first several tens of thousands sold out. (``Not quite a
`Titanic','' said the book club editor, Xi Hong, ``but a consistent
top-seller over the last year.'')
</P>
<P>
   The second featured title, just published here this week after a
rush translation job, was Monica Crowley's new memoir, ``Nixon in
Winter'' (Random House, 1998). The third was Henry Kissinger's 1994
tome ``Diplomacy'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), which appeared in Chinese
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever American critics may have made of the Clinton book and
Ms. Crowley's obsequious memoir of the former president who took
her under his wing in his final years, the assembled professors
here treated these works seriously, as offering insight into the
men who made today's emerging Chinese-American partnership
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Qian Wenrong, deputy director of the New China World Issues
Research Institute, noted that by the time Clinton published his
book, he had already made his momentous shift in China policy, and
recognized the leading role China will play in world affairs in the
next century. Back in the 1970s, Qian said, Nixon had presciently
seen how the world system was changing and China's inevitable rise.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yizhou of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences called the
Nixon book excellent, a reminder of how far-sighted the man was.
Kissinger's book he declared a classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kissinger book is very deep,'' he said, ``but I like the
Clinton book better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jia Qingguo, a political scientist at Beijing University who
spent several years in the United States, was less taken with the
books per se, but noted that through Clinton's book, and his rags
to riches story, Chinese could better understand the American
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth scholar, Huang Annian, a historian at Beijing Normal
University, listed the three most important American presidents
from China's perspective. The first was Franklin Roosevelt, leader
during World War II, ``the most glorious period in Chinese-U.S.
relations'' as the countries fought together against fascism and
Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The second was Nixon, who set the process in motion that led to
normalized relations. And third was Clinton, who despite human
rights and other concerns has realized that the isolation of China
does not serve America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three men _ they all have strategic vision,'' Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even greater praise has appeared in the official media.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton gave an interview to visiting Chinese journalists
last week, an article in the Economic Daily here said: ``The
40-minute interview was unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``foresight, courage and insight deeply impressed the
Chinese correspondents,'' the article said.

BUSINESS TRAVEL:  
 AMEX MAY ADD TO AIRLINE-SEAT BULK PURCHASES  
 MORE MARKETS, FEWER CUSTOMERS  
 FLYING TO KUALA LUMPUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   The planned bulk purchase of airline seats between the United
States and London may be only the first in a series of such deals
by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The company is buying seats on Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic
Airways flights from Continental Airlines, Virgin's partner, on
routes between London and New York, Los Angeles, Washington, San
Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Other similar arrangements are possible, ``with Continental and
with other airlines, as well as hotel companies,'' according to
Melissa Abernathy, a spokeswoman for American Express.
</P>
<P>
   No company the size of American Express has previously bought
tickets this way for resale to corporate customers, according to
Norman Sherlock, executive director of the National Business Travel
Association. He said he expected to see similar deals in the
future, adding, ``The problem is how much cash people have to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all large corporate travel companies are rushing to jump on
the bandwagon. Travis Tanner, chief executive of the Carlson
Wagonlit travel agency chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was
skeptical about bulk buying of airline seats. ``We haven't seen yet
where that creates any greater value,'' he said. Carlson Wagonlit
has so far preferred to contract for volume discounts without
purchasing the seats outright, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth International, the corporate travel agency based in
Philadelphia, has been negotiating bulk purchases for clients for
about three years, with the clients putting up the money. However,
it turned down a bulk-purchase deal with Continental similar to
American Express', according to Patty McMenamin, a spokeswoman, who
said the company would be open to other offers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party to the transaction between American Express and
Continental would disclose the number of seats or the amount of
money involved, though both said it was a multimillion-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abernathy said the discount on the fares, estimated at 25 to
30 percent, was greater than what most of American Express'
corporate clients would be able to negotiate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The seats, in both first class and coach, will be sold mostly as
fully refundable unrestricted tickets to American Express'
corporate clients, according to Ms. Abernathy, although she said
some might be made available to the company's retail travel agency
network for sale to individuals. The seats will be on flights over
the next year that match the preferences of the company's corporate
customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which airline might be a candidate for similar deals in
the future, Ms. Abernathy said, ``Any time an airline gets into a
new market or expands in a market, they have to put a lot of
resources into building their presence. That would be one place to
look for another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Continental, which began code-sharing
with Virgin Atlantic in February and has been ``looking to broaden
awareness and availability of our new seats,'' said Dave Messing, a
Continental spokesman. The agreement between Continental and Virgin
Atlantic called for the airlines to buy seats on one another's
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Competition Report
</P>
<P>
   Though low-fare airlines served more markets around the country
last year than in 1996, fewer people had access to them, according
to a new study by the Department of Transportation. In 1997, 1,115
city pairs had ``competitive service'' _ defined as at least 10
percent of market share _ by carriers such as Southwest Airlines,
Tower Air, Vanguard Airlines and Airtran Airlines; in 1996 there
were 984. Yet the total number of passengers on those routes last
year was 120 million, down from 122.9 million in 1996. The reason
is that the low-fare carriers have been entering markets that are
traveled by 50 or fewer passengers a day, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, fares were lower in city pairs that had
competitive low-fare service, the department said. The differential
was greatest in short-haul markets. For example, average fares for
city pairs of between 251 and 500 miles without low-fare
competition were 121 percent higher than for those that did have
such competition. The study was part of the department's quarterly
report on domestic airline fares, covering the fourth quarter of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Airport in Asia
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, set to open July 6, may
be getting all the attention, but Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also
getting a new international airport, scheduled to begin operating
June 30. It is situated near Sepang, about 35 miles south of the
city, on a 39-square-mile site that allows for future expansion. In
the first phase, the airport will be able to handle 25 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   The main terminal, measuring 2.6 million square feet, will be
connected by an automated shuttle train to a satellite building for
international passengers. Express rail service from the city is
expected to begin in late 1999 or early 2000. Taxi fare is about
$18 and travel time about 45 minutes, depending on traffic.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pan Pacific Hotel is set to open Thursday at the airport.
It is linked to the main terminal by a walkway. The 450 guest rooms
will have fax machines, modem jacks and two phone lines. An
auditorium will seat 200; a ballroom will seat up to 1,000, and 10
meeting rooms can accommodate up to 360. The hotel will also have a
business center, video teleconferencing facilities, a health club
and pool. Regular rates start at around $110 a night, but the hotel
is planning to offer a 50 percent discount for the first three
months.

   MICROSOFT-RULING (Undated) A three-judge federal appeals court
ruled in favor of Microsoft Tuesday, throwing out a December
judge's order that barred the company from including its Internet
Explorer browser in Windows 95. The decision could make it harder
for the Justice Department and 20 states to win new, more sweeping
lawsuits filed in May. Those suits seek to force Microsoft to
remove its browsers from its new Windows 98 operating system
software, or offer a competing browser, such as Netscape
Communication Corp.'s Navigator. The 39-page appeals court decision
said Jackson exceeded his authority in issuing an injunction
against Microsoft. Microsoft stock shot up to nearly $100 a share.

   SURGERY-BLOODLESS (Seattle) Scientists at the University of
Washington and elsewhere are perfecting techniques that could one
day make bloodless``surgery'' possible using ultrasound waves,
without ever opening the body. Within a few years, doctors may be
able to use the technology to stop internal bleeding for patients
in remote locations, such as the mountains, or on the battlefield.
The ultrasound passes through the skin and other organs without
damaging them until it gets to the ``focal site'' where it heats
the tissue, cauterizing it. The technique is also already being
used in clinical trials to destroy tumors in the body without doing
incisions. The technology was the subject of talks here Tuesday at
the Acoustical Society of America Meeting, which has drawn
scientists from all over the world.

DAVIS REGISTERS AS PAKISTANI AGENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lanny Davis, the former White House special counsel
and presidential spokesman on campaign-finance matters, this week
registered as a foreign agent for the government of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by The Boston Globe last week, Davis began his work
for the Islamabad government shortly after leaving his White House
post in February. Davis, however, said he was not required to
register immediately as a foreign agent. Davis registered Monday
and distributed a copy of the registration to the news media
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's work comes at a time when White House officials are
making decisions about the relationship between the United States
and Pakistan. Pakistan and India recently conducted nuclear tests,
much to the dismay of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials who earn more than $110,000 a year are
prohibited after leaving from engaging immediately in lobbying
activities. Davis said he earned $100,000. He is now employed by
the Washington law firm of Patton Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said he was not trading on his work at the White
House, which mostly involved responding to allegations that Clinton
had evaded campaign-inance laws.

DIABETES ADS AIMED AT HISPANICS, OTHER MINORITIES, ARE LAUNCHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two U.S. health agencies launched a nationwide
campaign Tuesday alerting the 16 million Americans with diabetes,
including 1.2 million Hispanics, to the dangers of the disease,
which can lead to blindness, amputations, kidney failure, heart
trouble and death.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in announcing their National
Diabetes Education Program, urged all Americans with the disease to
control their blood-sugar levels.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and African Americans ``are on average almost twice as
likely to have diabetes as non-Hispanic whites of similar age,''
said Dr. Richard Eastman, director of the Division of Diabetes,
Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases at NIH.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped statement, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher
said that minorities ``experience higher rates of eye disease,
kidney disease, amputations and premature deaths'' because their
ailments often are untreated or inadequately treated.
</P>
<P>
   NIH and CDC released two public service ads Tuesday, one in
Spanish and English and one in English alone, that are being
broadcast on TV and radio and run in print media around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The ad aimed at Latinos shows an elderly Hispanic man who says,
``There are good days and bad days, but that's life. Having
diabetes has made me appreciate all of them. I realize the way I
feel depends entirely on the way I treat myself. There are many
things in life that can't be controlled. Fortunately, diabetes
isn't one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad in English alone shows people of many ethnic backgrounds
with diabetes. One says, ``I know it can lead to more serious
health problems.'' Another says, ``I know my blood-sugar numbers.''
A third says, ``I'm in charge of what I eat.'' And a fourth says,
``I get regular exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ads aimed at minorities other than Hispanics will be released
over the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said the campaign is a part of President Clinton's
initiative on race and is designed to ``eventually eliminate
disparities'' in the rates that different ethnic groups contract
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes is a disorder in which the body is unable to properly
process sugar. It is usually caused by a defective pancreas, which
is unable to produce the right amount of insulin, a hormone that
metabolizes sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Rowley, associate director for science at the CDC, said,
``Diabetes is serious, it's common, it's costly and it's
controllable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's campaign seeks to reach undiagnosed diabetics
through the ads as well as information provided to physicians
around the country, said an official of the diabetes education
program.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Elizabeth Furse, D-Ore., co-chair of the Congressional
Diabetes Caucus said federal funding for diabetes should be
increased. She noted that the proposed budget for the disease for
fiscal 1999, which begins Oct. 1, is $415 million, up from the
current $373 million.

YELTSIN TELLS PARLIAMENT TO APPROVE `ANTI-CRISIS' PLAN OR ELSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday summoned Russian
legislators to an unusual public meeting and demanded that they
enact a rash of measures to restore the confidence of foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary session was intended to impress the
International Monetary Fund, which is beginning negotiations over
billions of dollars in additional financing.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just a matter of political theater. Yeltsin
presented an ``anti-crisis'' plan to overhaul the tax system,
lay-off civil servants and slash government spending.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the specter of a fresh confrontation, Yeltsin insisted
that the Legislature approve the plan before it breaks for its
summer recess on July 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the package of bills in the government is not approved,''
Yeltsin warned ominously ``other measures will be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's threat to impose the measures by decree drew protests
from the Communist-opposition in the parliament, or Duma, as it is
called here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin performed his usual repertoire,'' said Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist leader. ``He opened the meeting, started
threatening the Duma, was rude, insulted us and then left.''
</P>
<P>
   The steps proposed Tuesday were designed to placate the IMF,
which has demanded that the Kremlin meet a series of tough demands
to qualify for billions of dollars in additional loans.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, deputy chairman of the IMF, has come to Moscow
for talks with top Russian officials, along with other Fund
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's plan addressed two of the IMF's concerns _ reforming
Russia's antiquated tax code and slashing its budget deficit. But
it was silent on the IMF's insistence that the government break up
Gazprom, the huge natural gas monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, who is representing the Russians in talks with
the IMF, said he expected the negotiations to take one or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall amount of the package should be in the range of
$10 billion to $15 billion,'' Chubais reiterated Tuesday. ``It is
too early to say what the share of the IMF will be in this.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's meeting took place in the White House, a mammoth
marble structure. Yeltsin ordered Russian tanks to pound the
building in 1993 when it was occupied by rebellious members of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But these days the White House is the administrative center for
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko and other top Yeltsin aides.
</P>
<P>
   Angry coal miners have set up a small squatters' camp outside to
protest months of waiting for their wages. They demonstrated as
black Mercedes, BMWs and Volga sedans with flashing blue lights
ferried legislators and Kremlin aides to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the well-appointed hall, the meeting was dominated by
Kiriyenko, who provided a catalog of the economy's ills. Reporters
watched from the balcony and Russian television broadcast
highlights of the session.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko noted that the flight of investors from emerging
markets and the decline in world oil prices had taken a heavy toll.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of putting all the blame on external factors or
nameless speculators, he acknowledged that the failure to impose
budget discipline and follow through on reform had made Russia
especially vulnerable to the global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriyenko described an economy that is groaning under a mountain
of short-term debt. Russia has been forced to sell treasury bills
at high interest rates to finance its budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's short-term debt is being redeemed at a rate of 31
billion rubles ($5 billion) a month, 1.4 times the federal
government's monthly revenue, Kiriyenko explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means that we are forced to borrow again in order to pay
back old debts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding more like a conservative American Republican than a
former member of the Communist youth league, Kiriyenko called for
easing corporate taxes and introducing a flat tax on income.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the deficit, the government has already called for
spending cuts totaling 42 billion rubles, or $6.8 billion. To
encourage investment in Russian enterprises, the government is
trying to drive down interest rates substantially, to about 20
percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on the parliament, which has been suspicious of
the IMF and shown little understanding of monetary policy. But
there is a palpable sense that Russia is in the midst of a genuine
crisis. That may help the Kremlin and the Legislature transcend
partisan posturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are confronted with the result of our indecisiveness
in carrying out reforms,'' Kiriyenko said. ``Russia's problems lie
not in Asia, but in Russia itself.''

FOR CENTURIES, THE GARDEN PATH HAS LED TO ADVENTURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In addition to providing intellectual and visual
pleasure, art exhibitions can engage the imagination the way
adventures do. ``Verdant Riches Revealed: A Selection From the
Treasures of the LuEsther T. Mertz Library at the New York
Botanical Garden,'' offers a case in point.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the 80 illustrated books, neatly arranged in
showcases at the Grolier Club in Manhattan, are a fine collection,
featuring botanical prints and early garden designs. But to proceed
along the exhibits slowly, reading the informative captions, is
like traveling, first to a medical school in Salerno in 1190, on to
the cargo hold of Captain Bligh's Bounty in 1792 and, eventually,
to the landscape at the Royal Pavilion at Brighton in 1808.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinating story of plants and their uses is marked by
scientific discoveries, sea voyages to explore distant countries,
commercial development, preservation in botanical gardens, and
finally the great wealth and intrigue that surrounded the
establishment of princely gardens. Rarely have plants appeared so
interesting as they do in this selection from the 250,000 volumes
in the New York Botanical Garden's Library, one of the premier
collections of books on botany, horticulture and garden design in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This exhibit, which runs through July 31, is occasioned by the
recent gift to the botanical garden of 400 rare books and prints on
the history of garden design donated by Elizabeth K. Reilley, a
90-year-old Long Island librarian and book collector.
</P>
<P>
   The show has also been arranged in part to celebrate the new
library building, now under construction, supported by a $6 million
grant from the LuEsther T. Mertz Charitable Trust. Although Mrs.
Mertz was a generous cultural benefactor of New York City (notably
the New York Shakespeare Festival), it is not generally known that
she was a trained librarian, and passionate about her own garden
and botanical science.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition turns on an important art historical footnote. It
was the introduction of the woodblock print in the 15th century
that made possible the use of illustrations to disseminate
scientific information. Previously, books were illustrated by hand
illumination with idealized versions of flowers and leaves; a 1483
edition of Pliny the Elder's ``History of Nature'' is an example on
view.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also demonstrates that botanical researchers
centuries ago were exploring the same questions that their
counterparts are today: the medicinal uses of plants, for example.
Matthaeus Palterius, the physician who taught at Salerno, kept his
list of plant nomenclature by hand, while Konrad von Megenberg's
``Book of Nature,'' printed in Augsburg in 1475, is credited with
publishing the first botanical prints for scientific rather than
ornamental purposes.
</P>
<P>
   As artists drew plants in increasingly realistic detail, books
about them, called herbals, became more authoritative, and
researchers' lists of plant terminology turned into early systems
of codification. Carolus Linnaeus' ``Species Plantarum,'' a
classification of 8,000 plants published in Stockholm in 1753, was
the culmination of those efforts and is a high point of the show.
</P>
<P>
   While the Linnaean system remains the most prevalent method of
categorizing plants, scientists are now developing a new
classification based on DNA studies. The computer printouts it
yields will never, however, compete with the sumptuous botanical
prints on view.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 16th century, explorers took to the seas to
gather plant specimens from around the world. The French friar
Charles Plumier produced 6,000 botanical drawings, like the passion
flower in the show, from his travels to the Caribbean; Linnaeus
later used them in his work. The Englishman William Bartram's
exploratory visit to the American South is represented by his
illustration of a Seminole chief who was his protector during a
sojourn in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Plants from distant lands were also being exploited for
commercial purposes, like the breadfruit seedlings that were
shipped from Tahiti to Jamaica to feed the slaves. One drawing
shows how the Bounty was outfitted with brackets for a thousand
potted plants. The ill-fated voyage ended with the breadfruit being
dumped overboard during the mutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The show also chronicles the evolution of garden design. ``The
Profitable Arte of Gardening,'' by Thomas Hill, from 1593,
contained the first woodcut of a garden published in England. A
trellised fence encloses patterned beds, and water was supplied by
a well on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Such simplified drawings were later replaced by detailed
depictions of gardens, complete with strolling courtiers, by
artists like Israel Silvestre at Versailles. (Elizabeth S. Eustis,
one of the show's curators, noted that Louis XIV's chief minister,
Jean Baptiste Colbert, regarded garden prints as a way to spread
the king's influence throughout Europe.)
</P>
<P>
   A print of a design for a cascade, with 600 levels, near Kassel,
Germany, is an example of extravagant garden style. The nobleman
Karl of Hesse began the project around 1700 but never completed it.
</P>
<P>
   The word horticulture, one learns, was first used in 1632 as the
title of a book by a German professor, Peter Lauremberg, who
presented etched designs for topiary shapes. And the magnolia,
illustrated in the show by one drawn in the Chelsea Physic Garden
in London in 1743, was named for the French botanist Pierre Magnol.

ITALY, UNDER MALDINI'S INSTINCTS, CONQUERS AUSTRIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ ``Caesar, reconquer Gaul,'' the
hand-painted sign said in Italian in the upper decks of the Stade
de France, an ultra-modern Caesar's Palace, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cesare Maldini moved a step closer to capturing France '98 by
guiding Italy to a 2-1 victory over Austria. At least, Maldini has
reconquered the hearts of Italians, deluded after six years of the
reign of Arrigo Sacchi, who many considered too arrogant to deserve
their approval.
</P>
<P>
   Maldini apparently has what might be luck, or just good coaching
instincts, and certainly a comfortable rapport with the fans,
media, and players.
</P>
<P>
   He has had the good sense to integrate the fantasy of both
Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero, to rejuvenate the team
with exciting performers such as Luigi Di Biagio and Francesco
Moriero, and the self-assurance to recall Giuseppe Bergomi.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those players had a major role in the victory which
clinched first place in Group B and set up a second-round meeting
with Norway in Marseille Saturday. Del Piero's free kick was headed
in by Christian Vieri four minutes into the second half, and Baggio
combined with Filippo Inzaghi for a 2-0 lead in the 89th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Andreas Herzog, a reserve who is considered Austria's best
player, scored a 92d-minute penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to talk about one player,'' Maldini said.
``When you have good players, they have to play. And when you have
good players, you can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maldini has been wise enough to find the right combination
of players. He appeared to have an unreasonable predilection for
Vieri in qualifying, but his faith has paid off as Vieri has scored
four goals, tied for the tournament lead with Gabriel Batistuta of
Argentina. And Maldini has complemented Vieri's strength with the
creative subtlety of Baggio and Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero, making his first World Cup start, displayed flashes
of brilliance in the first half but was treated roughly by the
Austrians. The Austrians required a victory to advance, but seldom
seemed threatening in attack.
</P>
<P>
   Italy played conservatively, yet still had more quality
opportunities as Del Piero constantly threatened. Vieri finally
scored with a header as Bergomi moved into the goal area and
goalkeeper Michael Konsel collided with Anton Polster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I've surprised anyone,'' Vieri said. ``I'm a
forward and I am supposed to score goals. I'm happy with the four
goals I have scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Inzaghi replaced Vieri early in the second half and Baggio
entered for Del Piero midway through. They combined with Moriero on
effective counterattacks, and Baggio dribbled past three defenders
and Konsel to nearly score a third goal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Austria seemed in as much disarray as it was in 1990,
when it was eliminated in the first round, then lost to the Faroe
Islands in European Championships qualifying. Polster, the
Austrians' leading scorer, departed in the 62d minute and headed
straight past coach Herbert Prohaska to the lockerroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed the coach took me out, I don't understand
the decision,'' Polster said.
</P>
<P>
   Maldini, though, seems in command of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sacchi, Maldini has the lasting respect of both players
and TIFOSI because he was a highly-regarded player in the 1960s. He
also has an empathetic feel for the current national team members
because he coached some of them on the junior level, and through
his son, Paolo, who is the team captain.
</P>
<P>
   His master stroke might have been to bring back Bergomi, the
34-year-old defender nicknamed ``Zio'' (``The Uncle'') who played
in Spain in 1982, the last time Italy won the World Cup. Bergomi
replaced Alessandro Nesta, who departed with tournament-ending knee
injury in the fourth minute, and performed more like a lively young
``Nipote'' (``Nephew'').
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't words to describe a player like Zio,'' Paolo
Maldini said. ``He is incredible.''

MOCK DRAFT 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. LA Clippers: Michael Olowokandi, C, Pacific. Too valuable to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   2. Vancouver: Paul Pierce, G-F, Kansas. Solves one glaring need.
</P>
<P>
   3. Denver: Mike Bibby, G, Arizona. Best point guard in the
draft.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toronto: Raef LaFrentz, Kansas. Solid player for a team in
need of solid players.
</P>
<P>
   5. Golden State: Antawn Jamison, F, North Carolina. Dynamic
player and even better person for team needing both.
</P>
<P>
   6. Dallas: Larry Hughes, G, St. Louis. Backcourt scorer to go
with Michael Finley.
</P>
<P>
   7. Sacramento: Vince Carter, G, North Carolina. Kings jump at
this guy as the heir apparent to Mitch Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   8. Philadelphia: Robert Traylor, F, Michigan. Derrick Coleman
wants to stay, knowing he has an eating companion.
</P>
<P>
   9. Milwaukee: Michael Doleac, C, Utah. Bucks need size in the
middle. He's the best center on the board.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boston: Pat Garrity, F, Notre Dame. OK, he's not Michael
Johnson. But Rick Pitino wants character and scoring, and Garrity
has both.
</P>
<P>
   11. Detroit: Nazr Mohammed, F-C, Kentucky. He can block shots
and play the post, two rarities in Motown.
</P>
<P>
   12. Orlando: Dirk Nowitzki, F-C, DJK Wurzberg. A possible steal
if Magic can get him to forsake Italy. Could also go to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   13. Orlando: Jason Williams, G, Florida. Talented point guard
with a blemished record.
</P>
<P>
   14. Houston: Michael Dickerson, G, Arizona. The rebuilding
starts here and now.
</P>
<P>
   15. Orlando: Bonzi Wells, G, Ball State. Best shooting guard on
the board.
</P>
<P>
   16. Houston: Radoslav Nesterovic, C, Kinder Bologna. Hakeem
isn't getting any younger.
</P>
<P>
   17. Minnesota: Keon Clark, C-F, UNLV. The latest in a long line
of All-Star Timberwolves centers.
</P>
<P>
   18. Houston: Rashard Lewis, F, Alief Elsik High, Texas. Local
prospect groomed by Charles Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   19. Milwaukee: Bryce Drew, G, Valparaiso. Good shooter and
Terrell Brandon insurance.
</P>
<P>
   20. Atlanta: Ruben Patterson, F, Cincinnati. Best available
Patterson.
</P>
<P>
   21. Charlotte: Casey Shaw, C, Toledo. Best American center
available, such as it is.
</P>
<P>
   22. LA Clippers: Al Harrington, St. Patrick's (N.J.) High. Why
not? He can be the Clips' Kobe.
</P>
<P>
   23. Denver: Tyronn Lue, G, Nebraska. Best point guard available
on a team that needs everything.
</P>
<P>
   24. San Antonio: Matt Harpring, F, Georgia Tech. Could help
Spurs' anemic outside game.
</P>
<P>
   25. Indiana: Corey Benjamin, G, Oregon State. It's all about the
Benjamins at this point.
</P>
<P>
   26. LA Lakers: Brian Skinner, F, Baylor. Jerry West hopes he has
another late bloomer.
</P>
<P>
   27. Seattle: Ricky Davis, G, Iowa. Young, spirited talent who
fits in well with Sonics' style.
</P>
<P>
   28. Chicago: Simon Dwight, F, Australia. Another Jerry Krause
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   29. Utah: Mirsad Turkcan, F, Efies Pilsen (Turkey). Good choice
here for a team that looks to remain intact.

MIDWEST CHALLENGE TO DAIRY COMPACT FAILS IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The dairy compact that sets milk prices in New
England withstood a House challenge Tuesday from Midwest dairy
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture appropriations bill being considered by the
House contains a provision that would extend for six months the
Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, which is scheduled to expire
April 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The extension would keep the compact through Sept. 30 next year,
the end of the fiscal year and the deadline for introduction of a
new federal milk pricing system.
</P>
<P>
   Two Wisconsin lawmakers, Representative Tom Petri, a Republican,
and David Obey, a Democrat, attempted to eliminate the extension
with separate amendments. Petri's amendment was struck down on a
parliamentary motion, and Obey's was defeated by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am delighted we were able to defeat this effort,'' said
Representative Bernard Sanders, a Vermont independent. ``It is a
sad state of affairs that we are fighting each other when we should
be working together. ... There should be a commitment to preserving
family farms all across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The extension measure stirred regional rivalries, with New
Englanders rallying behind the plan and Midwesterners lining up
against it, regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, broke the
regional unity to oppose the compact, which he said violates
free-market principles. During Tuesday's debate, he said Sanders,
the former Socialist mayor of Burlington, was being consistent with
his position, but Republican supporters were at odds with the GOP's
traditional support for unregulated markets.
</P>
<P>
   The compact sets milk prices in the six-state region at a level
slightly higher than the rate set by the federal government.
Supporters of the compact say it helps to preserve regional dairy
farmers, open space and fresher milk for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say it hurts consumers in New England by raising the
price of milk and dairy interests in other parts of the country by
blocking them from the market. National dairy firms have been
financing a lobbying campaign to block regional cartels that could
undermine national pricing policies. Southern states are
considering establishing a similar compact.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department regulates the price of milk for
different sections of the country. Under the current system, the
price of milk in the Midwest, a major dairy area, is the nation's
lowest, a sore point for Midwestern dairy interests.

N.H. COURT DECLARES SCHOOL FUNDING PLAN UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The New Hampshire Supreme Court Tuesday
unanimously ruled that Governor Jeanne Shaheen's plan to fund
public schools is unconstitutional, finding that her plan to rely
on a package of sin taxes failed to equalize tax rates between
wealthy and poor towns in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The court gave the governor and Legislature until April 1999 to
come up with another solution. Its advisory opinion Tuesday raised
the specter that New Hampshire might have to give up its status as
the only state never to have enacted a broad-based sales or income
tax.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen had crafted her plan, known as Advancing Better
Classrooms (ABC), in response to the court's December finding that
the state's reliance on local property taxes to fund public schools
has resulted in unconstitutional disparities in tax rates and
educational opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan avoids a property tax system that transfers wealth from
rich towns to poor ones. It calls for using increased state revenue
from taxes on cigarettes and video poker gambling to provide state
aid and tax relief to poor towns.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen argued that this approach would avoid social and
economic unrest. But the court rejected that argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``That all three branches of government must struggle with
difficult decisions which may cause social unrest cannot be a
factor in the court's constitutional review of the bill,'' the
judges wrote in Tuesday's ruling. ``It should not be forgotten that
New Hampshire is not a random collection of isolated cities and
towns. Indeed, all of us live in a single state. The benefits of
adequately educated children are shared statewide and are not
limited to a particular town or district.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics say it was no surprise that the court found her plan
flawed since it leaves rich towns paying tax rates that are in some
cases 15 times lower than rates in poor towns. The education
property tax rate in towns with no children in public schools would
be zero under Shaheen's plan, a few dollars per $1,000 valuation in
towns with power plants or shopping malls, and up to $15 in
property-poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read as a whole, the Supreme Court opinion makes very clear
that the taxing scheme of the ABC plan is not only unconstitutional
but akin to some of the oppressive tax policies of the British
Crown in the 1770s,'' said Thomas Connair, a former school board
member from the property-poor town of Claremont and one of the
lawyers who brought the initial 1993 school funding suit that led
to the court ruling in December.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Shaheen's plan also said any further support for
her plan in the wake of the ruling would simply be a stall to avoid
controversy until after the November election. Shaheen is running
for reelection this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeanne Shaheen's lack of leadership on this issue has put us
back to square one,'' said Republican gubernatorial candidate Fred
Bramante. Bramante is making his third attempt to sell the
Legislature and voters on a statewide property tax that would
equalize education funding.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, however, seemed non-plussed by the ruling and
interpreted it as a request to provide the court with more
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the court's advisory opinion clearly and
unequivocally states that abatements (like those already granted
veterans and the elderly) and exemptions are constitutional,''
Shaheen said. ``I think it gives us an opportunity to continue to
provide a solution through the ABC plan.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Shaheen said her administration may hire economists to help
convince the court that the abatements requested for entire
communities under her plan are likewise justified because they
would prevent economic warfare between rich and poor towns.
</P>
<P>
   The state's legislative leaders, Senate President Joseph
Delahunty and House Speaker Donna Sytek, both found Shaheen's
optimism unfounded. They agreed that the most likely scenario calls
for holding a special legislative session in September to cope with
the dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I have to say that I disagree with the governor when she
characterizes it as an opportunity. I view it as an obstacle,''
Sytek said of the opinion. ``It appears less and less likely that
we will be able to fix this in the remaining days of the
Legislature,'' which adjourns June 30 until December.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Jim Rubens, another Republican candidate for
governor, also lost in court Tuesday. The judges found his modest
state aid plan, which would have left most of the current tax
system in place, also unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Shaheen and the Republicans running against her in the fall
agree on one thing. New Hampshire voters do not want an income or
sales tax, and none of the candidates want to become the elected
officials who give voters one.
</P>
<P>
   Rubens said the court's action will only increase support for a
constitutional amendment that would strip the court of power over
school issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling is nothing more than an order for a broad base tax
in this state,'' said Rubens.

`NEW FOUND LANDS': HISTORY OF MAPS IS FLAWED BY ILLUSTRATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of the review) 
(ja) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the differences between the West and other parts of the
world, and one of the reasons for the global spread of Western
power, is that Europeans inscribed their knowledge on maps while
others didn't. Or, as Peter Whitfield, the author of several books
on the history of maps, puts it: ``Men in Seville, Amsterdam, or
London had access to knowledge of Mexico, India, Canada or Brazil,
while the native peoples knew only their own immediate
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``New Found Lands: Maps in the History of
Exploration,'' Whitfield writes a history of the way in which
knowledge of the world became ``recorded, permanent, and above all
centralized into one systematic view of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield begins in the ancient world, especially with the work
of Ptolemy of Alexandria, whose second century A.D. world gazetteer
``brought huge tracts of Europe, Asia and Northern Africa into the
sphere of Greek knowledge.'' He ends with a chapter on high-tech
mappings of the Earth, the sea beds and other planets. But the bulk
of the work concentrates on the classic age of exploration, from
the Renaissance until the 19th century, when the world, so much a
matter of fanciful speculation, came to be expressed in Europe as
lines, drawings and words on pieces of paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield faced something of a technical problem in formulating
this book. He needed to survey the actual history of exploration to
provide the background to his major theme, the codification of
exploration in maps. But the survey of exploration takes up so much
space that the main theme seems to get short shrift. Moreover,
while the dozens of beautifully reproduced maps included in these
pages give ``New Found Lands'' a gorgeous, coffee-table-book
appearance, the illustrations, with all too brief captions, are
rarely placed on or opposite the pages where Whitfield discusses
them. This gives the book a disorganized quality very much in
contrast to Whitfield's precise text.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the map reproductions themselves are difficult to
read, the print being small and often not in English. One
understands Whitfield's point: that the history of map making is a
history of a very slow approach to geographical accuracy. But his
book is more an encyclopedic survey of material already known _ the
activities and exploits of the explorers _ than a close and
illuminating study of the maps that those activities and exploits
produced.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's main story begins with the voyages of Marco Polo and
the excitement that the Italian merchant's exotic travels generated
throughout Europe. Here, the author retells the familiar story of
the quest for a sea route to Cathay, covering the Portuguese
expeditions around Africa, Columbus' accidental encounter with
America, the early circumnavigations of the globe. Whitfield,
trying always to understand the spirit that motivated his
explorers, is unsentimental about these Renaissance figures. They
were uninterested in geographic knowledge itself; they aimed at
trade and plunder. It was unintentional that they produced a
revolution in geographical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield is at his best when he discusses the cartographic
landmarks produced by the new knowledge. In 1502, for example, the
Cantino global chart, drawn by an Italian diplomat named Alberto
Cantino from Portuguese sources and smuggled out of Portugal,
``mapped with startling accuracy'' the Indian peninsula, Brazil,
Newfoundland and the coast of Africa. ``The Cantino chart,''
Whitfield notes, ``is a celebration of Portuguese Africa, with the
Portuguese flags defending its coast, and the fort of El Mina
pictured like a huge Renaissance city dominating Guinea.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, only two portions of the Cantino chart are reproduced
in Whitfield's book, one five pages before the author's description
of it and one 14 pages after it, leaving the reader to flip back
and forth from map to text to map. Similarly, a detail from the
famous Waldseemuller World Map of 1507 is printed eight pages
before Whitfield's account of it. Martin Waldseemuller, a humanist
scholar at the court of the Duke of Lorraine, based his charts on
Amerigo Vespucci's narratives of his ``New World'' explorations. He
combined ``the `Old World' of Ptolemy, updated with the Portuguese
map of Africa, with the `New World' now revealed by Vespucci.'' (It
was Waldseemuller who named America after Vespucci.)
</P>
<P>
   This 1507 map, Whitfield reminds us, is ``one of the most
intriguing and enigmatic in the history of cartography.''
Waldseemuller showed North America to be separate from Asia, with a
sea between the two continents and mountains on the American West
coast, although as of 1507 no European had penetrated the American
West or Northwest coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's illustrations show how long it sometimes took for
the Renaissance maps to approximate the outlines of maps that we
use today. After Ferdinand Magellan's historic circumnavigation of
the world demonstrated that the sea between the Americas and Asia
was the world's largest body of water, it still took some time for
map makers to appreciate just how large that body of water is. In
part this had to do with the difficulty of approximating longitude,
a problem not solved until more than 200 years after Magellan. The
first map that indicated the true extent of the Pacific was a world
chart of 1529 by Diego Ribero, a Portuguese who, like Magellan, was
working for Spain. It was the only 16th-century map that did not
show China and Japan a short distance from the American West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   As is so often the case in this book, the reproduction of the
Ribero map is several pages from Whitfield's description of it, and
the lettering is so small and faint that much of it is impossible
to read. Still, the point of it _ drawing ships in the vast, empty
space between America and Asia _ comes across. Whitfield's main
subject is so inherently fascinating that one feels frustrated that
he does not explore it more fully, even as one is grateful to him
for the lucid, if brief, presentations he does make.

   MICROSOFT-SUIT (Washington) _ A U.S. Appeals Court overturns a
lower court order against Microsoft Corp. in an opinion that also
undercuts a central argument of the government's new antitrust suit
against the software giant. By Joel Brinkley.
</P>
<P>
   With: MICROSOFT-ASSESS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS-REPORT (Geneva) _ AIDS infection rates worldwide are far
worse than previously believed, particularly in parts of Africa
where as many as one in four adults has the virus, according to a
U.N. report. By Lawrence K. Altman. With graphic. 1,700 words.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CLINTON (Beijing) _ At home, President Clinton's fortunes
may wax and wane, but here, on the eve of his first state visit to
China, he is already a star. Not only in the official press but
also among elements of the intelligentsia, he is being lionized as
a great statesman who had the wisdom to change his mind about China
_ turning from his early attack stance to his current policy of
engagement. Clinton's great global vision, it seems, ranks him
right up there with that all-time great strategist, Richard Nixon,
who will ever be revered here for reviving ties between the United
States and China. By Erik Eckholm. (The story has moved)
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-ALBANIANS (Klina, Serbia) _ The gong of church bells
summoned the Serbs up to the weed-choked cemetery with its ancient
stone crosses, marble tombs etched with the faces of the departed,
crooked iron gates and gnarled trees. During the tolling, the open
coffin of Oliver Zaic, 17, his face waxy with the pallor of death,
was carried through the dusty streets, lifted through a hole in the
cemetery fence and borne up the steep hill. He was killed in his
garden, his family said, as he tried to protect his widowed mother
and 10-year-old sister Marica from ethnic Albanian rebels who in
recent days have begun to attack and kidnap Serbian civilians in an
apparent effort to drive them out of their villages in the
overwhelmingly Albanian province of Kosovo. By Chris Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-MISSILES (Washington) _ A Clinton administration official
told lawmakers scrutinizing the possible transfer of missile
technology to China today that the Justice Department is
investigating a second incident in which a satellite company shared
information with the Chinese without prior authorization. By Eric
Schmitt. (Eds.: this is an early summary from wires)
</P>
<P>
   HOG-fACTORIES (Lennox, S.D.) _ The rapid growth of big hog
factories has emerged as perhaps the most contentious issue in the
nation's countryside. Besides driving out small farmers, these
plants with thousands of hogs crowded in small pens _ a practice
known as confinement _ create an almost unbearable stench for
nearby small towns and can threaten groundwater. About a dozen
states are debating laws to curb the big hog plants, including a
South Dakota initiative on the fall ballot that would effectively
outlaw corporate livestock production. By Dirk Johnson. With
graphic. 1,500 words.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-TAX-BREAK (Washington) _ How an obscure tax break for
wealthy heirs got into law by mistake and why Congress is expected
to sidestep a chance to repeal it. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   With: CONGRESS-IRS (Washington) _ Republican leaders appear
likely to cut the holding period for investors to get favorable
capital gains tax rates by pushing the measure onto a bipartisan
bill overhauling the IRS. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   NEW YORK _ Lucy, voluble as always, is at boarding school these
days; the pressure to become a Princetonian seems irresistible.
Alexis is pretty serious about becoming a marine biologist. And
Luis, no longer homeless but charismatic as ever, has left the
Latin Kings gang in Milwaukee but will soon star as a gang member
onstage in a Victory Memorial Church production.
</P>
<P>
   They are seven years older now, and they're back. That
demographically correct band who became America's darlings in 1991
has returned in a second installment of the documentary series that
is following the lives of 16 children from age 7 through adulthood.
It will be broadcast for 90 minutes as ``14 Up in America'' on
Sunday night on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series has no beginning, middle or end,'' said Phil
Joanou, the director. ``I like that the project lacks inherent
dramatic structure. It's just life. The drama is in how all these
lives will turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   The American series is based, of course, on the groundbreaking
British documentary that has tracked 14 English children for the
last 35 years as they have segued through school, college, jobs,
marriage, children, success, failure, euphoria and agita.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``a unique longitudinal, psychological and social history
that defies broad definition,'' said the executive producer of the
series, Michael Apted, the English filmmaker who, in 1964, produced
the first of the highly praised ``7 Up'' documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   The documentaries have proliferated across the globe: After the
American version was filmed in 1990, Apted set loose a Russian
documentary crew that filmed 7-year-olds in Russia. That team has
just completed its own version of ``14 Up.'' Subsequently, versions
of ``7 Up'' were started in South Africa, Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Apted, gray-haired, tweedy and avuncular at 57, first filmed his
group of English youngsters when they were 7 and he was 22, then
visited them again when they were 14, 21, 28 and 35. The newest
installment, ``42 Up,'' will be broadcast on the BBC next month.
</P>
<P>
   The series is ``a mix of instant history, sociology and soap
opera,'' Apted said. ``It's either a great Victorian novel, or a
fascinating invasion of people's privacy. It depends on how you
look at it.'' The American version is following the master script.
Joanou interviewed more than 20 7-year-old boys and girls from
disparate ethnic, racial, economic and social backgrounds in New
York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Lincoln, Neb., and Dublin, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the children had well-off parents; six were poor,
including one, Luis, from a homeless family; the rest had
middle-class backgrounds. The group includes children who are
Asian, black, Hispanic and white.
</P>
<P>
   In ``7 Up,'' three Manhattan second graders, Lucy, Alexis and
Kate, were filmed in the elite precincts of the Nightingale-Bamford
School in Manhattan. They wore pressed uniforms and crisp white
blouses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lucy and Alexis _ who, like the other subjects of ``14
Up,'' are identified only by first names in the documentary and who
spoke on the condition that their last names not be published _
were being casual at Sofia, a Madison Avenue pizza hangout in the
independent-school zone on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   They have become minor celebrities not only in their schools but
also as far away as Paris, ``where someone came up to me and said,
`I've seen you on TV,''' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate, who couldn't get to Sofia but was interviewed later, said,
``A baby sitter I hadn't seen in years called me when she saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis said, ``When the film comes out, it's sort of a home
video, but it's played for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy shook her head and said: ``I see what a spoiled brat I was
at age 7. I kept babbling on, and wouldn't let anyone speak.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls lost touch with one another as they changed schools
through the years. ``When I entered the interview room, it was
weird to see Lucy and Alexis again,'' said Kate, 15. ``At first I
was expecting them to be 7.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth grade Alexis transferred to the Chapin School in
Manhattan, which she termed ``intensely competitive.'' Lucy and her
parents moved to Long Island, and in the 10th grade she began
attending Lawrenceville, the New Jersey boarding school, where she
skipped a grade. ``Lawrenceville is totally pro-Princeton, so of
course I want to go there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kate's parents divorced a year ago, and she, her mother and two
sisters have moved to Westchester County. Currently Kate, who
volunteered in a Manhattan women's shelter when she was 7, is
interested in being a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   For Luis, ``right now the church is my life,'' he said. He was
originally filmed in Manhattan in Public School 97 on East Houston
Street, when he was attending school there while his family lived
in a shelter on the Lower East Side. At 7 he had huge, canny eyes
and streetwise indomitability; these days he is a rangy ninth
grader, a running back on his Milwaukee high school football team,
the South Division Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   His current ambition ``is to be the pastor of a church,'' said
Luis, who prefers being called Tony these days. He said of the
documentary series: ``It's nice to feel like a movie star for a
while. When you're in the ghetto, you're not paid too much
attention, and when they did this video, it said they actually
cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Apted said the original, British ``7 Up'' in 1964 ``was an
accident, a one-shot.'' Its immense popularity gave him ``the idea
to go back at seven-year intervals,'' said Apted, who has directed
feature films ranging from ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' (1980), with
Sissy Spacek, and ``Gorillas in the Mist'' (1988), with Sigourney
Weaver, to ``Nell'' (1994), with Jodie Foster, and ``Extreme
Measures'' (1996), with Gene Hackman.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The film that recommended Joanou to Apted was the documentary
``U2: Rattle and Hum'' (1988). Joanou (whose name is pronounced
joe-ON-oh) was the director of ``State of Grace'' (1990), with Sean
Penn; ``Final Analysis'' (1992), with Richard Gere, and ``Heaven's
Prisoners'' (1996), with Alec Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   The American series is ultimately intended for theatrical
release in 2012, when its subjects are 28, following the pattern of
the English series. Until then, an installment is to appear every
seven years as a television special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am struck with how savvy and worldly-wise the American
14-year-olds are,'' Apted said. ``My English children were a bit
more innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   The original English series has focused on the disparities of
the English class system, as played out in the children's lives.
Joanou said his subjects ``are not as class-bound as the English,
or at least not as aware of class boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They see themselves as equal. In our country there
are strong economic boundaries to opportunity, but the kids don't
see them. That's positive for them, but it's also disturbing for
the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   To a reporter who interviewed the ``Up'' youngsters when they
were 7, it is clear that their lives have been transformed by fate
and the meander of time. But their personalities seem fixed _
blurred pictures that are slowly developing before the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lives are unpredictable, but I'm inclined to think that
their core personality doesn't change,'' Apted said.
</P>
<P>
   To Joanou, ``it is the most important project in my life,'' he
said. ``There is nothing else like it for a documentarian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible not to reflect on where you were seven years
ago,''he said. ``Then, the kids were waist high, and now they're
taller than me. I'm 36. Now I have gray hairs, and a little less on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   For Apted, the project is equally consuming. ``Without being
nauseating about it, they are very much like a family,'' he said,
``and our lives are interwoven whether we like it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``14 Up'' bunch has found growth to be a painful process.
``At 7 I thought I knew everything, I was so confident of what I
had to say,'' Lucy said. ``Now I'm not so sure if I'm right. I
guess now we're facing the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis said she was ``more aware of being better off and the
advantages it gives you,'' adding: ``But you can have a whole lot
of money and just slack off. It may sound retarded to say this, but
I believe we all have the same chance of succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   They are quite aware of the documentary process, and at times
are annoyed by it. ``I feel I was stereotyped as some kind of Upper
East Side rich snob,'' Kate said.
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I don't think that the five minutes they give you
tells anything. It's not a portrayal of the real me. And I don't
know what you can learn about a whole generation from 17 kids. I
had mixed feelings about being in the film again. But they said
that everyone else is doing it, so I felt pressured to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group ``is supposed to represent our generation,'' Lucy
agreed, ``but we're so much more than what you see on screen. And
of course they have to ask us questions like `Are you having sex?'
I mean, puh-lease! The interview went on so long I began giggling
and couldn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Luis said he ``took the questions like a test'' in the film
interview, and ``I answered them with truth; I don't know if I
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The American teen-agers say they intend to participate in the
next round, at age 21. ``It's risky,'' Lucy said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis interrupted: ``But it's a cool risk. At least people will
know that you were alive. We'll leave something behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy smiled. ``I feel we're part of an experiment,'' she said,
``but I think we're taking over the experiment. I'm already making
plans to be hyper and outgoing at 21, versus depressed and solemn
at 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Deadpan, Alexis said: ``Absolutely. I'm working on my wardrobe
for age 21.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to come to the aid of some of the children who
are struggling, Joanou said. ``We feel protective of them, but we
can't help them,'' he said. ``We have to remain objective, and show
the truth that we see. We have to let their lives unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   As the years go by, Joanou said, ``sadly, it's not impossible
that there will be tragedy.'' He added, ``Life throws a lot of
curveballs, and no one gets out alive.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the destiny of his subjects? ``It's a cliffhanger,'' he
said. ``Stay tuned for 2005.''

EXPLORING THE DREAM AND THE DRIVE: TO MOVE UP  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The American dream is about rise and fall and evolution,''
Anthony Geffen said from his London office. ``It's true that as an
outsider you tend to assume there's a lack of meritocracy in
America. But after a while, you realize that there is a kind of
hierarchy that evolves, based not on your family but more on money
_ and the power it wields.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Stories: The American Dream,'' he traces this
evolution through 3 generations of 10 families in their quest for
betterment. Produced by Geffen and his company, Atlantic
Productions, and directed by Richard Bradley, the five-part
documentary, to be shown in its entirety on the Discovery Channel
on Saturday from 6 to 11 p.m., uses oral testimony, archival
footage and personal photographs to examine the yearnings and
expectations, the achievements and the disappointments that have
shaped the national psyche.
</P>
<P>
   The series is built around several events in modern American
history: the Depression, World War II, the civil rights movement,
the student protests of the 1960s and the Reagan era. The result is
an account of the rise _ and, some say, the fall _ of the American
dream since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, Geffen and his crew discussed the
documentary's focus with academics and writers, and then
interviewed some 17,000 families across the country, consulting
with churches and unions to find ``ordinary Americans that had
powerful stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   They ultimately narrowed their search to 10 families whose lives
encapsulated the spirit and scope of the story: people like Dick
Manoff, the son of Russian immigrants who rose from the poverty of
the Lower East Side of Manhattan to become a Madison Avenue
advertising executive; John Gage, a student radical and Vietnam
protester who became an Internet pioneer; Jewell Blankenship, a
refugee from the Dust Bowl whose journey to California in the 1930s
had the trappings of Steinbeck's ``Grapes of Wrath''; Joe Mifsud, a
Maltese sailor who arrived in America in 1927, helped build the
first Model T's in Ford's Detroit plant and became a union
campaigner; Alfredo Vea, the son of a migrant laborer who was
reared by his grandmother in poverty, drafted for Vietnam and is
now a lawyer for immigrants' rights, and General (his real first
name) Baker, who moved from a shack in the Deep South, where he
worked in service for a white family, to Detroit, where he worked
alongside Mifsud on a Ford production line.
</P>
<P>
   That an Englishman should mastermind such a series doesn't seem
ironic to Geffen, who also produced ``The Promised Land,'' a 1995
documentary that traced the migration of five million Southern
blacks to Northern cities.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from the outside was a special thing, he said:
``Repeatedly, the typical response was, `My God, we couldn't have
said this to anybody who was American.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Toni Peabody, whose life as the wife of the Massachusetts
Governor Endicott (Chub) Peabody II, who died last December, was
among those examined, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What came out of this was that Chub spoke about his life in
the most truthful, wonderful way,'' she said. ``He would have never
opened up like that to anyone else.''

     RECALL RAISES QUESTIONS OVER SPEED OF FDA DRUG
APPROVALS
 &HT;     By JEFF NESMITH 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Food and Drug Administration, under fire a
decade ago for moving too slowly to get potentially life-saving
medicines approved for sick Americans, is now being criticized from
the opposite direction: for allowing unsafe medicines to reach
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency announced Monday that the maker of Duract, a popular
prescription pain reliever, was withdrawing the drug because of
reports linking it to an expected high incidence of liver damage.
It was the third recall of an approved prescription drug in the
past nine months.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said it had learned of four patients who died and eight
others who have had to undergo liver transplants after taking
Duract, which the agency licensed slightly more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Duract, known generically as bromfenac, belongs to a class of
medicines known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories. A comparable
drug is ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   At the time the Duract was licensed, clinical trials had
revealed an elevation in enzymes associated with liver failure, and
its recommended use was limited to no more than 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are generally free to prescribe drugs ``off label'' and
ignore such recommendations once the substance is licensed by FDA.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials and the manufacturer, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories of
St. Davids, Pa., said that among the more than 2.5 million
prescriptions of the drug written since last September, when it
went on the market, many were for more than the 10-day limit.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst officials, in a letter to doctors and druggists
recommending discontinued use of the drug, said all but one of the
12 known cases of liver failure involved use beyond the 10-day
period.
</P>
<P>
   The ``voluntary withdrawal,'' result of an agreement between
Wyeth-Ayerst and FDA, marked the third time in the last nine months
that prescription drugs have been withdrawn. Posicor, a
hypertension medication, was withdrawn June 8 and the diet drug
Redux _ also marketed by Wyeth-Ayerst _ was pulled from druggists'
shelves last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drug (Duract) should never have been approved in the
first place,'' said Thomas J. Moore of the Center for Health Policy
Research at George Washington University. ``Here was a drug that
was shown in its clinical testing to be comparable to ibuprofen,
with the exception of its toxicity to the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who co-authored an article in the May 20 issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association calling for creation of
a national office of drug safety to monitor approved
pharmaceuticals, said FDA was forced to accelerate its review and
approval of proposed new drugs as a result of lobbying by the
pharmaceutical industry in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the industry-funded Center for the Study of Drug
Development at Tufts University in Boston show that after Congress
passed the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992, the FDA reduced
by more than half the time it requires to approve a typical
application for a new drug license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharma launched a massive lobbying campaign in the 1980s,''
said Moore. ``They spent a very large amount of money and it was a
very effective campaign. The question became, `How quickly can you
approve a drug?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're not stamping passports here. Approval of a
prescription drug is one of the most complex and important
scientific judgments that we make in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore and others, including medical school researchers Curt
Furberg of Bowman Gray College of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C.,
and Bruce M. Psaty(cq) of the University of Washington in Seattle,
have argued that the FDA has been pushed too far from its
once-criticized slow action on drug evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Moore also questioned why FDA would approve Duract, sometimes
described as a ``me too'' drug because of its similarity to
ibuprofen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like marketing a car and saying that if you drive it
more than 35 miles an hour it will kill you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He might have pushed the analogy further and said the car would
cost $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of 100 Duract pills costs about $103, according to
estimates in industry trade publications when the drug was
released.
</P>
<P>
   A bottle of 100 ibuprofen caplets _ marketed as Advil by
Wyeth-Ayerst's parent company, American Home Products Corp. _ costs
about $10.

   DAKAR, Senegal _ This West African capital has been throbbing
for years with nightclubs. Walls are pasted with concert posters,
and street merchants peddling cassettes can talk knowledgeably
about musicians from across the region.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that any taxi driver can point to a landmark
on the the city's corniche, or seaside road: the home of Youssou
N'Dour, one of the world's best-known African singers.
</P>
<P>
   He composed the theme song for the World Cup soccer tournament
in France. His bluesy ode to the sport may not be his finest work,
but, said Ken Braun of Stern's Music, a specialist record company
in New York, ``it really seals his reputation as  &UR; the &LR;  African star
in the eyes and ears of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   N'Dour's house is a modern structure overlooking the Atlantic
Ocean. Inside, the banisters are decorated with bass clefs, and
there is a 53-inch television in the living room. It hardly looks
like the site for a musical revolution. Still, if N'Dour has his
way, the latest addition to his home could help transform West
Africa's music scene. In an airy room around the back, on hardwood
floors under a mosaic dome, he has just opened a state-of-the-art
recording studio.
</P>
<P>
   It cost him about $300,000 to build, and N'Dour stands to profit
by recording local talent and attracting Western performers eager
to collaborate with African musicians. But that's not the point.
His goal, he said, is to stop the tide of African musicians who
have abandoned the continent for the United States and Europe by
offering them a world-class studio at home, at prices way below
those in New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to work in your country,'' N'Dour said in
his living room recently. ``The work, the friends, that reality is
reflected in our music. It's important to record this music here.''
</P>
<P>
   Other well-known African musicians, like Papa Wemba from the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Ismael Lo of Senegal, have settled
in Paris, setting up dual careers making popular Western recordings
and, more rarely, authentic African ones. Although N'Dour also
records many albums abroad, he has become a local hero for
insisting on living in Dakar and spending as little time as
possible elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   His smile advertises Colgate toothpaste on billboards around
town, no caption needed, and most weekends he performs downtown in
his own nightclub, which he said he enjoys more than his overseas
concerts. ``The audiences know what we're talking about, they feel
the music,'' he said. ``The international audiences just get the
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, however, N'Dour, at 38, has become an idol for
a new generation of African musicians. After recording the hit
``Shaking the Tree'' with Peter Gabriel in the mid-1980s, N'Dour
became the first Senegalese musician to break out of the local
scene. His biggest hit, ``Seven Seconds'' _ which mixed English,
French, and Wolof, a Senegalese language _ topped the European
charts two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Dakar's music in the future looks as if it might be very
different from the African percussive rhythms that have made
N'Dour's dance songs so successful. The generation born in this
burgeoning city since Senegal gained independence from France in
1960 has cut its ties to the rural villages that N'Dour sings about
and holds none of his romantic affection for them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the youth of Dakar owe as much of their musical tastes to
the South Bronx as to N'Dour's cherished Dakar. Scores of would-be
rap singers barely out of high school have begun recording angry
lyrics in French and Wolof on makeshift machines and selling out
concerts in school halls and clubs. Mimicking the Americans they
see on television and in movies, they have even created a Dakar
form of jive.
</P>
<P>
   Hyperson, the small recording studio for Dakar's most popular
rap group, Positive Black Soul, has become a magnet for groupies
dressed in baggy jeans and baseball caps turned backward. Sometimes
during the day the thumping bass emanating from the building
competes with wailing Islamic chants from the open-air mosque
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   For now, N'Dour is thrilled at Dakar's change in musical
direction. ``It's a direct reaction to the world, which looks at
Africa as being all about jungles and wildlife tourism,'' he said.
As such, Dakar's rap music might allow African musicians to break
out of their traditional mold, said N'Dour.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Boubacar, helps manage his business affairs and has
begun promoting young rappers. Whether the West will accept such
music is another matter. Positive Black Soul's first U.S. concert
is scheduled for Central Park's Summerstage on Aug. 2. A few other
Senegalese rappers are finding audiences in Europe, where ``people
are far more tolerant of foreign languages,'' said Braun of Stern's
Music.
</P>
<P>
   But the appeal is limited, Braun added. ``In America, people
want to hear English, and if these kids sing in English it comes
out sounding false.''
</P>
<P>
   N'Dour maintains that, ultimately, the most important thing is
to create music at home. ``My generation began playing roots
music,'' he said. `It was very, very different. But it was just 20
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If any of Dakar's young rappers are to enjoy N'Dour's worldwide
success, they will have to overcome their imitative Western style,
which hurts their chances. But for those who do make it, there is
now a place for them to record their music, right here in N'Dour's
home.

`I WENT DOWN': CAVORTING IN IRISH GANGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fresh out of prison, having served time for someone else's
crime, laconic Git Hynes (Peter McDonald, a quietly
attention-getting newcomer) finds himself in new trouble and the
beguilingly bad company of Bunny Kelly (Brendan Gleeson). Bunny is
a great big baby of a gangster, as memorable for his sweet tooth as
for his wildly unhelpful instructions to Git on how to use a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Bunny is also the sort to pull into a gas station and face the
embarrassment of not being able to open the tank of his stolen car.
As played with boisterous flamboyance by Gleeson, whose starring
performance in ``The General'' was one of the brighter lights at
this year's Cannes International Film Festival, Bunny is garrulous,
colorful and wrongheaded, a character with a capital C.
</P>
<P>
   When Git unwittingly hurts the henchman of a Dublin crime boss
named Tom French (Tony Doyle), he finds himself roped into teamwork
with Bunny in ``I Went Down,'' a convoluted but droll, sharply
etched story of an Irish gangland feud. Beyond the facts that both
have been ditched by the women in their lives and both are under
the thumb of Tom French, these two reluctant partners have little
in common.
</P>
<P>
   But they get to know and influence each other during the course
of this tartly written movie, which has proved to be Ireland's most
successful independent film. ``I Went Down'' owes much of its
novelty to steering clear of Irish movie stereotypes and instead
showing off a spare and quizzical indie spirit.
</P>
<P>
   As directed by Paddy Breathnach and written by Conor McPherson,
``I Went Down'' is essentially a four-man comedy of errors with a
rueful twist. The fourth principal is Frank Grogan (Peter Caffrey),
whom Tom French wants to find in the worst way. The many grievances
between Tom and Frank include lost loot and (in a film full of
sheepish, cuckolded male characters) Frank's affair with Tom's
wife. ``Did you ever make love to a gangster's wife?'' Frank asks
somewhat rhetorically. ``You can't really enjoy yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The story's main plot device is sending Bunny and Git off to
find Frank, but ``I Went Down'' is too deliberately knotty to let
any such mission have an easy outcome. Instead, the four characters
cross paths and swap small talk that remains interesting even when
it's not easily comprehended.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that's a matter of McPherson's ever-piquant dialogue.
(``No goods, no black pudding,'' remarks Bunny. ``I think you know
what I'm talking about.'') Thick brogues and excitable delivery
(especially Gleeson's) throw up their own language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Went Down'' is handsomely though not picturesquely
photographed, with Irish settings that depart from the prettily
familiar. (One setting is a bog.) It's also set off by intermittent
chapter headings to punctuate the action, and by an opening
quotation from Plato's ``Republic'' that explains only the loftiest
of the title's assorted meanings. The film also extends beyond the
predictable when it sounds the occasional moody note, as when Tom
watches Git digging a hole late in the story. ``What do you do?''
Tom wonders. ``What's in your life? Things like this?''
</P>

   ROSY-ECON-OUTLOOK (Los Angeles) _ California's economy, robust
enough to shrug off a withering financial calamity in Asia, should
continue on a strong growth curve through 2000, according to a

likely rival the strong spurts of the 1970s and 1980s, said the

will move to Burbank, giving the butt of Johnny Carson jokes

COMMENTARY: OZZIE AND HARRIET UNPLUGGED  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Murphy Brown'' is history and so, to everyone but himself, is
Dan Quayle. And still their family-values slugfest lingers on. This
month Lisa Schiffren, a former Quayle speechwriter who's now a
``full-time mother of two,'' and Candice Bergen, a widowed mother,
had a rematch on the editorial pages of The New York Times. Even as
they battled, however, they agreed that two hands-on parents are
better than one _ a truism now embraced by every politician in the
land, from our dysfunctional chief executive on down.
</P>
<P>
   But is life so simple? On Father's Day another TV series,
``Biography,'' lobbed a stink bomb into the debate: a documentary
examining the people who created the cultural template for suburban
family values in the postwar era, the Nelson family. From 1952 to
1966 Ozzie Nelson, his wife, Harriet, and their sons starred as
themselves in the early, much-imitated and longest-running family
TV sitcom ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.'' It propagated
not only stay-at-home moms but full-time dads. Though Ozzie had a
job, his occupation was never identified and demanded so little
time that he could always be found in the living room bumbling
amiably about.
</P>
<P>
   Nice work if you can get it. Yet as ``Biography'' details, the
offstage story in this primordial Truman Show was less sunny. Ozzie
was a 24-hour-a-day workaholic who subjugated his sons to his
career ambitions, sacrificing even their education to his lucrative
show-biz franchise. While it's hard to imagine a more literally
intact, home-schooling-style family than the Nelsons, its
psychological fallout was lethal. Adorable little Ricky, who
morphed into a teen-age pop star, lost his virginity at 14 before
careening into a disastrously combative marriage, drug abuse and
the de facto abandonment of his own kids.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Biography'' documentary (to be repeated on Friday) is
painful to watch if you're part of the boomer generation that grew
up with the Nelsons. It's as if ``Long Day's Journey Into Night''
were being performed by the cast of ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' But
for those of us who grew up measuring our homes against the Nelson
ideal _ and finding them wanting _ there's rough justice here. If
Ozzie and Harriet couldn't live up to their own image, how could
the rest of America? The Nelsons _ and the Eisenhower-decade ethos
they typified _ set a standard that couldn't be met by a society in
which men did have to work long hours to get ahead and women were
not necessarily delighted to be confined to home while they did so.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Biography'' reveals, the values propagated by Ozzie and
Harriet weren't really their own anyway (both were itinerant show
people before they married). Nonetheless, the powerful new medium
of TV imposed their nostalgic, unrealistic, one-size-fits-all
familial model on a vast, rapidly changing America to which it no
longer applied. The discrepancy between who the Nelsons were and
what they preached became a lasting model for hypocritical public
discourse as well. A Father's Day article in The New York Times
reported that the rigid 1990s family-values moralist William
Bennett was ``raised by a mother and grandmother who at best count
were married a total of nine times.''
</P>
<P>
   At the young age at which I was in thrall to ``Ozzie and
Harriet,'' I had a single, divorced Mom, compelled to work to pay
the bills. She was plainly no Harriet, and even when she remarried
she continued her dedicated work as a teacher. Later I would figure
out that she was a successful parent, but back then she and her
children alike felt woefully deficient. Surely it was Mom's fault
that life had dealt her a hand different from the omnipresent
Nelsons, ``Father Knows Best'' and Doris Day. Luckily, she lived
long enough to feel vindicated _ not by ``Murphy Brown'' but by her
children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience doesn't prove that ``Murphy Brown'' was right or
that Dan Quayle was wrong. But it does show that the whole
long-running family-values debate is framed, especially by
politicians and mass culture, by cliches of little use to real
people caught up in the inevitable, and perhaps infinite,
permutations of family configurations in a modern America. This is
why one can feel only sympathy, not anger, toward the real Ozzie
and Harriet, naked at last. They were as trapped by their cliches
as anyone who watched, and, unlike many of us in that audience,
they never could escape.

 &HT;      CONSTITUTION CENTER CLEARS FIRST $ HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 23 -- Funding for the glitzy, high-tech $130
million National Constitution Center at Independence Mall cleared a
major hurdle Tuesday as a key Senate panel signed off on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution Center would receive $10 million from the
federal government next year to break ground on the project, under
a plan approved by the Senate appropriations subcommittee
overseeing the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   And another $10 million could be coming soon from the Senate
appropriations subcommittee for education projects, chaired by Sen.
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., a key backer of the Constitution Center.
</P>
<P>
   The funding still has many more hoops to go through before it's
a done deal -- including approval from the Senate Appropriations
Committee, the full Senate and then the House. But Tuesday's turn
of events is a sharp contrast to the doubts expressed for the
project at a field hearing in Philadelphia in March, when a
cash-strapped Park Service said it was unwilling to foot the entire
federal portion of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, fantastic news,'' said John Ullyot, spokesman for
Specter, who is still recovering in Philadelphia from heart
surgery. ``It is just a great win,'' said Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., who helped broker the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If all funding is approved and the project built, the
Constitution Center will be a 132,000-square-foot multimedia museum
dedicated to the Constitution at the site of its birth in 1787. The
Senate subcommittee also on Tuesday included $3.5 million for a new
Gateway Visitors Center and a new home for the Liberty Bell -- all
part of the more than $200 million in renovations Mayor Ed Rendell
is trying to secure for Philadelphia's most popular historic site.
</P>
<P>
   For the center to be built, the federal government must put up
$65 million over three years, meaning $20 million in 1999 is on
target. Rendell has pledged to raise $35 million from private
sources, and Harrisburg will fund the remaining $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to $3.5 million from Washington, the visitors center
and Liberty Bell home will require $63 million from state and local
governments and non-profit foundations.
</P>
<P>
   The latest deal turned on negotiations between Santorum and
Specter and Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., the chairman of the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on Interior and other agencies such as
the Park Service. Gorton -- a history buff -- supported the
Constitution Center, but thought $20 million was too high a price
considering the Park Service's annual construction budget barely
topped $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   So Gorton agreed to provide $10 million from the Park Service,
as long as Specter provides $10 million from the Education
Department's budget, according to Santorum. ``It was absolutely
essential for (Gorton) to fund the project,'' Santorum said. ``Once
he got on board, it gives Sen. Specter a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a slight stretch for Specter's subcommittee on Education,
Labor and Health to fund a Park Service project, but Senate aides
say they will call the Constitution Center an ``interactive
teaching'' tool for history classes.
</P>
<P>
   Ullyot said no deal has been finalized, and Specter's
subcommittee has yet to hold hearings on the Education Department
budget. But, Ullyot added, Specter will ``fight for as much other
funding as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum is confident Specter will come through, and that the
battle will ultimately be decided in negotiations between the
Senate and House, which is not expected to include the Constitution
Center funding.

HIGH COURT RULING RAISES CONCERN AMONG CUSTOMS AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Customs officials said Tuesday they would
continue to search for large sums of money that people leaving the
United States fail to declare, despite a Supreme Court ruling that
confiscating undeclared cash may be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which was issued by a sharply divided Supreme Court
on Monday, struck at the heart of an aggressive campaign by the
U.S. Customs Service and other federal agencies aimed at seizing
millions of dollars being smuggled across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had time to even review this decision; our lawyers
are looking at it right now,'' said Bill Anthony, a Customs
spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents will continue to hunt as aggressively as ever for
hidden cash, Anthony said.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents seized roughly $18 million along the southwest
border in fiscal year 1997 and have kept up a similar pace this
year, according to the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that anyone who transports more than
$10,000 in cash or other ``monetary instruments'' out of the
country must report that amount. People who fail to report it can
be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined up to
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires the people to forfeit the unreported money
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But the Supreme Court ruled that forfeiting all of a person's
money amounted to an excessive fine and was therefore
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was rooted in a case in which a man tried to leave
the country at the Los Angeles airport in 1994 with more than
$350,000 that had not been declared.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents in South Texas have found hundreds of thousands
of dollars at a time stashed in hidden compartments in the doors
and ceilings of vehicles or stuffed in suitcases and boxes leaving
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Covertly moving bulk cash is a favorite tactic of drug
traffickers hoping to hide their wealth and to avoid paying taxes,
the agents say.
</P>
<P>
   FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration officials declined
comment Tuesday on the high court's ruling, as did federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't anticipate the government lying down as a result of
this, but this ruling definitely gives defense counsel another
weapon in its arsenal to retrieve forfeitures,'' said Ronald
Ederer, a San Antonio attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Ederer, a former U.S. Attorney, is currently battling the
federal government over $572,650 that was seized in April from a
courier for a company that specialized in putting armor plating on
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Aldrete De La Cruz pleaded guilty last week to failing to
tell Customs agents about the money, but Ederer said his client
kept quiet because he feared letting anyone know he was
transporting the cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is legitimate,'' Ederer said. ``In Mexico there's
constantly hijacking and kidnapping when there's large amounts of
cash.''

<P>
   KALISZ, Poland _ A well-worn school playground, where hard
sports have left more dirt than grass but that was once the site of
a venerated Jewish cemetery, has prompted a bitter dispute between
Jewish organizations and the Polish authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now a prosperous town bustling with commerce, Kalisz was one of
the earliest Jewish settlements in medieval Poland. Leaders of
Jewish groups say they believe that the body of a distinguished
17th-century rabbi, Abraham Abele Gombiner, is buried beneath the
soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   They say it is an affront to the Jewish religion that the body
of such an important figure, whose legal works and biblical
commentaries are still in use, should be left in such a
sacrilegious way.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City rabbi, Hertz Frankel of the World Council of
Orthodox Jewish Communities, and Jewish leaders in Poland insist
that the playground, and perhaps even the school, which was built
in the 1960s, should be moved. Only then, they say, can the
sanctity of the cemetery, of which there is now no visible trace,
be restored.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with Polish officials and American diplomats that
have dragged on in Warsaw over the last several years, Frankel has
made no secret of his disdain for what he believes to be the Polish
government's lack of sensitivity to a Jewish issue.
</P>
<P>
   The argument is particularly sensitive because the playground is
the main outdoor activity area for the 250 physically and mentally
handicapped children who board at the school. In one of the many
emotional elements of the case, the school is named after Janusz
Korczak, the head of a Jewish orphanage, who during World War II
accompanied all of his charges to the Treblinka death camp, where
they were all killed.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded letter this year to the Polish Foreign
Minister, Bronislaw Geremek, Frankel said that resolution of the
Kalisz cemetery issue had become a ``litmus test'' of the sincerity
of the Polish government to establish ``some relationship with
world Jewry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the collapse of the Communists in 1989, the restoration of
more than 1,000 Jewish cemeteries in Poland, many of them
vandalized by the Nazis and then neglected under communism, has
been a matter of friction and cooperation between Jewish
communities abroad and Polish authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, non-Jewish Poles in small towns have taken it
upon themselves to spruce up Jewish cemeteries by scrubbing the
gravestones, tending the gardens and fixing fences. Twenty-five
such unpaid volunteers will be honored by the Israeli government at
a ceremony in July in Krakow. In other places, the Jewish
Historical Institute in Warsaw has sent two preservation
specialists, Eleonora Bergman and Jan Jagielski, to help in the
restoration of dilapidated cemeteries and to photograph gravestones
for the archives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, here in Kalisz, about 100 miles southeast of Poznan, Ms.
Bergman designed a wall at the 19th-century Jewish cemetery in the
town that encapsulates gravestones that were once in the old Jewish
cemetery at the playground site.
</P>
<P>
   There is little left of the once-vibrant Jewish community in
Kalisz. Before World War II about one-third of the 70,000 people
here were Jews, according to Anna Wozniak, the administrator of
cultural affairs. She said she knew of no Jews still in the town.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis forced the Jews into a ghetto in the marketplace and
sent them to the death camps. The local synagogue was destroyed by
the Nazis and a bank stands on its site. The Nazis uprooted the
gravestones at the cemetery of the rabbi, which by the end of the
19th century had been supplanted by a new cemetery, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The gravestones were used by the Nazis to strengthen a nearby
river embankment, where they remained until 1989. Then, in an
effort to attract attention to the desecration of the old cemetery,
the Nissenbaum Foundation, a Polish group that pays for the
restoration of Jewish cemeteries in Poland, took some of the stones
from the river and put them on the edge of the sports field. They
were later taken to the new cemetery and set in the commemorative
wall designed by Ms. Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   Stanislaw Sikorski, the school principal, who met recently with
a Polish-Jewish leader, Jerzy Kichler, and Kalisz officials over
what to do about the playground, said he would not object if the
school were moved and rebuilt elsewhere. But who is going to pay
for it? he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel and Polish Jewish leaders say they believe the Polish
authorities should pay for a new school. That would atone for the
Communists' allowing a school to be built on what was known to be a
holy Jewish site, they say. But the Polish authorities say that
given their pinched economic circumstances, they cannot afford such
a gesture.
</P>
<P>
   Under a restitution law passed by the Polish Parliament last
year, religious groups may claim back property that was confiscated
by the Communists and still remains in government hands.
</P>
<P>
   But Kichler said he was pessimistic about a satisfactory
solution. ``We don't mean any harm to the Kalisz community and its
people,'' he said. But, he added, the Jewish religion demanded that
a cemetery remain sacred, no matter what the passage of time.

SPACE ... THE BUSINESS FRONTIER: NASA, UH FORM TEAM ON SPINOFFS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Subs to correct lede. Tang and Velcro did not originate with
the U.S. space program.) 
 
By KAREN SANTOS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the more than 25 years that NASA has commercialized
innovations designed for the special rigors of space, most were
licensed directly to various existing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping its innovations can give birth to and support entire
companies, NASA and the University of Houston recently formed a
business incubator.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator will help create business strategies and find
funding for new businesses based on NASA spinoffs, as well as other
innovations brought to it by individuals and companies.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the UH-NASA Technology Commercialization Incubator has
focused on 15 innovations, said Judy Johncox, director of
technology management at UH and temporary director of the
incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Here are just a few:
</P>
<P>
   _ A water filtration system using ultraviolet radiation instead
of chlorine. It could be used in sewage treatment plants or in home
purification systems. It is advantageous because ultraviolet rays
do not leave residue, while chlorine does. Over time, chlorine
exposure can lead to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ A testing procedure for herpes that will detect the disease
sooner than other methods. The test uses a modified chemical
reaction process that needs only a small amount of genetic material
to make many copies. That, in turn, allows for an easier and
quicker diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The test is projected to detect the disease within a few hours
instead of the usual two to three days at present.
</P>
<P>
   _ A method that would allow blood to be stored in a refrigerator
for up to 72 hours before it is processed or analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   This will be useful to small medical labs and remote medical
facilities, which often do not have the tools for proper analysis
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ A pressure sensor that is only two inches square. Such a
device might help in deploying air bags during an auto collision.
</P>
<P>
   Current air bag systems can only detect front-end collisions,
and the sensors in these systems are expensive. New air bag systems
may be equipped with side-impact bags, which would require more
sensors, and the patented pressure sensor being developed for
market by the incubator might help reduce the cost of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is no set time frame for the release of these products,
Johncox said. Many are still in development and could be released
six months to a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the 15 products under consideration have patents or
have patents pending.
</P>
<P>
   There are currently no businesses within the incubator. However,
both Johncox and Arthur Vailas, vice president for research at UH,
said they would begin searching for companies for the incubator in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good thing for Earth-based spinoffs of NASA
research,'' Vailas said. ``The university has a good view for
evaluating technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The university will draw upon students in its graduate business
program and the resources of its small business development office
to help show future businessmen what is vital to the birth and
development of their company.
</P>
<P>
   Vailas said the university also will draw upon the knowledge of
faculty at other colleges with which it is affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   NASA has a history of spinning off products.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the technology used to shield the space shuttle
from the sun's heat is used to keep race car drivers cool inside
their cars.
</P>
<P>
   The liquid cooling garment worn by astronauts has been adapted
to help people born without sweat glands to eliminate excessive
body heat. Also, some people with multiple sclerosis, for example,
have found that the suit relieves their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   NASA also developed the bioreactor, which keeps human and other
cells alive during space experiments. It's now being used in cancer
research in studies of tumor growth.
</P>
<P>
   The technology transfer department at Johnson Space Center in
far south Houston licenses products to be developed for consumers,
said James Cameron, who works for the NASA department.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Cameron's department helps evaluate the technology,
its commercial potential and its patentability.
</P>
<P>
   After a product is identified as a potential consumer item, and
a patent application has been filed, the product is shown to
potential licensees.
</P>
<P>
   An upfront fee of up to $10,000 as well as royalties are
charged. If a product makes a few million dollars, royalties are no
longer collected. Cameron said a large majority of the profit,
about 97 percent, usually is kept by the licensee.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator is different in that it will spin off new
businesses from NASA technology, and allow inventors to develop
their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually have someone technical who wants to develop
technology, who doesn't want a business plan,'' a common mistake
among technology start-ups, Cameron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big difference is that UH is a class act; it has all the
resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UH had formed an alliance with NASA in 1986, to develop a
process that used molecular beams to put a layer of chemicals just
a few atoms thick onto silicon and other crystals used in producing
microchips.
</P>
<P>
   Johncox said development of certain technologies will be
assigned to faculty members whose research complements the function
of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Johncox said she hopes that ``we will be a vehicle ... to
commercialization'' for many innovations. ``This is not just a NASA
vehicle, or a University of Houston vehicle, it's also important to
the city and the region.''
</P>
<P>
   The incubator will be funded for three years by a $1.2 million
grant from NASA. UH is currently looking for other sources of
funding so it can continue its research after three years. Johncox
said it probably will seek funding from the National Science
Foundation, a government agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a model which spreads across the country,'' Vailas
said.

SIDE   EFFECTS RAISE DOUBTS ABOUT AIDS `COCKTAILS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potent AIDS drug combinations that burst on the scene 2 1/2
years ago continue to work wonders for thousands of patients
infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). But not for
Hal, a 41-year-old Boston man.
</P>
<P>
   The pills that are saving many people's lives and restoring
their health were ruining his with their relentless side effects.
So a few weeks ago, against his doctor's advice, Hal (who didn't
want his last name published) stopped taking his AZT, his 3TC, his
nelfinavir and crixivan _ the drugs in his particular daily
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's wrestling with doubts and fears. ``I hope it's a good
decision,'' he said with a pained expression. ``It's not totally
that I've failed. I really did give it my very best. Hopefully I
can make it until something better comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal's decision reveals the shadowy side of the AIDS treatment
revolution that has recently given respite from the 17-year-old
epidemic _ at least in wealthy societies that can afford the
$10,000-plus yearly cost-per-patient.
</P>
<P>
   While AIDS doctors say few patients are taking themselves off
Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy or HAART, as the regimens are
termed, tens of thousands struggle every day to remember their
medicine, tough out miserable side effects such as chronic diarrhea
and ugly fat deposits, and pray that researchers will soon provide
them with better, simpler alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people feel they're in pill prison,'' said Dr. Calvin
Cohen, a Boston AIDS specialist.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS agencies have lately begun to devise ways to help patients
adhere to treatment regimens. A Massachusetts program, believed to
be the only state-run effort of its kind, has enrolled 412
HIV-infected patients in 17 sites _ out of 18,000 in the state
believed to be in anti-HIV treatment. Trained ``advocates,''
themselves coping with treatment, help others stay on the wagon
with pep talks, late-night phone calls, group sessions, and
compartmentalized pill boxes that beep when it's time to take
another dose.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advocate helps build me up,'' said Herbert Dean, 45, a
recovering addict in the adherence program at Boston Living Center,
an AIDS service organization. ``I was so used to beating up on
myself for missing my doses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This requires a higher degree of compliance than any regimen
I've seen,'' added Dr. Deborah Cotton, associate provost of Boston
University School of Medicine. ``It requires people to
fundamentally reorganize their lives and put this at the top of
their priority list every single day.''
</P>
<P>
   The relentlessness of treatment is making ``treatment fatigue''
AIDS topic number one in developed nations. This, in turn, lends
new urgency to the search for more drug options and more
user-friendly regimens.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS specialists expect these issues _ and the painfully
widening treatment gap between rich and poor nations _ to dominate
the 12th World AIDS Conference beginning next weekend in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Never has strict adherence to drug treatment been more
crucial, for patients themselves and for public health. HIV
patients who take their drugs sporadically are certain to foster
resistant forms of the virus that can elude any current drugs _
putting them on a downward spiral and raising the risk that they
will transmit resistant viruses to others through unsafe sex or
sharing of drug paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   This problem ``must be addressed if antiviral therapy is to play
its optimal role in blunting and altering the course of the HIV
pandemic,'' Mark A. Wainberg of Montreal's McGill University and
Dr. Gerald Friedland of Yale warn in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-1996, when treatment successes were the theme of the
last international AIDS conference in Vancouver, ``we've learned to
appreciate how difficult these drugs are to take over the long
term,'' said Friedland, who will chair a session in Geneva on how
to improve patients' adherence to treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of the regimens _ typically they involve
ingesting 20 to 40 pills a day, some on an empty stomach, others
with food, some requiring copious amounts of fluid _ was an
anticipated problem. So were some side effects, such as diarrhea,
headaches, and pins-and-needles sensation in fingers and toes due
to nerve damage.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, unexpected ``metabolic'' side effects are cropping
up: a redistribution of body fat to the abdomen, the breasts, or
the back of the neck, combined with a wasting of the face and
extremities; an increase in the fat content of blood; emergent
diabetes. No one knows what causes these late effects, how many
will suffer them, or what to do about them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the main bugaboo of current AIDS therapy _ the number one
worry of patients, doctors, researchers, and public health
officials alike _ is the virus's alacrity in acquiring resistance
to the 11 federally approved AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are living with HIV,
according to a new estimate by the US Centers for Disease Control,
and about half of them are aware they're infected. Of those on
anti-HIV drugs, a sizable but unknown percentage are, like Hal,
veterans of treatments available before early 1996, when
triple-drug treatment was first shown to suppress HIV below
doctors' ability to detect the virus in many patients' blood.
</P>
<P>
   Those who began treatment in 1996 are luckier, as long as they
got state-of-the-art therapy. Potent drug ``cocktails'' containing
protease inhibitors and other drug types can make HIV virtually
disappear (except in hidden ``sanctuaries'' within the body) in 80
to 90 percent of patients who were ``naive'' to prior AIDS
treatment. But those who began less-effective treatments before
1996 often have developed resistant strains of the virus that
linger in their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hal is a person who came to me before protease inhibitors
became available,'' said Mazzullo. ``He was on what we considered
the best regimen but it didn't fully suppress the virus. When I
tried to get him on more potent medications, he got terrible side
effects, to the point he was unable to take the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking up to five anti-HIV drugs at a time, Hal never
achieved the coveted status of ``undetectable,'' when the virus
cannot be found by the most sensitive blood tests. Treatment
brought his ``viral load'' down from an alarming 900,000 viral
copies per deciliter of blood (about a thimbleful) to about 30,000,
where it has hovered for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would give their right arm for a viral load of
30,000,'' Hal acknowledged, adding that treatment has certainly
``bought me something.'' But his stubborn viral levels in the face
of treatment mean the HIV in his system has mutated into a
resistant form.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes a new regimen will emerge soon that will be both easier
to take and potent against his resistant strain.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hal said, ``People can't get complacent about this
disease because the numbers are growing, people are still getting
infected, and the drugs aren't working for everyone.''

HARVARD ARTS FORUM TO FOCUS ON RACE, GUNS AND THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anna Deavere Smith, the playwright and performer who has created
a summer institute at Harvard University intended to strengthen the
role of the arts in civic discourse, announced Tuesday the first
group of several dozen artists and scholars who will take part in
the six-week program.
</P>
<P>
   The group includes choreographer Donald Byrd and members of his
dance company, who will use the subject of the black minstrel show,
an early American form of popular entertainment, to explore issues
of race, image and stereotyping.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Wallace, a composer, and Michael Korie, a lyricist, who
together created the opera ``Harvey Milk,'' will develop a new
opera, ``High Noon,'' centered on the Western myth of the
gunfighter and, by extension, guns and violence in American
society.
</P>
<P>
   Shu Lea Cheang, a media-installation artist and filmmaker, will
work on ``The Brandon Project,'' a yearlong narrative on the
Internet that is being developed with the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum in SoHo. The project will examine sexual matters on the
Internet and crimes related to them.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants include Judy F. Baca, a visual artist who has
been organizing the painting of murals in neighborhoods across Los
Angeles; Roger Guenveur Smith, the actor and director who created
the one-man show ``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' and Patricia Williams,
a Columbia University law professor and author who will collaborate
with Oliver Lake, a jazz saxophonist and composer.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute on the Arts and Civic Dialogue, which will be held
from July 6 through Aug. 14, was begun late last year with a grant
of $1.5 million from the Ford Foundation. It is sponsored jointly
by the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Mass., and the
W.E.B. DuBois Institute at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Its purpose is not simply to provide artists with a supportive
environment in which to develop projects that might illuminate
contemporary controversies and events, but also to bring artists
together with scholars, journalists and civic activists. Every
night, some 50 people will sit down together for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can an artist, at an early point in the process, bring in
information and other ways of thinking than their art form normally
invites to the process of creating a work of art?'' Ms. Smith
wondered Tuesday. ``And can they also bring the audience in at an
earlier point and see what happens?''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the institute will hold, among other things, a
public symposium exploring minstrelsy as a barometer of social and
racial tensions and a town meeting to discuss guns and violence in
America in connection with the development of ``High Noon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm trying to find is a place where we explore the
tension between the audience and the artists, and we try to work in
that tension,'' Ms. Smith said. ``Because I believe that tension is
a source for creativity. We have to be ready to be responsive and
to listen differently.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Tall tales and short stories: Kids who read books
grow up to read newspapers
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A nice lady had left a message on my answering machine. It seems
that more than a month ago she'd mailed me her grandson's name and
address for a free book. As he reminds her almost daily, he's yet
to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Join the club.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'll call it the Book In A Couple Of Months Club.
</P>
<P>
   Back in May I made my annual offer of books for kids. Send me a
letter and I'll send you a book, no charge.
</P>
<P>
   If you could include stamps for return postage, I'd appreciate
it. If you didn't have the stamps to spare, no problem. You'd still
receive a book. The deadline was May 30.
</P>
<P>
   So far I've responded to 1,015 requests. I have at least twice
that many letters still waiting to be opened. If I haven't gotten
to yours, please be patient. It looks as if this is going to be a
summer-long project.
</P>
<P>
   I'm overwhelmed and delighted. The letters are wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of some of the comments from kids:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that much, but I feel like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   I know that feeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 9 years old. I am a fourth-grade student. My reading
level is average. May I please have the Top Ten Ways To Get Boys.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd say you were somewhat more advanced than your reading level
indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like WCW. WCW stands for World Champion Wrestling. It is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   A volume of science-fiction would be exactly the right book for
you.
</P>
<P>
   A number of readers have been nice enough to send in extra
stamps and even cash contributions. Locally, I've also received a
wide selection of donated books to pass along to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   I've been making an effort, also, to get other newspapers
involved in a similar project to encourage summer reading. So far,
only the Austin American-Statesman has picked up on the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the proposition put forth in the column _ kids who
read are kids who succeed _ there are obviously good business
reasons for newspapers to promote books.
</P>
<P>
   I know of any number of people who read the newspaper but don't
read books. I don't know of anyone who reads books but doesn't read
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Books are exciting. Newspapers, for kids, can be dull. Get them
reading books and they'll grow up to read newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the approval rating of newspapers at an all-time low,
you can't imagine the deeply appreciative mail you will receive
when you do something to help kids learn _ from parents,
grandparents, teachers and the children themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The cost is cheap. I pick up books for a buck. Discount stores
sell classics in paperback _ Mark Twain, H.G. Wells, Kipling _ for
as little as for two for $1. Book rate postage amounts to $1.24 for
most of the packages I send out.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it's a good investment in the future _ for future
generations and for the future of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Any newspaper interested in giving it a try can give me a call,
and I'll be happy to help in any way I can. Voice and fax is
409-639-4420; email, AWEW18A(at)prodigy.com; mailing address, P.O.
Box 151108, Lufkin, Texas, 75915.

yesterday.)

ADVERTISING: ROSY AND GETTING ROSIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember the disk jockeys on the old Top 40 radio
stations who shouted, ``And the hits just keep on coming!''? Well,
the rosy predictions for domestic advertising spending just keep on
coming from a leading industry forecaster.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at
the McCann-Erickson USA unit of McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising in New York, said Tuesday that he would again raise his
estimate of spending for 1998. The reason: myriad signs of economic
growth that have been more robust than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a good, strong upward movement,'' Coen said at a
presentation of his predictions at the University Club in midtown
Manhattan. ``The economic climate looks even more favorable.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``barring any unforeseen developments,'' he added, ``things
look better for 1998 than they did in December,'' when he issued
his previous forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending is closely watched because it is deemed a reliable
indicator of the health of the economy. For instance, advertising
as a percentage of gross domestic product peaked in 1987 and 1988
at 2.35 percent as the economy boomed, and then it fell as a
recession took hold, bottoming out at 2.12 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Coen predicted that marketers would spend a record $200.3
billion in the United States in 1998, up 6.8 percent from a revised
figure of $187.5 billion for 1997. The 1997 figure marks a gain of
7 percent from the $175.2 billion that was spent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If Coen's prediction holds, advertising as a percentage of GDP
will ``match or pass'' the previous peak of 2.35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While stronger than expected, the growth expected for 1998 would
be the smallest in percentage terms since a 5.2 percent increase in
1993. Yet, if the figure of $200.3 billion is indeed reached, it
will be the first time that domestic ad spending tops the $200
billion level. Overseas ad spending first passed that figure in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions for ad spending overseas will not be as favorable
this year as they will be in the United States, Coen said,
primarily because of the economic downturn in Asia. As a result, he
has trimmed his estimate for overseas ad spending in 1998 for a
second time.
</P>
<P>
   Coen ``has highlighted the concerns in Asia, which are warranted
but manageable,'' said Karen Ficker, an analyst at Furman Selz in
New York who follows the media and advertising industries. Ms.
Ficker, who attended Coen's presentation, said: ``We're encouraged
by his upward revisions in the United States. Everything we see
seems to support that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coen, who has been tracking advertising and media trends since
1948, issues his predictions twice a year, in June and December,
revising them based on updated data.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was once known for overly optimistic forecasts, he
most recently has underestimated spending as the American economic
expansion chugs along.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of $200.3 billion is the third made by Coen for
American ad spending in 1998. In June 1997, he forecast a 1998
figure of $196.5 billion, which he raised six months later to
$198.4 billion. Yet ``the demand for media time and space''
continues mostly unabated, Coen said, so he has increased his
prediction once more.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are projecting that unemployment and inflation in
1998 will fall from 1997 while housing starts and vehicle sales
will rise, he added, and there are factors, like the Olympics and
elections, that stimulate demand for ads in even-numbered years.
</P>
<P>
   In raising his forecast for 1998, Coen cited the first-quarter
results in several large national ad categories such as
automobiles, up 17 percent from the corresponding period of 1997;
toiletries and cosmetics, up 14 percent; food, up 11 percent;
movies, up 9 percent, and beverages and snacks, up 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In some secondary national ad categories, he said, the gains
were even larger: insurance, up 33 percent; airlines, up 28
percent; computers, up 26 percent, and beer and wine, up 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, several national media enjoyed double-digit
percentage gains in ad revenue during the first quarter of 1998,
Coen said, including cable television networks, up 15.8 percent;
the four biggest broadcast TV networks, up 14.9 percent, and spot
radio, up 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of Coen's forecast of $200.3 billion, $118 billion is in
national ad spending, up 7 percent from 1997, and $82.3 billion is
in local ad spending, up 6.5 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the local media registering gains in ad revenue in the
first quarter of 1998, Coen mentioned spot television, up 13
percent; newspaper classifieds, up 9.8 percent; spot radio, up 9
percent; Yellow Pages, up 4.6 percent, and retail newspaper ads, up
4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like another pretty good year for local newspaper
advertising,'' Coen said, because ``everything we look at suggests
consumers are spending a little more freely'' on the types of
merchandise sold through newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to ad spending abroad, Coen's revised figure for 1998 is
$218.4 billion, compared with a forecast he made in December of
$236 billion and a forecast he made in June 1997 of $240.5 billion.
Overseas ad spending last year totaled $210 billion, down 1 percent
from $212.1 billion in 1996; it was the first decline
internationally since 1993.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis ``affects the overseas consolidated numbers,''
Coen said, offsetting strong increases in ad spending expected in
such countries as Brazil, Britain and Mexico. Among the largest
declines Coen predicted were those for Indonesia, down 30 percent
from 1997; Malaysia, down 20 percent, and South Korea, down 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's worldwide total estimate for 1998, then, is $418.7
billion. If it pans out, it will be the first time the total
exceeds $400 billion. It would mark an increase of 5.3 percent from
a final figure of $397.5 billion for 1997. That spending last year
represented a gain of 2.6 percent from $387.3 billion spent in
1996, the smallest annual increase since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Coen's initial worldwide forecast for 1998, made in June 1997,
was $437 billion, which he lowered to $434.4 billion in December.
</P>
<P>
   And making his first prognostications about 1999, Coen estimated
spending in the United States at $212.3 billion, which would be up
6 percent from 1998, and spending overseas at $228.2 billion, up
4.5 percent from this year.
</P>
<P>
   His worldwide total for next year, then, is $440.5 billion, an
increase of 5.2 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And beyond 1999?
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach the year 2000,'' Coen said, ``we think the
momentum will build'' and may produce something like the ``upsurge
we saw in 1976,'' when ad spending in America rose smartly because
of the Bicentennial celebration.
</P>
<P>
   So, ad spending at the millennium could be ``hitting half a
trillion dollars,'' Coen said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 people attended Coen's presentation, which was his 25th
annual midyear update. The turnout was lower than usual because
some agency executives and journalists had left to attend the 45th
International Advertising Festival, which continues through
Saturday in Cannes, France.

     CATCHING THE WAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   - Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it. In-flight
in flagrante delicto is the hottest trend in air travel since
frequent-flier miles, says the staid old Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the cases of ``unruly behavior'' aboard Singapore
Airlines last year, for example, were cases involving sexual
misconduct. Aboard a South African Airways jet bound from
Johannesburg to London recently, ``a couple in business class
disrobed from the waist down and began having sex in a seat in full
view of other passengers.'' This was stopped only after the captain
was called in, yelling at the couple that the plane was ``not a
shag house.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline personnel told the Journal that people were becoming
more brazen and expressed the difficulties of acting as police:
``At 37,000 feet,'' said one flight attendant, ``you don't have the
option of throwing people out.''
</P>
<P>
   - The trend in fast-forward men's magazines, says the Columbia
Journalism Review, is to become more like traditional women's
magazines. GQ, Details, Men's Health, Esquire, Maxim and the like
include features that used to be for women only: celebrity
profiles, consumer information, health and appearance tips and
advice about succeeding in relationships. The new reader of these
magazines, says the CJR, is Cosmo Guy.
</P>

     CATCHING THE WAVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   - Birds do it, bees do it, even educated fleas do it. In-flight
in flagrante delicto is the hottest trend in air travel since
frequent-flier miles, says the staid old Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the cases of ``unruly behavior'' aboard Singapore
Airlines last year, for example, were cases involving sexual
misconduct. Aboard a South African Airways jet bound from
Johannesburg to London recently, ``a couple in business class
disrobed from the waist down and began having sex in a seat in full
view of other passengers.'' This was stopped only after the captain
was called in, yelling at the couple that the plane was ``not a
shag house.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline personnel told the Journal that people were becoming
more brazen and expressed the difficulties of acting as police:
``At 37,000 feet,'' said one flight attendant, ``you don't have the
option of throwing people out.''
</P>
<P>
   - The trend in fast-forward men's magazines, says the Columbia
Journalism Review, is to become more like traditional women's
magazines. GQ, Details, Men's Health, Esquire, Maxim and the like
include features that used to be for women only: celebrity
profiles, consumer information, health and appearance tips and
advice about succeeding in relationships. The new reader of these
magazines, says the CJR, is Cosmo Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Gregory Davidson &LR; , a Cosmo guy reading Cosmo itself,
found a consumer news recommendation for tiny tweezers, ``perfect

HOUSE APPROVES RENAMED WEAPONS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After taking a tough assault weapons ban bill right to
the legislative firing line, lawmakers Tuesday retreated in the
face of gun industry and owner opposition and approved a weapons
bill that was barely recognizable from its original form.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the bill, which has been hotly debated in the House for
days, was even renamed from an assault weapons ban, to An Act
Relative to Gun Control. Passed Tuesday, the new bill increases
licensing fees and penalties while mandating safe storage of
weapons and training for would-e gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, the bill's name was changed to reflect that
those who already own high-capacity weapons would still be allowed
to own and sell them on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill really is not a ban on assault weapons and the bill
title was reflective of nothing more than a reaction and political
rhetoric. It's an emotional issue,'' said House Minority Leader
David Peters.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran said the comprehensive
legislation -- &UR;  &LR; passed 100-52 -- balances the Constitutional rights
of those who own guns with the dangerous nature of the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He said that because the bill mirrors the federal assault
weapons ban, the name change means little.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right position was in the middle,'' Finneran said. As for
the new name, Finneran said it is technically correct, ``but by
recitiation of the federal ban it's all in the eye of the beholder.
The House is more interested in substantive progress than illusory
titles.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal ban prohibits the sale of high-capacity weapons made
after 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While the bill was tightened to prevent convicted felons from
buying guns, it stopped short of the outright ban on existing guns
being resold, similar to what the Senate passed last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Both versions of the legislation will have to be rectified in a
potentially volatile conference committee. And Finneran Tuesday
warned that any change that takes away the right of a current owner
to resell an assault weapon would be rejected by the House,
effectively killing the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was amended Tuesday on several key points by:
</P>
<P>
   _ Adopting Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's regulations on
handgun safety, including a ban on the sale of junk guns in the
state and mandatory trigger locks on all handguns sold here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scrapping the ability for gun owners to have $2 lifetime
firearm identification cards and requires them to renew every four
years at a cost of $25. Licenses to carry handguns will also cost
$25 every four years. Those applying would have to be fingerprinted
and receive mandatory training. Those with hunting licenses and
those over 70 would be allowed to renew free and those between ages
65 and 69 could renew at half price.
</P>
<P>
   _ Restricting access to guns by those convicted of domestic
violence and preventing convicted felons from buying guns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Giving police chiefs discretion over what guns are allowed in
their communities. But the bill also establishes a seven-member
appeals board to overrule those officials.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increasing penalties for using handguns in the commission of
crimes.

   KLINA, Yugoslavia _ The gong of church bells summoned the Serbs
up to the weed-choked cemetery, with its ancient stone crosses,
marble tombs etched with the faces of the departed, crooked iron
gates and gnarled trees.
</P>
<P>
   During the tolling, the open coffin of Oliver Zaic, 17, his face
waxy with the pallor of death, was carried through the dusty
streets, lifted through a hole in the cemetery fence and borne up
the steep hill.
</P>
<P>
   The pallbearers were jostled by the densely packed crowd of 200
mourners, and the body, wrapped in a white sheet and strewn with
flowers, bobbed toward its destination on a lake of black cloth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have we been abandoned?'' Milic Zaic, 42, the slain boy's
uncle asked the crowd as he stood over the coffin. ``Are we doomed
to face this terror alone? Are we strong enough to survive? You,
Oliver, have shown us our destiny, the destiny of all who try to
defend their homes. I apologize, my boy, that we cannot bury you in
your own village.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Zaic was killed in his garden in Bica as he protected his
widowed mother and 10-year-old sister, Marica, from ethnic Albanian
rebels, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days the rebels have changed their strategy and begun
to attack and kidnap Serbian civilians in an apparent effort to
drive them out of their villages in the overwhelmingly Albanian
province of Kosovo in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Until now the rebel group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, has
avoided attacking Serbian civilians, despite the deaths of scores
of ethnic Albanian civilians, including more than 20 children, in
counterinsurgency sweeps the Serbs have mounted in Kosovo since
March.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days, five Serbian villages and many small
hamlets and farms in the agricultural region around Klina have been
seized by armed rebels after gun battles with Serbian inhabitants.
The Kosovo Liberation Army has cut most of the roads in this area,
isolating it from the protection of Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, these attacks have swiftly drawn in armed Serbian
militias thirsting for revenge and determined to defend their
villages. Before, the war against Albanian separatists in Kosovo
was waged by some 50,000 special police and army troops. But the
new mixture of combatants threatens to usher into Kosovo the
savagery inflicted on Bosnia during the war there, when battle was
often waged by undisciplined paramilitary groups against civilians
from opposing ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days armed ethnic Albanian groups have expelled Serbs
from Jelovac and Kijevo, which were populated by Albanians and
Serbs. There are now 900 Serbs, displaced from their homes in the
last week, taking refuge in Klina, and several say male relatives
detained by the rebels are still missing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I have two brothers who were taken by the terrorists from
their farm on Sunday,'' said Novica Vostic, 60, a farmer who fled
to Klina. ``One is 70 and the other is 69 years old. The terrorists
attacked my house yesterday in the village of Jelovac, four miles
from here. We all fired back, and the Serbian families in 12 houses
in Jelovac fled. We don't dare to go back. It's too dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodies have begun turning up near Serbian settlements. Zivojin
Milic, shot six times in the head, was found last Wednesday on the
outskirts of Pristina, apparently a victim of the ethnic Albanian
militants.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Bica, three miles north of Klina, is one of the
last Serbian villages staving off rebel bands in this corner of
Kosovo, and like most it is trying to organize its men into an
armed force.
</P>
<P>
   As nearby Serbian farms and hamlets have swiftly fallen to rebel
bands, the 1,300 inhabitants of Bica have dug four trenches, built
crude underground bunkers and established a home guard. The soccer
field in the center of the village had a pile of new, white sacks
filled with dirt destined for the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Shots have been fired at several cars traveling to Klina in the
last three days. Brief exchanges of fire with the rebels, who
occupy a hill just a few hundred yards away, punctuate the shrill
drone of the cicadas. And many people with jobs in Klina say they
no longer go to work because of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems started in April when the Kosovo Liberation Army
kidnapped three young men from the town,'' said Vojislav Doncic,
38, a local police officer who leads the militia, and whose
extended clan has many members here. ``There were three Albanian
men from the Hoti family near our village, and they agreed to be
our mediators. They got the boys released after 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, two weeks ago, the terrorists began to take potshots at
us. We sent the Hoti men over to mediate again, and they never came
back. We heard they were accused of being Serb collaborators and
executed, but we have not found their bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove his point, Doncic walked up a road to a small hill that
looked out over a valley. When he got to the top, shots rang out
and he began to run, crablike, down the embankment.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian farmers, standing in a trench, let out a noisy volley
from ancient bolt-action rifles, automatic rifles and an old World
War II German machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' Doncic said, bent nearly double, ``I told you. This is
as far as I can go. Beyond here you get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian farmers say the police, often hemmed down in
sandbagged checkpoints along the main roads, are of little help.
There is a growing feeling among Serbs in this isolated pocket that
Belgrade has abandoned the Serbs, who number about 150,000 in a
province with nearly two million ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police come for a visit and leave,'' said Ljubisa Doncic,
38, a teacher who has not traveled out of the village for three
days. ``We don't have proper weapons to fight back. The police do
not protect us. We are getting pretty angry, especially since every
day it gets worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljubisa Doncic walked toward his house as neighbors headed
toward their guard posts, carrying their dinner and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my father's 1924 Belgian carbine,'' he said, ``and I
get it out each night. My two children begin to cry. I tell them
what you always tell children _ that everything is OK, that I will
not be far away. But they hear the shots at night. They know.''
</P>
<P>
   Two farmers, Zviko Doncic, 65, and Milenko Gorgevic, 47, stood
next to 10 grazing sheep and four goats on the dirt road at the
entrance to the village. They clutched Yugoslav carbines dating
from World War II, which are of little use against the AK-47
assault rifles carried by the rebels. It is their job to wave down
incoming cars and check those who enter the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``See down there,'' said Gorgevic, pointing in a valley to a
small settlement of white stucco houses. ``That little village was
half Serb and half Albanian a week ago. Now there are no Serbs
left.''

BAY STATE TEEN PREGNANCY RATE CONTINUES SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The percentage of Massachusetts teenagers having babies
is continuing to decline, and state officials give credit to a
range of efforts, including expanded after-school programs.
</P>
<P>
   The birth rate of teenagers hit an 8-year-low in 1996, according
to an annual report issued by the state Department of Public Health
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The after-school programs, comprehensive health education in
grades K through 12 about risk factors, and strong family planning
initiatives all combine to keep teen pregnancy rates low, said
Deborah Klein-Walker, assistant commissioner for the Bureau of
Family and Community Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some good programs and good systems in place,'' she
said. ``We include parents, business, and youth,'' in designing
programs that will work.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' birth rate for mothers between the ages of 15 and
19 of 32.6 per 1,000 women compares favorably to the US average of
54.7.
</P>
<P>
   Klein-Walker cited the impact of the DPH-funded Challenge Fund
program, which finances a coalition of community organizations,
parents, and business leaders who design after-school programs. The
programs include after-school activities, counseling, mentoring,
and peer leadership opportunities for children.
</P>
<P>
   These are ``things that build on the assets of the young,''
Klein-Walker said, ``and make them feel good about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Media campaigns about responsible sex, and improved sex
education also play a part, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its not just one thing,'' she stressed, ``teens are becoming
more savvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker-Klein said her staff noticed increased abstinence,
improved sex education and a reduction in sexually transmitted
diseases among teens.
</P>
<P>
   The teen birth infant mortality rate also declined in 1995, the
latest year for which data are available. Massachusetts' rate was
7.9 per 1,000 live births compared to 10.8 for the nation. And when
women of all ages are counted, the state infant mortality rate is
half the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the report showed almost no gap in infant
mortality between racial minorities and whites in 1995, with all
groups showing less than 8 deaths per 1,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
   Racial and ethnic minorities in the state, however, continued to
show higher rates of teen births, low birthweight babies, less
adequate prenatal care, and fewer fathers acknowledging paternity.
</P>
<P>
   Programs giving pregnant teenagers prenatal care and counseling
have lowered the infant mortality rates and closed the gap between
racial groups in 1995, Klein-Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyoke, Chelsea, Lawrence and Springfield have the highest teen
birth rates in the state, project manager Saul Franklin said, but
the rates have declined steadily since 1990.

DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS TRADE JABS OVER CLINTON TRIP TO CHINA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican senators battled Tuesday
over President Clinton's trip to China, as conservative GOP members
sought to pass legislation aimed at punishing Beijing for human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, furious over what they called attempts by
Republicans ``to embarrass the president'' on the eve of his
departure Wednesday, moved to block the legislation being offered
as amendments to this year's defense authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we take a good look at what message this sends,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., who threatened to use
parliamentary procedures to block votes on a series of amendments
and resolutions offered by Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., and other
conservative lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is designed to embarrass the president of the United States
on the eve of his trip. That's what this is about,'' Daschle added.
He vowed to bring Senate business to a halt, if necessary, to
prevent the China issues from coming to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson's measures would prohibit U.S.-subsidized World Bank
loans to China and ban the issuance of U.S. travel visas for
Chinese officials suspected of engaging in religious persecution or
advocating forced abortions and sterilizations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the GOP measures would also return the authority for
approving satellite exports to China to the State Department
instead of the Commerce Department, which was granted
responsibility for such decisions in 1996 by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson and his supporters denied that they were trying to
embarrass Clinton prior to his summit meeting with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the amendments I have offered will strengthen the
president's ability to deal with China,'' Hutchsion told Daschle
and other Democrats as they threatened to shut the Senate down
rather than allow any direct votes on the amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats accused the Republicans of trying to play
election-year politics with the China issue at a sensitive time,
given the economic crisis in Asia and the situation between India
and Pakistan on nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the Republican moves not only
``transparent,'' but ``dangerous'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to score political points,'' Hutchinson
replied. But he called on his colleagues to support his measures
anyway, saying it was time to send a message ``that human rights
are taken seriously in this country (and) that human rights will
not take a back seat to trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the Hutchinson amendments highlighted the sharp
divisions in Congress over U.S. policy toward China, which has
promoted engagement through both Democratic and Republican
administrations ever since President Nixon normalized relations
with his visit in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The policy has suffered some setbacks in recent weeks with
disclosures that the Chinese government may have tried to influence
U.S. elections with surreptitious campaign donations and may have
received missile guidance technology from an American company that
received permission from the Clinton administration to launch its
satellites aboard Chinese rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The highly charged atmosphere could make it difficult to renew
most favored nation trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republican leaders, such as House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
favor the reauthorization of MFN, they have not been particularly
outspoken about it.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said China
is ``the only (economically) stable area'' in Asia, and that
closing off U.S. trade with Beijing would only make a bad situation
worse for in the region and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are not our natural enemies. We can make them our
enemies by our policy or we can encourage a friendly
relationship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Archer did not criticize any of his fellow Republicans
directly, he said ``those people who want to shut down trade with
China'' are mistaken if they believe it will force Beijing to
change its policies on human rights and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a practical matter, that will never happen,'' he added.
``They will turn to Europe and they will turn to Japan and they
will be able to get everything they want.''

PRESSURE MAY FREE BILL TO CURTAIL ATM FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Under pressure from community banks, consumer advocates
and the Cellucci administration, the House Ways and Means Committee
Tuesday indicated it will soon release legislation regulating
automated teller machine surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure something will come out of the committee,'' said Kim
Rezendes, a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee. She said
a bill would be sent to the House floor after the committee
finishes with the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   What shape the ATM legislation will take is unclear, but
Rezendes indicated the committee is looking to Representative
Philip Travis of Rehoboth for help. Travis, House chairman of the
Banking Committee, did not return calls Tuesday and an aide said
she had no idea what Rezendes was talking about. In the past,
however, Travis has favored setting a cap of $1 on ATM surcharges.
</P>
<P>
   For seven months the Ways and Means Committee has sat on a bill
that would ban the surcharges &UR;  &LR; _ fees banks charge customers of
other banks who use their ATMs. In many cases, those customers are
already paying a fee to their own bank.
</P>
<P>
   The surcharge ban passed the Senate 38-0 last September and has
the support of Acting Governor Paul Cellucci and Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger. It also has the support of half of the current
House membership, which means if ATM legislation reaches the House
floor it could be amended.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Democratic Representative Paul Haley of Weymouth,
who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, and House Speaker
Thomas Finneran have indicated they don't want to pass legislation
telling banks what fees they can or cannot charge.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, Rezendes told the Globe that the committee
hadn't acted on the surcharge ban legislation in part because it
wasn't sure whether consumers really cared the issue. That remark
prompted calls from 70 consumers and Tuesday the Community Bank
League of Massachusetts dropped petitions off from 10,000 of their
customers supporting a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we've shown them that consumers are interested in this
issue,'' said Dale I. Zelony, director of legislative services for
the bank league.
</P>
<P>
   Rezendes acknowledged as much Tuesday. ``Of course they're
interested,'' she said. ``It's there money.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Grabauskas, Cellucci's director of consumer affairs, said
he is not eager to regulate bank fees but he said he thinks it is
necessary in this case. He noted Bank of Boston and Fleet Financial
Group own 60 percent of the state's ATMs. He said he feared
surcharges by those two banks would force customers of smaller
banks to defect to the two larger banks.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston spokesman Bruce Spitzer said he was not aware of any
compromise legislation in the works on ATM surcharges. BankBoston
is currently preparing to impose surcharges if the Legislature
recesses this summer without taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston, which owns more than 1,200 ATMs in Massachusetts,
has pledged to impose only a $1 surcharge and use the surcharge
revenue to reduce fees paid by its own customers. BankBoston
currently charges its own customers $2 each time they use another
bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Travis in the past has expressed a hope that banks
would limit their surcharges to no more than $1. ``We said we'd
voluntarily keep it there,'' Spitzer said. ``That's all we know.''

INTEL EXPECTED TO DELAY RELEASE OF NEW PENTIUM II CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intel Corp., manufacturer of microprocessors that power some 80
percent of personal computers worldwide, is expected to delay the
release of its 450NX chip set, the newest version of the company's
Pentium II technology.
</P>
<P>
   The widely anticipated release of the so-called Xeon line of
chips, intended for use in high-end PC servers and work stations,
had been expected next week until a glitch, or so-called errata, in
the microprocessor was discovered. News that the Xeon release could
be delayed by between six and eight weeks was reported Monday in
ZDNet, the online version of PC Week magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Xeon delay comes at a difficult time for Intel. On June 8,
the company was sued by the Federal Trade Commission, which
contended that Intel had abused its monopoly power in the chip
market to quash its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Its newly released low-priced chip, the Celeron, is not selling;
PC makers panned it as too slow and chose instead to use Advanced
Micro Devices' K-6 chip.
</P>
<P>
   And in late May, Intel announced that it was delaying production
of its Merced processor, a high-margin chip with a completely new
architecture that was designed to propel Intel into the advanced
work station and PC server markets that it has never dominated.
</P>
<P>
   An Intel spokesman, Chuck Mulloy, said: ``The Xeon is an
unannounced product. We can't comment on whether or not there is
errata in an unannounced product.''
</P>
<P>
   Delays in the release of highly complex microprocessors are
common, of course. But problems with the Xeon line would be the
second disappointment Intel has had in its pursuit of the server
and work station markets.
</P>
<P>
   With the Merced chip delayed until 2000, Intel's near-term
penetration of both higher-margin markets, dominated by Sun
Microsystems and IBM, depended upon success with Xeon. Sales of
chips for use in work stations account for only 2 percent of
Intel's revenues; its server business generates around 10 percent
of total sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis is that Intel desperately needs Xeon to restore
revenue growth,'' said Nathan Brookwood, a microprocessor analyst
at Dataquest in San Jose, Calif. ``But because the bug only affects
the Xeon chip sets used in servers, we believe the business impact
won't be severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brookwood noted that success in the server market would
be more important to Intel over the long haul than its acceptance
by work station manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's Xeon line of processors is crucial to Intel's growth
because the company is in a price war with rivals in the low- and
mid-priced range of the microprocessor market.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has already cut PC chip prices several times this quarter,
which will reduce its profit margins. And Intel's failure with the
Celeron chip means it must go back to the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel will have to have a competitive chip at the low end and
soon,'' said William Milton, a semiconductor analyst at Brown
Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Intel shares shrugged off news of the Xeon delays
Tuesday. The stock rose $1.375, to $75.25, leading a rally in
technology stocks for the second consecutive day. Fears that Intel
would warn of a disappointing second quarter seem to have been
replaced by optimism that the second half of 1998 will bring strong
demand for computers. &QL;

FIGHT LOOMS OVER NIH FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Investment guru Peter Lynch, cancer researcher
Judah Folkman and other leaders joined lawmakers Tuesday in calling
for a big boost in medical research funding, amid signs that a
divisive fight is brewing over where to find the money.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and prominent lawmakers from both parties,
including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, say they want to raise more
money for the National Institutes of Health, with some saying the
budget should be doubled over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But a House subcommittee Tuesday moved to raise the money by
killing programs that provide summer jobs to youths and fuel
assistance to the poor, and by cutting in half an education program
called Goals 2000. The move sets up a probable fight with House
Democrats and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be acceptable to cut education or other health
programs,'' Senator Edward Kennedy said Tuesday at a press event to
promote medical research funding. ``That's robbing Peter to pay
Paul.'' Kennedy said Republicans were planning ``slash and burn
cuts'' in social programs and that money for the NIH could be found
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers say that a balanced-budget deal with President Clinton
will force them to find offsets for most new spending that they
propose. At the same time, expected revenues from a tobacco tax
hike now seem unlikely to materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Boston hospitals have said they would probably hire hundreds of
new staff members and add new lab space if the NIH budget is
doubled. The parent company of Massachusetts General and Brigham
and Women's hospitals has said a bigger NIH budget might prompt it
to construct a new building and hire as many as 1,000 new workers.
</P>
<P>
   The NIH received $13.6 billion this year, and President Clinton
has proposed an 8.4 percent increase for next year.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the GOP-led House Appropriations Committee moved
Tuesday to boost NIH funding by $1.2 billion, to nearly $14.9
billion. The subcommittee also proposed boosting the Centers for
Disease Control budget by $202 million to a total of $2.59 billion.
That is $89 million more than the figure in the president's
proposal, a committee spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee proposed abolishing the summer jobs program to
save $871 million and the fuel assistance plan to save $1.1
billion. It would also cut $245 million from Goals 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and other NIH advocates called for new research money at
a press event featuring Genzyme Corp. chief Henri Termeer, as well
as Lynch of Fidelity Investments and Folkman of Children's
Hospital, whose work with a new class of cancer-fighting drugs
caused a sensation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers unveiled a study by the Massachusetts Technology
Collaborative showing that while federal research funding has grown
every year through 1993, when it levelled off, the spending has
fallen dramatically when measured as a share of gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   Federal research spending peaked at close to 2 percent of GDP in
the mid-1960s and fell below 1.0 percent by 1992. The study said
that even under President Clinton's budget, spending continues to
decline as a share of GDP, though the total dollars spent would
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman is known for his work on promising drugs called
angiogenesis inhibitors, which supress the formation of blood
vessels that cancerous tumors need to grow. His drugs have worked
well in mice but have not been proven effective in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman said his work was possible because of 30 years of
uninterrupted support from the NIH, including years when the
research was seen as controversial. ``The government became the
risk-taker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Folkman also said that even when research proposals win high
marks in the peer-review process, NIH can fund only 25 percent to
27 percent of worthy projects, down from between 37 percent and 40
percent several years ago.

CLINTON CLEARS WAY FOR FEMA FUNDS IN EVENT OF MORE TEXAS FIRES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday opened the fire hydrant of federal
aid for Texas, where more than 1,100 wildfires have charred 150,000
acres since May 1.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring a fire emergency in the Lone Star State, the
president cleared the way for the release of Federal Emergency
Management Agency funds for the deployment of high-tech
firefighting equipment and personnel should another major fire
break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``(FEMA) will assist the state in firefighting efforts that will
help save lives, protect property and ensure public health and
safety,'' Vice President Al Gore said in Washington. ``And with
these additional resources, we can help Texas firefighters prepare
for the dangerous fire season ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's declaration came at request of Gov. George W. Bush,
who sought the assistance June 4.
</P>
<P>
   As the state slides into a summer characterized by little rain
and temperatures in excess of 100 degrees, state fire officials are
worried about a repeat of the spring of 1996 when roughly 500,000
acres went up in smoke.
</P>
<P>
   That summer was the last time such emergency federal funding was
available for firefighting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his aid request, Bush noted that 80 percent of
the state was experiencing drought conditions and in severe
jeopardy of fires. As of Tuesday, 115 of the state's 254 counties
had implemented burn bans.
</P>
<P>
   Graham Nance, who will coordinate the program from FEMA's Region
6 headquarters in Denton, said the agency will pay 75 percent of
the cost of moving the equipment, much of it owned by the U.S.
Forest Service, into place.
</P>
<P>
   A second federal program, so-called federal fire suppression
grants, pays for up to 70 percent of the cost of fighting the
fires. Four such grants have already been granted this year.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the state's wish list for firefighting equipment, said
Jo Schweikhard Moss, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public
Safety, are planes capable of spraying fire-retardant chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Funds likely also will be used to bring in bulldozers, federal
fire experts and fire prevention teams, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The total value of the federal aid, Moss said, will not be known
for months, but almost $6 million in federal and state money was
spent through the program between February and May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of '96 was rainy,'' Moss said, ``and the irony is that
the rains that broke the fires that year are the ones we haven't
gotten this year.''
</P>
<P>
   FEMA's Nance said the program will remain in effect until the
threat of wildfires no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fires reported thus far this year in Texas have
occurred in the state's parched western and southern counties.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a fired roared for days in Uvalde, Edwards and Real
counties west of San Antonio. More than 5,000 acres were burned in
the conflagration, which were fought by local and state
firefighters and water-spraying National Guard helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Another May fire in the mountains near Marfa in Presidio County
destroyed more than 60,000 acres before being brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent major fire, reported in Cottel County in
Northwest Texas, burned more than 1,000 acres over the weekend,
Moss said. It was declared officially contained Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Crop dusting plans operated by the Texas Forest Service dumped
1,000 gallons of water on the fire every 18 minutes, a Paducah Fire
Department spokesman told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had the blaze been contained, however, Moss said, than
a second fire ignited in the county. By Tuesday afternoon, the
second fire had consumed about 1,900 acres, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fires, many set by a lightning storm that brought little rain,
also were reported last weekend in Falls and Jeff Davis counties.

TWO MEN CONVICTED OF STEALING LUCRATIVE FAST-FOOD GREASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MELISSA PRENTICE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ During more than two decades with the Texas
Rangers, Al Cuellar helped build cases against dozens of murderers,
rapists and gun-totting robbers.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until Tuesday _ nearly two years into his
retirement _ that Cuellar's efforts helped bring convictions for
people charged with stealing thousands of pounds of used cooking
grease.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Judge Pat Priest found Tomas and Leonel Aguirre guilty
of felony theft after the men were caught on tape agreeing to
purchase a tanker truck holding $18,000 worth of grease.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bexar County District Attorney's first effort to
crack down on what it said has become a multimillion-dollar scam
nationwide, and prosecutors admit they couldn't have done it
without Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar was recruited out of retirement to help prevent an
estimated loss of $10,000 per week at Texas branches of Griffin
Industries, the largest of seven companies in the country that
collect the grease from fast-food restaurants and refine it for use
in soaps, makeup, clothes and animal foods.
</P>
<P>
   Using hidden microphones, a surveillance camera and an
undercover informant, Cuellar and Department of Public Safety
officers videotaped the defendants _ both employees of another
company, Imperial Grease Service _ agreeing to purchase 11,350
pounds of cooking grease that they were told was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Priest watched the tape several times Tuesday afternoon before
finding the two employees guilty and acquitting a third defendant,
Mary Ann Abbott, after finding no evidence she knew the grease was
stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were sentenced to two years probation and ordered to
perform 120 hours of community service work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will send a message to small, independent
operators that if they purchase stolen grease they will be
prosecuted,'' prosecutor John Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin assistant manager Jim Larkin estimates there are about
70 grease thieves in Texas. The grease, which sells for about 14
cents to 18 cents a pound, is stolen from containers outside
fast-food restaurants by thieves who sneak up at night, break locks
or damage container lids and fill tanker trucks with the grease.

BOSTON TURNS ON THE BOOSTERISM FOR DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY AND ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Wooing the Democrats for the convention in 2000, the
city's first play for a major event since the Fleet Center was
built, is prompting Boston leaders to market the city as never
before _ and in the process, forcing the city to take stock of its
turn-of-the-century identity.
</P>
<P>
   The boosterism is as unfamiliar as Yankees boasting about family
money, but the exercise _ civic, business, and labor leaders are
finding _ is strangely rewarding. It's as if repressed Boston is in
therapy, discovering it's okay to analyze and even talk about
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought outside of the box, it was a mindset that
there are things we can do and things we can't do,'' said Mayor
Thomas M. Menino, who has thrown the city full tilt into its first
convention bid with a surprisingly strong showing so far.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Boston has fancied itself as very attractive, a
big draw without marketing. ``They come to us, the tourists and
businesses and conventioneers,'' said Thomas N. O'Brien, director
of the Boston Redevelopment Authority. ``This is a new way of
thinking for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to O'Brien at the courtyard reception at the
Boston Public Library on Monday night, Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham conceded a certain unease in pitching Boston's best
attributes. ``I just remember going to other cities on a tour of
convention centers and stadiums, and there was so much hucksterism
and hyperbole.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said he welcomes the ``new Boston,'' now that city
leaders have decided to hone their own hyping skills. But still he
favors ``an understated approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a spine-tingling fireworks display inside the Fleet
Center and an amphibious Duck Tour that had state party chairwomen
quacking away (literally), it looked like the city had learned to
loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is incredibly healthy for this city,'' said
Michael Taylor,a longtime South Boston resident and a member of the
BRA board, at a dinner in the BPL's stately Abbey room. Boston has
always felt above the fray, perhaps even collectively cynical when
it comes to the game of selling itself, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The marketing of the ``new'' Boston is buttressed by the
Boston of old, said historian David McCullough, who spoke to a
hushed crowd after dinner. ``This isn't Atlanta. It isn't
Cleveland,'' he declared. ``In a country where everything is
starting to look alike, you can wake up here and look at the red
brick facades and the scale of the buildings and you know you are
in a real place and a very, very American place. This city offers a
chance to bring the message of how we began.''
</P>
<P>
   By seeing its reflection in the glowing perception of outsiders,
local leaders are seeing the worth of their home affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Site committee member Roz Wyman, a 67-year-old Californian who
directed the 1984 San Francisco convention, said she would love to
have Boston's asssets _ from its nationally-celebrated chefs to its
shopping and fine arts venues _ to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drool a bit, because you can do so much with 2000 in
Boston,'' said Wyman, over breakfast atop the John Hancock
building, where an actor playing the company namesake penned
autographs for the assemblage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a native of Los Angeles,'' Wyman said. ``But I love all
these historic buildings and patriotism.''
</P>
<P>
   As home to the nation's first high school and public library,
the city was born for spin, visitors noted.
</P>
<P>
   Menino said the city has helped forge bonds among an array of
communities as he has gone to business and labor and non-profits in
hopes of showing the city's diversity, and to ask for help in
raising money for the convention _ including $32.8 million in
public and private funding ($8 million from the city), $8 million
in state funding, and another $16 million in corporate spending
with in-kind contributions.
</P>
<P>
   As for the darker chapters of busing, and urban renewal, and
racism, they are fading with the writing of new chapterspromoting
tolerance and education, Menino said.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a member of the site selection committee who joined
Menino for a 6 a.m. walking tour of the South End Tuesday, said
Boston's maiden voyage in marketing itself _ blending the new and
the old _ is having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of stuff we walk away talking about,'' she
said as she walked past the renovated brownstones of Waltham
Street. ``Democrats are neighborhood people. This is where the
rubber meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   As McCullough exhorted the supper crowd. ``If you're going to
evoke images, evoke real images. There's no place like Boston.''

SMALL STOCKS REMAIN LOW DESPITE RISING TIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A rising tide lifts only big boats.
</P>
<P>
   Ask any investor who owns small-capitalization stocks. He will
tell you that the old saw about bull markets levitating all stocks
no longer holds true.
</P>
<P>
   While the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq
composite index are both up more than 13 percent so far this year,
the Russell 2000 small-cap stock index has barely budged from the
level at which it began the year.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, this frustrating performance has come as a throng of
market seers and Wall Street pundits have repeatedly proclaimed
small-cap stocks to be cheap and poised for a move.
</P>
<P>
   The throng is only half right _ small stocks are cheap. The
price-to-earnings ratio of the Salomon Smith Barney emerging growth
index stands at 1.13 times that of the S&AMP;P 500. It has been cheaper
on only two occasions since 1979: during the market plunge of 1987
and the 1990 recession.
</P>
<P>
   It is much more common for small stocks to trade at premiums of
1.5 times to 2.25 times the S&AMP;P Just two years ago, for example,
the P/E on the Salomon Smith Barney index was double that of the
S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   But just because small stocks are cheap does not mean that they
are poised to move. Indeed, this is the paradox facing small-cap
stock investors, patiently waiting for their stocks to come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Their companies may have real products, solid financials and
seasoned managements, but their stocks still trade at depressing
discounts to investor favorites like Yahoo Inc. or Netscape
Communications Corp., which have no sales and no earnings.
</P>
<P>
   What many small-cap investors do not realize is that they could
be waiting quite a long time for their shares to bounce. In fact,
the lid on small-stock prices is the result of a confluence of
events in the market and it is not likely to be lifted soon. Small
stocks, worthy of investor attention though they may be, could
remain in the cellar for the duration.
</P>
<P>
   If small stocks continue to lag behind, investors will need to
do some serious rethinking of their expectations for these shares.
And the underperformance could cast doubt on the long-held
assumption that small stocks always outperform large stocks over
time.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that small stocks are bad investments, of
course. But because most people with money in the market like to
see positive results sooner not later, it is likely that small
stocks will continue to disappoint even the most patient investor.
</P>
<P>
   L. Keith Mullins, an equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney,
likens small-cap stocks to real estate in Chernobyl. ``It might be
cheap, but who wants to buy it?''
</P>
<P>
   What is keeping small stocks down? A series of factors, both
large and small, obvious and obscure.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor in small-stock underperformance is the
dominance of institutional investors in today's markets. Direct
stock ownership by individuals has fallen to about 47 percent of
all U.S. equities last year from 91 percent in 1952. Individuals
have handed over management of their portfolios to professionals
who run mutual funds and pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Because many of these professionals have billions of dollars
under management, they require easy entry and exit from the stocks
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to buy a $5 million position in a stock without
pushing its price up is known as liquidity, and the demand for it
among institutional investors has driven prices of the
large-capitalization stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and
at the top of the S&AMP;P 500 to record valuations. Meanwhile, small
stocks lag behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for liquidity has created a new class of stocks we
call orphans,'' said J.D. Sullivan Jr., vice president of Carleton,
McCreary, Holmes &AMP; Co., the Cleveland-based investment banking arm
of Keycorp. ``The people with all the money can't own them, so they
have not enjoyed the same kind of value appreciation enjoyed by the
market as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time that the demand for deep liquidity in stocks
has risen among institutional investors, liquidity among many small
stocks is in decline, making them even less likely to be traded by
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest contributor to illiquidity among small
stocks is the change in Nasdaq market trading rules, which took
effect last year. The new rules, mandated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, require that a Nasdaq market maker post an
investor's price for a stock if it falls between the firm's bid and
offer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Posting an outsider's price on a Nasdaq stock is good for
investors. It has had the effect of narrowing the difference
between what an investor must pay to buy a stock _ the ask _ and
the price at which he or she sells it _ the bid.
</P>
<P>
   But the rules have hurt the big Nasdaq market-making firms. That
is because the difference between the bid and ask on a stock, known
as the spread, is often pocketed by the trading firms. Therefore,
these firms are earning much less from trading small stocks today
than they did before the rule change.
</P>
<P>
   Result? Major brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch, Salomon Smith
Barney and Bear, Stearns are cutting back on the number of Nasdaq
or small-cap stocks they trade for their customers.
</P>
<P>
   We are not talking about big, actively traded stocks like Cisco
Systems, Oracle or 3Com Corp., which continue to have many firms
trading their shares. But a more obscure stock that might once have
had 10 market makers, could easily now be down to five. A result of
fewer firms making markets in a stock is much less liquidity.

</P>
<P>
   Small-stock investors face more problems than just a lack of
liquidity. According to James Paulsen, chief investment officer of
Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis, small companies are
likely to be hurt by declining inflation much more than big
companies are.
</P>
<P>
   Small companies, with their lower overhead and more nimble
operations, have traditionally won customers by doing what their
bigger competitors do more cheaply. But, Paulsen contends,
declining inflation forces big companies to reduce their prices,
stealing low-price thunder from small concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, small companies are less likely to have either the
capital to invest in technology to lower their costs or the money
to buy other companies to achieve economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a disinflationary world, small companies can't compete as
easily with big companies,'' Paulsen said.
</P>
<P>
   As proof of his theory, Paulsen pointed to small-cap stock
performance during other periods of low inflation or deflation
going back to 1925. Small-cap stocks underperformed their larger
colleagues throughout the 1920s and 1930s, when inflation was low
or in negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Consumer Price Index surged in 1945, did small
stocks start to recover. Then again, in 1975, when inflation
started to pick up, so did small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   `It's my belief that the small-stock outperformance over the
last 70 years is a result of the fact that the period had more
inflation than less,'' Paulsen said. ``If low inflation continues,
that could change the outlook for small stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Disinflation could explain the intriguing deterioration in
operating margins among small companies recently identified by
Christine Callies, investment strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, operating margins at
companies whose market capitalizations were among the top one-fifth
came in at an average 13.5 percent. Those in the second and third
quintiles showed operating margins of around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But operating margins among the smallest companies _ those in
the fourth and fifth quintiles in market cap _ averaged 9.3 percent
and 5.4 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callies pointed out that the drag on small-company
performance was not limited to the first quarter; margin
deterioration among these concerns was a constant through the
second half of 1997 as well.
</P>
<P>
   She also noted two more reasons that small stocks are not likely
to recover anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   First, a bull market in small caps has never materialized near
the middle or end of an overall advance in stock prices like the
one we are in. And second, recent data from the Federal Reserve
Board shows a surge in foreign buying of American equities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors prefer large-cap companies with global
names,'' Ms. Callies said. This goes a long way toward explaining
the recent outperformance of the S&AMP;P 500 and the Dow Jones
industrials.
</P>
<P>
   Rising tide indeed. &QL;

SPRAY PAINT MAY HAVE BEEN USED ON FACE OF TEXAS MAN DRAGGED TO
DEATH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ One of the suspects in the alleged racially
motivated murder of a black man may have sprayed the victim's face
with black paint before he was dragged almost three miles along a
winding rural road, court documents show.
</P>
<P>
   The gruesome murder of James Byrd Jr., 49, in the early morning
hours of June 7 has brought international attention to Jasper.
Three white men, including two who may have ties to white supremacy
groups, were quickly arrested and charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   In a search warrant affidavit made public Tuesday, investigators
asked for tests to seek ``chemical compounds forming paint'' on the
hands of Russell Brewer Jr., 31, of Sulphur Springs. The affidavit
said investigators found an 11-ounce can of Duplicolor spray paint
among other items at a spot a mile down a dirt road where they
think Byrd was savagely beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The newest affidavit says Shawn Berry, 23, of Jasper, told
investigators that after Byrd was beaten, ``Brewer spray painted
the black male's face with black spray paint.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think Byrd's killers then used a towing chain
wrapped around his ankles and attached to the bumper of a pickup to
drag him to his death. Along the way Byrd's head and right arm were
ripped from his body.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Joe Bob Golden granted the search warrant
request. He also granted requests for scrapings from underneath the
fingernails of Brewer, Barry and Bill King, 23, of Jasper. The
scrapings, affidavits said, may reveal evidence ``consistent with a
struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The affidavits also asked for evidence of injuries to the bodies
of the three accused men that also would be consistent with a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Golden allowed blood samples, as well as samples of hair from
the defendants' heads, faces, pubic areas and legs to be taken from
the three men. The blood is being compared with blood spatters
found at the scene, the hair with hair samples recovered by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmen also were allowed to photograph the many tattoos on each
of the defendants. Some of the tattoos, the affidavits said, could
``be consistent with common practices of white supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of some groups, like the widespread prison gang Aryan
Brotherhood, often identify themselves with tattoos. All three
defendants have spent time in Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they are still awaiting the results of some
forensic tests, and refused to divulge the outcome of any of the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The cases against the three men are expected to go before a
Jasper County grand jury July 6. Prosecutors said they expect to
seek the death penalty for at least two of the defendants.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine the following ad in the Sunday classifieds:
</P>
<P>
   ``Help wanted: Experienced CEO needed to turn around troubled
company or division. Executives looking for long-term relationship,
signing bonuses, guaranteed severance, an equity stake or stock
options need not apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the kind of demands that chief executives typically
make before they sign up with a company these days, an ad like the
one above would probably not draw much of a response. After all,
capable top executives are in short supply, and they can command
substantial compensation for their services.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone wants the typical trappings that come with
lengthy tenure in the upper reaches of corporate America. Many
executives, no longer enamored of steady management jobs, are
signing up to be, in effect, temps. They go into a company for a
short period to fix problems for a daily rate, without all the
bells and whistles that accompany so many pay packages.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, they like to make changes and move on, rather than
manage a stable situation or jockey for position in the hierarchy
of a large corporation. And being a temp gives them the freedom to
focus on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge advantage in objectivity, because you're not
worried about your next position within the company and where you
go from there,'' said J. Steve Davis, who recently completed a
stint running the Wells BDDP advertising agency. ``It's a chance to
soar above the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   So-called interim managers _ outside the corporate suite _ are
not new, of course. As companies downsized managers and
professional staff over the last decade, they often hired
replacements on a temporary basis for these midlevel positions.
</P>
<P>
   And in the fast-paced industries of computers and high
technology, hired guns with specialized skills are commonplace. But
with companies facing more pressure from shareholders to act
quickly, and with the process of finding a new chief executive
growing more complicated and involved, demand for temporary help at
the highest levels is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over all, it's going to continue to be more accepted,'' said
Alice Snell, senior analyst for Kennedy Information, which
publishes newsletters, directories and research reports on the
executive search and management consulting industries. ``It really
is consistent with a lot of employment trends, including the life
style that more executives are looking to establish.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of interim management firms offer such services. About
15 percent of the executives placed by Imcor in Stamford, Conn.,
for example, go into one of the top three slots at a company. And
many companies that place consultants for a specific industry
sometimes provide top executives on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   But one company, Executive Interim Management, which deals
exclusively with placing chief executive, chief financial and chief
operating officers, is betting that this field will grow even
further in the United States. Although the company has several
offices in Europe as well as in Australia, and has placed more than
2,000 temporary executives around the world, it has only recently
set up an office in New York.
</P>
<P>
   EIM is unusual in that it is much less of a middleman or agent
than are many other firms. Instead, EIM principals determine the
goals and limits of the assignment, then send in a single candidate
for the job. There are no so-called beauty contests in which the
client chooses from several candidates.
</P>
<P>
   EIM works quickly, and can place an executive within days.
Services, not surprisingly, do not come cheap _ the executives earn
$1,000 to $5,000 a day, depending on their experience, and EIM gets
a hefty fee from the employer that is in line with the industry
average, which works out to 30 to 50 percent of the executive's
total pay. EIM charges a stiff penalty to companies that want to
hire its executives full time, because it likes to keep the people
it has found in its fold to do other assignments.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of people want such a job? It requires a lot of
travel. There is the stress of trying to learn a new industry, new
company and new colleagues and quickly fix problems as soon as they
are uncovered. While there may be performance bonuses, there are
generally no stock options that enable executives to share in the
rewards of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in broad brush, is executives who are financially
independent, have changed careers or businesses several times and
have demonstrated that they can take charge of an entire company or
major division. Perhaps most important, they do not like to stay in
one place for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had attention deficit disorder before it was fashionable,''
said Davis, one of EIM's more recent recruits.

</P>
<P>
   Davis, 53, was tapped to run Wells shortly after the agency was
bought in January by the Omnicom Group. Omnicom was not sure what
the fate of the agency would be _ and it ultimately decided to
shutter it last month _ but it needed to put in somebody quickly to
take charge. Davis was at his desk at Wells eight days after EIM
first got in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a temporary chief executive is, of course, not a
perfect situation. It creates uncertainty among employees,
shareholders, customers and suppliers about whether changes will
simply be turned upside down once a more permanent replacement is
installed. But clients say the advantages of a temporary top
executive far outweigh the disadvantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only upside,'' said Michael Greenlees, president and
chief executive of the TBWA Worldwide advertising agency in New
York, an Omnicom subsidiary. ``If it works, the benefits are
obvious. If not, you're not committed and can change direction
quickly.'' Greenlees was chairman of the parent of Wells, GGT,
which hired EIM, and subsequently was acquired by Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, EIM provides a support system so that he can
continually scratch a persistent entrepreneurial itch.
</P>
<P>
   He first diagnosed his itch about 13 years ago. After a dozen
years at the Benton &AMP; Bowles ad agency, he had risen to group
account director handling about a third of the business in the
agency's flagship office in New York. He had a corner office and a
blossoming reputation in the industry. There was only one problem:
he was bored to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife thought it was hormonal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He left to help build a small agency, Altschiller Reitzfeld,
that was later sold to Omnicom. That led to an offer to try to turn
around the troubled Chicago office of J. Walter Thompson. He
shifted the staff around, visited clients and pushed the office to
do everything it could to win new business. ``People started to
feel that they were on a roll,'' he said, ``which is a very
seductive and powerful feeling, especially in an image- and
perception-driven service business.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint at Young &AMP; Rubicam's New York office, he
received a call from EIM, and eagerly signed up for a new career of
permanent impermanence.
</P>
<P>
   Another temporary executive in the EIM stable is Werner Von
Pein, currently president of the U.S. division of Lavazza, a
successful coffee company in Europe that has had trouble making
inroads in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hired for my point of view, not a point of view that
somebody wants to hear,'' he said. ``In a large corporate
structure, if you want to implement change, it's a very lengthy
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Pein has seen his share of large corporate structures. A
native of Hamburg, Germany, he started with Procter &AMP; Gamble 37
years ago, and over the years jumped from one high-level
international marketing job to another at Quaker Oats, General
Foods, Life Savers and Planters.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, he enjoyed seeing the world on an expense
account. But in the mid-1980s, something started to nag at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some soul-searching about whether I might be better off
as a management consultant, and not be in such a large culture
where people are gun-shy and looking over their shoulder all the
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He went out on his own, and did some work with a number of
companies, including Hebrew National and a peanut farm in Georgia.
When EIM approached him a year ago, he was intrigued by the notion
of being part of a more structured organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``EIM offered the opportunity to have discussion partners of
comparable professional background with whom I could bounce things
around, rather than being a lone ranger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be operating completely alone anymore, but he is not
planning to rejoin a corporate hierarchy anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get up in the morning and know that by the end of the day
you will have probably made some changes,'' he said. ``That is more
rewarding.''
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the executive who is in charge of establishing
EIM's presence in North America, Neil Carragher, is himself an
interim executive who has handled a number of projects for the
company. And once his task is complete, he will probably return to
taking, rather than handing out, assignments at companies that need
help quickly. Running something for the long term is simply not in
his blood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management of change is something that gets built into your
system,'' Carragher added. ``You get bored very quickly and you
need to feed this habit.'' &QL;

MARIJUANA TOP DRUG IN BOSTON AREA, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Marijuana remains the drug of choice among young people
in Greater Boston, but LSD, methamphetamines and some prescription
drugs are making inroads, a researcher reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not trends yet, but we're concerned about them and
keeping an eye on them,'' said Thomas Clark, lead author of the
report compiled by the Boston-based Health and Addictions Research,
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Methamphetamine is making its way from the West Coast and
Midwest, he said. ``It's highly addictive, causes direct
neurological damage and unstable psychotic behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Although LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms are most popular,
after marijuana, among young people, they are still available only
sporadically, he added, and so-called ``club drugs'' such as
``ecstasy'' and ketamines are gaining popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And prescription medications, including Ritalin, a drug used
primarily to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, are
showing up more, especially among teenage females. People sell
their prescriptions, and since it is so common, Ritalin abuse is
widespread nationally, he told law enforcement officials and
epidemiologists at a workshop in Boston sponsored by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get a buzz off it,'' Clark said, ``You can get a high
if you take enough of it, like amphetamines.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen focus groups have offered some reasons why crack use is
declining among youth in Boston, he said: ``Kids are starting to
notice the `older brother syndrome,' the debilitating effects of
crack use on people they know, and are avoiding it. There's also a
stigma attached to being a crackhead.''
</P>
<P>
   These kids, Clark said, ``now have the option of snorting or
smoking heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   While cocaine and crack use continues to level off among young
people, it is still the drug of choice among users overall in
Boston, Clark said. Heroin comes in second in use overall, because
of the large supply, low cost, and high purity. The third most
popular drug overall, remains marijuana.

1996, the Long March rocket exploded, showering fiery debris,

American accounts as many as 200 civilians were killed. For five
hours, Chinese authorities barred them from rushing to the crash
site, purportedly for their own safety. When the Americans finally

FURIOUS TECHNOLOGY RALLY PULLS UP ENTIRE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Includes bond market activity) 
(JT) 
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors bid up technology shares Tuesday in a
furious rally that reversed a three-day decline in blue-chip stocks
and pulled the entire market higher, but many analysts remained
skeptical about how long the gains would last.
</P>
<P>
   The strong rise among computer-related shares lifted the Nasdaq
composite index more than 2 percent to its highest close since May
19. Other major market indexes gained more than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft led the technology surge, buoyed by a federal appeals
court decision that allows the company to sell its computer
operating software with its own Internet browsing feature,
undercutting an important element of the Justice Department's
antitrust case. Microsoft rose 4 15/16, or 5.15 percent, to 100}.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology shares rose including Intel, Dell, Compaq and
Hewlett-Packard, amid expectations that demand for personal
computers may rise later this year.
</P>
<P>
   However, such gains merely signal a near-term rally for stocks,
some analysts said. Many expressed doubt that the market would
reach new highs against a backdrop of uncertainty about the fate of
Asian economies and domestic problems, such as the General Motors
strike.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, stocks are merely recouping some of the losses suffered
in recent weeks, said Steve Shobin, chief technical analyst at
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   After three consecutive declines, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 117.33 points Tuesday, or 1.35 percent, to 8,828.46.
But the blue-chip gauge is still 383.38 points away from its record
close of 9,211.84 on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 16.25 points, or 1.47
percent, to 1,119.49. The rise left the index just 11.05 points
away from its April 22 closing high.
</P>
<P>
   Extending its rally for a third day, the Nasdaq composite index
jumped 38.75 points, or 2.15 percent, to 1,844.57. Despite those
gains, the technology-laden index is still 73.04 points away from
its April 22 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the market still has a pretty skeptical tone,'' said
Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks are up on the day, but they're not acting like great
things are happening or Asia is going to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people believed that Japan was going to do more, we'd have
a different foreign exchange rate,'' he added, referring to the
yen, which resumed falling on Monday after a sharp rise last week.
The yen fell further Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts attributed the yen's renewed decline to skepticism
that Japan will quickly take additional action to overcome its
worst postwar economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   A strong conviction that Japan is ready to take strong measures
should push the dollar lower to the 130 to 135 range, Brusca said.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar's higher value relative to the yen and other
currencies could make it increasingly difficult for United States
exporters to sell goods overseas, and Brusca said that ``does
create a problem for equities.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet-related shares rose Tuesday for a second day, partly on
persistent takeover speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But such speculation is probably unfounded, said Keith Benjamin,
an Internet stock analyst with Banc-America Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there are any more premium deals to be done,''
Benjamin said. Individual investors have been strong buyers of the
stocks recently, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some shares are merely retracing lost ground. For
example, Excite is still down 9 percent from its April 16 high. It
had fallen as much as 44 percent. Infoseek is down 31 percent from
its April high and Lycos, which had fallen as much as 37 percent,
is still off about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the credit markets, Treasury securities rose Tuesday,
deriving strength from a renewed rally in the dollar and vibrant
demand for newly auctioned two-year Treasury notes.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury sold $12 billion in two-year notes, awarded at a
price to yield 5.495 percent, a little less than the 5.50 percent
to 5.505 percent traders had expected. Demand was better than the
average of the last 10 two-year-note sales.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the 30-year bond was up 11/32, to a price of
106 30/32, while its yield, which moves in the opposite direction
of price, dipped to 5.64 percent, from 5.66 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the Treasury will sell $11 billion of five-year
notes and after that sell the five-year maturity on a quarterly
basis rather than monthly, reflecting the government's diminished
needs to borrow. In when-issued trading late Tuesday, dealers were
offering the five-year notes at a price to yield 5.47 percent.

   As expected, the pros set the time standard in the 685-mile race
from Newport to Bermuda, as the Maxi Alexia crossed the line at St.
David's Light at 10:16 Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But what a slow race it was!
</P>
<P>
   ``Slow, slow, slow,'' was all Chris Dickson could say as he
sailed his Maxi, Sayonara, into port two hours behind Alexia.
``We've been out there a long long time,'' said the America's Cup
skipper from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Alexia is an 82-footer from Buenos Aires, skippered by Alberto
Roenners, with Guillermo Parade as first mate.
</P>
<P>
   But the big gun on this trip was John Kostecki, an Olympic
champion and participant in the last two America's Cups, who called
the right moves. Shortly after the Friday noon start off Newport,
Alexia took an extreme easterly course, caught the favorable winds
that put her 29 miles ahead, then ``never looked back,'' said
Kostecki.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Maxis competing for the overall world title were
pressing, but in the light air that followed, they could never make
up the time to catch Alexia.
</P>
<P>
   A third Maxi, Boomerang, owned by George Coumonteros from the
New York Yacht Club, crossed the line third, while the first
race/cruise division boat, Trader, sailed by Fred Detwiler of
Grosse Point, Mich., crossed the line fourth with an all-amateur
crew.
</P>
<P>
   All results are subject to handicap adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   A few other boats were on the horizon at press time, according
to race spokesman Talbot Wilson, but the majority of the 168-boat
fleet is still out in the Atlantic after a prolonged windless
period at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-hour time raised speculation that this might be the
slowest race of the 42 that have been sailed since 1906, but Wilson
insisted, ``It's not even in the top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The slowest race was 1960, when the fleet sailed for 121 hours
before a winner crossed the line, and the 1978 race took 105 hours
to sail.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest crossing for a monohull came two years ago when
Boomerang roared to a win in 57 1/2 hours, less than half the time
of the slowest race.
</P>
<P>
   The finish of this race will appear on the World Wide Web at
www.rbyc.bm/newportfinlog.htm.

TV NOTES: `SILVER' ACTOR JOINING `BLUE'; KURTIS' DREAM JOB; AMERICA
STILL LOVES OZZIE AND HARRIET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The search is over. With Jimmy Smits to depart the cast of ABC's
``NYPD Blue'' sometime in the fall, the producers have been
auditioning dozens of actors to find the next young, good-looking,
brooding partner for Detective Andy Sipowicz, played by Dennis
Franz.
</P>
<P>
   Like David Caruso and Smits, the winner is young and
good-looking. But brooding? Hardly. Rick Schroder is best known for
playing Ricky Stratton, the adorable adolescent son who moves in
with his childish, divorced father, in the mid-1980s NBC sitcom
``Silver Spoons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schroder, now 28, has been honing his skills in television
movie roles, including that of a young cowboy in ``Lonesome Dove,''
and, the executive producer Steven Bochco says, he showed great
chemistry in reading scenes with Franz.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kurtis, Host
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kurtis has been in television news a long time and now, at
57, he thinks he has found a dream job. The A&AMP;E Arts and
Entertainment cable network has scheduled hourlong documentaries
every weeknight at 9, starting next Monday, and Kurtis will oversee
and play host to all five nights. The A&AMP;E project comes when
networks are devoting more of prime time to news: ``Dateline'' on
NBC, ``20/20'' on ABC and ``48 Hours'' on CBS have gained
additional time slots, and the cable networks CNN and Fox News
Channel are producing new magazine-style programs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen so much informational programming on the
air,'' said Kurtis, who spent 30 years at CBS and has been an
independent producer of programs for A&AMP;E and PBS since 1991. ``I
think it's the golden age of documentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he said, is that ``nonfiction or informational
programming is more interesting than what the networks are giving
us in their entertainment programming. You get a new plot and new
characters each week, but with familiar faces in the reporters and
anchors who bring the news to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The A&AMP;E documentary lineup will include two returning programs
produced by Kurtis, ``Investigative Reports'' (Mondays) and
``American Justice'' (Wednesdays), another returning program called
``The Unexplained'' (Thursdays) and two new ones, ``Inside Story''
(Tuesdays) and ``L.A. Detectives'' (Fridays).
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside Story,'' will be a cinema-verite look inside an
institution, a profession or an interest group; the first episode,
for example, profiles a motorcycle gang from the Bronx. ``L.A.
Detectives'' will follow actual Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department homicide detectives, at work and at home. ``It won't be
cops chasing guys across a back yard,'' Kurtis said. ``It will show
them meticulously piecing together clues, and also show they have a
human side, taking care of the kids and going to soccer games and
so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some traditional documentarians criticize A&AMP;E's hour
documentaries, including those on the popular ``Biography'' series,
for being hastily assembled and often superficial. One calls the
genre ``docu-lite.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtis candidly acknowledged that to fill five hours a week ``is
daunting, and I can't sit here and say every night will be of the
same quality or will be Emmy Award-winning material.'' But his
dream is to produce enough solid and intriguing material to ``lay
claim to the time period,'' in viewership terms, and then persuade
A&AMP;E to let him produce multipart series. He wants to do five nights
in a row on five aspects of a single topic, like drug use or
presidential candidates' platforms. ``That would be really new,''
he said. ``That's my dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson Adventures
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the shortcomings of A&AMP;E's ``Biography'' series, last
Sunday night's two-hour episode about the classic 1950s sitcom
``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' earned generally high
praise from television critics. And on Tuesday when the Nielsen
ratings came out, A&AMP;E learned that it had been tremendously popular
with viewers, too, as the second most-watched program in the
network's history. ``Ozzie and Harriet: America's Favorite
Family,'' produced for A&AMP;E by Peter Jones Productions, was watched
by an average 3.4 million households, second only to the 3.7
million audience for the Jane Austen drama, ``Pride and
Prejudice,'' seen in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think two things contributed,'' said Michael Cascio, A&AMP;E's
senior vice president for programming. ``The Nelsons cover three
generations, and the ratings breakdown shows both older and younger
people watched. Also, with the movie `The Truman Show' out, the
concept of how television affects people's lives has been in the
news a lot. The Nelsons are the original `Truman Show.' ''

   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China,
Senate Republicans on Tuesday mounted a wide-ranging critique of
the administration's China policy, but Democrats blocked any votes
on politically embarrassing bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats rallied behind Clinton in a rare show of unity.
``I'm not going to allow one single vote on China this week,'' Sen.
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said on
Tuesday. ``We're not going to embarrass this president.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a package of amendments sponsored by Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., that would deny travel visas to Chinese
officials involved in religious persecution or forced-abortion
policies, ban new American-backed international loans to China, and
shift the licensing authority for commercial satellites back to the
State Department from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Through delaying tactics, the Democrats avoided a test vote on
that package and allowed only an ambiguous procedural vote. The
Senate decided, by 84 to 12, not to kill the amendments but to
leave them in legislative limbo.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unwritten rule that Congress will not vote on
legislation affecting a foreign country while the president is
visiting that nation. But some Republicans, angry over what they
perceive as the administration's failure to press Beijing
aggressively on China's record on human rights and religious
tolerance, sought to put the president on the spot before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make our point before the president leaves,'' said
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, Lott agreed to postpone a vote on the China
amendments until after July 6, when Clinton will have returned from
his trip.
</P>
<P>
   The decision appeared to free the Senate to finish consideration
of the a $270 billion military authorization bill for fiscal year
1999, to which the China amendments had been added.

`RENO FINDS HER MIND': HYPERQUICK WIT

   NEW YORK _ Reno makes you glad to be a New Yorker. She has had
it with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who ``thinks he's in Athens and
he's fighting Troy.'' (If you want the place where you live and
work to be calmer and cleaner, Reno suggests, move to Wisconsin.)
She is thankful that so many Muslims live in the city, because
alternate-side-of-the-street parking is now suspended on their
holidays. She's totally baffled by the supposed appeal of spending
weekends at a country house. (If everybody goes to bed at 9, how
much fun can they really be having?) She wishes Donald Trump would
move to Malibu, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's newest one-woman show, ``Reno Finds Her Mind,'' at the
Sullivan Street Lounge through July 4, finds her loud, annoyed and
hilarious, which is just as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   A high-energy comedian who has been compared to Bette Midler, a
nuclear reaction and living Cubism, Reno gives new meaning to
``fast-paced.'' She mentions the preppy murderer, the Boston nanny
and Joel Steinberg in one sentence. (They're not this month's news,
but it's not as if we've forgotten them.) No one would ever tell
her to take a moment, because she appears to deal in nanomoments
instead, so fast that the effect is almost subliminal.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a virtually unrelated joke, she suddenly sings
a few notes from ``Jesus Christ Superstar'' (``See my ears? I can
hardly ... ''), then keeps going with her original thought. If only
one person in the audience catches it, no problem. As Reno says:
``If I think two people will get the joke, I will go for it. Me and
Philip Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno points out things the audience members know but probably
haven't given a lot of thought to. Like the fact that getting your
teeth cleaned hurts. (It didn't always.) Or what the size of the
self-help section at big bookstores says about the state of things.
</P>
<P>
   She does not deal well with the passing of time, long (``If I
haven't been doing anything all these years, why should it
count?'') or short (``The trouble with getting up at 2 p.m. is that
the banks close at 3.'').
</P>
<P>
   The material in ``Reno Finds Her Mind'' ranges from an anecdote
about an attempt to shop at Sears (``three floors of nothing'') and
ends with one about a mammogram, which she has in lieu of a $5,500
brain scan. Here and there, she even makes fun of herself. Of her
recent search for her biological mother, which she turned into an
HBO special, she says, ``You can't really find your mother without
a sound person, can you?'' Works for me.
</P>

`AIDS IS WINNING,' REPORTS INTERNATIONAL AGENCY 

</HEADLINE>

By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the World AIDS Conference approaches, the primary
international AIDS agency paints a bleak picture of the spread of
the AIDS virus in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most of the world, AIDS is winning,'' said said Dr. Peter
Piot, executive director of the Joint United Nations Agency on
AIDS, or UNAIDS,, an international umbrella organization
coordinating the fight across national borders. The World AIDS
Conference begins Sunday in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis the group has issued,
its experts estimated that 30.6 million are living with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, or AIDS across the world, with 16,000 new
infections daily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 5.8 million new infections and 2.3 million deaths were
attributed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the disease has become one of the
leading causes of infectious death in the world _ ranking with
malaria and tuberculosis as a mass killer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the industrialized world that includes the United
States, the AIDS death rates and rates of new infection are
stabilizing or dropping, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   In most of these countries, people with AIDS have ready access
to drugs that fight the virus and the infections to which infected
people are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to prevent the spread of AIDS have met with varying
success.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industrialized world and some developing nations
have reported declining infection rates. That is not true of Asia
or most of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At least one in 10 people living in 13 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa are infected with HIV, an example of how fast the infection
is spreading, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South Africa has 3 million people living with HIV,
Piot said. Of those, 700,000 were infected in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of southern Africa _ the part of the world
hardest hit by the disease _ AIDS rates have continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana and Zimbabwe, one in four adults in urban and rural
areas carry the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is doubling and tripling adult death rates in the many of
these countries, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   HIV is still an emerging epidemic in the nations of Eastern
Europe and Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, overall rates of disease are low, but in the
past two years, many have experienced a six- to 10-fold increase in
the numbers of reported cases.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said gaps contribute to the increasing death and infection
rates in countries where people are uneducated and poor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the numerous gaps include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disparities in access to treatment for all diseases related to
HIV, including tuberculosis and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Differences in the rates of transmission, with spread of the
disease slowing in countries where prevention is stressed and
speeding up where AIDS is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaps in knowledge about HIV status, leading to increased
spread of the disease and the threat that more children will be
born infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand and Uganda have managed to slow the increase of disease
in their burgeoning epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda has cut its AIDS infection rate by 25 percent _ from 13
percent in 1994 to 9.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has reduced prevalence of the disease in that country
from 13 percent in 1994 to 9.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, prevention programs stressing condom use, delayed
age at first intercourse and reducing sexual partners played a big
role in lowering infection rates.

SCIENTISTS SAY NEW FOSSILS STRENGTHEN DINOSAUR-BIRD LINK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paleontologists examining fossils from animals bearing feathers
think they have found the most persuasive evidence yet that birds
evolved directly from small, meat-eating dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the scientists and their allies contend that the mystery
of bird origins has at last been solved and that the close
dinosaur-bird link is now beyond debate. But a few skeptical
adversaries are not ready to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said another implication of the newly discovered
fossils, which are from China, was that feathers could no longer be
considered a defining characteristic of birds. Although birds are
the only living creatures with feathers, this was not always so.
Some dinosaurs with putative ancestral ties to birds appear to have
evolved feathers, too, and they were unrelated to flight.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings are being reported this week in the journal
Nature, to be published on Thursday, and are also described in the
July issue of National Geographic magazine. The scientists
displayed the fossils and discussed their interpretations at a news
conference Tuesday at the National Geographic Society in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new fossils represent stages in the evolution of birds
from feathered, ground-living, bipedal dinosaurs,'' the scientists
concluded in their journal report.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the findings in the same issue, Dr. Kevin Padian,
a paleontologist at the University of California at Berkeley, said
the research ``should lay to rest any remaining doubts'' that birds
evolved from a type of turkey-size carnivorous dinosaurs called
coelurosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   The fossils of these animals, discovered in sediments of an
ancient lake in Liaoning Province, in northeastern China, represent
two different species. Their significance was determined by Dr.
Philip Currie of the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology in
Drumheller, Alberta, and Dr. Mark Norell of the American Museum of
Natural History in New York City, working with Dr. Ji Qiang and Dr.
Ji Shuan of the National Geological Museum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fossil species, Protoarchaeopteryx, had already been
recognized in a preliminary scientific report. But further analysis
showed it to be similar in many respects to the swift predatory
dinosaur Velociraptor of ``Jurassic Park'' fame. The most notable
aspect of the new species, though, was a cluster of feathers at the
end of its tail. Some of these feathers must have been 6 to 8
inches long, Norell said.
</P>
<P>
   The other specimens, at first mistaken for Protoarchaeopteryx,
were of an even more feathery dinosaur, as Currie and his
assistant, Kevin Aulenback of the Tyrell museum, could see on first
examination. Feathers covered the arms and much of their bodies, as
well as their tails. Some were downy feathers; others were more
structured, with shafts and vanes like a quill pen.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that they were seeing a new species, the
paleontologists named it Caudipteryx, for the tall, feathery plumes
the animal likely fanned for display like a peacock. This species,
Currie and his colleagues concluded, should probably be placed on
the dinosaur family tree somewhere between Velociraptor and
Protoarchaeopteryx.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists said the two species lived at least 120 million
and perhaps as much as 135 million years ago. The size and
configuration of their primitive feathers, as well as the size of
their forelimbs and other characteristics, probably rendered the
two creatures flightless.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeopteryx, the earliest established bird, which could
apparently fly, lived about 147 million years ago in what is now
southern Germany. The fact that these two feathered dinosaurs lived
after Archaeopteryx did not trouble Currie.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he said that these primitive animals could well
have evolved long before Archaeopteryx. Protoarchaeopteryx, for
example, is a dinosaur that may reflect how ancestors of
Archaeopteryx looked.
</P>
<P>
   If the feathers of these dinosaurs were not used for flight, the
paleontologists said, their earliest functions could have included
body insulation, camouflage, mating displays and species
recognition. Only among animals in the transitional phase leading
to birds, the scientists said, would feathers have been adapted for
flight.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery team emphasized that these two species were still
definitely dinosaurian and not early flightless birds. Currie noted
that of the 90 recognized physiological characteristics for
dinosaurs, 80 were represented in the skeletons of these animals.
</P>
<P>
   For scientists who had been undecided in the dinosaur-bird
origin controversy, Currie said, this kind of evidence, plus the
feathers, ``is going to be the straw that breaks the camel's back
in the whole debate.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most resolute critics of dinosaur ancestry of birds
is Dr. Alan Feduccia, an ornithologist at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill and author of the authoritative ``The
Origin and Evolution of Birds'' (Yale University Press, 1996).
Feduccia says he believes that the skeletal similarities between
dinosaurs and birds can be largely explained in terms of their
parallel but separate evolution. Birds thus did not evolve from
dinosaurs but shared with them a common reptilian ancestor at a
much earlier time.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Feduccia cited several anatomical disparities
between dinosaurs and birds and the difficulty of explaining how
animals could have developed flight from the ground up, rather than
from trees down, as reasons for doubt about a direct ancestral
relationship between dinosaurs and birds. He suggested that the
long feathers on these species could indicate that these animals
had once been able to fly, but had evolved into flightless birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we're being asked to put a square peg in a round
hole,'' Feduccia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Norell said the ``anatomical similarities between dinosaurs
and birds are overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hans-Dieter Sues, a paleontologists with the Royal Ontario
Museum, in Toronto, said the critics had no physical evidence to
support their arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only dinosaurs,'' Sues said, ``are anatomically suited to be
the precursors of birds.''

AUSTRIAN CARDINAL IMPRESSES SOME AS CHOICE FOR NEXT POPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ It is impolitic for Catholics to speculate too
openly about who could be the man to succeed Pope John Paul II. But
as the 78-year-old pope's health declines, Vatican watchers cannot
resist studying the roster of cardinals for the few who could be
tapped.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the names frequently mentioned these days as
``papabile'' _ (pah-PAH-bee-lay), ``possibly a pope'' _ is that of
Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the 53-year-old leader of the deeply
divided Austrian Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The rift drove the pope to travel to Austria on a pastoral
mission, his third visit here. And while the pope set about trying
to address the problems of his Austrian flock, his three-day visit
gave his Vatican entourage _ and the Vatican press corps _ a closer
look at the man directly in charge of solving them.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenborn, like the pope, is a staunch conservative on
doctrinal matters, but he has handled a deep scandal with deft
diplomacy. In a news conference on Friday, the cardinal
effortlessly charmed an often cynical press corps from Rome by
calmly answering questions about the battles within the church in
four languages. (He speaks six.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked to give his own views on one issue bedeviling Austrian
Catholics _ whether laymen should be allowed to say Mass _ the
Cardinal launched into an extended metaphor borrowed from St. Paul
about how believers are part of the same body, equally important
but not interchangeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of the members is important,'' he said, ``so the
importance is to know, What is my role in the body, that is to say,
the church?'' Then he stopped and asked with a smile, ``Is that too
pious?''
</P>
<P>
   Before the pope's arrival, Schoenborn moved boldly to put to
rest a sex scandal that bred mass defections in an already
embattled church. His predecessor, Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, was
forced to resign in 1995 after allegations surfaced that he had
molested seminarians 20 years earlier. Groer, a conservative who
was appointed by the pope in 1986, left office without admitting
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   When a priest reopened the scandal with fresh charges this
January, another conservative Austrian bishop dismissed the priest,
unleashing another round of in-fighting.
</P>
<P>
   To smooth a path for the pope's visit, Schoenborn took the
extraordinary step in April of announcing that the allegations
about Groer were true and apologizing for his predecessor's
actions. (Groer, who retains his title but none of his
responsibilities, was sent to a monastery abroad while the pope was
in Austria.)
</P>
<P>
   Schoenborn may have disappointed some of Austria's more
conservative bishops but he won some credit with many of the
leadership's critics within the church.
</P>
<P>
   He preaches the need for dialogue, but he is not seen as someone
who supports the growing movement for democratization. ``He is a
very friendly man who listens to the people,'' said Paul Weitzer, a
member of a dissident Catholic lay group, ``but he moves not a
millimeter from his theological point.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenborn, a former theology professor who comes from a
wealthy, noble family, has already won the Vatican's trust. He was
assigned delicate diplomatic negotiations with the Russian Orthodox
Church in Moscow, and with other faiths. And in a clear signal of
papal favor, he was invited to preach at the pope's Lenten retreat
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   His youth, more than anything else, is cited as an obstacle to
being elected pope. Pope John Paul II has ruled for 20 years, and
there is the broad suspicion that in the next conclave, the
cardinals will choose an older successor likely to have a briefer
reign.
</P>
<P>
   Another test awaits Schoenborn in October, when a special
conference of 300 lay Catholics and clergymen is to vote on such
contested issues as priestly celibacy and the ordination of women.
The conference is likely to support positions that the pope has
long opposed; though it cannot act without Rome's approval, its
stance will be an important gauge of disaffection in the Austrian
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is possible,'' Schoenborn replied when asked if the
conference would vote in favor of allowing priests to marry. ``But
the most important question is, How do we live with these opinions
and desires?'' he said. ``We are in the Catholic Church, which has
taken a certain path. We will not chose a separate path for
Austria, so how do we live today the situation of a Catholic Church
of Austria that is part of the universal church?''

A COMPANY CELEBRATES A BIRTHDAY, DRAMATICALLY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sweden and its gleaming capital on the water, Stockholm, draw
tourists from all over the world. And yet international dance
audiences, especially Americans, know little about the Royal
Swedish Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   To fill in the gaps, and on the pretext of celebrating its
founding, in 1773, the company held a highly successful 225th
anniversary festival this month. This showcase of performances in
Stockholm, enhanced by an international lecture series, was a fine
time to throw away preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Royal Swedish Ballet should not be confused
with the Royal Danish Ballet. All Scandinavian ballet troupes with
royal patrons are not the same.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes have a living tradition, embodied in their great
19th-century choreographer August Bournonville. His ballets,
dependent on a precise classical style, were passed down from
generation to generation of dancers.
</P>
<P>
   True classicism is more problematical in the Royal Swedish
Ballet. Continuity in the company was broken more than once after
its founder, the arts-loving King Gustav III, was murdered at a
masked ball at the Royal Opera House in 1792 (an event that
inspired Verdi's opera ``Un Ballo in Maschera'').
</P>
<P>
   The captured assassin, who was opposed to the King's liberal
reforms (not his choice of repertory), had his hand and head
chopped off.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Royal Ballet seemed virtually headless as well.
There was no official ballet director from 1913 to 1920 and it was
common for a director, often foreign, to stay on for less than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this stream of eclectic influences, the Royal Swedes
have forged a style of their own, more rooted in dramatic
expression than classical virtuosity. No other ballet company today
comes within hailing distance of the Swedish dancers' intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Their projection, emotional and kinetic, was astonishing in
everything danced at the festival. This was especially true in
``Skating Rink,'' the most spectacular reconstruction on a bill
devoted to the ``lost'' works of Les Ballets Suedois, the Swedish
avant-garde troupe based in Paris from 1920 to 1925.
</P>
<P>
   At the festival's symposium, which included Swedish, American,
Danish and British speakers, I asked Anna Greta Stahle, the doyenne
of Stockholm's dance critics, if this emphasis on emotional
expressiveness came primarily from the dancers' schooling or their
repertory, which has featured many modern-dance pieces and
dance-dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Stahle's reply took another turn: ``I think it is in our
nature to be dramatic,'' she said. ``Our Danish friends think we
are quite strict, but actually we have something going on under the
surface. I can tell you that when Ingmar Bergman went to a village
and used the people there in a church for a film, he found he did
not need to direct them. They expressed what he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   One might question the national determinism of this view, but it
is logical in a country that has always favored drama and opera
over ballet. Gustav III was a playwright and amateur actor, not a
dancing king like Louis XIV. August Strindberg is a name more
familiar than Anders Selinder, who headed the Royal Swedish Ballet
from 1833 to 1845.
</P>
<P>
   Selinder was identified as ``the Swedish Bournonville'' in a
fine exhibition organized by Erik Naslund, director of the Swedish
Dance Museum. The show, including costumes, paintings and prints
from the museum, runs through next Sunday at Bukowski's auction
house, across from the Dramatic Theater, where Bergman has directed
many plays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet was Selinder really another Bournonville? The latter, as we
know through his extant ballets, remained true to classical
technique, not afraid to show off its brilliance. Selinder too was
interested in the ethos of Romantic ballet and like Bournonville,
sought to give his company a national profile.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he promoted Swedish folk dances in his ballets and
the June 13 gala that closed the festival included a folk duet in
his style by Pierre de Oliva. The question is whether even then,
the company was beginning do move away from pure classical style.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Swedish Ballet is a classically trained company but it
is not quite as classical as the Paris Opera Ballet, the New York
City Ballet, American Ballet Theater and the Kirov Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   This is most noticeable among the women whose toe work needs to
be strengthened, although obvious exceptions are Marie Lindqvist
and Anna Valev, who performed opposite the extraordinary
dancer-actor Jan-Erik Wikstrom in Kenneth MacMillan's
``Mayerling.''
</P>
<P>
   The men are stronger, showing perfect body placement and Goran
Svalberg, seen as the Everyman in John Neumeier's ``Mahler's Third
Symphony,'' is a true danseur noble. Yet the company's impact comes
through the commitment of each dancer's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Onne looked like a porcelain figure in an 18th-century
ballet about Harlequin and a dazzling, sexy flapper in ``Within the
Quota,'' one of the Ballets Suedois works. Ms. Lindqvist was
compelling as a midinette in ``Skating Rink'' and the
housemaid-turned-princess in Par Isberg's enchanting ``Nutcracker''
with a Swedish folk touch.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers like Wikstrom, Hans Nilsson and Anders Nordstrom
appeared spent after each performance. They never held back.
</P>
<P>
   This passion is understood by Frank Andersen, the former
director of the Royal Danish Ballet, who became the Royal Swedish
Ballet director in 1995. It was his idea to hold the festival and
to commission an entire evening of reconstructions of Jean Borlin's
choreography for Les Ballets Suedois.
</P>
<P>
   It was a magic magnet. Attracted by the idea of seeing ``lost''
ballets, the festival's visitors discovered an exciting company
that has strangely turned in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of its dancers appeared in New York in 1996 in a
tribute to the American choreographer Ulysses Dove and at the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival last year, the full company has not
performed here in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to make amends. The winner on the United States
tour would be the bill of Suedois reconstructions. These were put
into context at the symposium, most brilliantly by Bengt Hager, the
Dance Museum's founder whose exhibitions and writings since the
1960s sparked interest in the forgotten works that Borlin
choreographed for fellow fugitives from the Royal Swedish Ballet
before his death in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the stagings are of passing interest ``El Greco,'' which
recalls Borlin's occasional expressionism, is in a new version by
the Swedish choreographer Ivo Cremer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the Quota,'' staged by Millicent Hodson and Kenneth
Archer, is a revue-style satire of America to music by Cole Porter.
Ms. Hodson and Archer researched richer material for the trancelike
``Dervishes'' and the stunning ``Skating Rink,'' with images of
roller skaters fusing their geometric patterns into Fernand Leger's
Cubist designs.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Royal Danish Ballet, Andersen organized a
fine Bournonville Festival in 1992 and that event was the implicit
model for this festival. Yet it was not just a Bournonville
festival without Bournonville; Andersen and the Royal Swedish
Ballet pulled it off because they had something to give of their
own.

U.N. REPORT PAINTS GLOOMIEST PICTURE OF AIDS EPIDEMIC SINCE '81 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The scourge of AIDS now rivals the greatest epidemics
of history, particularly in areas of Africa where as many as one in
four adults has the virus, according to a U.N. report issued on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis of the disease, the
United Nations said that last year 30 million people worldwide were
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, and that 21 million were in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Countries south of the Sahara account for the world's 21 highest
rates of HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 years, the most sexually
active segment of the population. In 13 of those countries, HIV has
infected at least 10 percent of adults, and in Botswana and
Zimbabwe, a quarter of adults are infected, a rate that even an
expert described as ``shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released ahead of the 12th international AIDS
conference that begins here on Sunday, paints the gloomiest
pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is hitting Africa so fiercely that it now rivals the great
epidemics of history _ the Black Death of the Middle Ages that
killed 20 million people, or one-quarter of Europe's population, in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 that killed 20
million people, including half a million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But where plague and influenza killed in days, death from
untreated AIDS takes about a decade, making it a more silent
epidemic that officials have too easily ignored, AIDS officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HIV killed as rapidly as plague and influenza, the epidemic
would be controlled by now,'' Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the U.N.
AIDS Program, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report contained a glimmer of good news, showing a slowing
of infection rates in countries that have adopted strong prevention
programs, like Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot and other officials warned that South Africa, Namibia
and other African countries could soon reach a 25 percent adult
infection rate unless national leaders undertook similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates exceed one in three adults in some major African
cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in some prenatal
clinics. Many infected women pass the virus on to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of the Africans are doomed to die from
AIDS, the officials said, because they live in countries that
cannot afford the costly combinations of drugs that have helped
keep the virus in check among infected people in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The African figures compare to a worldwide adult HIV-infection
rate of 1 percent for adults and 0.76 percent in the United States.
Moreover, officials said, 90 percent of the African patients
probably do not know they are infected because testing is not
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide last year, 5.6 million people were newly infected
while 2.3 million died from AIDS. AIDS is now on the verge of
moving into the top five leading causes of death in the world,
overtaking diarrheal diseases. The viral infection now kills as
many people as malaria and is second only to tuberculosis, which
itself is a common complication of AIDS and a source of infection
to non-HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Piot, a Belgian who has worked with AIDS in third world
countries for more than 15 years, called the new HIV figures
staggering and said he was ``shocked'' when he learned that 25
percent of an entire country's adults were infected. At first, both
Piot and Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, the U.N. epidemiologist who
led the analysis, said they suspected a statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   But checking found them accurate and erring on the side of
underestimates, they said. It took the U.N. AIDS program more than
a year to gather and verify the figures with each country, and the
figures on AIDS are considered the most reliable of any
international health statistics, Piot said. Health officials have
been hampered since AIDS was first recognized in 1981 in getting a
handle on such information because of the notoriously poor quality
of health statistics in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said the epidemic could eventually be controlled if other
countries matched successful prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda was the first country to respond to a massive burden of
HIV infection, and the African country has cut HIV prevalence more
than a quarter, to 9.5 percent in 1997 from 13 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, which has experienced what the U.N. said was probably
the best documented epidemic in the developing world, has cut its
prevalence by nearly 15 percent _ to 2.3 percent in 1997 from 2.7
percent in 1994. A drop in new infections was noted especially
among sex workers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the industrialized world, reductions of this magnitude
are virtually unheard of,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal instituted campaigns for safer sex that has kept its
infection rate at about 2 percent. ``Senegal acted before it had a
major problem, but there are not enough of those countries,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than money will be needed to match such efforts
elsewhere, Piot said. ``The overriding need is political courage _
deciding to move ahead with effective approaches despite cultural
constraints such as promotion of condom use, sex education in
schools and widespread health education programs,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   As HIV is spread, it insinuates itself into communities little
troubled in the past and strengthens its grip on areas where AIDS
is already the leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, the infection rate has more than doubled to 25.1
percent in 1997 from 10 percent in 1992. Surveys have found 43
percent of pregnant women infected in 1997 in the major urban
center of Francistown. In 1995 in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,
32 percent of pregnant women were infected.
</P>
<P>
   In one town on the Zimbabwe-South African border, 70 percent of
women attending prenatal clinics in 1995 were found to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   HIV rates are lower in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America.
But an alarming trend is the doubling and tripling of transmission
rates in some countries in these areas since 1994. ``Because over
half the world's population lives in the region, small differences
in rates can make a huge difference in the absolute numbers of
people infected,'' the U. N. report said.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing alarm about the widening gap in infection and
death rates between industrialized and developing countries, Piot
said the gap ``shines the spotlight on the have-nots of the
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. group attributed the gap to inadequate measures to stop
transmission of HIV and to make available the combinations of
anti-HIV drugs that help forestall development of deadly
AIDS-related infections and cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, deaths from HIV left 1.6 million children without at
least one parent. From the time the epidemic was first recognized
in 1981 to the beginning of 1998, 8.2 million children lost their
mothers to AIDS. Many also lost their fathers as well. In East
Africa, 40 percent of children 15 or younger have lost their mother
or both parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the number of orphans grows and the number of potential
caregivers shrinks, traditional coping mechanisms stretch to the
breaking point,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. AIDS program cited four reasons why the infection rates
are so high in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One is that more women of childbearing age are HIV infected in
Africa than elsewhere. A second is that African women have more
children on average than those in other continents. Thus, one
infected woman may pass the virus on to a higher average number of
children.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that nearly all children in Africa are
breastfed, which is thought to account for between a third and a
half of all HIV transmission from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth reason is that new drugs are less readily available
than in industrialized world. Also, other sexually transmitted
diseases are known to speed transmission of AIDS and may go
untreated in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. said it saw early warning signs that epidemics of
similar magnitude could occur among Asian countries, where HIV has
been a relative latecomer. However, the report said the figures for
Asia are less reliable than elsewhere because only a few Asian
countries have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the
spread of the virus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   India has the largest number of HIV-infected people _ 4 million
_ in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One survey in Pondicherry found four percent of pregnant women
infected. The prevalence of infection among truck drivers in Madras
quadrupled to 6.2 percent in 1996 from 1.5 percent in 1995. In
Manipure state, 73 percent of the patients in a clinic for
injecting drug users were infected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although HIV has infected less than 1 percent of adults in
India, the figure is 10 times higher than in neighboring China.
</P>
<P>
   Two major epidemics are occurring in China, the U.N. said. One
is among injecting drug users. The other is among heterosexuals in
the prosperous eastern seaboard where prostitution is re-emerging
as the gap grows between rich and poor. The incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases has soared in recent years. Health officials
regard the trend in sexually transmitted diseases as a warning sign
of HIV rates because sexually transmitted diseases can enhance its
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report also includes the first country-by-country
information about the availability and use of condoms. But on
condom use, the report's tables contain many blanks _ purposeful by
challenging national leaders to take tougher stands on controlling
HIV infection, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   With a vaccine against HIV a distant hope, Piot said that ``AIDS
is with us to stay for a long time.''

NATO EXPANSION WINS NARROW APPROVAL IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Italian Parliament voted in favor of NATO expansion
on Tuesday, averting a political showdown that was the most serious
threat to the government's stability to date.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Romano Prodi won a reprieve when a small centrist
opposition party threw him its support at the last minute and his
conservative opposition abstained. But the bitter fight was the
strongest signal yet that the political unity that helped Italy
wage an uphill fight for membership in the European Monetary Union
this year fractured almost as soon as that battle was won.
</P>
<P>
   Had Prodi failed to get the necessary support on such an
important foreign policy matter, he might have been forced to offer
his resignation. ``We cannot reply with a refusal to this request
from Eastern Europe to expand NATO,'' the Prime minister pleaded in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet bloc countries _ including the three new members,
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic _ cannot join NATO unless
all 16 members of the military alliance vote to approve the move.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign policy disputes were not really the driving force
behind the crisis; domestic political maneuvering was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign policy really doesn't mean anything in Italian
politics today,'' said Patrick McCarthy, a professor of political
science in Bologna. ``What this measures is the stability of the
government. This is the first of what are likely to be many
so-called crises.''
</P>
<P>
   Prodi's center-left coalition relies on a less than loyal
Communist Refounding Party for a majority in Parliament, and those
hard-line leftists oppose many of the government's economic
austerity commitments, as well as NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right opposition, led by the media tycoon Silvio
Berlusconi, supports NATO expansion, but it is so eager to see
Prodi tumble that its leaders said they would vote for it only on
the condition that Prodi promise to resign after the vote. Prodi
declined to make such a bargain, and held a meetings with
opposition groups for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, finally chose to abstain from
the vote rather than support Prodi. The vote was delayed until 6
p.m. on Tuesday for the back-room consultations, which conveniently
also gave members of the lower house time to view Italy's afternoon
match against Austria in the World Cup soccer championship.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts say in all seriousness that Prodi was helped
by Italy's victory, which provided even the fractious Parliament
with a quick boost of patriotic pride.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi became prime minister in 1996, pledging to tame the
Italian economy, reduce public debt and meet the fiscal
requirements for inclusion in a single European currency. Italians,
who feared that exclusion would condemn them to third-world status,
supported the government's policy of new taxes and spending cuts,
as did a range of labor unions, political parties and business
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Refounding Party forced Prodi to offer his
resignation in 1997 during a dispute over budget cuts. Back then,
its own rank-and-file members were so outraged by the threat to
government stability _ and European membership _ that they forced
the leadership to craft a compromise that would keep Prodi in
office.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Communist Refounding Party refused to vote for
NATO enlargement, no longer fearing that ordinary party members
would object. Italian leftists are generally pacifists who have
long opposed the military alliance, and many ordinary Italians have
expressed reservations about NATO, particularly after American
pilots flying jets on a NATO exercise severed a cable at a ski
resort in the Dolomites in February, killing more than 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance put up by both Prodi's allies and his opponents
could be a harbinger of political and economic trouble in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Italy goes back to its old habit of bringing down
governments,'' McCarthy said, ``financial markets will get very
irritated, and so will Italy's European partners.''

   MARSEILLE, France _ Norway had just stunned Brazil with two late
goals, but Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo, whose team already had
clinched first place in Group A before this 2-1 setback, was intent
on accentuating the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost at the right time,'' Zagallo said.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan team certainly did not agree. When the final
whistle was blown after its comprehensive 3-0 victory over Scotland
in Saint Etienne, the Moroccan players were smiling and exchanging
jerseys with their opponents, convinced that they, not the
Norwegians, would be joining Brazil in the second round from Group
A.
</P>
<P>
   The games between Morocco and Scotland and Norway and Brazil had
begun at the same time, and the last news the Moroccans had heard
was that Brazil was leading. Considering the fact that even a draw
would have been enough for Morocco to advance, this was rather
reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   But inexorably the final update from Marseille trickled onto the
field in Saint Etienne. Moroccan coach Henri Michel already had
kicked his bench in frustration, and soon his players' smiles were
giving way to anguished expressions and tears. Norway not only had
tied the score with a goal from its long-limbed striker Tore Andre
Flo in the 83rd minute, they had won with a penalty kick from
Kjetil Rekdal in the 88th after a highly debatable foul was called
on Brazilian defender Junior Baiano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all understand that what happened is rather
incredible,'' said Norwegian coach Egil ``Drillo'' Olsen, who shed
some tears of his own in a post-match interview.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil might have won Group A with six points, but Norway was
the only team to emerge from the group undefeated. After two
disappointing draws, the Norwegians' upset of the defending
champions allowed them to finish with five points, one more than
Morocco. The Brazilians, who never lost on their way to the title
in 1994, will face Chile in the second round on Saturday; the
Norwegians will face Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been thinking a lot about that match,'' Olsen
said. ``We have to come back to earth very quickly.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since taking over the national team in 1990, Olsen has used his
tactical and psychological gifts to transform Norway from a soccer
backwater into a soccer power whose citizens care as much about his
sport as they do about winter sports. He has not done it by
emphasizing ``the beautiful game''. Aime Jacquet, the French coach,
once said that Norway ``has a gift for making its opponents play
badly.'' Olsen's team does it with a 5-4-1 alignment, with Flo as
the lone striker and the four midfielders turning into four more
defenders as soon as trouble looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian scheme clogs up passing lanes and minds, and in a
friendly match last May, it clogged up the Brazilians in Oslo.
Olsen's team won 4-2, putting an end to Brazil's 34-match unbeaten
streak, and though Tuesday's match was meaningless in theory for
Brazil, the memory of that defeat gave the Brazilians a reason to
care about the result. ``I wish them lots and lots and lots of
luck,'' said Brazil's left fullback Roberto Carlos before the
match.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil took the lead in the 78th minute when Denilson, the
world's most expensive player, burst through the Norwegian defense,
regained his feet after being tripped, and launched a cross that
Bebeto headed into the Norwegian goal.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen immediately substituted Flo's brother Jostein Flo for
Vidar Riseth and had his players push forward. ``We knew the result
of the other match with Morocco, and we knew we had to take
risks,'' Olsen said. Five minutes later, Tore Andre got past Junior
Baiano and tied the score with a right-footed blast. He would get
two more decent opportunities in the next five minutes, but it
would take a very questionable decision from American referee
Esfandiar Baharmast to give the Norwegians their second goal.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Mykland, another of Olsen's second-half substitutions,
launched a cross into the box. Tore Andre appeared to fall
backwards into Baiano as the Brazilian defender leaped to head the
cross. Baharmast signaled for a penalty, which Rekdal converted
with a calm that his fellow citizens would not share as they
joyfully streamed into the streets of Oslo to celebrate.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS AGREE TO CHANGE ON CAPITAL GAINS TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (See also CONGRESS-TAX-BREAK, CONGRESS-SPEND) 
(th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders agreed Tuesday on a plan to
give investors a break on capital gains taxes, attaching the
measure to an overhaul of the Internal Revenue Service that appears
headed toward speedy final passage.
</P>
<P>
   The change, agreed to over several days of negotiations among
members of both parties, would reduce to 12 months from 18 months
the period that investors must hold stocks, bonds and other assets
to qualify for the most favorable capital gains tax rate. The
change would be retroactive, effective for all sales after Jan. 1,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 18-month holding period was included in last year's
tax law at the Clinton administration's insistence in an effort to
reward long-term investment and discourage speculation,
administration officials said Tuesday night that they expected the
president to sign the new legislation after final passage by both
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders are trying to keep their tax-cutting efforts
in the limelight as they begin gearing up for the congressional
elections this fall. So, now that they have won agreement to reduce
the holding period necessary for the most favorable tax rate on
capital gains, they plan to turn to efforts to reduce the rate
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich will propose on Wednesday that the top
rate on capital gains be reduced to 15 percent from 20 percent,
adding the proposal to an already lengthy tax-cutting wish list
that Republicans have yet to find the money to pay for.
</P>
<P>
   The change to the capital gains holding period was one of a
number of issues settled Tuesday as House and Senate negotiators
reconciled the slightly differing versions of the IRS overhaul bill
passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by both chambers.
Republican leaders said they expected the final version of the bill
to gain passage in the House this week and in the Senate next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would set in motion the most sweeping overhaul of the
tax collection agency in four decades. It would create an
independent oversight board, provide taxpayers a range of new legal
protections in disputes with the IRS and spur a broad internal
reorganization of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   It was precisely the bill's broad bipartisan support, and the
likelihood that President Clinton would not dare veto it, that
emboldened Republicans to add the provision that would shorten the
capital gains holding period.
</P>
<P>
   The provision was proposed by Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, who early this year
made the change a top legislative priority.
</P>
<P>
   Archer said the measure would make calculating capital gains
simpler for millions of people who this year had to grapple with a
three-tier rate system that many taxpayers complained was
excessively complex.
</P>
<P>
   But it also amounted to a tax cut for those people who sold
stocks or other assets after holding them for more than a year but
less than 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's tax law, gains on investments held for under
12 months were taxed as ordinary income. Gains on investments held
from 12 to 18 months were taxed as ordinary income, but only up to
a maximum of 28 percent. Gains on investments held 18 months or
more were taxed at a maximum of 20 percent, except for people in
the 15 percent income tax bracket, who faced a maximum capital
gains rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Tuesday's agreement becomes law, gains on investments
held less than a year would be considered short term and would be
taxed as ordinary income, while gains on investments held a year or
more would be subject to the 10 percent capital gains rate for
people in the 15 percent income tax bracket and the 20 percent
maximum capital gains rate for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has not yet determined how many people paid the
intermediate rate in calculating their taxes for 1997. For 1996,
the most recent year for which figures are available, 16.6 million
tax returns included a capital gain. About 40 percent of households
are estimated to own stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Capital gains taxes have been debated by economists and
politicians for decades, and have been the source of bitter
political disputes between Democrats, who say cutting the rate
amounts to a giveaway to the rich, and Republicans, who say that
lower rates spur investment and help improve the economy's
long-term growth capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing a rate cut, Gingrich seems determined to reopen
that debate. Aides said he will argue that Congress has more room
to cut capital gains taxes than official revenue estimates would
suggest because Congress has consistently underestimated how much
revenue will flow into government coffers following a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe that capital gains is no longer an
issue only for the wealthy, given the widespread stock holdings
among the middle class. But Republicans have already promised to
push this year for a reduction in the so-called marriage penalty,
the provisions in the tax code that yield a higher tax bill for
many two-income couples than for two single people with the same
incomes. They are also pressing for reductions in estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has signaled his opposition to any large-scale tax
cut this year. And Republicans are feuding among themselves over
how deeply they are willing to cut. &QL;

`CHOCOLATE-SMEARED WOMAN': THERE'S STILL NO VANILLA IN A FINLEY
ENCOUNTER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Much attention has been given to Karen Finley's body,
or at least to what she does with it in public. In her new
performance piece, ``The Return of the Chocolate-Smeared Woman,''
now at the Flea Theater in Manhattan, every inch of that body is
visible. And yes, it is again lathered up in some chocolatey
substance (you can tell that it's chocolate by the smell), a
not-so-sentimental nod to the routine that made her a figure of
angry debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Finley's raw, singular style finally has less to do with
her naked body than with her voice. Or rather, one should say,
voices. There are several of them: a breathy, Marilyn-like purr; a
dominating, nasal bark; an eardrum-wounding scream; and an aching,
evangelical moan.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Finley shifts among these voices, often with an impatient
abruptness, as though none of them really fit, each seems connected
to the others in a dangerous, frustrating chain of identities.
Sexual passivity turns into sexual aggression, which escalates into
strident, out-of-control anger. The end of this cycle, with the
voice that Ms. Finley does best, is usually pain, shame and an
unspeakable sorrow. It is by no means the sound of a self-centered
crybaby; it has a wide, appalled reach of empathy.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Ms. Finley continues to deserve attention in ways
that go beyond her status as the object of the wrath of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and others who held her up as an example of how the
National Endowment for the Arts was misspending its funds. ``The
Return of the Chocolate-Smeared Woman,'' directed (as much as one
directs Ms. Finley) by Jim Simpson for the Bat Theater Company and
featuring a sort of backup group of swimwear-clad dancers called
the Furballs, isn't always easy to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finley's mission, after all, is to make people
uncomfortable. This is achieved not only through anatomical
explicitness, both physical and verbal, but by her insistence on
being the opposite of a polished performer. ``Return'' is
punctuated throughout with acts of self-sabotage. Ms. Finley
frequently interrupts her monologues, which she reads from loose
sheets of paper, to criticize herself before starting over. She
demands that the audience, which sits on plastic buckets because
the Flea Theater is being renovated, share her self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``This is experimental theater!'' &LR;  she yells, by way of
explanation, after asking someone near the stage to readjust a
music stand for her. Wearing nothing but bikini briefs, a pink
feather boa, silver spiked heels and the obligatory coat of
chocolate, she hawks the chance to taste that coat for $20 a lick.
(She says she needs taxi fare.)
</P>
<P>
   Only one person obliged the night I saw the show: a young man
who had only $7 and change. Ms. Finley accepted his bid and told
the man, who had put his tongue on the middle of her leg, that he
could go higher if he wanted to. He did.
</P>
<P>
   That accomplished, Ms. Finley proceeds to explore the chafed
underbelly of this sort of self-objectification. She tells stories,
in rough-hewn prose, of alcoholism and the value of ugliness and
butchered veal calves and rape and self-mutilation. She delivers an
overly long fantasy sequence in which she is the much-sought-after
erotic plaything of politicians who include Helms, President
Clinton, and Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.; she describes their
particular tastes in unstinting detail. You can only imagine what
Helms, in Ms. Finley's version of him, is into. Revenge takes
unlikely forms.
</P>
<P>
   As sexual as much of this is, none of it is sexy. In Ms.
Finley's world, kinks and fetishism are born of childhood abuse,
emotional neglect and anger. She has traveled this territory
before, and there's not much new in ``Return.'' It's basically a
declaration that she is still here. She includes a couple of
``greatest hits'' routines, both loud laments for the anguished
outcasts of a humiliation-driven society; they remain her strongest
material.
</P>
<P>
   Despite (or because of) the publicity she has received, and
despite her fiercely vivid presence, Ms. Finley is still not a
widely marketable commodity. Other performance artists, she notes
(in her screaming voice), have gotten their own HBO specials. She
has met with a number of agents, she says, one of whom proposed she
appear in a female version of ``Animal House.'' Ms. Finley was
right to think the agent misunderstood her sensibility. Though she
can on occasion be very funny indeed, Ms. Finley is not fun. Life,
as she limns it, is too brutal to enjoy.
</P>

NORTH KOREAN SUB SINKS UNDER SOUTH KOREAN TOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korea protested on Tuesday the incursion of a
North Korean sub into its waters but lost control of the vessel
when a towing cable broke and it sank to the sea bottom.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean naval forces were towing the 60-foot submarine
under intensive security Tuesday morning when the cable broke. The
sub was then within a mile of the shore, and South Korean officials
said that the boat was only about 100 feet down and that they would
try to raise her as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Several North Korean crew members had been believed aboard, but
there has been speculation that they may have committed suicide to
avoid capture. If they are alive and on board, South Korean
officials said, they could still be rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, the latest bizarre episode in the odyssey of
inter-Korean relations, began on Monday afternoon when a South
Korean fishing boat spotted a dark green sub with the periscope
entangled in drift nets 11 miles off the South Korean coast. The
fishermen saw officers from the submarine as they frantically tried
to cut the nets and radioed the authorities. The South Korean navy
arrived in a rush to seize the sub.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea towed the sub in an intensive military operation to
make sure that there was no North Korean rescue attempt. But the
South Korean navy had apparently overlooked the need for a strong
enough cable to tow the 70-ton sub.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, there was a loud noise heard at one point from
inside the sub, possibly an attempt by the crew to kill themselves
or to destroy the interior before South Korean and American
intelligence analysts could examine it.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea accused the North of a provocation that violated the
armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War. But tensions seemed to
ease a bit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that the sub had dropped off infiltrators
or was planning to, and it was well offshore and not far south of
the line that divides North and South Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not directly commented on the seizure. But it
issued an unusual statement Tuesday asserting that it had lost a
submarine and was wondering where it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that North Korea was ``now searching for the
submarine and its crew.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea did not need to search very hard. Generals from the
United States and other countries on the U.N. side of the Korean
War raised the intrusion in discussions Tuesday with North Korean
counterparts in the border town of Panmunjon, along the
demilitarized zone that divides the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of the intrusion on North-South relations are
unclear. While it will add to suspicions in the South about North
Korea's intentions and, perhaps, make conciliatory efforts by
President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea more difficult, the tone of
the latest South Korean news reports and official comments has not
been particularly hostile.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the reaction to a submarine incursion in 1996 was
furious. But in that case the North Korean sub ran aground, and
heavily armed commandos slipped ashore. After a series of
firefights, all but one commando were killed or captured.

TEXAS COURT THROWS OUT PLANNED PARENTHOOD LAWSUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a
Planned Parenthood lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of a
state law that would have withheld state funding for birth control
and other prescription pills for minors without parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   The court, however, stopped short of actually determining
whether the law is unconstitutional. The justices ruled only that
state District Judge Scott McCown of Austin had jumped the gun when
he ruled that way last year.
</P>
<P>
   In August, McCown found in a lawsuit brought by Planned
Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas Inc. that the parental
consent law violated the state constitution's ban on amending or
repealing general law through the budget. That was because
lawmakers had added it as a last-minute provision to the state
spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, however, said McCown's ruling was premature
because it was based on hypothetical arguments about what could or
might happen rather than on any real loss of funds or services.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, Tuesday's ruling is expected to have little or no
impact on minors' ability to get prescriptions without a parent's
consent because the Texas Department of Health had already found a
way to abide by the letter of the law without curtailing services.
The department simply shifted the source of funding for such
services to federal programs that did not require state matching
funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means that there's no parental consent requirement and
everything goes on like it always did, getting funded,'' said David
Duggins, an attorney who had represented Planned Parenthood.
``We're kind of pleased. We feel like we've accomplished our goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we would have preferred that the court go ahead and
say this is unconstitutional, affirm Judge McCown's ruling, but
absent that this pretty much gets us where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas provides family planning services to about 7,500 minors a
year, said Health Department spokesman Doug McBride. Prior to the
rider in the 1997 spending bill, Texas had paid for such services
from state Medicaid funds, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In writing for the majority, Justice Deborah Hankinson wrote,
``A case is not ripe when its resolution depends on contingent or
hypothetical facts, or upon events that have not yet come to
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood had argued that the state law jeopardized
more than $90 million in federal aid for Texas because federal
regulations prohibit any requirement for parental consent. But the
justices noted that no federal funds had been cut off and federal
officials had not indicated what they would do if Texas implemented
its current policy of paying for such services entirely from
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record does not support Planned Parenthood's assertions,''
the majority opinion said. It cited Health Department testimony
before McCown that Planned Parenthood and its clients would
experience no change in services, but that only the funding source
would be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This testimony is not sufficient to support the conclusion
that harm to Planned Parenthood is imminent,'' the court found.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Raul Gonzalez, in a concurring opinion, said he would
have barred Planned Parenthood from filing suit in the first place
because Planned Parenthood has no standing to represent the
interests of minor children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Texas law ... only the parents or guardians of a minor
may represent their legal interests,'' Gonzalez wrote. Justice Greg
Abbott joined Gonzalez in the concurrence.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Gonzalez said Planned Parenthood ``does not
identify any implicit right or entitlement owing it under the Texas
Constitution or (state law) ... even if federal funds are cut
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Last session, state lawmakers added a last-minute rider in the
800-page budget bill that required parental consent before state
funds could be used to provide birth control, medications for
sexually transmitted diseases or any other prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Nenney, a vice president of Planned Parenthood, said the
Health Department, while continuing prescriptions for minors, is
taking money from funds intended to provide family planning
programs for low-income women.
</P>
<P>
   ``TDH, to their credit, is doing everything they can to keep
services available to teens,'' Nenney said. ``There is a huge clash
here between good public health policy and the will of the
Legislature, which is counter to the will of the people of Texas
who support family planning services to women of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a ridiculous effort on the part of the Texas
Legislature. It's bad public policy and the Texas Department of
Health knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, who sponsored the parental
consent provision, said it is ``a small but significant victory''
that the court didn't find the rider unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden told The Associated Press that he hopes the ruling will
spur the 1999 Legislature into action. &QL;

 &HT;    Ga. newborns to get soothing music
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a news conference in his office today, Georgia Gov.
Zell Miller plans to present a newborn with a copy of ``Build Your
Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The classical music album, a pet project of Miller's, will be
handed out to all new Georgia parents, starting in July. It's being
provided free to the state by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing albums for babies, Miller cites studies showing
classical music can stimulate babies' brain development and, as
children grow, help them excel in math. Classical music is also
considered soothing to fussy infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the children of Georgia were the smartest
anywhere. With this program, we can now give them an even greater
head start,'' Miller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Liner notes on the album include a short note from the governor
urging parents to play the music for their children.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Ga. newborns to get soothing music
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At a news conference in his office today, Georgia Gov.
Zell Miller plans to present a newborn with a copy of ``Build Your
Baby's Brain Through the Power of Music.''
</P>
<P>
   The classical music album, a pet project of Miller's, will be
handed out to all new Georgia parents, starting in July. It's being
provided free to the state by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   In proposing albums for babies, Miller cites studies showing
classical music can stimulate babies' brain development and, as
children grow, help them excel in math. Classical music is also
considered soothing to fussy infants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought the children of Georgia were the smartest
anywhere. With this program, we can now give them an even greater
head start,'' Miller said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Liner notes on the album include a short note from the governor
urging parents to play the music for their children.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, including conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh,
laughed when Miller announced his proposal in January. But Sony
took him seriously and offered to produce and distribute the albums
at no cost to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The first shipment of cassettes and CDs is expected to arrive at

ANALYSIS: RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN REPORTERS AND PROSECUTORS IS SUBTLE
AND MESSY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is one of the least talked about corners of journalism: the
relationship of reporters and their prosecution sources. But the
debate in recent days over how much and what kind of information
the independent counsel Kenneth Starr gave reporters about his
investigation of the president has put an uncomfortable spotlight
on the ties between journalists and prosecutors, ties that often
lead to information and sometimes to misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rules that strictly limit what prosecutors are permitted
to say publicly, there is a steady stream of reports describing
investigations and prosecutions across the country. Those news
accounts almost always appear orderly and certain.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews, reporters and former prosecutors said the
process was far more subtle and messy than it appeared. It is
built, some of them said, on often unspoken pacts among people who
advance their careers by getting information before the public.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, prosecutors are able to enhance their
crime-fighting image by reassuring the public that troubling cases
are being investigated. For intensely competitive reporters, leaks
by definition provide an edge over those from other news
organizations and even within their own newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The subtleties of the process, some of the reporters and former
prosecutors said, help explain how information about Starr's
investigation could have reached reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this image that you call a prosecutor and say
`What are you working on?' and they spill,'' said Joel Kaplan, an
investigative reporter for years in Tennessee and Chicago who is
now chairman of the newspaper department at the S.I. Newhouse
School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. ``That
never happens. It's really a dance and it is often a matter of
having personal relationships built up over a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on prosecutions often involves journalists piecing
together fragments of information, bluffing that they know more
than they do and appealing to ego as well as altruism. Many
prosecutors are extremely reluctant to provide even the most basic
information to journalists, with some keeping reporters at arm's
length.
</P>
<P>
   More often than most people realize, reporters said, it is
defense lawyers who provide information, some that may even appear
damaging to their own clients. Then reporters often get figurative
winks from prosecutors or prosecution investigators to confirm
accounts assembled from many sources.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process that often involves the intuition of a reporter.
The reporter might feel, for example, that the self-interest of a
prosecutor or a mid-level investigator could be served by a
detailing of some aspect of an investigation. Or the reporter might
sense that a defense lawyer wants to provide a fuller account of a
damning detail so that blame is spread more widely.
</P>
<P>
   It is a to-and-fro that has existed for decades, becoming an art
form in the Watergate era and advancing to even higher levels of
refinement in the investigation-clogged Clinton era. It is a
process, some journalists said, that shows why reporters, who need
prosecutors to get their articles and broadcast reports, rarely
scrutinize prosecutors as rigorously as they do other public
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The current intense focus on prosecution-press ties began when
Starr was quoted in an article in a new media magazine, Brill's
Content, acknowledging that he briefed reporters. Starr was then
attacked by presidential aides, which led his allies to say he had
to give information to reporters to counter a campaign of press
manipulation from the White House. Besieged by critics, Starr
attacked the article's author, Steven Brill, saying Brill had
distorted his comments.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whose
relationship with the president is being investigated, the
accusations from both the White House and Starr's office that the
other organization is disclosing information represent a typical
pattern in high-profile cases. Each side tries to tailor new
reports to make its cause appear more just and to counter
disclosures from the other.
</P>
<P>
   Several former prosecutors said it could be tempting to disclose
information to help an investigation. A startling news report can
signal the strength of a case and persuade a defendant to testify
against others. In the insider-trading cases that rocked Wall
Street in the 1980s, a drumbeat of news reports appeared to help
persuade traders and investment bankers to turn on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Often, mid-level prosecutors or investigators have some reason
to talk. They may hope to goad superiors to be more aggressive in
an investigation or to try to make their agencies look good, some
of the former prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the government,'' said Thomas Puccio, who was
the chief prosecutor in the so-called Abscam investigation of
members of Congress in the early 1980s, ``the investigative
agencies, particularly the FBI, viewed their success in getting big
budgets from Congress as tied to how much positive publicity they
got.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Scafidi, a spokesman for the FBI, said he would not
comment on what happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the FBI and most investigative agencies,'' Scafidi said,
``are not going to initially give information that's going to ruin
an investigation or damage someone's reputation. But if someone has
leaked and we're getting calls for verification, sometimes we will
discuss things with reporters so they have a context; we don't want
wrong information going out.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers, some reporters say, often begin the process by
telling reporters about investigations involving their clients or
providing details about cases that have already attracted some
attention. The motivations range from vanity to attempts at
management of the news. Defense lawyers are not subject to the
strict limitations that apply to prosecutors and are often privy to
extensive information.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers compete with each other for clients and they
often benefit from warm relations with reporters. A reporter might
not name a lawyer in an article concerning information obtained
this way but might mention the lawyer in some other context that
would help cement a reputation as an important legal player.
</P>
<P>
   The reporters and the defense lawyers often see themselves as
members of the permanent establishment, several reporters said,
with the lawyers' clients mere transients. Sometimes, those
reporters said, defense lawyers seem to be disclosing information
that might be harmful to their clients or other people purely to
build their relationships with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters pursue those relationships as well as relationships
with prosecutors because such ties, as much as hard information,
are their stock-in-trade and a means to their own advancement. In
newsrooms, where it is sometime impolitic to bandy about the names
of sources too publicly, reporters often speak of a prosecution or
defense lawyer who is supplying information as ``my guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal ambition is one motivation, but defense lawyers also
use the disclosures to advance strategies for their clients. It is
possible to diminish the impact of negative information about a
client if it comes out before the announcement of an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   From a prosecutor's vantage point, the defense ``spin'' can be
harmful. Among other things, it can influence potential or sitting
jurors, said John Volz, who was the U.S. attorney in New Orleans
for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Volz said he never disclosed secret grand jury information. But
he said he often spoke to reporters, both for attribution and as an
unidentified source, and believed most prosecutors did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the defense puts out a story, they put their spin on it,''
Volz said, ``and I think someone from the government has an
obligation to step forward and correct the misinformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Possley, a reporter for The Chicago Tribune, said top
prosecutors were often ambitious, and as such were savvy about the
details of news coverage. They often recognize, he said, that
because of the nature of journalistic competition, a news
organization will more prominently display an article if it has it
exclusively rather than from an official announcement that goes to
all news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   On rare occasions, some reporters said, a prosecutor's desire to
get information out is so strong that the prosecutor will present
an entire account of an investigation to a reporter. One senior
Washington journalist who spoke on the condition of anonymity
recalled that a federal prosecutor who was investigating a friend
of the governor of the prosecutor's state described his
investigation with a promise of anonymity. The prosecutor told the
journalist he had been receiving political pressure from Washington
to curtail his investigation and said he believed news coverage of
the investigation would make such pressure too risky.
</P>
<P>
   Far more common, the reporters said, is a back-and-forth in
which reporters use clues to try to assemble a version of events.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Pound, a longtime investigative reporter at several of
the country's big newspapers who is now at USA Today in Washington,
said he often spoke to investigators or mid-level prosecutors,
checking out tidbits he had learned from defense lawyers and other
sources.
</P>
<P>
   He said he often pieced together an account from six or seven
people and then called someone he knew who was working on the case
for the government. ``I'll say, `Am I there yet?' And they'll wave
you in the right direction once you've done your homework.''
</P>
<P>
   Several former prosecutors said that among federal prosecutors
there was strong social and professional pressure to conform to
Justice Department guidelines prohibiting the disclosure of grand
jury information.
</P>
<P>
   But even among those who said they had never disclosed such
information to reporters, there was widespread acknowledgment that
other prosecutors violated the rules. Some suspected abuses lead to
internal investigations in prosecutors' offices, but they rarely
uncover the source of the disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it is prosecutor's ego,'' said Gregory Wallance, a
former federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, N.Y. ``They think they can
present what they're doing in a more flattering light'' through
leaks.
</P>
<P>
   When Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York was the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan in the 1980s, he heatedly denied that he had leaked
information. But the allegations were so extensive that some judges
attacked him for the tactic in their court opinions.
</P>
<P>
   One judge, Kevin Thomas Duffy, wrote bitterly that Giuliani had
pressed to remove the judge from an important corruption case
because of ``my long-established and often stated belief that cases
should be tried in the courtroom and not in the newspapers.''

 &HT;    Fate delivered title to Janzen
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't just win a U.S. Open. You survive it. It is a mental,
more than physical grind, for seven days. From the moment a player
settles his spikes into the turf of a U.S. Open venue on the first
practice day, he knows that his life indeed might never be the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about winning when I teed off (Sunday),''
Lee Janzen said later that afternoon through a haze of tears. ``I
figured I'd be too nervous if I thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who already had won a U.S. Open five years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine if Janzen had missed the green at the 18th Sunday.
Or yanked the 3-footer for par. There are no gimmes in a U.S. Open.
There are no favorites. Fate, not the USGA, handles all official
rulings. Janzen's ball drops out of a tree. Payne Stewart's
trickles into a divot filled with sand. No different than Tom
Lehman's drive on the 18th at Oakland Hills in '96, bouncing into
the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces take over. It happens every year. For three days
Janzen and The Olympic Club's cruel 17th hole are as compatible as
sourdough and ketchup. He manages a bogey, followed by two
double-bogeys. Sunday Janzen two-putts for par when his legs should
have gone Goodyear. On 18, the scariest short hole in golf, he
eventually stands over a 3-footer and, gasp, thinks the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I putted out the short putt, I thought, `This could be
it. This could be the putt that would win the U.S. Open,''' he
said. ``That's the last thing you want to say to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, ask Scott Hoch or Hubert Green, who each lost a Masters
because of putts that are kicked away in your Saturday foursome.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the 98th U.S. Open, it also becomes apparent
that:
</P>
<P>
   _ For everything that golf's more recent, earth-toned,
mostly-hip fashions have done to destroy old stereotypes, Payne
Stewart sets back the process a few years every time he shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, should a man dressed like a thermos win a U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   _ For all of Colin Montgomerie's attitude, some of what bothers
him at major championships is not self-inflicted. A fan called him
``fat boy'' last week. Another said, ``Go home, Monty.'' When the
Scot asked who said that, the fellow identified himself at the
ropes. When Monty asked why, the man said, ``Because of the Ryder
Cup.'' Replied Montgomerie, ``The only thing that happened at the
Ryder Cup is that our guys beat your guys.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Casey Martin is the real deal. In his first U.S. Open, despite
all the mess about which cart might keep him from flipping over,
Martin tied for 23rd and finished two shots better than Mark
O'Meara, the Masters champion. You will see Martin again on the PGA
Tour next week at the Greater Hartford Open, where he accepted a
sponsor exemption.

   Duval appearance too late
</P>
<P>
   David Duval's game only appeared on alternating days at Olympic
_ 75-68-75-69. Unhappy with the way he struck the ball even during
the 68, Duval took his first full attempt on the range Sunday
morning and declared, ``Well, it's nice my golf swing finally
decided to show up.'' Although never a tournament factor, Duval,
with a tie for seventh that earned $83,794, regained his PGA Tour
money lead over Fred Couples by just over $60,000. It was by far
Duval's best Open finish. Previously, it was a tie for 48th last
year. ``I'm still trying to grasp it and learn about how I'm going
to approach (the Open) next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Undue criticism for Augusta National?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody at Audubon magazine got turned down for a Masters
badge and has never forgotten about it. The publication's
July/August issue ranks golf courses in regard to environmental
friendliness and places Augusta National Golf Club on its ``bad''
list. Among other things, Audubon cites the fact that Augusta
National colors its ponds for television and hints that the club
puts its aquatic life in jeopardy. In truth, Augusta National uses
harmless food coloring in its ponds and is meticulous about
environmental standards. It even washes golf carts at a designated
area, for pesticide and fertilizer control. ``If anything,'' a club
spokesman said, ``we're overly careful. (Course superintendent)
Marsh (Benson) is a nut about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   One of these days it would be nice if Tiger Woods actually
contended in a U.S. Open. Can he do nothing more than win
tournaments in Georgia? Woods, who tied for 19th in 1997, tied for
18th Sunday. He never was a factor at a course he said he knew as
well as any in California, having played there regularly in
college. But all he does during the tournament is complain about
drives he hit to the middle of the fairway that bounced into the
rough? How about playing for the tilt and aiming accordingly? If
you're keeping score at home, Woods now has compiled 13 straight
rounds in the 70s in major championships. ... Olympic sensation
Matt Kuchar of Georgia Tech has been invited to appear on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' but isn't sure if it can be scheduled.
... Kuchar nervous? Hitting balls on the range Sunday he said,
``Hey, I heard (Georgia Tech's) Matt Harpring got drafted by the
Hawks.'' ... Of the PGA Tour's top 10 players in the all-around
competition (combined rankings of all categories), John Huston is a
runaway leader at 101, but three have Georgia connections.
Ex-Georgia Tech man Duval is second with 243, Sea Island's Davis
Love III is third (280), and Smyrna's Stewart Cink, another Tech
man, is 10th (322).

 &HT;    Hawks have option after option for NBA draft
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About this NBA draft ... .
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Hawks figure they can go a few different ways by the
time their number _ 20 _ is called tonight. They can trade up; they
can hold their ground; they can drop down and get more picks.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for conviction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of draft,'' general manager Pete Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have brought about 20 players to Atlanta, tested them,
worked them, discarded some, set up a wish list.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft that contains no single dominant selection, this
field does offer some help to teams that have a core of good
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four players under contract,'' Babcock notes. ``That means we
can go just about anywhere in this draft and improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nice, but confusing. Monday, Babcock was in his CNN
Center office at 5:30 a.m. He was still returning phone calls on
the way home about 9:30 that night. He endured a similar day
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For all this work, the Hawks have narrowed their target to 13
players, provided they hold at pick 20. Their job will be made
easier, because at least half that number will be taken in the
teens.
</P>
<P>
   If they trade up, they can be more ambitious. If they trade
down, they might be able to land two of the players they like.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hawks will not trade their four holdovers _ Dikembe
Mutombo, Mookie Blaylock, Ed Gray and Steve Smith _ Babcock can
offer future picks as coin.
</P>
<P>
   Owning lottery-proof picks from Detroit (14 or higher) and
Sacramento (16 or higher), ``we might be able to package something
to get into the low teens or acquire more picks,'' he said. ``Since
our roster is so small, it's a good time to do it.'' Orlando and
Houston have three picks each.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the field:
</P>
<P>
   Centers Radoslav Nesterovic, Kinder Bologna; and Michael Doleac,
Utah; forwards Ruben Patterson, Cincinnati; Pat Garrity, Notre
Dame; Brian Skinner, Baylor; Matt Harpring, Georgia Tech; Andre
Patterson, Indiana; and Roshown McLeod, Duke; and guards Michael
Dickerson, Arizona; Corey Benjamin, Oregon State; Tyronn Lue,
Nebraska; Ricky Davis, Iowa; and Bryce Drew, Valparaiso.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, the Hawks' wish list includes Doleac and Garrity,
both excellent shooters and defensive liabilities. Skinner is
extremely bright, very athletic and competitive and able to play
forward and center but is limited offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The next grouping includes Patterson, the best defender in the
draft, and a couple of kids _ Benjamin, 20, a slasher with improved
shooting skills, and Davis, a marvelous athlete who will be 19 in
September. Georgia Tech's Matt Harpring also would fit here.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also have some interest in Lue, a promising point
guard and a terrific athlete, and in Drew, a scorer whose
point-guard skills mighty not be NBA quality.
</P>
<P>
   Nesterovic, a highly-skilled face-up shooter, is a Slovenian who
played in Bologna of the Italian League last season. There are
questions about his availability for next season.

   The 1998 NBA Draft: Who wants to go first?
</P>
<P>
   By Curtis Bunn

   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Has there ever been an NBA draft in which so many
teams with high picks were looking to trade them? Perhaps, but not
likely. Even the Los Angeles Clippers, who hold the No. 1 selection
in tonight's annual draft, have made countless inquiries about
dealing the top slot for veteran help.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it speaks to the eligible talent, or lack of
it. So scattered were teams' thoughts a day before the event in
Vancouver that a mock draft is bound to be a mockery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weak year, but it's not weak for guys who are
projects,'' was the way Minnesota general manager Rob Babcock put
it. ``Anyone picking 12 and beyond had to look at a lot of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   The general consensus is that, barring trades, the Clippers will
take Arizona point guard Mike Bibby with the first pick. Los
Angeles could surprise and take Pacific center Michael Olowokandi
if it thinks it will not re-sign free-agent center Isaac Austin.
</P>
<P>
   With the second pick, the Grizzlies could go for smooth Kansas
forward Paul Pierce, matching him in the frontcourt with Marietta's
Shareef Abdur-Rahim and center Bryant Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Nuggets, selecting third, would take Pierce or
Olowkandi, whichever one is remaining. Or maybe not. It's that wide
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're basically going to get as good a player at
(pick) three or four as you would at one or two,'' said Dan Issel,
general manager and coach of the Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   What might turn out to be most interesting about this draft is
the selection of those players whose stock rose during pre-draft
workouts or tournaments. North Carolina guard Vince Carter was so
dynamic physically that he had Sacramento Kings personnel officials
shaking their heads. Carter astonished with his leaping ability
during a drill and impressed with his jump-shooting ability from
3-point range. The feeling is that he could be another Tar Heel who
will flourish _ a la Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Walter Davis _
away from UNC's structured system.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the case of former Florida guard Jason Williams,
who played for three colleges and was dismissed from the Gators
this season because he failed a drug test. Williams has been
sparkling in workouts, and his playmaking skills and ability score
from the perimeter at 6-foot-1 are major attributes. He could go as
high as No. 7, to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   At least four of the five high-school players in the draft
should be taken. The first could be a foreign prospect, 6-11 Dirk
Nowitzki, 19, of Germany, who has scouts excited about his ability
to score inside and outside.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis of Alief-Elsik High in Alief, Texas, is projected
to be taken as high as No. 14 by the Houston Rockets. Lewis is a
6-10 forward with a guard's game. His perimeter shooting ability
rates him higher than Al Harrington, a 6-8 forward from New Jersey,
who might have attended Georgia Tech if he had selected the NCAA
over the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The other prep star who could be drafted is Korleone Young, a
probable second-round pick.

   STAFF WRITER
</P>
<P>
   Without a coach or a player under contract, or even somebody to
sharpen skates, Don Waddell nonetheless spent his first day as an
NHL general manager attempting to set the tone for a franchise
still 16 months away from playing its first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right off the bat, our players have to understand what our
commitment is to winning,'' Waddell said after being introduced as
the Thrashers' general manager. ``By the time we start this thing
in 1999, expansion is gone. We'll be a first-year team that's
expected to win. ... Expansion is not a reason for losing.''
</P>
<P>
   For a career minor-league defenseman who played only one game in
the NHL with Los Angeles _ he was knocked down by a teammate on his
first shift, and the opponents scored _ Waddell hardly is
associated with losing. He built IHL expansion teams in San Diego
and Orlando into winning organizations and twice won honors as top
executive; turned around another struggling minor-league team in
Flint, Mich.; and spent the past season as assistant general
manager of the Detroit Red Wings, who won their second straight
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying he will be able to secure the services of Sergei
Fedorov, Steve Yzerman and Chris Osgood, Waddell plans to mimick
the Red Wings in organizational philosophy and playing style. He
wants to build the team around speed, which clearly became the
trend this past NHL season and favored high-scoring teams like the
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in speed and attacking the puck,'' he said. ``The
(defensive) trap is really (overrated). I like in-your-face type of
hockey. Trying to win the game 1-0, 2-0 is not the best thing for
your team or when you're trying to get new fans.''
</P>
<P>
   At 39, Waddell becomes the second-youngest general manager in
the NHL, to Washington's George McPhee (38). But his immediate
duties will not come as a Thrasher but a Red Wing: His contract
does not expire until July 1, so he will accompany the Red Wings to
Buffalo for the amateur draft on Saturday. But he also will spend
the weekend contacting potential candidates for the scout staff,
which he hopes to have put together by mid-July. Waddell said a
coach likely won't be hired until after the 1998-99 season because
``all the best ones are under contract right now to somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell's first hire will be an amateur scouting director, three
scouts in Canada (based in Ontario, Quebec and somewhere in the
West), one for U.S. colleges, one in Sweden and one in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The first realization he was in a novice hockey market came when
team executives showed him 10 offices that could be set up for the
scouting staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we don't need the offices,'' Waddell said. ``We
want our scouts on the road seeing games, not talking on the
phone.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Whatever ailment Shane Reynolds came down with must be contagious.
By the fourth inning Tuesday, it was the Minnesota Twins who were
sick to their stomachs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Originally scratched from the starting lineup after spending
Sunday night in the hospital with a case of food poisoning,
Reynolds arrived at the Astrodome on Tuesday 10 pounds lighter and
a whole lot sharper. Though not exactly what the doctor ordered,
the righthander gave a gutsy performance with seven shutout
innings, and the Astros provided plenty of offense in a 9-0 victory
over the Twins before a matinee crowd of 27,157.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, coupled with the Chicago Cubs' 5-4 loss to
Cleveland, increased the Astros' lead in the National League
Central to a season-high five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I felt good enough to pitch, (but) I was tired,''
said Reynolds, who suffered an attack of gastroenteritis two days
earlier and was not in uniform for the series opener with Minnesota
on Monday. ``I felt good. But I didn't feel wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought 24 hours earlier he would be on the
mound, Reynolds replied, ``I was in a hospital with an IV, and I
felt real bad with some kind of food poisoning. It drains you and
makes you feel weak. I stayed on the IV for six or seven hours. I
got a little better, enough to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins manager Tom Kelly would probably like to see Reynolds'
medical chart after his squad managed to get only one runner past
first base off him _ on a fourth-inning double by Marty Cordova.
Reynolds (8-5) retired 10 of the first 11 batters he faced and
allowed four hits and no walks in his seven innings. He also had
six strikeouts while snapping a personal two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came right out of the hospital and straight to the
pitcher's mound,'' Kelly said. ``We couldn't do a thing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros had their way with 37-year-old journeyman
Bob Tewksbury (4-9), who was tagged for five runs and eight hits in
1 innings. Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio and Carl Everett went a
combined 8-for-10 with seven RBIs in leading the Astros' 13-hit
assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just another example of how unpredictable things are,''
Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``I think among our players we
had one that had success against Tewksbury (catcher Brad Ausmus is
hitting .455 lifetime against the Twins righthander), and he wasn't
playing. Yet we go out and score all these runs off him. You never
know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds arrived at the Astrodome two hours before Tuesday's
12:35 start and was evaluated by team trainers. After warming up,
he appeared tired, and the Astros were prepared to start lefthanded
reliever C.J. Nitkowski. Dierker and pitching coach Vern Ruhle met
with Reynolds, and 20 minutes before the first pitch, the decision
was made to start him.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-inning outing surpassed all expectations, including
those of Dierker, who just wanted to get as many innings as
possible out of Reynolds to save the bullpen for the Astros'
upcoming five-game trip to Colorado and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them they were going to use the bullpen anyway, so why
not let me go two, three or four innings? If I give you five
innings, we're lucky, and then you don't have to burn the whole
bullpen,'' said Reynolds, who threw 97 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Nitkowski pitched two scoreless innings to preserve the Astros'
sixth shutout of the season and sixth win in eight games against
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros left little doubt about the outcome early, scoring
nine runs in the first four innings off Tewksbury and Dan Serafini.
The Astros went up 3-0 in the first on a two-run double by Bagwell
and an RBI double by Everett. In the second, Bill Spiers (2-for-4)
and Bagwell delivered run-scoring singles to put the Astros up 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put away all the scalpels in the training room, so I
can't slit my wrist,'' said Tewksbury, 1-2 with a 6.64 ERA in his
last three starts. ``I guess I have to get on the plane with the
rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who was 3-for-3 before leaving the game in the fourth
inning, had a two-run double in the third off Serafini. The Astros
completed the scoring in the fourth on an RBI single by Everett and
Tony Eusebio's double-play grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Cranking up the offense was the least the Astros could do for a
sick teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sucked it up for the team,'' Biggio said of Reynolds. ``He
needed to go out there and pitch. That's why he's one of the top
two pitchers on our team. You have to do those things and sometimes
put the team above yourself. Being able to get runs early always
allows a pitcher to put his mind at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Or in Reynolds' case, his stomach.

 &HT;    Hawks have option after option for NBA draft
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About this NBA draft ... .
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Hawks figure they can go a few different ways by the
time their number _ 20 _ is called tonight. They can trade up; they
can hold their ground; they can drop down and get more picks.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for conviction?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of draft,'' general manager Pete Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have brought about 20 players to Atlanta, tested them,
worked them, discarded some, set up a wish list.
</P>
<P>
   In a draft that contains no single dominant selection, this
field does offer some help to teams that have a core of good
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four players under contract,'' Babcock notes. ``That means we
can go just about anywhere in this draft and improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nice, but confusing. Monday, Babcock was in his CNN
Center office at 5:30 a.m. He was still returning phone calls on
the way home about 9:30 that night. He endured a similar day
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For all this work, the Hawks have narrowed their target to 13
players, provided they hold at pick 20. Their job will be made
easier, because at least half that number will be taken in the
teens.
</P>
<P>
   If they trade up, they can be more ambitious. If they trade
down, they might be able to land two of the players they like.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Hawks will not trade their four holdovers _ Dikembe
Mutombo, Mookie Blaylock, Ed Gray and Steve Smith _ Babcock can
offer future picks as coin.
</P>
<P>
   Owning lottery-proof picks from Detroit (14 or higher) and
Sacramento (16 or higher), ``we might be able to package something
to get into the low teens or acquire more picks,'' he said. ``Since
our roster is so small, it's a good time to do it.'' Orlando and
Houston have three picks each.
</P>
<P>
   Here is the field:
</P>
<P>
   Centers Radoslav Nesterovic, Kinder Bologna; and Michael Doleac,
Utah; forwards Ruben Patterson, Cincinnati; Pat Garrity, Notre
Dame; Brian Skinner, Baylor; Matt Harpring, Georgia Tech; Andre
Patterson, Indiana; and Roshown McLeod, Duke; and guards Michael
Dickerson, Arizona; Corey Benjamin, Oregon State; Tyronn Lue,
Nebraska; Ricky Davis, Iowa; and Bryce Drew, Valparaiso.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, the Hawks' wish list includes Doleac and Garrity,
both excellent shooters and defensive liabilities. Skinner is
extremely bright, very athletic and competitive and able to play
forward and center but is limited offensively.
</P>
<P>
   The next grouping includes Patterson, the best defender in the
draft, and a couple of kids _ Benjamin, 20, a slasher with improved
shooting skills, and Davis, a marvelous athlete who will be 19 in
September. Georgia Tech's Matt Harpring also would fit here.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also have some interest in Lue, a promising point
guard and a terrific athlete, and in Drew, a scorer whose
point-guard skills mighty not be NBA quality.
</P>
<P>
   Nesterovic, a highly-skilled face-up shooter, is a Slovenian who
played in Bologna of the Italian League last season. There are
questions about his availability for next season.

CONGRESSMAN MAKES SURE A MISTAKE BECOMES TAX LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tax code is chock full of benefits for the
wealthy. Most of them were put in on purpose. But last year, one
got in accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Now a powerful congressman has used his influence to keep on the
books this tax break for rich people that no one intended to be in
the law in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The only beneficiaries of the mistake are the heirs of a few
hundred people who die each year and leave estates worth more than
$17 million. Each of those estates will be saved more than $200,000
in taxes. The government will lose $880 million in revenue over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   After the mistake was caught, the Treasury Department and the
Senate took steps to correct it before it could be taken advantage
of.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, blocked them. At his insistence, a House-Senate
conference committee decided last week to keep the tax break in the
law. Archer says he prevented the correction to express his fervent
opposition to inheritance taxes, which he calls ``death taxes.''
Archer represents a district in Houston that is one of the
wealthiest in the country and presumably one of the likeliest to
have someone die and leave an estate worth more than $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   This all started when someone on Congress' technical staff made
a mistake in the drafting of the mammoth balanced budget and tax
cut law that Congress approved and President Clinton signed last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Such mistakes are common in big, complicated tax bills. Several
years ago, for instance, a measure dealing with tax write-offs for
race horses referred to ``houses'' instead of ``horses.'' Normally
the errors are repaired in what is known as the
technical-corrections section of the next tax bill to go through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 tax law increased the amount in estates that are exempt
from federal taxation. Under the old law, the first $600,000 of an
estate's value went untaxed. The new law raised the excluded amount
to $625,000 in 1998, to $650,000 in 1999 and, in continued
increments, to $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion is particularly important to heirs because the
estate tax rate is high, beginning at 18 percent and rising to 55
percent on the taxable amount over $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The old law required the value of the exclusion to be gradually
eliminated, a process called a phase-out, on estates worth more
than $17,184,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IRS, about 300 tax returns were filed on
estates worth more than $20 million in 1995, the last year for
which statistics are available. Because stock prices on average
have doubled since then, it is safe to assume that more such
estates will be taxed this year. But the total number should not be
more than several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the lawmakers who voted to increase the
exclusion intended to retain the phase-out. But somehow in the
drafting, that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The error was quickly caught. A private tax lawyer apparently
spotted it and called it to the attention of the congressional tax
staff. The tax staff recommended that it be corrected, and tax
specialists at the Treasury Department agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like one of the dozens of mistakes that would be
routinely repaired in this year's technical corrections bill before
anyone's taxes could be affected. Indeed, the Senate included a
correction in its version of the bill. But in the House, Archer
balked. And when the measure _ a small part of the legislation to
overhaul the IRS _ got to conference, he refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one in the Senate felt as strongly about correcting the
mistake as Archer felt about letting it go uncorrected, the
conferees agreed last week to leave the tax break in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Archer explained his position in a letter he wrote this month to
the National Federation of Independent Businesses, an organization
representing small businesses that opposes estate taxes but did not
specifically lobby on the provision in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some might argue that the proposed change is a mere
correction of a drafting error made last year, I view it as an
increase in federal death tax rates,'' Archer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter added: ``I believe we should reduce or eliminate the
unfair death tax. Accordingly, I cannot support any change in law
that would go in the opposite direction by increasing death tax
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's spokesman, L. Ari Fleischer, said the chairman's
position well illustrated the importance in which party controls
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Democrats controlled Congress and drafting errors
worked against the taxpayers, the Democrats let them stay in the
law,'' Fleischer said. ``Now, when one works against the government
and for the taxpayers, we're in no rush to correct it.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: New York Yankees
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Kevin Millwood (9-3, 4.43; first
appearance vs. Yankees) vs. RHP David Cone (9-2, 4.82; 9-3, 2.68
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: As the four-game set moves to Atlanta, Millwood is coming
off the briefest, and worst, outing of his young big-league career.
Friday in Montreal, he lasted just 1 1/3 innings, as nine of the 12
Expos he faced reached base. Millwood gave up seven hits --
including back-to-back homers by Chris Widger and Shane Andrews --
and seven earned runs. It was the fourth time he's made consecutive
starts against the same opponent, and the third-straight time that
team has pounded him. Cone's 14th start of the year is his 14th
lifetime against Atlanta, all as a Met. He took the loss Friday in
a 7-4 defeat in Cleveland, going 5 1/3 innings and allowing eight
hits, including two homers, and five earned runs. That ended a
career-best, nine-game personal winning streak for Cone, who opened
the season 9-1 for the second time in his career. Since joining the
Yankees on July 28, 1995, Cone is 37-12, 3.41, and the Yanks are
11-2 in his 13 starts this season, averaging 7.7 runs per start.
Now he returns to Atlanta, where he beat the Braves 5-2 in Game 3
of the 1996 World Series to start the Yankees' four-game comeback.

 &HT;    Braves keep Weiss, son in mind during important series
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - His jersey still hung in his locker Tuesday here at
Yankee Stadium. His cleats clean and polished, his glove waiting to
be slipped on.
</P>
<P>
   But Walt Weiss is far from baseball these days.
</P>
<P>
   While his teammates faced the Yankees again in this much hyped
interleague series, Braves shortstop Walt Weiss remained at the
bedside of his son Brody, who is back in an Atlanta hospital
stricken with E. coli, a deadly strain of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, however, are thinking of Weiss and his family,
especially little Brody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of time to think about it,'' said Denny Neagle.
``One of my families' best friends passed away last night from a
heart attack. I can't imagine what Walt must be going through. You
can't let baseball consume so much that you forget about everything
else. To think that he (Brody) might have (contracted) something
like this in a pool just blows my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Added John Smoltz, who has three young children, ``I've gone
through it with (someone in) my wife's family. He had leukemia. You
just have to hope and pray for Walt and his family. In a situation
like that, you wish you could switch with the child because you are
bigger and stronger. People take so much for granted. Something
like that doesn't hit home until it happens to someone close to
you. I've always said whatever happens to you as a family, there is
always others that are worse off.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this is his first season with the Braves, Weiss has
become a very popular player in the clubhouse. One player he has
gotten close with is his double player partner, second baseman
Keith Lockhart, whose wife Lisa has visited the Weiss family at the
Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to help,'' Lockhart said. ``I have a
three-year-old and it tears you up. This really puts the game in
perspective for you. When your kid is in a life and death situation
like that, every minute is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga knows Weiss well, having
spent the four seasons in Colorado with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he is in love with his kids and is a really close with
them,'' Galarraga said. ``I really don't have words for this. I
just know you put your family first and baseball second. He's
probably not even looking at ESPN to see how we are doing, but is
just trying to help his kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are not concerned about when Weiss will be back with
the club. They have told him to take as much time off as he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about what happen with Walt's kid, I felt like it
was mine,'' said Javier Lopez, who has a 2-year-old son. ``I felt
very, very scared, I felt like I could be in Walt's position right
now. I pray for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tom Glavine, who has a 3-year-old daughter, ``We can't
imagine what Walt is going through. A lot of us in here have young
kids and this puts things in perspective. The family is always the
most important thing. Always.''

 &HT;    Fate delivered title to Janzen
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't just win a U.S. Open. You survive it. It is a mental,
more than physical grind, for seven days. From the moment a player
settles his spikes into the turf of a U.S. Open venue on the first
practice day, he knows that his life indeed might never be the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about winning when I teed off (Sunday),''
Lee Janzen said later that afternoon through a haze of tears. ``I
figured I'd be too nervous if I thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a guy who already had won a U.S. Open five years
before.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine if Janzen had missed the green at the 18th Sunday.
Or yanked the 3-footer for par. There are no gimmes in a U.S. Open.
There are no favorites. Fate, not the USGA, handles all official
rulings. Janzen's ball drops out of a tree. Payne Stewart's
trickles into a divot filled with sand. No different than Tom
Lehman's drive on the 18th at Oakland Hills in '96, bouncing into
the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces take over. It happens every year. For three days
Janzen and The Olympic Club's cruel 17th hole are as compatible as
sourdough and ketchup. He manages a bogey, followed by two
double-bogeys. Sunday Janzen two-putts for par when his legs should
have gone Goodyear. On 18, the scariest short hole in golf, he
eventually stands over a 3-footer and, gasp, thinks the
unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I putted out the short putt, I thought, `This could be
it. This could be the putt that would win the U.S. Open,''' he
said. ``That's the last thing you want to say to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, ask Scott Hoch or Hubert Green, who each lost a Masters
because of putts that are kicked away in your Saturday foursome.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the 98th U.S. Open, it also becomes apparent
that:
</P>
<P>
   _ For everything that golf's more recent, earth-toned,
mostly-hip fashions have done to destroy old stereotypes, Payne
Stewart sets back the process a few years every time he shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, should a man dressed like a thermos win a U.S. Open?
</P>
<P>
   _ For all of Colin Montgomerie's attitude, some of what bothers
him at major championships is not self-inflicted. A fan called him
``fat boy'' last week. Another said, ``Go home, Monty.'' When the
Scot asked who said that, the fellow identified himself at the
ropes. When Monty asked why, the man said, ``Because of the Ryder
Cup.'' Replied Montgomerie, ``The only thing that happened at the
Ryder Cup is that our guys beat your guys.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Casey Martin is the real deal. In his first U.S. Open, despite
all the mess about which cart might keep him from flipping over,
Martin tied for 23rd and finished two shots better than Mark
O'Meara, the Masters champion. You will see Martin again on the PGA
Tour next week at the Greater Hartford Open, where he accepted a
sponsor exemption.

   Duval appearance too late
</P>
<P>
   David Duval's game only appeared on alternating days at Olympic
_ 75-68-75-69. Unhappy with the way he struck the ball even during
the 68, Duval took his first full attempt on the range Sunday
morning and declared, ``Well, it's nice my golf swing finally
decided to show up.'' Although never a tournament factor, Duval,
with a tie for seventh that earned $83,794, regained his PGA Tour
money lead over Fred Couples by just over $60,000. It was by far
Duval's best Open finish. Previously, it was a tie for 48th last
year. ``I'm still trying to grasp it and learn about how I'm going
to approach (the Open) next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Undue criticism for Augusta National?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe somebody at Audubon magazine got turned down for a Masters
badge and has never forgotten about it. The publication's
July/August issue ranks golf courses in regard to environmental
friendliness and places Augusta National Golf Club on its ``bad''
list. Among other things, Audubon cites the fact that Augusta
National colors its ponds for television and hints that the club
puts its aquatic life in jeopardy. In truth, Augusta National uses
harmless food coloring in its ponds and is meticulous about
environmental standards. It even washes golf carts at a designated
area, for pesticide and fertilizer control. ``If anything,'' a club
spokesman said, ``we're overly careful. (Course superintendent)
Marsh (Benson) is a nut about things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   One of these days it would be nice if Tiger Woods actually
contended in a U.S. Open. Can he do nothing more than win
tournaments in Georgia? Woods, who tied for 19th in 1997, tied for
18th Sunday. He never was a factor at a course he said he knew as
well as any in California, having played there regularly in
college. But all he does during the tournament is complain about
drives he hit to the middle of the fairway that bounced into the
rough? How about playing for the tilt and aiming accordingly? If
you're keeping score at home, Woods now has compiled 13 straight
rounds in the 70s in major championships. ... Olympic sensation
Matt Kuchar of Georgia Tech has been invited to appear on ``The
Tonight Show with Jay Leno'' but isn't sure if it can be scheduled.
... Kuchar nervous? Hitting balls on the range Sunday he said,
``Hey, I heard (Georgia Tech's) Matt Harpring got drafted by the
Hawks.'' ... Of the PGA Tour's top 10 players in the all-around
competition (combined rankings of all categories), John Huston is a
runaway leader at 101, but three have Georgia connections.
Ex-Georgia Tech man Duval is second with 243, Sea Island's Davis
Love III is third (280), and Smyrna's Stewart Cink, another Tech
man, is 10th (322).

IN CHINA, CLINTON IS LIONIZED AS A GLOBAL VISIONARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for top 4 grafs, new info)  (Eds., see related CHINA-PIRACY, CHINA-VISAS, CHINA-MEDIA,
CHINA-U.S.-ECON, CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-MISSILES, CLINTON-CONGRESS.) 
(HLW) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Bill Clinton's global vision, it seems, ranks him
right up there with that all-time great geopolitical strategist,
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon will ever be revered here for reviving ties between the
United States and the formerly isolated China. Now, in the days
before Clinton arrives for his first state visit to China, he is
being lionized in the official press and among elements of the
intelligentsia as a far-sighted statesman who had the wisdom to
change course with China, shifting from his initial attack stance
to his current policy of close engagement.
</P>
<P>
   It's a politician's dream: newspapers, magazines, and television
shows are showing a deep fascination with Clinton the political
leader, dissecting his recent speeches on China policy and
extolling his courage in the face of the China-haters who are
trying to derail the emerging ``strategic partnership'' between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper ran a large picture of the president in a suit of
armor, while Chinese journalists who visited Arkansas reveled in
Clinton's record as governor in promoting education, not
Whitewater. (So far, oddly, there has been relatively little
attention to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will accompany him on the
visit that begins on Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   The adulation of Clinton was evident on Tuesday afternoon at the
monthly salon of the XSH Book Club, in its headquarters in the
middle of a park in northwest Beijing. The directors of the club _
which markets books at a discount to its thousands of members
through catalogues and seminars like Tuesday's _ assembled foreign
policy experts and a few dozen Chinese journalists and book lovers
to discuss three major American titles recently published in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Clinton's ``Between Hope and History: Meeting
America's Challenges for the 21st Century'' (Random House, 1996),
the manifesto of his second administration written with William
Nothdurft. This month, the book went into its second printing in
China after the first several tens of thousands sold out. (``Not
quite a `Titanic','' said the book club editor, Xi Hong, ``but a
consistent top-seller over the last year.'')
</P>
<P>
   The second featured title, just published here this week after a
rush translation job, was Monica Crowley's new memoir, ``Nixon in
Winter'' (Random House, 1998). The third was Henry Kissinger's 1994
tome ``Diplomacy'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), which appeared in Chinese
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever American critics may have made of the Clinton book and
Ms. Crowley's deferential memoir of the former president who took
her under his wing in his final years, the assembled professors
here treated these works seriously, as offering insight into the
men who made today's emerging Chinese-American partnership
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Qian Wenrong, deputy director of the Xinhua World Issues
Research Institute, noted that by the time Clinton published his
book, he had already made his momentous shift in China policy, and
recognized the leading role China will play in world affairs in the
next century. Back in the 1970s, Qian said, Nixon too had
presciently seen how the world system was changing, and China's
inevitable rise.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yizhou of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences called the
Nixon book ``excellent, a reminder of how far-sighted the man
was.'' Kissinger's book he declared a classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kissinger book is very deep,'' he said, ``but I like the
Clinton book better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jia Qingguo, a political scientist at Beijing University who
spent several years in the United States, was less taken with the
books per se, but noted that through Clinton's book, and his rags
to riches story, Chinese could better understand the American
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth scholar, Huang Annian, a historian at Beijing Normal
University, listed the three most important American presidents
from China's perspective. The first was Franklin D. Roosevelt,
leader during World War II, ``the most glorious period in
Chinese-U.S. relations'' as the countries fought together against
Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The second was Nixon, who set the process in motion that led to
normalized relations. And third was Clinton, who despite concerns
over human rights and other issues has realized that the isolation
of China does not serve America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three men _ they all have strategic vision,'' Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even greater praise has appeared in the official media.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton gave an interview to visiting Chinese journalists
in Washington last week, an article in The Economic Daily here
said: ``The 40-minute interview was unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``foresight, courage, and insight deeply impressed the
Chinese correspondents,'' the article said.

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ Three years ago, while sitting in
his London apartment, Michael Olowokandi opened up the Peterson
Guide to American Colleges and Universities, turned to the letter
``P'' and dialed the telephone number of the first school his
finger came upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Michael Olowokandi, and I am 7-1, and I want to come play
basketball,'' he told an assistant coach at the University of the
Pacific in Stockton, Calif. ``The coach said `Well, we'll take
you.''' I was so happy. Organized basketball for the first time.
What a great day.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, all the advance scouting in the universe goes for
naught.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after that conversation, Olowokandi (pronounced
Oh-Lo-Wuh-Candy) may be the first player taken in the 1998 National
Basketball Association draft. Wednesday at GM Place, either the
7-foot-1, 265-pound center or a player a foot shorter, Arizona
point guard Mike Bibby, will be selected by the Los Angeles
Clippers with the No. 1 pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the icing on the cake after everything that has
happened to me,'' Olowokandi said Tuesday. ``What a story, no?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no. If you're talking about the son of a Nigerian
diplomat living out a Horatio Alger fantasy, yes. But if it is a
dream realized for Olowokandi, it is a huge conundrum for most NBA
general managers.
</P>
<P>
   That a guy who had not played 5-on-5 basketball until two
seasons ago could be the No. 1 pick is disturbing, almost as
disconcerting as taking an undersized playmaker who has trouble
creating his own shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be a lot of mistakes made at the top, but in the
middle of the draft you might end up with a better player than you
thought you were getting,'' said the NBA analyst and former coach
Kevin Loughery. ``Those first five or six picks, a lot of people
are going to be faced with the toughest decisions they've had in
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Sacramento Kings opted for Pervis Ellison in 1989
_ over Danny Ferry, Sean Elliot, Glen Rice and J.R. Reid _ has
there been such uncertainty with the top grouping of players.
</P>
<P>
   After Olowokandi and Bibby, duos from Kansas (Paul Pierce and
Raef LaFrentz) and North Carolina (Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter)
are expected to be taken in the top 10 along with the St. Louis
shooting guard Larry Hughes, Michigan's immovable Robert (Tractor)
Traylor and Utah's All-American center Michael Doleac.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando and Houston control the middle of the draft, adding to
the possibility of last-minute trades. Through prior trades and
other deals, the Magic and Rockets have three picks apiece between
Nos. 12 through 18. The Magic have the 12th, 13th and 15th picks
while the Rockets have Nos. 14, 16 and 18. Minnesota has the 17th
selection.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks do not have a first-round pick and the Nets have no
pick in either the first or second round. With the 38th and 44th
picks in the second round, the Knicks and are said to be interested
in moving up to acquire the Florida point guard Jason Williams in
the early teens or possibly a young front-line player such as Al
Harrington, the 6-9 center from St. Patrick's High School in
Elizabeth, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington and Rashard Lewis of Alief Elsik High School in
Alief, Texas, are the class of the youngsters. A bevy of foreign
players _ led by the 6-11 German forward Dirk Nowitzki and the
7-foot Slovenian Radoslav Nesterovic _ may also be among the top 20
players chosen in a draft short on potential All-Stars but long on
role players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the top 8 or 9 players set, but you can get the same
guy at 13 or 14 you can get at No. 24,'' Knicks team president
Ernie Grunfeld said. ``As far as impact players, it's not very
good. As far as depth in the draft, it's pretty solid.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Celtics, with the 10th pick, are one of several teams
looking to possibly trade their selection in order to acquire a
veteran player. Host Vancouver, which holds the No. 2 pick, and
Toronto, with No. 4, also are said to be interested in dealing
their selections for other players and possibly future draft picks.
The league's needy teams indeed will have their work cut out for
them the next 24 hours.

APPEALS COURT OVERTURNS RULING ON WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ASSESS) 
(th) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Undercutting a central argument in the government's
new antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp., a federal appeals court
Tuesday overturned a lower court's order in an earlier, similar
case against the company.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a setback for the Justice Department and for
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who issued the
order, which had required Microsoft to offer its Windows operating
system software separate from its software for navigating the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is scheduled to preside over the trial in September for
the new antitrust suit, which was filed last month by the Justice
Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court's ruling Tuesday struck down a preliminary
injunction that Jackson issued against Microsoft in December after
the Justice Department had argued in a separate case that Microsoft
was illegally using its monopoly in operating system software to
gain an unfair advantage in the market for browser software.
</P>
<P>
   But in its ruling Tuesday, the appeals court said that Jackson
had ``erred procedurally'' by issuing a preliminary injunction
without giving Microsoft a chance to present its case, and
``substantively'' by misinterpreting the intent of antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   Stating a principle that legal experts say would clearly apply
to the new antitrust suit as well, the court said that Microsoft
had the right to determine what features and functions to include
in its operating system as long as the combination ``offers
advantages unavailable'' if a consumer were to purchase separate
software products and combine them to achieve similar capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The same bundling of browser and operating system is a central
feature of Microsoft's latest version of Windows _ Windows 98 _
which goes on sale Thursday, and it is one of the core complaints
of the Justice Department and 20 states in their current suit
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   While Tuesday's ruling is not likely to have any immediate
impact on what consumers get when they buy personal computers, it
signals that the Justice Department will likely face a hostile
legal atmosphere as it heads toward the September trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of
having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of
technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust
law,'' said the text of Tuesday's decision by a three-judge panel
of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suggest here only that the limited competence of courts to
evaluate high-tech product designs and the high cost of error
should make them wary of second-guessing the claimed benefits of a
particular design decision,'' the text said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a terse, three-sentence statement
expressing ``disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reviewing the opinion to assess our options,'' the
statement said. ``We remain confident that the evidence and our
legal arguments in our antitrust case filed May 18 will demonstrate
that Microsoft's conduct has violated federal antitrust law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice
Department's antitrust office, said: ``This cuts the legs out from
under the Justice Department on their new case. It's potentially
devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's leaders were jubilant, and investors seemed to share
their enthusiasm, bidding up shares of the company's stock $4.9375
each in heavy trading Tuesday, to a closing price of $100.75.
Meanwhile, shares of Netscape Communications Corp., Microsoft's
only direct competitor in browser software, fell on the news,
ending the day at $26.1875, down 56.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned from this decision is that integrating new
features into our products is a good thing to do, and that's what
these judges say is the right thing to do,'' said Robert Herbold,
Microsoft's chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, senior vice president for law and corporate
affairs, said he invited Justice Department officials ``to review
the decision carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the department gave no indication that it intended to
modify or drop the case that is scheduled to go trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that Jackson had erred when he appointed a
``special master'' to advise him on technical matters when he
considered the first case last fall. Microsoft complained that the
individual chosen, Lawrence Lessig, a law professor from Harvard
University, was biased.
</P>
<P>
   The same appeals court had tentatively suspended Lessig's
appointment, and in the ruling Tuesday the court dismissed him from
the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Lessig said, ``This is an extremely
difficult case, and I am grateful to both sides for the patience
and respect that they showed me during the brief time that I worked
with them on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department could appeal Tuesday's ruling to the full
appeals court, or to the Supreme Court. In one sense that might not
seem to be a high priority, since the old case deals with
integrating a Web browser in Windows 95, a product that has been
superseded by Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   But Litan, director of Economic Studies at the Brookings
Institute, suggested that the Justice Department might consider an
appeal as a stalling tactic, in essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given this ruling today, Microsoft could be expected to come
in with a motion to dismiss the new case _ or for a summary
judgment of the case,'' he said. ``To forestall that, they might
decide they need to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial on the new case is scheduled to begin September 8, and
the appeal probably would not have been completed by then. &QL;

HOUSE HEARS ABOUT ENCODED CIRCUIT BOARD MISSING FROM CHINESE
ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., see related CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-PIRACY, CHINA-VISAS,
CHINA-MEDIA, CHINA-U.S.-ECON, CHINA-PEONY, CLINTON-CONGRESS.) 
(ps) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret encoded circuit board containing sensitive
American technology was missing from a Chinese rocket that exploded
in 1996 and American officials said Tuesday they suspect that
Chinese authorities took it.
</P>
<P>
   American military monitors had watched the launch of a Chinese
rocket from southern China as it streaked toward space carrying a
$200 million American communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
   But 22 seconds after liftoff on Feb. 15, 1996, the Long March
rocket exploded, showering fiery debris, burning fuel, and chaos on
a nearby Chinese village, where, by American accounts, as many as
200 civilians were killed.
</P>
<P>
   For five hours, American officials said, Chinese authorities
barred them from rushing to the crash site, saying it was for their
own safety. When the Americans finally reached the area and opened
the satellite's battered but intact control box, a secret encoded
circuit board was missing.
</P>
<P>
   Now congressional investigators are asking whether there could
be any explanation for the missing technology other than that the
Chinese took it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The box is recovered, but the card is gone,'' Rep. Curt
Weldon, R-Penn., said on Tuesday. ``We better call the Chinese on
this issue. That is a very serious concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon quoted a statement he said was given to him by the
National Security Agency, which warned that: ``If the encryption
board were reverse-engineered, the knowledge gained could be used
to strengthen adversaries' knowledge'' of the devices the United
States uses to safeguard its communications systems.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Defense Department official said on Tuesday night that
he was not aware that the government had demanded that the Chinese
account for the missing encoded card. ``We're not 100 percent sure
they filched this encryption card,'' the official said. ``It may
have just fallen out, but we have to assume they do have it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Congress also disclosed that the Justice
Department has begun an investigation of a second failed China
missile launch that also involved an American satellite. This
second inquiry is centered on the possible sharing of sensitive
information with the Chinese without American government
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the missing encryption board was made at an
unusual joint hearing of the House National Security and
International Relations committees, opening a new front in
Congress' inquiry into whether sensitive American space technology
was transferred to the China and assisted Beijing's military.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence promised to be a main focus of a special select
committee the House created last weeks to investigate the
wide-ranging China accusations, Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   The new revelation also adds a new dynamic to an ongoing Justice
Department inquiry into the matter. Federal investigators are
trying to determine if the two satellite-makers, Loral Space &AMP;
Communications and Hughes Electronics, divulged sensitive
technology to Chinese rocket scientists during an analysis of the
failed launch.
</P>
<P>
   The encoded circuit board, a 64-bit card, tells an orbiting
satellite which way to point to receive and transmit signals to and
from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department oversees exports of the encoded boards as
militarily sensitive technology. But when the same components are
embedded in a satellite, the whole unit falls under the export
controls of the Commerce Department. A government auditor told a
Senate inquiry earlier this month that the Commerce rules are
looser than the State rules.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insist that American satellites launched on
Chinese rockets are protected with armed, 24-hour American guards.
But the Commerce rules provide little protection against sensitive
technology being released in accidents like the February 1996
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, an undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, told a House hearing last Thursday that there
``there would not have been any effect on national security'' if
Chinese engineers illegally obtained the encoded device.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense Department said in a statement it provided to
Weldon that the ``loss of the chips'' would actually have a
``minimal impact'' _ not no impact at all _ on national security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to Weldon, the National Security Agency,
the government's code makers and code breakers, said that it had
changed the encoded algorithms in satellite circuit boards after
the failed February, 1996, launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was only 'minimal impact' to national security, why
did the NSA change the algorithms?'' Weldon asked today's witnesses
from the State, Defense and Commerce departments, which included
Reinsch.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials did not have a ready answer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing also provided new details into the Justice
Department's investigation of the role of American satellite makers
in helping China's troubled rocket program.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the 1996 accident, a Chinese rocket containing a
Hughes satellite failed, and Hughes did a study of that failure.
The Commerce Department permitted Hughes to provide the study to
the Chinese after the company assured the department that its
review was done ``independently'' of the Chinese and the department
determined that the review complied with the license, according to
testimony by Reinsch.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch said the Justice Department had recently requested all
its documents on the 1995 accident. Bert Brandenburg, a Justice
Department spokesman, said the department's review of the 1995
study was part of their investigation into the 1996 study by Loral
and Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy J.K. Tiffany, general counsel for Hughes, said company
employees had held meetings with the Chinese to obtain data for the
1995 study and that the Commerce Department had reviewed the scope
of those meetings to assure they would be in compliance with the
license.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch told the panel that the Hughes study would not help
China's missile program because it only involved the integration of
the Hughes satellite with the Chinese rocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. and chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, questioned why the Commerce
Department didn't seek advice from other agencies before allowing
Hughes to share the report with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You quietly authorized a United States company to share
information regarding a Chinese launch failure in 1995 without
sharing that decision with any other agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch replied, ``This was a judgment we made on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie K. Fowler, R-Fla., questioned why a Pentagon agency
didn't seek additional expertise on another technology sale to
China, which congressional and industry officials said involved
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fowler asked Pentagon officials about why they approved the
1996 sale of encrypted ground station terminals to a Chinese
military company, China Electronics Systems Engineering Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals, called Vsats, are the heart of a closed
telecommunication network in which the users, typically businesses,
transmit data via satellite. The communications can be coded
through separate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fowler wondered why officials from the Defense Intelligence
Agency, who are supposed to be consulted on such technology
transfers, were apparently not consulted.
</P>
<P>
   David Tarbel, the head of the Defense Technology Security
Administration, the Pentagon agency responsible for reviewing
technology transfers, said he would reply later to the inquiry.
Tarbel did not return a reporter's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tiffany, the Hughes lawyer, said ``we comply with all
American laws and restrictions in our overseas sales and those laws
do not prohibit the sale of Vsats to the Chinese military.''

EXPERTS WARN AGAINST DISRUPTION IN U.S.-CHINA TRADE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To get a feel for the United States' trade
relationship with China, take a stroll through Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie dolls, Lincoln logs, model trains _ all quintessentially
U.S. toys _ are made, at least in part, in China. In fact, more
than half of all toys sold in the United States last year were
manufactured in China.
</P>
<P>
   Now take a look at your shoes. Two out every three pairs worn by
Americans bear the Made-in-China label.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers benefit from Chinese imports in the form of lower
prices, trade experts say. But it is the communist giant, not Uncle
Sam, that is most dependent on trade.
</P>
<P>
   The United States comprises a third of China's total export
market, while the world's most populous nation still represents a
minuscule marketplace for American goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sell more to us,'' said James Lilley, a former ambassador
to China during the Bush administration. ``More people are employed
by them, and their economy is a lot more fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates want to use that leverage to prod Beijing
to improve its record on political dissent and religious freedom,
and trade officials hope to use the U.S. trade muscle to pry open
China's heavily protected market.
</P>
<P>
   But trade experts and diplomatic sources warn that any
disruption in U.S.-China trade at this time could send China into a
recession, force the country to devalue its currency and send
economies from Bangkok to Tokyo spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian financial crisis, at least temporarily, has a higher
priority,'' said Winston Lord, former assistant secretary of state
for East Asia and a one-time ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will board Air Force One on Wednesday to
travel to China, becoming the first U.S. president to visit China
since the government's bloody crackdown on student protesters in
Tiananmen Square nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal is to improve overall relations with the United
States' fourth-largest trading partner, including to help reduce a
growing U.S. trade imbalance with China that now approaches a ratio
of 5 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   China shipped about $62.6 billion worth of merchandise to the
United States last year, while importing only about $12.8 billion
worth of U.S. goods, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is meeting with Chinese leaders, the House Ways
and Means Committee is expected to vote to extend Most Favored
Nation trading status to China for another year.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to approve the measure next month,
but opposition on Capitol Hill is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Congress has investigated allegations the
Chinese tried to influence the 1996 presidential race by providing
illegal campaign funds and whether misappropriation of American
missile technology threatened U. S. national security.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of U.S. policy toward China span the political spectrum,
from liberal presidential hopeful Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., to
conservative Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, lawmakers have heard testimony on issues
ranging from persecution of Christians to the sale of executed
prisoners' vital organs. The battle continued Tuesday in the
Senate, where lawmakers debated whether to block visas for Chinese
officials who engage in religious persecution or promote forced
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also recently angered U.S. officials when they
banned direct marketing, a move that hurt American cosmetics firms
such as Avon Products and Mary Kay.
</P>
<P>
   Li Zhaoxing, China's ambassador to the United States, is warning
U.S. companies that all the criticism on Capitol Hill could hurt
their chances of landing lucrative contracts as the Chinese spend
$750 billion over the next three years to improve their
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   But despite those threats, no matter how polite, China stands to
lose the most from any trade dispute with the United States, trade
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   While American consumers gobbled up such a large percentage of
China's exports last year, China purchased less than 2 percent of
the goods American companies shipped abroad last year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, South Korea, despite a sputtering economy, purchased
twice as many American products last year than China, U.S. Commerce
Secretary Bill Daley said last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about 1.2 billion people, but only 0.2 are in
the modern economy,'' said Murray Weidenbaum, co-author of the book
``The Bamboo Network.'' A billion Chinese ``are still pushing ox
carts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't buy from anyone that's a 1,000 miles away in their
own country. It's very primitive.''
</P>
<P>
   China's relatively small purchases also reflect the continued
closed nature of that country's economy, a problem that has
prompted U.S. officials to rebuff China's efforts to join the World
Trade Organization, the international trade governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the merchandise China sells to the United States are
low-priced consumer goods, the manufacture of which has migrated
from one low-wage Asian country to another over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Toys, sporting goods and shoes made up 28 percent of all Chinese
sales to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Any disruption in trade between the United States and China
would send prices of products such as toys skyrocketing, in the
short term, until that manufacturing could be relocated, noted
retail analyst Lewis Alton with L.H. Alton &AMP; Co. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make it somewhere else, but it would take time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Imports of low-cost items from China and other East Asian
countries have helped keep a check on inflation and allowed the
U.S. economy to continue humming along.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we tried keeping their goods out, we'd have inflationary
pressures here and the Fed would be raising interest rates,'' said
Weidenbaum, who is also chairman of the Center for the Study of
American Business at Washington University.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Esserman, general counsel for the U.S. Trade
Representative's Office, told lawmakers last week that U.S.
consumers would be forced to pay abut $590 million more year for
products from items ranging from shoes to small appliances if Most
Favored Nation trading status were denied.
</P>
<P>
   For a country the size of the United States, that amounts to an
annual cost of about $2.21 a person.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' chief exports to China, meanwhile, are
high-tech goods such as aircraft and telecommunications equipment,
as well as agricultural products such as fertilizers and cotton
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   About 180,000 American jobs are tied to trade with China, and
U.S. operations ranging from Boeing Co. to Texas cotton farmers
could be hurt by a trade battle.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Adler, manager of international issues for the
Washington-based Aerospace Industries Association, noted that when
the United States imposed unilateral sanctions related to missile
technology control, American satellite manufacturers lost $100
million worth of business.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were to deny Most Favored Nation status to
China and disrupt trade across the Pacific, the Chinese economy
could recoil into recession, trade experts said.
</P>
<P>
   That could prompt Beijing, which has resisted the urge to
devalue the Chinese currency at a time when the Japanese yen and
other Asian currencies have already plunged, to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they devalue their currency it will set off a chain
reaction all over Asia and wreck economies all over Asia,'' Lilley
said.
</P>
<P>
   And that would send economic shock waves racing back across the
Pacific, said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee and a leading advocate of free trade in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are not our natural enemies,'' Archer said. ``We
can make them our enemies by our policy or we can encourage a
friendly relationship.''

HINGIS AND VENUS WILLIAMS ADVANCE IN RAINY OPENING MATCHES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ No sooner had Wimbledon's ever-harried
officials chased away the field mouse that took up residence in a
corner of Center Court on opening day than they had to deal with a
more familiar enemy on Day 2: rain. Unlike the rodent, the rain
refused to decamp, and the result was that only 14 of Tuesday's 70
matches were completed, 15 were left unfinished Tuesday night, and
Martina Hingis had to begin her title defense with the court, and
her Wimbledon-white outfit, coated by a fine mist.
</P>
<P>
   But the 17-year-old Hingis did not let the drizzle affect her
play, winning her first match on grass since she claimed this title
last year to become the youngest Wimbledon champion in 110 years.
And the weather did not stop another teen-ager, 18-year-old Venus
Williams, from her own achievement: her first Wimbledon victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' first-round opponent, 19th-ranked Lisa Raymond of Wayne,
Pa., had not only dealt her one of her five losses of 1997 but did
so right in Hingis' home base of Zurich, and Hingis got her revenge
Tuesday with a 7-5, 6-3 dismissal. Once Hingis weeded out her
forehand errors and began pushing Raymond, a two-time national
collegiate champion, into her backhand corner, she settled herself
into the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come back to play Wimbledon, you don't want to play
the No. 19 player who you lost to the last time,'' said Hingis, who
had recently been accused by her namesake, Martina Navratilova, of
taking her opponents too lightly. ``I was definitely more
concentrated, and I had to give everything just to get through the
first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis defied the slick surface, kept her concentration despite
a 90-minute rain delay just after she had held serve for a 2-1
second-set lead, and made sure she buried her shots deep enough on
the baseline to discourage Raymond's chip-and-charge offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was by no means a flawless performance by Hingis, who
had problems countering Raymond's laser-like backhand slice, it did
prove that she had recovered from her unexpected semifinal loss to
Monica Seles at the French Open this month. That defeat broke
Hingis' streak of reaching five straight Grand Slam finals, four of
which she won.
</P>
<P>
   After that disappointment, Hingis took herself up into the Alps
and did not come down until it was time to sneak in a few practice
rounds in London. ``I got away from all the stress and all the
tennis,'' Hingis said. ``I didn't want to see anybody and nobody
was there in the top of the mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hingis got to Wimbledon, Raymond, who has reached the
fourth round here twice, was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's vulnerable here,'' Raymond said. ``I knew she
hadn't played any grass-court matches, and she's got the pressure
of being the defending champion, and I think the loss at the French
probably affected her as well, so I think she feels like she's got
something to prove again.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Navratilova, a nine-time Wimbledon champion, this
tournament is the perfect place for Hingis to start proving her
reverence not just for her Grand Slam surroundings and the trophy
that awaits the survivor of this two-week haul, but for opponents
like Seles and Steffi Graf who crave the title just as much as she
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``She better shape up emotionally and physically; she's No. 1,
but she needs to step it up,'' said Navratilova, who also
criticized Hingis for being ``a bit dismissive of her opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not the case Tuesday. Hingis took Raymond very
seriously, especially when it came to fending off all five of the
break points Raymond had in the opening set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd play well to get those break points, and then I wouldn't
execute and break her,'' said Raymond, who was stymied by Hingis'
defensive lobs and by the winning down-the-line recoveries she made
even after being pushed laterally off the court. ``Martina seems to
be able to come up with those shots, and that's one of the reasons
she's No. 1. That's one of her talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the seventh-seeded Williams is, owing to her height,
supposed to possess serve-and-volley talents, she has not used them
at Wimbledon. But Tuesday she finally won her first match here, a
6-3, 6-3 decision against 98th-ranked Jana Nejedly of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' mother, Oracene, who broke her left ankle last Sunday
when she took a freakish tumble down the staircase of their rented
home here, watched from a wheelchair at courtside as Venus joined
her 16-year-old sister, Serena, in the second round. The sisters
are on a fourth-round collision course, but Venus refused to say
which of them she thought would soldier on toward the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going into the tournament your chances are 1 out of
128, so everyone's in the running, and then there are a few who are
really serious and only one who will win,'' she said. ``I try to be
as serious as possible.''

 &HT;    The good life only lasts so long as man is sued for theft
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What would you do if you found an
unexplained $400,000 deposit in your bank account?
</P>
<P>
   This was the moral dilemma facing Hans-Peter Frey of Wellington,
Fla. in June 1996. What he did was transfer the money to a
cashier's check and fly with it to Switzerland, where he opened an
annuity for his wife, Renate, that pays her about $2,000 a month
for the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's being sued in Palm Beach County (Fla.) Circuit Court
for civil theft by the Swiss Bank Corp., which erroneously placed
the $400,000 in his account. The money was supposed to pay off a
mortgage for Dr. Hans Frey, a Swiss citizen with the same name. Dr.
Hans Frey's mortgage company had a Swiss Bank account, as did
Hans-Peter Frey of Wellington.
</P>
<P>
   In opening arguments of the jury trial Tuesday, Swiss Bank's
lawyer, Glen Waldman, said a bank employee put the money in
Hans-Peter Frey's account after a computer noted a mismatch in
account numbers when receiving the $400,000 by wire from another
bank.
</P>
<P>
   When Hans-Peter Frey _ who was born in Switzerland himself _
received the deposit along with his regular payment from a family
annuity in Switzerland, he called his local Barnett Bank branch and
Swiss Bank to confirm the deposit was real. Waldman said Frey lied
to a Swiss Bank official and said he was expecting the payment, but
Frey denies it.
</P>
<P>
   Once Swiss Bank learned of its mistake, Frey had already put the
money in his wife's annuity, where no one else could get it,
Waldman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these types of mistakes happen, you know what people
usually do? They do the right thing,'' Waldman said. ``We made a
mistake, but what they did was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freys' lawyer, Paul Safran, said the bank is trying to
punish his clients for its own mistake. Swiss Bank had to pay Dr.
Hans Frey's Swiss mortgage because of the error.
</P>
<P>
   Hans-Peter Frey, 56, typically receives about $2,000 a month
from his family's annuity at Swiss Bank, but other family members
sometimes contribute larger deposits to it. Until the bank called
him more than three weeks after the June 28 deposit, he had no
reason to believe the money wasn't his, Safran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to take any responsibility for their
mistake,'' Safran said. ``It's easier for them to say this is the
Freys' fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Both lawyers said the annuity Hans-Peter Frey set up for his
wife is structured so that the money can't be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to conclude today.

 &HT;    Toxic algae raises more questions
 &HT;    (EDS: All cities, towns and counties are CQ in Florida)
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JENSEN BEACH, Fla. _ The mysterious microalgae that may have a
role in making fish on the Treasure Coast sick has been found in
three more sites in the St. Lucie Estuary and as far south as the
Lake Worth lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This adds a whole other dimension and raises even more
questions,'' said Ann Forstchen, a Florida fish health expert.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are studying whether cryptoperidiniopsis is linked to
an outbreak of sick fish this spring on the Treasure Coast. They
have speculated the toxic algae breaks down the protective slime
covering fish, making them susceptible to bacteria in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Crypto was identified earlier at five sites in the St. Lucie and
Indian rivers, Forstchen said. But water and sediment samples taken
from Lake Worth May 18 by a private citizen in Palm Beach County
also proved positive for crypto, along with three samples taken in
the Intracoastal Waterway in Martin County May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Forstchen said the Palm Beach County resident contacted her by
e-mail and offered to help after reading about sick fish problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got six samples and we've been incubating them'' at Florida
Marine Research Institute's laboratories in St. Petersburg, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When a sample turned up positive for crypto this week,
biologists tried to contact the man to find out where it was taken,
but he was on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we need to look at fresh water flows going into Lake
Worth,'' which stretches from Palm Beach Gardens to the Boynton
Inlet, Forstchen said. ``We need to go back and see how many
lesioned fish were reported in Lake Worth. Historically, it's not
an area where we got reports of fish with lesions.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish with sores, lesions and rotting flesh began turning up in
the St. Lucie and Indian rivers in March, following massive dumping
of fresh water from rain-swollen Lake Okeechobee that disrupted the
normally brackish estuary.
</P>
<P>
   But Forstchen said the three positive samples, near the St.
Lucie Inlet, in Peck Lake and north of the Jensen Beach Causeway,
were taken when salt levels in the water were much higher and
considered healthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we have crypto at places where the water was virtually
fresh _ such as the Roosevelt Bridge during the fresh water
releases _ and at places where the salt levels are close to sea
water,'' Forstchen said.
</P>
<P>
   The microscopic algae, which has been found in water in areas
that also have fish with lesions, may be in the water all the time,
she said. ``There are just a lot of questions we don't have answers
for yet.''

EVIDENCE REVEALED OF IRAQI WARHEAD LOADED WITH NERVE GAS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The first physical evidence that Iraq loaded
deadly VX nerve gas into missile warheads before the 1991 war in
the Persian Gulf has strengthened the resolve of the United States
and its allies to maintain the embargo on Iraqi oil sales,
diplomats said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors excavated warhead fragments in March
from a weapons dump at Nibai, Iraq, and shipped them to a U.S. Army
laboratory at Aberdeen, Md. The laboratory found significant traces
of VX, an agent so toxic that a few drops can kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nail in the coffin for Iraq's efforts to lift sanctions
and to show substantial progress on disarmament,'' the chief U.S.
delegate, Bill Richardson, said on Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's chief delegate, Sir John Weston, said there is no room
to give Iraq the benefit of the doubt about the existence of
``extremely potent chemical weapons'' like VX. ``I think it ill
serves the United Nations not to look the facts in the face and to
deal with them squarely in a case of this kind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain have fought against relaxing the
sanctions, which were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,
until weapons inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons of
mass destruction and the means to make them. The condition was
spelled out in Security Council Resolution 687, enacted in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The three other permanent members of the Security Council,
China, France and Russia, have supported a more accommodating
approach that takes into account the limited cooperation Iraq has
offered so far. The oil sanctions have already been relaxed to
allow Iraq to earn money for food and medicine imports.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of VX on missile warhead fragments, first
reported Tuesday by The Washington Post, has sounded alarms because
it offers proof that the Iraqis lied when they called their VX
program purely experimental. Experts say that if the Iraqis could
stabilize VX sufficiently to pour into warheads, they could also
keep it stable enough to hide for years from inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton left little doubt that the United States will
use the discovery to keep the sanctions on Iraqi oil. ``Let the
inspections go forward and don't lift the sanctions until the
resolutions are complied with,'' he said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, in a statement Tuesday by its U.N. mission, said the
Aberdeen analysis of warheads could not be correct because
``continuous production failure'' had prevented the use of VX in
any munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi statement also sought to find fault with the handling
of the VX samples, saying Baghdad was told that only one of the
seven samples analyzed had shown variable traces of VX. It also
said that the samples were taken without giving Iraq equivalent
samples, as had been agreed upon, and that no soil samples were
taken for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also noted that Iraq had insisted that any
analysis of importance be done in a neutral country or be divided
among laboratories of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council is to be briefed on the issue on Wednesday
by Richard Butler, the Australian diplomat who heads the arms
inspection team. In a report he sent to the Security Council last
Thursday, Butler said that when he met with Iraqi officials in
Baghdad on June 13 and 14, they refused to address questions about
production of VX, some biological agents and missile fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who arrived in New York Tuesday from Australia, refused
to talk about the Aberdeen results.
</P>
<P>
   Ewan Buchanan, a spokesman for the team, said, ``No doubt it
will be discussed in depth in the council tomorrow, which is the
proper place for such discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Butler was advised that the warhead shards had tested positive for
VX before he arrived in Baghdad on June 11, and raised the matter
informally with his Iraqi counterpart, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz. Aziz, according to the diplomat, dismissed the finding as a
lie.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's report sent to the Security Council on Thursday alluded
to their confrontation. ``During the discussions, the commission
presented the preliminary results of the chemical analysis of
certain excavated remnants of special mission warheads,'' it said.
``The Iraqi side rejected these results.''

</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., see related CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-PIRACY, CHINA-VISAS,

 (JT)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has tried to minimize
its direct involvement in Asia's economic crisis, pulling strings
at the International Monetary Fund, sending out envoys to cajole
foreign leaders and avoiding the lead role Washington took when it
saved Mexico from economic implosion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But as President Clinton prepares to leave for China, the Asian
crisis, in the words of one of Clinton's top aides, is becoming
``worse and worse every day,'' and it is becoming far more
difficult for the leader of the world's largest economy to deal
with it at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there is talk inside the administration, and
at the World Bank, of the possibility of an Asian depression _ an
event that would reverberate deeply in the United States. And
Clinton will end his trip in Hong Kong, once the booming example of
Asian free enterprise, whose chief executive declared on Tuesday
that a deepening recession ``is more far-reaching than we
anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   Market instability, which a few months ago seemed contained, now
amplifies as it circles the globe: Trouble in Southeast Asia
unnerves investors in Japan, the meltdown of the Japanese yen
triggers a crisis of confidence in Russia and China, and
nervousness in those nations rattles Central Europe and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Plan A, a year-long effort to devise solutions through the IMF
and the World Bank, where the United States is the largest and most
influential member, is clearly not working. But Clinton's economic
team says that direct American aid to countries in deepest trouble
_ even Russia, in which the United States has the most at stake _
is out of the question. In short, there is no Plan B.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to his trip, Clinton has delved into
some risky market diplomacy _ offering symbolic indications of
support for Russia and Japan, in the hope that investors will be
calmed by Washington's commitment to financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, faced with an imminent devaluation of the ruble
that would undercut the government of President Boris Yeltsin,
Clinton backed more international financial aid for the country.
Last Tuesday, concerned about an attack on the yen, he approved
intervening in the currency markets to prop up Japan. On Friday, he
urged China not to worsen a dicey situation by devaluing its own
currency, an argument his aides say he will repeat in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are stopgap measures. Their success is dependent on
domestic political decisions in Moscow and Tokyo and Beijing that
the United States has relatively little power to influence. That is
worrisome for three reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is a fear in the White House that America's
year-long insulation from the Asian crisis may be peeling away.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides are circumspect about raising these worries in
public _ for fear of triggering more troubles in the markets _ but
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's public comments make it clear he
is far more worried about the domestic impact of the Asian crisis
than he was two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a major crisis were to develop,'' he said last week at the
White House, ``the effects in our nation could be great.'' He cited
the dramatic fall in American exports, the most measurable example.
Others worry that as money pours out of Asia, it is seeking safe
haven in the United States _ creating a market ``bubble'' that
could collapse when global economic fortunes change and investors
sell dollars and re-invest in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is more stark: If the IMF is unable to
contain the instability, what does Washington do next? The
$12-billion U.S. contribution to the bailout of Mexico was an
economic success, but it cannot be repeated. Congress refused to
back financial aid for America's closest neighbor, and it screamed
when Clinton dipped into a fund under the control of the Treasury
and the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   An amendment to a major budget bill in the House this week would
forbid the administration from using the same fund again, a step
that Rubin warned today would ``constitute an unacceptable
limitation on the executive branch's ability to protect critical
U.S. economic interests.'' The fund, he noted, was used last year
to provide backup to the IMF in preventing an imminent national
default in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But Rubin's aides concede that using the fund again, even if
Congress enacts no limitation, would raise an uproar _ just at the
moment the administration is trying to convince the House to
approve another $18 billion for the IMF. Even if Russia needed aid,
one senior official noted recently, ``where would we get the
money?''
</P>
<P>
   That leads to the president's third challenge: convincing China
this week that it must resist temptations to devalue its own
currency, and convincing Americans, via television, that the global
economy can do them more good than harm.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it will keep its currency pegged to the U.S.
dollar, even though devaluations around Asia have made its products
less and less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's got to hold the fort,'' said C. Fred Bergsten,
president of the Institute for International Economics. ``If not,
if the strong center buckles, all hell breaks lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton will again have to make the case that
economic engagement benefits American workers. There is already
considerable suspicion the the North America Free Trade Agreement
led to a loss of American jobs, even if the statistical evidence is
mixed. In China, Clinton must argue that Asia is America's best
long-term bet, despite the economic crisis and congressional
suspicions that China is bent on stealing American technology. It
was a more convincing argument in better economic times.

A CLASSIC THAT'S AS CHANGEABLE AS THE WIND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28)

   ``Gone With the Wind'' is still generally accepted as the most
widely seen motion picture ever to come out of Hollywood. When its
estimated income is adjusted to reflect the increase in ticket
prices over 59 years, it is still one of the biggest-grossing
movies in history, topped only by a handful of others, including
the newest champion of champions, ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, ``Gone With the Wind'' placed fourth (after ``Citizen
Kane,'' ``Casablanca'' and ``The Godfather'') in the American Film
Institute's poll of the 100 best American films of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Since its world premiere in Atlanta in December 1939, David O.
Selznick's movie adaptation of the Margaret Mitchell novel has
never been long off a screen somewhere in the world. I ran into it
once in the early 1960s in Cairo, where Arabic audiences sat enrapt
by its tale of the Old South, dreamily described in the
introductory title as ``a land of Cavaliers and Cotton Fields ...
[a) pretty world [where) Gallantry took its last bow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' has always had an alarming ability to
enchant millions of people who know better, as well as millions of
people who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Its politics _ to the extent it has any _ are at a decent remove
from the blatant racism of ``The Birth of a Nation,'' the D.W.
Griffith silent-film masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   But with the exception of a couple of sarcastic remarks made
early on by the renegade aristocrat Rhett Butler, there is nothing
in ``Gone With the Wind'' to indicate that the pretty world being
destroyed is anything but perfect.
</P>
<P>
   With the passage of time, the movie has been taking on the airs
of the imperious Lady Bracknell, who simply ignores everything that
exists beyond Belgravia.
</P>
<P>
   These observations, prompted by the film's latest re-release,
are made by someone who has been regularly visiting ``Gone With the
Wind,'' as if it were a fond friend, ever since it first came out.
Each time I see it, I'm surprised by how much it continues to
change, in the manner of a memory adjusting to the world in which
it is being remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few things about the film that have remained constant
are the still-ravishing performances of three actors: Vivien Leigh,
Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel _ their roles defined in Sidney
Howard's screenplay in scenes and dialogue often taken directly
from the book.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's changeable beauty, her ferocity of spirit, give Scarlett
O'Hara something of the dimension of a pop version of Mother
Courage. As Rhett Butler, who is essentially the bodice-ripping
hero of every romance novel ever written, Gable saunters through
the film with such skillful, laid-back self-assurance that he seems
to be sending it up while never sabotaging it.
</P>
<P>
   He is the film's contemporary, life-saving sensibility. Hattie
McDaniel? No stereotypical Mammy she. Bossy, wise, argumentative,
as skeptical as she is loving, she's very much her own woman. Mammy
is the moral center of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gone With the Wind'' that opened on Friday is not being
shown in wide screen, the format most often favored in recent
decades, but in its original aspect ratio of 1.33 to 1. This means
that audiences are seeing the images as they were photographed for
optimum effect in the boxier film frame of pre-``scope'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   No tops of heads are being chopped off now, as they were in the
1950s, thus to allow the print to be projected on the wider screens
that came into favor then with Cinemascope, Vistavision and other
such processes.
</P>
<P>
   The distributors are also publicizing the fact that
``approximately 12{ minutes of the film'' have been digitally
repaired and that for the first time since 1961, the prints were
processed by Technicolor (in which it was photographed). They say
further that the original soundtrack has been restored to ``CD
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   You might expect from all this that the ``Gone With the Wind''
now being exhibited looks and sounds as pristine as the restored
version of David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia'' did several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   That it doesn't might reflect the difference in the ages of the
two films. ``Lawrence of Arabia'' came out in 1962, its original
negatives and soundtrack being just that much more modern and less
damaged by time. Remember, ``Gone With the Wind'' is almost 60
years old. It was made just 12 years after Al Jolson's ``Jazz
Singer,'' usually cited as the first talking picture.
</P>
<P>
   It was also only the 13th feature to be shot in Technicolor's
three-strip process, which involved the simultaneous, carefully
synchronized exposure of three strips of film. Though cumbersome,
the process for the first time made it feasible to reproduce the
full-color spectrum in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the restored ``Gone With the Wind'' is far
from a complete technical success. The color quality is uneven:
sometimes gorgeous, usually for interior scenes; at other times it
has a pinkish cast, or the color appears to bleed from one object
onto another.
</P>
<P>
   The day after I saw the film in a screening room, I rented a
``Gone With the Wind'' videocassette that actually looked better.
The color was not as intense as it might have been originally, but
neither was it washed out to any degree. The colors were true and
full, without pink patches or any unsightly seepage. In fact, the
quality was superior to the tapes of a lot of color films that were
made no more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the new print of ``Gone With the Wind'' in the
screening room, I was surprised by the color quality but more
interested in the other ways in which the film either defies its
age or announces it.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind'' is not Leo Tolstoy's
``War and Peace.'' It doesn't examine history to understand it.
Mitchell wasn't interested in sociology or politics or the
institution of slavery. She wrote a vivid historical romance whose
extraordinary popularity prompted Edmund Wilson, in his collection
of essays titled ``Patriotic Gore,'' to call it ``a curious
counterbalance to `Uncle Tom's Cabin.' ''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Wilson noted that in the 1880s, as industrialization and
``energetic enterprise'' changed the face of American cities,
making them uglier and harsher, Northerners became aware of losing
their own amenities. Feeling a bit guilty for ``their wartime
vituperation,'' he wrote, Northerners ``took over the Southern myth
and themselves began to revel in it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, he explained the huge popularity in the North of
the nostalgic stories and novels of the Virginia-born Thomas Nelson
Page (1853-1922), an obsession that culminated in the publishing
phenomenon of ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   There was never to be another such Southern romance to match the
way ``Gone With the Wind'' conquered this country, selling a record
of 50,000 copies in one day and, in its first year of publication
(1936), approximately 1.5 million copies. Yet one can't explain its
popularity entirely in the parochial terms of the North and the
South. The book, like the film, has been equally popular around the
world and stays in print.
</P>
<P>
   One of the astonishing things about the film is how much of the
1,000-plus-page novel Selznick and Sidney Howard managed to cram
into the movie, even one with a running time of 3 hours and 40
minutes. Because the novel's events are so graphic, and because the
characters are so quickly recognized (they don't have much in the
way of interior lives), the movie's images can seamlessly replicate
the sense and appeal of the book.
</P>
<P>
   And, at the breathless pace at which the film moves, there isn't
the opportunity to miss what isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   The true auteur of this movie is none of the directors who
worked on it, not Victor Fleming, who received the directorial
credit, or George Cukor, who was fired after the first 14 days of
shooting, or any others who pinch-hit from time to time. It was
Selznick who, as the producer, was all over every aspect of the
production, including the intertitles that explain the jumps in
time and set up the scenes to come.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Road to Tara,'' her book on the making of ``Gone With
the Wind,'' Aljean Harmetz quotes Selznick as saying that he wanted
to make a movie that would look modern 25 years after it came out.
He did that, but he also decorated it with florid intertitles that
have a way of linking ``Gone With the Wind'' to the tradition of
silent movies like ``The Birth of a Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider: ``Hushed and grim, Atlanta turned painful eyes toward
the far-away little town of Gettysburg ... And a page of history
waited three days while two nations came to death grips on the
farmlands of Pennsylvania ...''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is the same movie in which Scarlett, thoroughly bored
the afternoon following the death of her second husband of
convenience, is getting drunk on brandy when Mammy bursts into her
bedroom. ``Miz Scarlett, Captain Butler's here to see you,'' says
Mammy, adding deadpan, ``I told him you was prostrate with grief.''
</P>
<P>
   At its best, ``Gone With the Wind'' has not only great, timeless
comic edge but also grandeur, as in the sequences in which the
Confederate wounded come pouring into Atlanta, and those set during
the city's siege by the Union Army. Or, as an intertitle insists on
telling us: ``Panic hit the city with the first of Sherman's shells
...''
</P>
<P>
   Olivia de Havilland's performance as Melanie, the rather
impossible but steadfast paragon of Southern womanhood, has grown
more mellow with time. Butterfly McQueen is no longer a joke as
Prissy; instead, she's a bewildered, frightened girl, which adds
emotional substance to the siege sequences. Movies do change.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Howard's performance as the wimpish Ashley Wilkes has all
but disappeared from view. He is on the screen, but there is no
performance. According to Ms. Harmetz, Howard accepted the role
only for the money. He didn't want to be in the film and, if I ever
have to see it again in a few years, he may not be.
</P>
<P>
   Distributors are asking that ``Gone With the Wind'' now be shown
with an intermission, as it was originally. That may not be a wise
thing to do. If you walked out after Part I, you would have seen
almost everything that remains memorable about the picture. The
second half has some amusing moments as Rhett indulges Scarlett's
taste for nouveau riche finery and housing, but the plot, which,
after all, is paramount, creaks and falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone With the Wind'' is not a great film, but it is a most
satisfying one. As Mitchell's book mourned the end of an era, it
was itself an era's end. Now the success of ``Titanic,'' a
special-effects-driven, pre-teen romantic fantasy, would seem to
indicate that the Selznick era of mass-market humanism is ending.
We'll see.

ANALYSIS: RULING UNLIKELY TO AFFECT WINDOWS 98 RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-SUIT) 
(sw) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the dust kicked up in the legal battle
over the Microsoft Corp.'s right to include Web browsing software
in its Windows 95 operating system, a ruling by an appeals court
today in the software giant's favor will have almost no impact on
the imminent release of Windows 98, a new version that integrates
the browser even more tightly.
</P>
<P>
   What the ruling and the suit have managed to do is focus a lot
of public attention on a product that has been playing to
widespread yawns in computer industry publications. In recent
weeks, even Microsoft has been playing down revenue expectations
for Windows 98, which is scheduled to go on sale at retail outlets
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the software publisher appears to have generated even
less enthusiasm for Windows 98 among corporate computer buyers,
where a consensus appears to be emerging that this upgrade should
be skipped in favor of Windows NT, a more powerful and robust
version of the operating system designed for large networks of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is clearly that NT is the future in the corporate
market,'' said Mike Elgan, the editor of Windows magazine, a
computer industry news weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Corp., a maker of agricultural equipment, based in
Racine, Wis., is representative of many corporate buyers who have
decided to forego upgrading their entire company to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is to, in an evolutionary fashion, migrate to
NT,'' said James Hatch, Case's chief information officer. ``We
haven't evaluated Windows 98, and we don't see a compelling need to
orchestrate a mass change.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Tuesday's ruling might have an impact, analysts said, is
in emboldening Microsoft to adopt a tougher stand in its
contractual dealings with computer makers and Internet service
providers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three weeks, several computer makers have announced
that they will ship their products with Windows modified so that it
opens with a customized screen that either identifies the brand or
offers icons that link to sites on the Internet chosen by the
manufacturers. This was a practice that Microsoft had forbidden in
its contracts in recent years but did not fight after the Justice
Department included the company's restrictive contracts in the
antitrust lawsuit it filed in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that Microsoft will have more muscle to reapply the
screws,'' said Jessie Berst, editorial director of AnchorDesk.com,
a Internet publication of the Ziff-Davis Corp. ``Recently, we've
seen large manufacturers such as NEC Corporation, Compaq and
Gateway become emboldened by the Justice Department's pressure.
This gives Microsoft the court sanction to reinstitute its previous
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling will also put new pressures on the Netscape
Communications Corp., which created the commercial Web browser
market with its Navigator software only to lose much of that market
to Microsoft in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Netscape executives sketched out a new
business strategy: to transform its home page into a ``portal,'' an
industry buzz word used to describe massive World Wide Web sites
that attract heavy Internet traffic with a mixture of search
engines, Web directories, news, online shopping and entertainment.
Such sites are becoming lucrative in attracting advertising and
steering Web users into the expanding world of Internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   However, while NBC and the Walt Disney Co. both invested in
portal sites this month, analysts have remained cautious about the
revenue prospects for such a strategy by Netscape, which has no
search technology or content of its own. The popularity of its home
page rests primarily with the fact that it is the first site that
people see after they install the Navigator browser. As the market
shifts toward Microsoft's browser, Netscape's online traffic could
well sink.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Netscape suffered two setbacks this week. The first
involved server software, the programs that run on the large
computers that host Web sites. Since competition with Microsoft in
the browser market forced Netscape to give Navigator away free,
server software has been a main source of revenue. On Monday, IBM
announced that it would begin supporting Apache, a free Web server
that competes against Netscape's server product.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Tuesday, the appeals court ruling meant that Microsoft
can continue to include its Explorer browser with about 90 percent
of all computers sold in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape has gotten a one-two punch, and it's only Tuesday,''
said David Readerman, a financial analyst at Nations Banc
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After competition with Microsoft forced Netscape to stop
charging for Navigator, its revenues from browser sales fell from
$17 million in the quarter that ended in December to zero in the
quarter ending in April, Readerman said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Readerman is estimating that Microsoft will realize
$2.24 billion in revenue from sales of Windows 98 to computer
makers and retail customers in its first year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledge that they are doing far less to
promote the upgrade than they did with Windows 95. Industry
analysts say the company is spending only about $10 million on
marketing versus almost $200 million for its introduction of
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say we're ratcheting back,'' said Yusuf Mehdi,
director of Windows marketing at Microsoft. ``In fact, outside of
the Department of Justice coverage _ which has been extensive _ I
think that Windows 98 has been an under-hyped product.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention to Windows 98 in the news media's coverage of the
antitrust suits has been ``bittersweet,'' Mehdi said, because while
it brought the issue of browser integration the public's attention,
it did so in a negative context.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one retail chain sees the impact differently.
CompUSA, the nation's largest computer retailer, will open its
doors at midnight on Wednesday in an effort to make the release of
Windows 98 a ``marketing event,'' said Larry Mondry, an executive
vice president at CompUSA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Microsoft spent,'' he said. ``The government
gave them so much free advertising they probably didn't have to
spend as much. There is much more interest now than there ever
would have been.'' &QL;

 &HT;    No loophole to stop klan rally
 &HT;    By Brad Mayhar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Lawmen and representatives from the state
attorney general's office say they have not developed any loopholes
that would prevent members of the Ku Klux Klan from conducting
their scheduled Saturday rally in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The officials met Tuesday afternoon following a morning news
conference, where attorney general representatives offered legal
advice to Jasper authorities on how to prepare for Saturday's rally
_ scheduled from noon until 2 p.m. at the Jasper County Courthouse
_ and a possible capital case against at least two of the three
suspects charged with murder in connection with the dragging death
of Joe Byrd Jr. along a rural road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really just sort of provided them with what the law said
and any legitimate information they could use, but that was really
the extent of it,'' Ward Tisdale, spokesman for Attorney General
Dan Morales, said. ``We're always there to help, but it's really up
to the local officials to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper Police Chief Harlan Alexander said advice offered by the
AG's office served as a means to get everyone on the same
wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jasper County Sheriff Billy Rowles' indication that a
group dubbed the ``New Black Panthers'' plans to return to Jasper
on Saturday in conjunction with the KKK rally, some Jasper
officials say have not heard any confirmed reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard the same rumors,'' Alexander said. ``Most of
that's come from the news media. The next rally we have's going to
be against the news media. We're just tired of the circus.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Public Safety troopers, Texas Rangers, state
intelligence officers and ATF agents have been called to assist the
local deputies and police officers monitoring the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander declined to comment on how many law enforcement
authorities will man the courthouse area Saturday, but said he
feels confident in their abilities to control any excessive
physical or verbal outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be enough to handle the situation,'' he said.
``We've tried to plan for anything we can foresee and we're
confident it will go all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31, and John William King and Shawn
Allen Berry, both 23, remain in the Jasper County Jail without
bond. Federal prosecutors have not yet decided whether to pursue
charges against the three suspects

 &HT;    Jasper to hate groups: Stay away
 &HT;    By Andy Adams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Civic leaders here politely issued a similar
statement Tuesday both to the media and to supremacist
organizations: Leave us alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would help us a lot is for all of y'all to go home, for
all of these radical groups to go home,'' Jasper County Sheriff
Billy Rowles told a group of about 20 reporters and television
cameramen in front of the county courthouse. ``Let Jasper's
citizens, the good people in our county, deal with what has taken
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing an outstanding job. I applaud the citizens of
Jasper County and the Byrd family. We're working on this. I know
this is newsworthy and I know y'all have a job to do. But as soon
as y'all get out of Jasper County, we're going to continue our
healing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Jasper has remained in the national spotlight since June 7, when
James Byrd Jr. was dragged to death behind a pickup on a county
road east of town. Three white men have been charged with murder in
connection with the death of Byrd, who was black.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent developments have focused on Ku Klux Klan
members' intention to stage a rally in Jasper this Saturday. Rowles
said that he also has learned that a faction of the Black Panther
party _ some of whose members brandished shotguns when they visited
Jasper on the day of Byrd's funeral _ plans to return on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of Rowles, who was not scheduled to speak at the
press conference but answered reporters' questions, drew applause
from a small contingent of local residents who were gathered on the
courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   Five other community leaders offered similar opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Jasper in the past weeks have come together to
solve our problems, to work through them,'' County Judge Joe Folk
said. ``What we would like to do is to ask the other people to let
our people, the citizens of Jasper County, continue to work
together to solve our problems and to heal the wounds that we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do not represent ourselves to be anything except
a Christian community. We are God-fearing and God-loving people and
we do not condone, in any manner, the mistreatment of any person.
And, of course, we do not like to see outsiders come in to stir up
hatred among our people or to cause mistrust among any people of
Jasper County.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Domenech, chairman-elect of the Jasper Chamber of
Commerce, repeated the request of one of Byrd's daughters. Renee
Mullins said last week that, if the Klan is coming to Jasper to
renounce any association with the murder and lend its support to
the Byrd family, then its members should come in plain clothes
instead of ``in costume,'' with hoods and flowing robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the opinion of the chamber of commerce that, only by
granting her request, can the Klan show support for her family
rather than add more trauma to their excruciating grief,'' Ms.
Domenech said. ``Jasper's healing process has begun and does not
need to be disrupted by outsiders seeking attention for themselves
or their causes. The best support that organizations such as the
Klan can give Jasper is to respect our privacy. ''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gatlin, president of the Jasper Independent School District
board of trustees, begged visitors to let the community's children
have a peaceful summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We implore all outside interests, including the group that has
announced that they will be present in Jasper this coming Saturday,
to stay away,'' Gatlin said. ``We have students who are trying to
continue their education process this summer and we have students
who are attempting to relax so that they can be refreshed when
school begins in August of this year. Distractions from outside
groups which truly have no interest in the people of Jasper will
only inhibit the education process of our youth, who are our adult
leaders of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those outside groups, I will state that, if your concern
for Jasper and our world is for the good, then stay at home on
Saturday and days to come. You will probably be surprised to find
that you have children or grandchildren at your own homes that
could use your own love and attention.''
</P>

   Bill Snelson, past-president of the chamber of commerce, said he
has done business in Jasper for 24 years and said its residents do
not view each other in racial terms but as people with whom they
trade and with whom they attend school and church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this tragic incident as the difference between good
and evil, between right and wrong _ not between black and white,''
Snelson said of Byrd's murder, calling it ``a cruel and savage
atrocity committed by misfits not represented by the citizens of
our town.''
</P>
<P>
   Folk said that, while Jasper residents may not be able to keep
groups like the KKK and Black Panthers from staging rallies, they
can simply refuse to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize people's constitutional rights and we're going to
see that those rights are guaranteed,'' he said. ``But we're also
interested in working out our problems among ourselves and we're
the kind of people that can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Neff, pastor of the First United Methodist Church in
Jasper, echoed the other leaders' sentiments as he spoke about the
KKK: ``We don't want you in Jasper. Stay home and let our community
continue the healing process as we strive to live together in peace
and harmony.''

 &HT;    Delta's frequent flier points hardest to redeem, study says
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new analysis of frequent flier programs suggests
Delta Air Lines makes it harder than other carriers to redeem
mileage.
</P>
<P>
   The July issue of Consumer Reports says Atlanta-based Delta in
1997 booked the smallest proportion of its seats, 5.4 percent, for
award travel on popular routes.
</P>
<P>
   That was down 20.5 percent from a year earlier, giving Delta the
steepest decline among seven airlines listed in the analysis. The
study, by a consulting firm hired by the magazine, was based on 500
domestic routes with the highest award-ticket traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis comes as airlines carry heavy loads of paying
passengers, making it tougher to redeem mileage. Consumer Reports
said the seven airlines booked 152,000 fewer award flights on the
top routes last year. Still, three carriers _ American, United and
Northwest _ showed gains in the percentage of award seats booked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the best mileage-award programs make available the
most frequent-flier seats,'' the magazine says. American and TWA
booked the highest proportion, 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta, which claims its SkyMiles program is 'the most ...
rewarding in the industry,' was absolutely the worst,'' the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokeswoman Laura Gillig said the analysis was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't feel that we have cut award seats 20
percent on top routes. In fact, we feel we take very good care of
SkyMiles members,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's annual filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, however, confirm a recent decline. The airline, which
is required to disclose certain frequent flier liability
indicators, said passenger miles logged by award travelers rose
steadily from 4 percent to 8 percent from 1991 to 1996. But in 1997
it dropped back to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta business travel consultant Chris McGinnis said he often
hears anecdotal complaints about mileage redemption but does not
feel they are necessarily justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have the attitude that these programs are a
divine right,'' he said, adding tighter seat availability is only
logical when demand by paying passengers is high. ``You didn't hear
a lot about this a few years ago when there were plenty of seats,
and you won't hear about it when the next recession hits and demand
drops. It's cyclical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Reports article is skeptical of mileage programs
generally, calling them a ``dubious scheme'' to entice consumers
with promises of award travel that isn't worth the purchases needed
to earn it. Airline officials and other defenders say the
popularity of the programs speaks for itself. More than 57 million
people are members, many in more than one program.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Transportation last year said it was
reviewing mileage programs to see how many seats are set aside for
award use and how clearly airlines warn consumers about redemption
limits.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said Tuesday the review is ongoing.

 &HT;    For this firm, it's all relevant; tracking commerce on Web is a
full-time job
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Before the Web was inhabited by the likes of ESPN,
MSNBC, Coca-Cola and Sony, nobody really cared who was surfing the
Web or what exactly they were surfing to. But once the medium
progressed from being a cool pastime for computer hipsters into a
serious business, the corporate world demanded the Web be
quantified and measured. Advertisers wanted to target their
advertising dollars on the Web just as they do on TV and in print.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Relevant Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Web measurement firm is one of a handful of
Web tallying wannabes vying for acceptance from corporate bean
counters. Founded in the summer of 1996 by two former Turner
Broadcasting executives, Jeff Levy and Tim Cobb, the company has
taken Nielsen's TV research methods and adapted them to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we looked at the Web, we saw there was nobody applying this
kind of approach,'' Levy says. ``Back in 1995-96, counting how many
`hits' you got didn't provide the kind of information advertisers
needed. Advertisers care about the Nielsen type of stuff,'' he
continues, ``How much time a user spent at a Web site.'' Other
companies such as Media Metrix and Net Ratings use a similar
research model as will Nielsen in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Most advertisers, ad agencies and the research community say
Relevant Knowledge's methodology and third party data assessment is
a Web measurement service they can live with. However, some still
find fault with the company's data, as they do with all current Web
measurement firms. The search engine Alta Vista claimed Relevant
Knowledge has under-reported its actual number of unique visits by
more than 5 million users.
</P>
<P>
   But even with this type of dispute, Levy and Cobb still have the
power to influence major Web media buys from clients such as
Microsoft and Intel. Companies such as the Gen-X Webzine Tripod
frequently cite their high ratings from Relevant Knowledge in their
press releases and company statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The firm also has enough influence in shaping the advertising
standards and naming conventions on mainstream Web sites such as
Yahoo and Warner Brothers to ensure Relevant Knowledge can capture
their data.
</P>
<P>
   Levy and Cobb founded Relevant Knowledge after they decided the
Web wasn't being accurately measured in a way meaningful to
advertisers or the Web sites themselves. ``We said `Wouldn't it be
great if we could get a random group of users and develop a
tracking software and process the data to give to customers?'''
</P>
<P>
   Relevant Knowledge randomly selects a panel of users who agree
to have their Web usage monitored for two years. Participants are
directed to a special Web site to download the software that will
track and record the data of every Web site they visit.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Relevant Knowledge had 6,100 users and are hoping to
ramp up to 10,000 users by the end of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Levy says the sample Relevant Knowledge uses is larger than the
Nielsen TV sample because there is so much fragmentation on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not concerned with tracking millions of sites,'' he
says. ``Our focus is on people who are using the Web for commercial
advantage, for buying and selling products.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is constantly surprised by the information it turns
up. ``Observation changes behavior,'' he says. ``My first thought
is that nobody's going to go to a porno site if they knew they were
being watched and we would get this sort of G-rated view of the
Web.''
</P>
<P>
   But what they found out was the software was so unobtrusive that
users were wandering all over the Web to everything from CNN to
more X-rated fare. He also notes 35 users must visit a site before
it is officially recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Levy acknowledges Relevant Knowledge may not be the perfect way
to measure Web usage, but he still believes his company is closer
than most. ``Nobody measures it right,'' he says. ``But we are the
arbiter of who is number one.''

 &HT;    Growth of telecom evident at Supercomm
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kannell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Supercomm drew attendance from all points on the
telecommunications compass.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day industry trade show here earlier this month, was
attended by an estimated 40,000 people and drew top executives from
companies that make equipment as well as those that provide all
manner of telecom services _ both wired and wireless. A sampling of
conversations with some of these executives shows how quickly the
lucrative field is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton (Carly) Fiorina, president of the global service
provider business at Lucent Technologies, a unit that accounts for
60 percent of Lucent's $26.4 billion in annual revenue, was one of
the many top executives attending Supercomm.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina, who helped shape Lucent's spinoff from AT&AMP;T, said the
surge of people to Supercomm reflects the industry's stunning
growth. ``We are only beginning to tap the demand. That market is
being driven by an insatiable global demand for data-intensive
applications and mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent came away from AT&AMP;T with one of the greatest research
engines in the world: the 26,000 people at Bell Labs. The company
now sells a wide array of products to so many markets that AT&AMP;T _
once virtually its only customer _ represents only 10 percent of
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has made several acquisitions and invested in some
start-up companies with interesting technology. But despite the
industry's spate of mergers, Lucent will not again meld itself into
some larger identity, Fiorina said. ``We intend to be a great name
in the 21st century _ with our name intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Teleport Communications Group is headed into the AT&AMP;T fold.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Annunziata, chairman, president and chief executive of
New York-based Teleport, said the spectacular growth of Atlanta has
made the area itself a draw for telecommunications companies.
Teleport, which provides local communications service to
businesses, recently opened an office here.
</P>
<P>
   The company's new role is to provide the shock troops for AT&AMP;T's
assault on the local phone markets, going after the most lucrative
parts of the market served by the regional phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to the point where people will have a choice,''
Annunziata said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T does $12 billion a year in business with the regional phone
companies _ money that Teleport can save for the company,
Annunziata said. ``I build the link, and I don't spend that with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The target is huge and growing: ``There is a $105 billion local
market. There is plenty there for us to cut up, so that we can grow
and for the (Bells) to grow as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Vienna, Va.-based Teligent Inc. is building wireless local
networks around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another great opportunity to change the landscape of
local phone service,'' said Richard Hanna, Teligent senior vice
president. ``You don't have to get a huge share of the market to do
well. Teligent is an integrated communications company that offers
small and medium-sized businesses local, long-distance, high-speed
data and Internet services over its own, digital wireless networks
in 74 major metropolitan areas throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The local business market _ which will include local,
long-distance, wireless phones, data and Internet _ will reach $250
billion in 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If all politics are local, perhaps all telecommunications will
someday be global.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Walz, president of Iridium North America, came to Supercomm
to promote company plans to start providing a global wireless
service in September using 72 satellites. ``We will flick the
switch, and the world is wired for wireless. If you want one phone,
one number and one invoice, you can do it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent billions of dollars, yet expects no rush
of subscribers. ``Our business plan is predicated on having just
under 5 million customers by 2002. That's out of a market that will
be about 10 or 12 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   However, that small group of customers will likely be the cream
_ traveling professionals who need to stay in touch no matter where
they are and are willing to pay for the privilege. This group
includes executives from huge corporations, ``all the way down to a
small business owner whose livelihood depends on going to Japan,''
Walz said.
</P>
<P>
   At least two other global services are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Iridium's phones, which will cost several thousand dollars will
be capable of bouncing signals off a satellite overhead or
switching to the local cellular phone service _ if there is one.
About 90 percent of the world has no wireless coverage. In fact,
one-third of the United States has none, Walz said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the world's population has no phones at
all.

FOR PETER BROOK, DECISIONS ARE A FORM OF ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28)
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ Peter Brook was explaining over lunch
that no one should ever be held to opinions voiced in the past,
which seemed fine as, well, a fresh opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was not quite enough to explain why, having turned his
back on mainstream opera, the legendary theater director was now to
be found rehearsing a new production of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni''
that will open next month's international opera festival in
Aix-en-Provence.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Brook began his professional career at Covent Garden
in the late 1940s, and he had clearly had his fill when he wrote in
``The Empty Space,'' his seminal 1968 book on theater, that grand
opera was ``a nightmare of vast feuds over tiny details.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, while creating stripped-down experimental versions
of ``Carmen'' (seen in New York in 1983) and ``Pelleas et
Melisande'' at his theater in Paris, he has refused innumerable
invitations to work in Europe's leading opera houses and festivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am ready to disclaim my opinion, even of yesterday, even of
10 minutes ago, because all opinions are relative,'' the stocky
73-year-old Englishman said with an amused twinkle of his famously
pale blue eyes. ``One lives in a field of influences, one is
influenced by everyone one meets, everything is an exchange of
influences, all opinions are derivative. Once you deal a new deck
of cards, you've got a new deck of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but what had made him change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   In his new book of recollections, ``Threads of Time,'' published
this month by Counterpoint in the United States, Brook describes
life as a series of accidents and chance encounters, which explains
why, perhaps, improvisation is his preferred way of creating
theater.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, more than serendipity was involved. In
Stephane Lissner, the new director of the Festival International
d'Art Lyrique et de Musique in Aix, he at last found someone
willing to let him do opera his own way, which means helping to
pick the cast, rehearsing for nine weeks, creating an ensemble
spirit and touring the production after the festival. Not
surprisingly, the two men are also allied at Brook's theater
headquarters in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At Aix, ``everything is shared,'' Brook said about the cast,
chorus and the two conductors, Claudio Abbado and the young
Englishman Daniel Harding. ``We work together, doing exercises,
preparing, all as one big group. We were given the time to do it.
And because there will be more than 60 performances here and on
tour, there is a relationship between everyone's emotional and
creative time and investment and the number of people who will see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, of course, this is precisely how Brook works at
the Theatre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris, where his International
Center of Theater Research (which Lissner manages) has been based
since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps he has surrendered little in coming to Aix. He does
see a challenge in directing his first ``Don Giovanni'' since, he
said, he had never seen a ``convincing'' production of the opera.
Yet he is more concerned with how his version will feel than how it
will look.
</P>
<P>
   ``To find new and striking ways of setting something is of no
interest to me,'' he said. ``If this production has any specific
characteristic, it will be that it is very simple and very
intimate, to get to the heart of it, the essence of it. And I don't
think that is done through staging or interpretation, but something
very different.''
</P>
<P>
   As ever, then, Brook is involved in a search: at Aix, into the
character and motivations of opera's greatest libertine; at the
Bouffes du Nord recently, into the burden of having a prodigious
memory in ``Je Suis un Phenomene,'' or ``I Am a Phenomenon,'' based
on a book by the Russian neurologist Aleksandr Romanovich Luriya.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Qui Est La?,'' or ``Who Goes There?,'' he used excerpts
from ``Hamlet'' to analyze the theater techniques of Stanislavsky,
Meyerhold, Gordon Craig, Brecht and Artaud. In ``L'Homme Qui,''
inspired by Oliver Sacks' book ``The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a
Hat,'' he probed issues of sanity, perception and memory. And in
``The Mahabharata,'' his nine-hour classic based on ancient Hindu
texts and seen, like ``L'Homme Qui,'' at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music, he addressed war and survival.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was his need to continue searching that prompted
Brook to move to France in 1970. In ``Threads of Time,'' he notes
that the book became a lengthy answer to the question, Why Paris?
</P>
<P>
   ``In England, artistic experiment is always viewed with
suspicion,'' he writes, ``while in France it is a natural part of
artistic life.'' He might also have added that unlike England,
France is generous with its theater subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to leave was a great loss to the London stage.
``The British theater in the past 20 years has sometimes felt like
a party being conducted with two of our most fascinating directors
away on French leave,'' the English playwright David Hare said in a
review of ``Threads of Time'' in The Guardian of London. ``Their
absence has haunted us, like a rebuke.'' The other British theater
director to flee to France was Joan Littlewood.
</P>
<P>
   Brook shows no regrets. And, still full of energy, he always
seems ready for a new adventure. Born into a Russian Jewish family
in London in 1925, his first career plan was to become a movie
director. But after studying at Oxford University, where he
directed a stage production of ``Doctor Faustus,'' he could not
break into films and instead found himself, at the age of 22, as
resident producer at the Royal Opera House.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``I entered the opera with one simple aim: to give this sleepy
old-fashioned institution a series of shocks that would jolt it
into the present-day world,'' he writes in ``Threads of Time.''
Reality was otherwise. A veteran tenor advised him: ``Flatter all
the time, flatter shamelessly, never ask if you're overdoing it,
because that's not possible, go on flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was able to direct opera and even the odd film, he was
soon drawn into theater and quickly made his name in the West End
in London and at the Royal Shakespeare Theater in
Stratford-on-Avon. He worked with many present or future stars and
provides delightful pen portraits of some in ``Threads of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   He also describes how he gradually moved from traditional to
experimental theater. In the 1950s, he had veered little from his
early view that ``lights, music and effects were all as important
as acting.'' But by the 1960s, while in France to direct Genet's
play ``The Balcony,'' he was ready to work with his actors as an
ensemble and experiment with what was still, in his words, ``an
unknown new tool called improvisation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the tool that he needed for his theatrical exploration,
and it was the tool that turned his memorable production of Peter
Weiss' ``Marat/Sade'' into the sensation of London theater in the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brook seemed to feel trapped in Britain. He traveled to
Mexico and Cuba and went on a long trek through Afghanistan with
his wife, the actress Natasha Parry. His fascination with
non-Western culture grew.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris in 1968, Jean-Louis Barrault invited him to present a
Shakespeare production at an international festival, but Brook
proposed instead a workshop of actors and directors from different
cultures. The seeds of today's International Center of Theater
Research were planted. Two years later, he moved to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   At first, working on its own, the ensemble focused on exploring
body language and other nonverbal communication through
improvisation. In time, though, the need for spectators, for the
reactions of a nontraditional theater audience, intensified. The
group began performing before migrant workers in grim hostels
outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it traveled to Iran and, most daringly, to West Africa,
where it would arrive unannounced in villages and ask permission to
perform. It was an approach that would define Brook's work long
after a multinational ensemble was installed at the Theatre des
Bouffes du Nord: endless months of preparation _ even years, in the
case of ``The Mahabharata'' _ go into every new work; then, after
it is presented in Paris, it tours extensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any group anywhere has done so much touring,''
Brook said as he dug into a piece of apple pie. ``This is the way
one tries to be useful. And that is the basic point that I feel
strongly about: one must always try to be useful.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Threads of Time,'' behind the author's exploration of
theater, another, seemingly more crucial, spiritual search emerges
as a constant of his adult life. It is an unusual search in that it
is not religious in a conventional sense but rather inspired by the
esoteric teachings of an Armenian philosopher and mystic, George
Ivanovitch Gurdjieff, who died in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Gurdjieff taught that ordinary people can attain higher states
of awareness and take control of their own lives. In 1978, Brook
directed a movie, ``Meetings With Remarkable Men,'' based on
Gurdjieff's book of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ``True spiritual search is recognizing that life is as it is,''
Brook said, his ever-present assistant, Marie-Helene Estienne,
already calling him back to rehearsals. ``We are what we are. We're
here, we're born as we are, and at every moment we're following all
sorts of impulses that we cannot possibly understand. But I need to
know something that I don't know. When that is there, one becomes a
searcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing ``Threads of Time'' in The Financial Times of London,
the playwright Simon Callow said that by writing of his spiritual
path, Brook ``reveals himself at the extremities of
vulnerabilities, wide open for mockery.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Callow noted, ``It is unlikely that anyone involved in the
theater will not find themselves questioning their work and their
lives at fundamental levels'' after reading the book.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for Brook, his theatrical and spiritual searches are
irrevocably linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gurdjieff was based on two things,'' he said. ``One was always
saying, Don't take this for granted, don't believe me, work this
out for yourself _ which is opposite to the common idea of a
teacher. The other is that if you want to understand something
beyond a certain point, you cannot do it alone. And that
corresponds to my experience here. I c`n't understand `Don
Giovanni' alone. What I am discovering is thanks to working as a
group.''

RULING ALLOWS MICROSOFT TO REQUIRE BROWSER WITH WINDOWS 95 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The US government's landmark antitrust campaign against
Microsoft Corp. was dealt a potentially serious blow Tuesday, after
a federal Appeals Court threw out an injunction that restricted the
way Microsoft can sell its Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   In a broadly worded ruling, the federal Appeals Court for the
District of Columbia overturned a temporary injunction issued in
December that had barred Microsoft from requiring computer makers
to include Microsoft's Internet Explorer browsing software on
machines that run the Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling could weaken the government's position in a
much broader case brought by the Justice Department and 20 states
on May 18. That case alleged Microsoft abuses its market power to
thwart competition. The issue of whether Internet Explorer and
Windows can be bundled together also is at the heart of the case,
which will be tried in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad news for Justice,'' Robert Litan, a former senior
antitrust enforcer at the department told Bloomberg News. &UR;  &LR; ``On the
surface it looks like it cuts the legs out from under Justice on
the browser operating system part of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives hailed the ruling as vindication of the
firm's long-standing practice of adding new features to its
operating systems. The decision ``affirms our central principle of
every company being able to improve its products and integrate new
features for the benefit of consumers,'' said Microsoft chief
operating officer Bob Herbold.
</P>
<P>
   The company's chief legal counsel, William Neukom, said the
ruling should also apply to the government's broader &UR;  &LR; case against
Microsoft. ``Many of the government's arguments in the lawsuit
filed last month are identical to their arguments in the case just
decided in favor of Microsoft,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock soared on Tuesday's news, closing at 100 3/4, up
4 15/16 on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department issued a statement expressing
disappointment, &UR;  &LR; and saying that antitrust regulators were
considering their next moves. ``We remain confident that the
evidence and our legal arguments in our antitrust case filed on May
18, 1998 will demonstrate that Microsoft's conduct has violated
federal antitrust law,'' the statement added.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has argued that by forcing companies that
use Windows 95 to also use Microsoft's browser, the company is
shutting out competition from rival browser makers, like Netscape
Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's 2-1 ruling, the court threw out an injunction
issued by US District Judge &UR;  &LR; Thomas Penfield Jackson in Washington
and held that Microsoft did not violate a 1995 consent decree with
antitrust regulators. The Appeals Court said that because a
combined operating system and browser would benefit customers, the
1995 consent decree ``does not bar Microsoft from offering it as
one product.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the ruling, Microsoft is once again free to compel
computer makers to install Windows 95 with the Internet Explorer
icon visible when the computer is started up. The company says that
it hasn't yet decided whether it will do so, but that so few
computer makers actually removed the icon that the issue is
unimportant. In addition, nearly all computer makers are switching
over to Windows 98, which goes on sale in stores Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The same federal Appeals Court ruled last month that Jackson's
injunction did not apply to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In a hearing last month in the Windows 98 antitrust case,
which also is being heard by Jackson, the judge suggested he was
eager to hear the Appeals Court ruling: ``It may be that we will
have a decision in that case and we will have some expression of
appellate opinion on some of the issues that will cover this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court Tuesday also overturned the appointment of
Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig as a ``special master'' who
was to study the evidence in the Windows 95 case and provide
recommendations to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The court called Jackson's appointment of Lessig an ``imposition
on the parties of a surrogate judge, and either a clear abuse of
discretion or an exercise of wholly nonexistent discretion.'' The
court did not address Microsoft's claim that Lessig was unsuited to
the task, because he purportedly had shown evidence of bias against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by Harvard Law School, Lessig declined to
express an opinion on the ruling. But he defended the right of
Microsoft attorneys to question his impartiality. ``Any litigant
has the right to a fair and impartial adjudicator, and it was
wholly proper for Microsoft's attorneys to raise any question that
they had about my background and my writings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts questioned how much impact Tuesday's ruling will
have on the government's broader case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it means that the government will lose their
case in September against Microsoft,'' said Lisa Wood, an attorney
at the Boston firm of Nutter McClennen &AMP; Fish. ``I think that the
decision is a narrow one,'' said Wood, who is vice chairman of an
antitrust committee of the American Bar Association &UR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Wood said that the essence of the ruling focuses only on details
of the 1995 consent decree between the government and Microsoft.
While the Appeals Court was highly critical of the Justice
Department's analysis of Microsoft's actions in the Windows 95
case, Wood said that those portions of the court's opinion don't
set a legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some Microsoft critics agree. At ProComp, a lobbying group
that recruited former Senator Bob Dole and former federal judge
Robert Bork to campaign against Microsoft, the ruling was dismissed
as a sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the real battle will occur in the compelling
and historically significant Sherman Act antitrust case that will
be tried in September,`` said ProComp executive director Mike
Pettit. ``That case is based on antitrust law, which is broader
than the consent decree language in today's ruling, and goes to the
heart of Microsoft's anti-competitive and predatory practices that
span the computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mountain View, Calif., Netscape officials were cautious. The
appellate ruling applied to Windows 95 and was decided ``largely on
procedural grounds,'' the company noted in a statement. ``It most
certainly did not decide the broad antitrust case,'' Netscape said.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape shares dropped 9/16 to $26 3/16 on the Nasdaq Tuesday.

<P>
   LENNOX, S.D. _ Clouds the color of gunmetal billowed across the
South Dakota sky as Merlyn Steever slouched in a metal chair in a
now-empty barn, his arms folded in weary resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give up,'' the 50-year-old farmer said as he waited for the
trucks to load the last of his pigs and take them to slaughter,
ending his career as a hog producer. ``I just can't compete with
the big corporates. I don't see how any farmer can.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of big hog factories, which are more akin to
the corporate efficiency of General Motors than the ethos of the
American family farm, has emerged as perhaps the most contentious
issue in the nation's farm country.
</P>
<P>
   While some big-scale corporate hog farming has existed for
years, it is now starting to dominate this sector of agriculture,
with companies increasingly owning the hog plants, the
slaughterhouses, and the distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of smaller farmers, along with anger among
townspeople in rural areas offended by the foul smell of the huge
hog barns, has stirred debate in a dozen states that are now
considering plans to curb them. A ballot initiative in South
Dakota, to be voted on in November, would effectively outlaw
corporate livestock production. And Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma
recently signed a bill that restricts big hog operations.
</P>
<P>
   These plants with thousands of hogs crowded in small pens can
threaten underground water supplies. The Sierra Club recently
called for a moratorium on such megafarms, saying they pose serious
health and environmental risks in the nation's heartland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nasty,'' said Barbara Dunham, 37, whose house, about a
half mile from a big hog plant in central Illinois, saw its
assessed property value drop 30 percent recently because of the
smell. ``It gets so bad you can't go outside. And you have to scrub
down your inside walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the big hog plants say the producers can scarcely
be blamed for delivering the kind of lean, low-cost pork that
American consumers demand. The hog companies say they operate in
scarcely populated areas, and take every precaution to ensure
health and safety. Moreover, they say they contribute mightily to
state tax coffers and rural regions that are starving for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has divided communities and turned neighbor against
neighbor,'' said John Bixler, a spokesman for Dakota Rural Action,
an advocacy group for small farmers in South Dakota. Indeed, the
passions over the big hog plants can become so pitched that people
who work in such plants often decide to live many miles away to
avoid the wrath of local townspeople angry about the odors.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms, which is owned by the Continental Grain
Company and is the nation's third largest pork producer, pays about
$200 million in income to about 3,000 workers in Missouri,
according to a study by the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mahoney, a 31-year-old supervisor for the hog company,
said that when he was a teen-ager in the early 1980s, he watched
the terrible pain on his father's face when the family farm was
foreclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story you could hear from a lot of people around
here,'' said Mahoney, who makes nearly $40,000 a year and never has
to worry about prices in on the hog markets. ``I never dreamed I
could stay close to home, continue doing the kind of work I'm doing
and make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving work, Mahoney must shower and change clothes. Pig
manure, he concedes, stinks.
</P>
<P>
   That is the smell of money, say the hog plants' defenders,
echoing a refrain that has been used for generations to defend
steel mills, oil refineries and rubber incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To people whose image of pig-raising evokes Old McDonald's farm,
the sight of big confinement operations would conjure something
more from George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each steel building at a Premium Standard plant
near Harris, Mo., houses 1,150 hogs in 48 pens that measure 20 feet
long and 9 feet wide, each holding 25 pigs. The animals are
genetically designed to produce an identical cut of meat, and their
hooves never leave concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the independent farmers have also moved to the
confinement method, using the pens to reduce labor and save space.
The bottoms of the pens are slatted, so that waste drops and
collects in a lagoon. This water, which is full of hog waste, is
then spread over cropland as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hoogestraat, who farms his family's century-old hog
operation near Lennox, 15 miles southwest of Sioux Falls, moves
through the hog pens to check on the newborn piglets.
</P>
<P>
   Hoogestraat, a former biology and physics teacher who said he
returned to farming after realizing that pigs were better behaved
than junior high school students, leaves an oldies rock music
station playing on a radio in the hog pen.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he selected a music station for the pigs, Hoogestraat
deadpanned: ``Because they get upset if they hear the broadcasts of
the hog reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his upbeat ways, Hoogestraat worried aloud that if hog
prices fell much lower than $35 per 100 pounds of a live hog he did
not know how he could stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Many bigger hog companies now breed the animals, own the
slaughterhouses and market the meat. This control of the process _
``gestation to consumption'' as one economist dubbed it _ allows
the big companies to withstand lower hog prices, since they can
make it up on the retail end. For the independent farmers, on the
other hand, a drop in producer prices can spell doom. And lately,
that is exactly what has been happening.
</P>
<P>
   Prices per hundred pounds of live hogs have been in the range of
$33 to $45 this year, the lowest prices in the last
quarter-century, and a disaster for many pig farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have a mixed view about the power of laws aimed at
stopping corporate farming. Nebraska has perhaps the nation's
toughest law of its kind, forbidding any corporation from engaging
in farming. The measure has endured federal court challenges. And
it has, indeed, kept out corporate farmers. The South Dakota
measure was crafted along similar lines, exempting family-owned
corporations. But huge family-owned operations can cause as many
environmental problems as the corporate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, producer prices are based on national markets. Keeping
the big companies out of state does nothing to help the producer
prices for local farmers. For that reason, the South Dakota measure
is unlikely to help small farmers survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss to understand what would be achieved by the
South Dakota measure,'' said Ron Plain, an agriculture professor at
the University of Missouri. ``In a large sense, this is an
emotional issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of agriculture, the trend toward bigger
operations is unmistakable. The average swine farm today produces
432 hogs. Twenty years ago, the average farm produced 87.5 hogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, about one million farms were raising hogs. Today, about
150,000 farms raise hogs, a number that is inflated by the ``hobby
farmers'' who raise pigs as an avocation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, meat packers get about 30 percent of
their hogs from their own hog-breeding operations, or from
large-scale contracts with farms. That compares with 2 percent in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   When slaughterhouses and breeders have such close arrangements _
or, in fact, are the same company _ the market shrinks for
independent farmers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Hunhoff, a South Dakota Democrat who is running for
governor against the incumbent, William Janklow, contends that this
trend is reducing competition and creating monopolies for big
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cut off access to markets, that's not free
enterprise,'' said Hunhoff, who grew up on a hog farm near Yankton
and supports the anti-corporate farming measure. ``We're at a
crossroads here. Are we going to defend and protect family farms?
Or are we going to let everything to the control of the
corporates?''
</P>
<P>
   Janklow has opposed the ballot initiative and defends the big
hog farms as good corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corporate farm measure has also divided farm groups.
Organizations that represent the bigger, more conservative farmers
and ranchers, like the Pork Producers Council, have expressed
opposition to the measure, while the more liberal National Farmers
Union has supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like the Hoogestraats look down the flat gravel roads
near their farm and recite the names of 10 farmers who have stopped
raising hogs in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not win this thing,'' said Craig Hoogestraat, talking
about the anti-corporate measure on the ballot. ``But we're not
going down without a fight.''

TANGLEWOOD: HOW FESTIVE A FESTIVAL?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Mass., the most
prestigious summer training institute for young musicians in the
United States, has just begun its 49th season, and much attention
will be focused on Seiji Ozawa, who, as music director of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, oversees artistic matters at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two summers, Ozawa fomented a shakeup, which
provoked angry, noisy resignations from respected leaders of the
center: the pianist and conductor Leon Fleisher, who had been
artistic director for 12 years, and the pianist Gilbert Kalish, who
had served on the faculty for nearly 30 years, the last 12 as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fleisher is a brilliant, probing musician, he can be
prickly and was not the most hands-on administrator. Still, he had
an inspiring sense of what the center should be, and he supported
invaluable faculty members with lower public profiles, like the
veteran double bassist Julius Levine, who has also resigned in
protest.
</P>
<P>
   To understand Kalish's involvement with the center, one had only
to visit his office, where he kept a master chart with the daily
schedules of the 160-odd students. He pored over it like a worried
parent, concerned that, say, a violinist might be working too often
with the same coaches.
</P>
<P>
   These are not men prone to quitting in pique. So what happened?
The conflict touched on the tension between art and commercialism,
the role of corporate financing in artistic decisions and, perhaps
most critically, Ozawa's concern with his own artistic legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The Tanglewood Music Center is operated by the Boston Symphony,
its board and, particularly, its conductor. But Ozawa, who is 62
and will celebrate his 25th anniversary with the orchestra next
season, conceded last summer that for his first 20 years he was
fairly uninvolved with the center. ``I fired myself,'' he said. ``I
regret it.''
</P>
<P>
   His realization coincided with a crossroads in his career. For
years, there had been talk that Ozawa might be offered a position
with, say, the Berlin Philharmonic. It has not happened, and he
seems to have dug in even deeper in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His tenure has been uneven. The orchestra can play spectacularly
for him, but the musicians are split over his leadership, and the
tension spills into their playing, which may veer from routine to
overwrought. He evidently began to see Tanglewood as a chance to
leave an important legacy, much as he has done in his native Japan,
where he is revered.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents that precipitated his shakeup started in 1994,
when the splendid Seiji Ozawa Hall was opened. It was financed by
Norio Ohga, then the president of the Sony Corp., a major supporter
of the Boston Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Sony approached Ozawa about the possibility of
filming a series of music-education videos, ``Marsalis on Music,''
using Tanglewood students in portions of concert music. Faculty
members vehemently objected, but Ozawa prevailed. But the two-week
project played havoc with schedules, and the results were mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the center recovered, or so it seemed. In 1996, staged opera
was revived at Tanglewood with Ozawa conducting a cast and
orchestra of students in an acclaimed 50th-anniversary production
of Britten's ``Peter Grimes.'' So it was all the more shocking,
that fall, when Ozawa fired Richard Ortner, a longtime
administrator of the center, who had tried hard to reconcile the
faculty to the Sony video project.
</P>
<P>
   This set up the tensions of last summer, when Ozawa dressed down
the faculty, calling it a ``club'' resistant to change. ``This
summer will be a test,'' Ozawa said. Told later by Fleisher that
the faculty was confused, even scared, Ozawa replied, ``A little
fear is not a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear may be a way to run an orchestra, but it is no way to
motivate musicians as distinguished and self-critical as the
violist Raphael Hillyer and the cellist Joel Krosnick. The faculty
struggled with Ozawa to pinpoint and address his concerns,'' Kalish
said, ``but in retrospect, it seems to me he had already made up
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Ellen Highstein, a former executive director of the
Concert Artists Guild who had taken Ortner's place on a temporary
basis, was appointed to a newly created position: director of the
Tanglewood Music Center. Kalish had already resigned. Now Fleisher
followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony went into damage-control mode. Its spin,
Kalish wrote in a letter to The Berkshire Eagle late last year,
``is that Richard Ortner, Leon Fleisher and I were manning the
ramparts to guard against the fresh breeze of innovation from
sweeping away the cobwebs of a tired and moribund institution, and
that although Ozawa was desirous of making changes for the past six
years, he was somehow prevented from doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa indeed has the right _ and the power, as he has amply
demonstrated _ to make changes. But he seems to have invented, or
at least exaggerated, a whole scenario of problems at Tanglewood to
justify his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the innovations that have been trumpeted by the new team
at Tanglewood are not new. Boston Symphony guest conductors like
Bernard Haitink have always worked with students when they visit
Lenox.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the distinguished violinist Robert Mann to
the faculty was actually put in motion by Fleisher. Other
engagements are artistically dubious, like that of the Guarneri
Quartet, consisting of once-fine musicians who have long been
uninspired.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Ozawa has placed himself in charge, he has a lot at
stake. So does Ms. Highstein, whose office, paradoxically, is in
the Leon Fleisher Carriage House.

DESIGNING MUSEUMS: OFTEN NOT A LIFELY ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some, the ``culture wars'' between liberals and
conservatives have been at best a sideshow. The main event (it's
been going on since the Renaissance) has been the struggle between
artists and politicians. Artists understand that creativity invites
destruction. Politicians prefer to snack on sweetness and light.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Newhouse's new book, ``Toward the New Museum'' (The
Monacelli Press), offers a shrewd, biting account of one of the
most conspicuous fields in which this struggle has been joined in
recent decades: the architecture of art museums.
</P>
<P>
   She reviews a broad selection of the more than 1,000 art museums
built in the United States and Europe in recent decades. There are
long, definitive chapters on the Getty Center in Los Angeles and
the Guggenheim Museum's branch in Bilbao, Spain. Less well-known
projects, like the Lingotto Exhibition Spaces in Turin and the
Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art, also receive sensitive,
straightforward appraisals. The illustrations are many and choice.
</P>
<P>
   Her book is a springboard for further discussion, and bumps up
the intellectual level on which debate will take place. Its point
is simply stated: the design of art museums should be as open to
creative energy as the artworks they exhibit. This is more easily
said than done.
</P>
<P>
   Major art museums are political institutions, staffed by arts
administrators, governed by policies, budgets, operating hours and
codes of public accommodation. They tend to be overly sensitive to
the opinions of critics as well as the desires of donors and
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   But this apparatus has been put together to support a slice of
life that is unruly, irrepressible, not quietly contained. In some
museums, art and politics are brought as fatally close together as
two scorpions in a bottle. Architects design the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gehry's Bilbao project graces the book's cover, and the
building is plainly her star attraction. She gets off to the right
start by declaring that ``nothing about this building is alien.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum's strong relationship to its site may not be apparent
in photographs, but in Bilbao itself the light, the river, the
hills beyond, the industrial waterfront, the bridges and even the
cars all appear magnetically pulled together by the curves, the
scale, the titanium cladding of the design. Its power to effect
urban cohesion is comparable to that of Brunnelleschi's dome in
Florence.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Newhouse likes most about Bilbao is the variety of
spaces in which art can be experienced: square galleries of
classical proportion; smaller rooms whose irregularly sculptured
contours evoke the curves of the museum's metal exterior; a ``boat
gallery,'' 450 feet long, that displays work in a loftlike setting.
</P>
<P>
   The Getty Center, last year's other museum-world spectacular,
sits somewhat lower in her estimation. Despite Richard Meier's
impeccable design, Ms. Newhouse likens the experience to visiting a
theme park. She is justly galled by decisions made by the client
that compromised Meier's singular esthetic: using Thierry Despont,
a decorator, to design the painting galleries, and choosing the
artist Robert Irwin to design a large garden.
</P>
<P>
   She points to Carlo Scarpa and Louis Kahn as architects who
created sensitive settings without indulging in historical
reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   She is similarly critical of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's
19th-century European painting and sculpture galleries. Designed in
1993 by David Harvey and Gary Tinterow, a Metropolitan curator, the
ornate, neoclassical rooms were described by Tinterow as an
imagined reconstruction of a turn-of-the-century McKim, Mead &AMP;
White gallery.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Glenn Hoffman, you've just been named to
manage the Los Angeles Dodgers, baseball's newest amusement park.
How do you plan to approach your job?
</P>
<P>
   ``Day to day,'' said Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   This is what you would call good planning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodger universe as we once knew it is collapsing like a star
at the speed of light. Inside of three months, the team has
jettisoned two star players, its general manager and manager. The
last person to undergo this quick of a makeover was Courtney Love.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm a groundskeeper for the Dodgers, I start looking for
snakes in my rakes. If I work in scouting, I make sure all of my
airline tickets are roundtrip. The phrase everyone is expendable
has become the new Dodger mantra.
</P>
<P>
   There is every reason to think that the new manager, the
pleasant and wide-eyed Mr. Hoffman, tops the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning, 99 out of a 100 Dodger fans wouldn't have been
able to name the manager of their Albuquerque farm club. Hoffman
has the look of a name plucked from a hat, the ultimate transition
choice of a franchise that has little experience in selecting
managers.
</P>
<P>
   He has 4{ years of experience as a minor league manager, with
only one winning season. He's 39; only one other major league
manager is younger, Philadelphia's Terry Francona. His last taste
of the major leagues was 1989. Since then, he's either been a minor
league manager or instructor. His only look at the Dodgers the last
few years have been fleeting glances on television.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros, one of the senior Dodgers left in the clubhouse,
was asked what he knows of Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing in Albuquerque when I was in San Antonio,''
Karros said after a long pause. ``He directed our winter workouts
at the stadium, which I attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws great B.P. (batting practice).''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's an endorsement. Karros wasn't trying to put Hoffman
down as much as put the spotlight on how incredible and incredulous
things have become with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman can't change those dynamics, and he doesn't plan to try.
That should be viewed as a redeeming quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get used to them, and they have to get used to me,''
said Hoffman of the players. ``I've had a much different role with
most of these guys (winter workouts and spring training). I've been
thrown at them. I think we're all feeling our way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get into this end of the game when my playing
career was ending, and was fortunate to get a chance. I had no
timetable. The opportunity arose for me suddenly. Sometimes, it
never comes. Only a very few people get to be a major league
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that his tenure may be short doesn't bother him. Before
his official introduction as the new interim manager, sports talk
show hosts and newspaper reporters were already throwing out names
of potential full-time candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland wants out of Florida. Davey Johnson is unemployed.
Bobby Valentine has a contract with the Mets, but he's the apple in
the eye of new interim G.M. Tommy Lasorda. Kevin Kennedy, once a
Dodger minor league manager and highly regarded, is working for
ESPN. Davey Lopes, a coach in San Diego, is one of a dozen former
Dodgers working elsewhere who belong on any short list.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman shrugged when asked whether this conjecture will bother
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here today, and hopefully tomorrow,'' he said. ``I'll go
one day at a time after that. I may not have been a manager, but
I've been around. I know how these things work.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Hoffman will learn in the days to come is that the
team he inherited isn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   The only success the Dodgers have had this season is proving
wrong all of those talent-rich assessments. Retrospect being
perfect, the Dodgers weren't that talented before the Mike Piazza
trade, and they are less talented now.
</P>
<P>
   The pitching staff which has unraveled this season actually
began to tear apart last September, when it coughed up the N.L.
West lead by finishing 10-14. In September, Ramon Martinez, Chan Ho
Park, Hideo Nomo and Tom Candiotti all had ERAs over 5.00, as did
the bullpen as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't be shocking that Nomo began the season without
velocity after undergoing elbow surgery, or that Martinez would
suffer more rotator cuff problems after missing 10 starts in 1997,
or that the bullpen, which didn't replace Todd Worrell, has blown
up.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were a lousy team a year ago in low-scoring games,
and that was with Piazza, who drove in 124 runs. Without him, they
have no one in the lineup who fills the definition of clutch. Even
those who believe Piazza overplayed his hand in contract talks
would agree the Dodgers miss him.
</P>
<P>
   Most would also agree that the Dodgers overestimated the ability
of several prospects, including about a half-dozen outfielders.
Fred Claire's legacy is Piazza and Karros, but also Karim Garcia,
Roger Cedeno, Todd Hollandsworth and Billy Ashley.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman may also learn that the team he used to manage in
Albuquerque is fundamentally better than the Dodgers, who regularly
miss signs, blow relays and run themselves out of innings.
</P>
<P>
   Change begats change, so there could be even more personnel
shuffling in the weeks to come. As Karros noted, the Dodgers have
set a club record for distractions, ``and we're not even at the
break yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly without a chance to catch the Padres, maybe the
Dodgers should be content catching their breath.

 UNDATED: White gallery.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Newhouse discounts the result as kitsch inauthenticity. ``In
the absence of an original Renoir, the Metropolitan would not
commission an imagined one; the Andre Meyer Galleries are the
design equivalent of such an absurd substitution.''
</P>
<P>
   New York museums in general don't do too well here. On Gwathmey
Siegel's 1992 addition to Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum:
``The problem is not so much with the design of the alteration as
with the decision to alter it at all.'' On Michael Graves' 1985
proposed addition to the Whitney Museum of American Art: ``Whatever
the design's undeniable merits, there is no doubt that it
cannibalized the Breuer building, reducing it to a subsidiary
element in a totally new statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The book's historically rich account of building at the Museum
of Modern Art will not bring cheer in Manhattan. Ms. Newhouse draws
a picture of the Modern's consistent failure to live up to the
standards maintained by its own department of architecture and
design.
</P>
<P>
   A low point was reached in 1984, surely, with the opening of
Museum Tower, a condominium high-rise and an escalator enclosure
called the Garden Hall. In these projects, both designed by Cesar
Pelli, architecture was eclipsed by real estate values.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newhouse praises the clarity and elegance of the Modern's
new expansion plan, designed by Yoshio Taniguchi, but regards the
project as a missed opportunity to reconfigure the museum's
mission. Though museum officials had announced their intention to
use architecture as a vehicle for regeneration, Ms. Newhouse views
the scheme as more of the same: ``a sacred sanctuary for MOMA's
gospel of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Libeskind's Jewish Museum Extension in Berlin draws forth
some of Ms. Newhouse's sharpest observations. Conceived as a
Holocaust memorial, the concrete structure is thunderbolt-shaped
and clad in zinc. The core of the design is a three-story void
space, crossed by bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents absence,'' the author observes, ``all that,
because of the Holocaust, is lost to Berlin and to civilization in
general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment one enters,'' she also writes, ``there is a
feeling of dislocation: the multiple axes; the steep, monumental
main stair crisscrossed by oblique girders overhead; the tortured,
slanted, asymmetrical wall incisions through which light beams
splice the interiors; and acoustics that amplify the slightest
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bilbao, the Jewish Museum Expansion evokes the struggle and
torment of the creative process. There is, of course, no reason
that all museum architecture must look Laocoonic. Richard
Gluckman's mild-mannered galleries are fine places for viewing art.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Newhouse is right to emphasize buildings that make
creativity's risks and dangers visible. In these buildings, Apollo
is doing his job, protecting Orpheus as the singer descends into
the underworld to explore its caves and labyrinths, the dark
corners where love might be hiding or a new song waiting to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   Her book raises a paradox. With all this honor being paid to
art, why is the present cultural climate so stifled by oppressive
appeals to normalcy? Civility campaigns. Baptists preaching about
woman's place. Health warnings on bags of potato chips. And when
you look at a building as enervated as the San Francisco Museum of
Modern Art, you may think, this place is playing right along with
that oppressive band.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo is not wholly benign. His name has been traced to an
ancient Greek verb meaning ``to destroy.'' The sun can be lethal as
well as life-giving. And the building that shows the god's dual
nature teaches something essential about cultural life.

   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAINT ETIENNE, France _ If it were hockey, it could be said that
Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert ``stands on his head.''
</P>
<P>
   That's puck parlance for contorting oneself into various
positions, all for the sake of turning back every shot.
</P>
<P>
   But this is World Cup soccer. And this is Chilavert, an
eccentric, on-the-edge monster of a goalkeeper who few would argue
is the strangest, most volatile combination of skill and
personality in the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell Chilavert about ``standing on his head.'' Don't give
him any ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert has been known to do a bit of everything while
performing for his Argentine professional club and more recently
for surprisingly tough Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   He sits in front of the net while the ball is on the other end
of the field, as if to say, ``Come on, I want some action.'' He
screams at opponents, calling them ``toothless kittens.''
</P>
<P>
   He flexes like a bodybuilder after saves, punches reporters,
calls referees names, kicks penalty and free kicks, occasionally
causes international incidents with his mouth and wreaks havoc in
various other ways.
</P>
<P>
   But here is Paraguay on the verge of advancing to the second
round of the World Cup with a tie or a win against Nigeria today.
And here is Chilavert, backing up his boasts of being the world's
greatest goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predicted we will move on,'' Chilavert said Tuesday, ``and
we will.''
</P>
<P>
   He is cocky and ultra-skilled. He is brash and funny. He is
controversial and unique.
</P>
<P>
   And without question, if Paraguay does indeed come out of the
so-called ``Group of Death'' today, Chilavert will be the sole
reason why.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Cup tournament that has been wide-open and
high-scoring from the start, Chilavert has kept his otherwise
mediocre team alive with two shutouts in 0-0 ties with Bulgaria and
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Against Spain, which was among the pre-Cup contenders to win it
all, Chilavert wowed fans and frustrated the Spaniards with an
array of diving and leaping saves.
</P>
<P>
   He did everything but literally stand on his head.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20th minute of the Spain game, Chilavert set the stage
for his remarkable tournament when Juan Antonio Pizzi headed what
looked to be a sure goal. Chilavert caught up to the ball and
somehow lunged to make an acrobatic save, barely tipping the ball
over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The save seemed to zap the life out of Spain, especially when
the burly Chilavert punctuated the save with taunting screams at
Spain's players.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the game, Chilavert made two more awkward and
spectacular saves, both on strong shots by Spain's Luis Enrique,
who is among the game's best goal-scorers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had many chances to win,'' Spain coach Javier Clemente said
afterward. ``They were all turned away nicely.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Spain game, Chilavert nearly fulfilled another boast
he had for the 1998 World Cup _ becoming the first goalkeeper to
score a goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Chilavert stepped up to take a free kick for
his team, which he does quite regularly for Paraguay and his
Argentine professional team, River Plate. Chilavert's booming
left-footed kick looked to have a chance but deflected off a player
in the defensive wall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is today's game and possibly more opportunities to
come for Chilavert. He might actually be Paraguay's best offensive
weapon as much as its best defensive stopper.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a marvelous 50-yard free-kick goal against Argentina
during World Cup qualifying last year, which led to a 1-1 tie and
assured Paraguay its first berth in the Cup finals since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates carried Chilavert off the field after the crucial
tie with Argentina, and Chilavert said of the Argentine goalie
afterward, ``He needs to concentrate more when I am kicking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert has scored 40 goals in international games and many
more for River Plate.
</P>
<P>
   So valuable has Chilavert, 32, become to his team that when he
was banned for four games for inciting an on-field brawl in 1994,
not only did Paraguay lose all four games but it scored just two
goals. Since then, he has become the focal point for a nation.
</P>
<P>
   As Chilavert goes, so go the Paraguayans. And currently, he is
at the top of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very good chance of advancing in front of us,''
Paraguay coach Paulo Cesar Carpegiani said. ``We need all our
players to be at their best (against Nigeria), but, yes, Chila is a
key.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the ``Bulldog,'' a nickname earned because Chilavert
refuses to wear a jersey that does not have an image of a bulldog
emblazoned on it. And, yes, Paraguay allowed Chilavert to alter the
national-team jersey so that he could wear a bulldog during this
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to invite controversy and attention with his volatile
ways, which some say overshadow the side to his personality that
last year prompted him to contribute more than $200,000 to a
children's charity in Asuncion, where Chilavert grew up in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   His most controversial moment might have come in 1994, when
after receiving a suspended jail sentence for his part in the
on-field brawl, Chilavert said the Argentines ``can't stand the
thought of a Paraguayan being the best in their country at
something. They think that Paraguayans belong on building sites or
cleaning the kitchens of the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement caused such an uproar that the Paraguayan
ambassador had to make a statement denouncing Chilavert's words and
calming the furor.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Chilavert again was taking shots at the
Argentines, with whom he definitely has a love-hate relationship.
Argentina is where he makes a rich professional living, but it is a
country that he often incites into uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert, who once called an Argentine goalie a Fiat and
himself a Mercedes, went to the Japanese media to offer a scouting
report before the Japan-Argentina Cup opener, which ultimately
Argentina won.
</P>
<P>
   ``Argentina's problem is in midfield,'' Chilavert said. ``Their
players don't go for pressing much, and they don't like it when
opponents stick too close to them. I am not impressed by them.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the irrepressible bulldog. But like his antics or not, it
is difficult not to be impressed by Chilavert in this World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the best at what I do,'' he said. ``My job is to prove
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has.

`AIDS IS WINNING,' REPORTS INTERNATIONAL AGENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct figures in story) 
 
By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the World AIDS Conference approaches, the primary
international AIDS agency paints a bleak picture of the spread of
the AIDS virus in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most of the world, AIDS is winning,'' said said Dr. Peter
Piot, executive director of the Joint U.N. Agency on AIDS, an
international umbrella organization coordinating the fight across
national borders. The World AIDS Conference begins Sunday in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis the group has issued,
its experts estimate that 30.6 million people are living with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, or AIDS across the world, with 16,000
new infections daily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 5.8 million new infections and 2.3 million deaths were
attributed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the disease has become one of the
leading causes of infectious death in the world _ ranking with
malaria and tuberculosis as a mass killer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the industrialized world that includes the United
States, the AIDS death rates and rates of new infection
arestabilizing or dropping, Piot said. In most of these countries,
people with AIDS have ready access to drugs that fight the virus
and the illnesses to which infected people are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   While attempts to prevent the spread of AIDS have met with some
success in industrialized nations, that is not true of Asia or most
of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At least one in 10 people living in 13 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa are infected with HIV. Southern Africa _ the part of the
world hardest hit by the disease _ has 3 million people living with
HIV, Piot said. Of those, 700,000 were infected in the last year,
an example of how fast the disease is spreading there.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is doubling and tripling adult death rates in the many of
these countries, Piot said. Specifically, in Botswana and Zimbabwe,
one in four adults in urban and rural areas carry the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   HIV is still an emerging epidemic in the nations of Eastern
Europe and Asia, he said. Because of that, overall rates of disease
are low, but in the past two years, many of these nations have
experienced a six- to 10-fold increase in the numbers of reported
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said gaps contribute to the increasing death and infection
rates in countries where people are uneducated and poor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the numerous gaps include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disparities in access to treatment for all diseases related to
HIV, including tuberculosis and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Differences in the rates of transmission, with spread of the
disease slowing in countries where prevention is stressed and
speeding up where AIDS is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaps in knowledge about HIV status, leading to increased
spread of the disease and the threat that more children will be
born infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand and Uganda have managed to slow the increase of disease
in their AIDS epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda has cut its AIDS infection rate by 25 percent _ from 13
percent in 1994 to 9.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has reduced prevalence of the disease in that country
from 2.7 percent in 1994 to 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, prevention programs stressing condom use, delayed
age at first intercourse and reduction of sexual partners played a
big role in lowering infection rates.

<P>
   GENEVA _ In certain areas of Africa, one in four adults is
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, and around the world the
disease now rivals the greatest epidemics of history, according to
a United Nations report issued today.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis of the disease, the
United Nations said that last year 30 million people worldwide were
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, and that 21 million were in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Countries south of the Sahara account for the world's 21 highest
rates of HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 years, the most sexually
active segment of the population. In 13 of those countries, HIV has
infected at least 10 percent of adults, and in Botswana and
Zimbabwe, a quarter of adults are infected, a rate that even an
expert described as ``shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released ahead of the 12th international AIDS
conference that begins here on Sunday, paints the gloomiest
pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is hitting Africa so fiercely that it now rivals the great
epidemics of history _ the Black Death of the Middle Ages that
killed 20 million people, or one-quarter of Europe's population, in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 that killed 20
million people, including half a million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But where plague and influenza killed in days, death from
untreated AIDS takes about a decade, making it a more silent
epidemic that officials have too easily ignored, AIDS officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HIV killed as rapidly as plague and influenza, the epidemic
would be controlled by now,'' Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the U.N.
AIDS Program, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report contained a glimmer of good news, showing a slowing
of infection rates in countries that have adopted strong prevention
programs, like Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot and other officials warned that South Africa, Namibia
and other African countries could soon reach a 25 percent adult
infection rate unless national leaders undertook similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates exceed one in three adults in some major African
cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in some prenatal
clinics. Many infected women pass the virus on to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of the Africans are doomed to die from
AIDS, the officials said, because they live in countries that
cannot afford the costly combinations of drugs that have helped
keep the virus in check among infected people in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The African figures compare to a worldwide adult HIV-infection
rate of 1 percent for adults and 0.76 percent in the United States.
Moreover, officials said, 90 percent of the African patients
probably do not know they are infected because testing is not
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide last year, 5.6 million people were newly infected
while 2.3 million died from AIDS. AIDS is now on the verge of
moving into the top five leading causes of death in the world,
overtaking diarrheal diseases. The viral infection now kills as
many people as malaria and is second only to tuberculosis, which
itself is a common complication of AIDS and a source of infection
to non-HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Piot, a Belgian who has worked with AIDS in third world
countries for more than 15 years, called the new HIV figures
staggering and said he was ``shocked'' when he learned that 25
percent of an entire country's adults were infected. At first, both
Piot and Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, the U.N. epidemiologist who
led the analysis, said they suspected a statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   But checking found them accurate and erring on the side of
underestimates, they said. It took the U.N. AIDS program more than
a year to gather and verify the figures with each country, and the
figures on AIDS are considered the most reliable of any
international health statistics, Piot said. Health officials have
been hampered since AIDS was first recognized in 1981 in getting a
handle on such information because of the notoriously poor quality
of health statistics in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. researchers obtained data from published material,
surveys conducted in clinics and health department data. Among the
methods used was computer modeling, using census data and infection
rates, to verify trends reported by the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said the epidemic could eventually be controlled if other
countries matched successful prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda was the first country to respond to a massive burden of
HIV infection, and the African country has cut HIV prevalence more
than a quarter, to 9.5 percent in 1997 from 13 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, which has experienced what the U.N. said was probably
the best documented epidemic in the developing world, has cut its
prevalence by nearly 15 percent _ to 2.3 percent in 1997 from 2.7
percent in 1994. A drop in new infections was noted especially
among sex workers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the industrialized world, reductions of this magnitude
are virtually unheard of,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal instituted campaigns for safer sex that has kept its
infection rate at about 2 percent. ``Senegal acted before it had a
major problem, but there are not enough of those countries,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than money will be needed to match such efforts
elsewhere, Piot said. ``The overriding need is political courage _
deciding to move ahead with effective approaches despite cultural
constraints such as promotion of condom use, sex education in
schools and widespread health education programs,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   As HIV is spread, it insinuates itself into communities little
troubled in the past and strengthens its grip on areas where AIDS
is already the leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, the infection rate has more than doubled to 25.1
percent in 1997 from 10 percent in 1992. Surveys have found 43
percent of pregnant women infected in 1997 in the major urban
center of Francistown. In 1995 in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,
32 percent of pregnant women were infected.
</P>
<P>
   In one town on the Zimbabwe-South African border, 70 percent of
women attending prenatal clinics in 1995 were found to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   HIV rates are lower in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America.
But an alarming trend is the doubling and tripling of transmission
rates in some countries in these areas since 1994. ``Because over
half the world's population lives in the region, small differences
in rates can make a huge difference in the absolute numbers of
people infected,'' the U. N. report said.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing alarm about the widening gap in infection and
death rates between industrialized and developing countries, Piot
said the gap ``shines the spotlight on the have-nots of the
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. group attributed the gap to inadequate measures to stop
transmission of HIV and to make available the combinations of
anti-HIV drugs that help forestall development of deadly
AIDS-related infections and cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, deaths from HIV left 1.6 million children without at
least one parent. From the time the epidemic was first recognized
in 1981 to the beginning of 1998, 8.2 million children lost their
mothers to AIDS. Many also lost their fathers as well. In East
Africa, 40 percent of children 15 or younger have lost their mother
or both parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the number of orphans grows and the number of potential
caregivers shrinks, traditional coping mechanisms stretch to the
breaking point,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. AIDS program cited four reasons why the infection rates
are so high in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One is that more women of childbearing age are HIV infected in
Africa than elsewhere. A second is that African women have more
children on average than those in other continents. Thus, one
infected woman may pass the virus on to a higher average number of
children.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that nearly all children in Africa are
breastfed, which is thought to account for between a third and a
half of all HIV transmission from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth reason is that new drugs are less readily available
than in industrialized world. Also, other sexually transmitted
diseases are known to speed transmission of AIDS and may go
untreated in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. said it saw early warning signs that epidemics of
similar magnitude could occur among Asian countries, where HIV has
been a relative latecomer. However, the report said the figures for
Asia are less reliable than elsewhere because only a few Asian
countries have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the
spread of the virus.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   India has the largest number of HIV-infected people _ 4 million
_ in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One survey in Pondicherry found four percent of pregnant women
infected. The prevalence of infection among truck drivers in Madras
quadrupled to 6.2 percent in 1996 from 1.5 percent in 1995. In
Manipure state, 73 percent of the patients in a clinic for
injecting drug users were infected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although HIV has infected less than 1 percent of adults in
India, the figure is 10 times higher than in neighboring China.
</P>
<P>
   Two major epidemics are occurring in China, the U.N. said. One
is among injecting drug users. The other is among heterosexuals in
the prosperous eastern seaboard where prostitution is re-emerging
as the gap grows between rich and poor. The incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases has soared in recent years. Health officials
regard the trend in sexually transmitted diseases as a warning sign
of HIV rates because sexually transmitted diseases can enhance its
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report also includes the first country-by-country
information about the availability and use of condoms. But on
condom use, the report's tables contain many blanks _ purposeful by
challenging national leaders to take tougher stands on controlling
HIV infection, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   With a vaccine against HIV a distant hope, Piot said that ``AIDS
is with us to stay for a long time.''

LAKERS CONSIDER OPTIONS AT NO. 26
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By JIM McCURDIE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Here we are, right back where we were a year
ago, wondering whether the Los Angeles Lakers will stand by their
man.
</P>
<P>
   The team that gave Nick Van Exel his first big break by
selecting him with the 37th selection of the 1993 Draft is now
believed to be contemplating trading him, and today could be the
day Van Exel is sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   Or could it?
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel's agent is on record saying that Laker executive vice
president Jerry West told him shortly after the Lakers were
eliminated by Utah in the Western Conference Finals that the club
would likely be trading his client. Today's NBA Draft is the ideal
time for wheeling and dealing, particularly with a July 1 lockout
looking more real and ominous each day.
</P>
<P>
   But Laker general manager Mitch Kupchak wouldn't confirm that
Van Exel is on the trading block. While exercising great caution
not to tip his hand and speaking with the kind of forked tongue NBA
executives generally use this time of year, Kupchak indicated that
speculation that the Lakers will shake up their roster a bit in the
wake of the sweeping loss to Utah may be inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking to do it,'' he said. ``I would not be
surprised if we did nothing. But as our jobs are defined, whatever
we can do to improve this team we will do. If it means trading a
player for a player or trading a player for a draft choice, or the
remote possibility that a free agent would come here and make a
contribution... that's what we're going to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking... we don't feel a great need to change the
team. But we would.''
</P>
<P>
   So a trade or two (any takers for Elden Campbell at $7 million
per year?) can't be ruled out, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'll say about our team is that we've been
getting a bunch of calls,'' Kupchak said. ``This time of year, it's
what we do. It's good to know that other teams covet some of our
players. It gives us options, and possibilities to improve the
team. If there's a way to do that, we'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing pat would mean the Lakers would try to uncover a gem
with the 26th selection of today's draft. They've come up big from
similar draft positions before (see Vlade Divac, No. 26 in 1989,
Campbell, No. 27 in 1990, Derek Fisher No. 24 in 1996 and Van
Exel), but this draft isn't exactly brimming with the kind of
player who can move right in and crack the rotation of a team that
won 61 games in 1997-98 and reached the conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers go into the draft with the 26th and 31st picks. The
latter, the second choice of the second round, was obtained from
Vancouver in a swap of second-round picks that was part of 1996
trade that sent guard Anthony Peeler and forward George Lynch to
the Grizzlies. They also have the 45th pick.
</P>
<P>
   What's likely to be left at those spots is more of what the
Lakers already have in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always more guards than there are big people,
always,'' Kupchak said. ``That's probably what we'll wind up
looking at down there at the end of the first round and early
second round--- players that range from 6-1 to 6-6, some of which
were small forwards or big forwards in college, and you have to
figure out if they can convert to a shooting guard or a small
forward in our league.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the players who could be available when that 26th pick
comes up are Nebraska point guard Tyronn Lee, who could come in
handy if Van Exel does indeed get traded, St. John's guard Felipe
Lopez, Oregon State guard Corey Benjamin, Valparaiso guard Bryce
Drew, Iowa guard Ricky Davis, Clemson guard Greg Buckner and Baylor
forward Brian Skinner.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are facing some uncertainty over their small forward
spot since starter Rick Fox is a free agent and, under the current
salary cap restrictions, the Lakers can't pay him as much as he
could get from another team. The Lakers are approaching this much
the same way they did with forward Travis Knight last season---
hoping that no one makes Fox an offer too good to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's indicated to us this is where he wants to be,'' Kupchak
said. ``We want him to be here, and all of our preliminary (plans)
include him. But we are aware that there's a significant
possibility we will lose him. Whether that's 10 percent or 30
percent I don't know.''

CLINTON CENSUS NOMINEE FAVORS POLITICALLY CONTROVERSIAL METHOD
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday nominated Kenneth
Prewitt, a soft-spoken academic and former divinity student, to be
director of the Census Bureau, an agency that is being buffeted by
partisan disputes over its plans for conducting the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Prewitt, 62, would fill a position
that has been vacant since January, when Martha Farnsworth Riche
abruptly resigned as congressional pressure mounted over the
bureau's plans to change its methods for conducting the next
census.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt is president of the Social Science Research Council, a
private foundation in New York City that finances studies to
determine how to approach the investigation of complex economic and
social phenomenon. Clinton administration officials say he is one
of the top social science statisticians in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Prewitt is a person of impeccable credentials and proven
scientific integrity,'' William Daley, the secretary of commerce,
said in announcing the nomination Tuesday. ``The year 2000 is
coming quickly, and the Census Bureau faces many challenges in its
quest to conduct the best census in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau has designed the next census in a way to avoid
a repetition of the 1990 effort, which was the most expensive in
history and yet is widely believed to have missed an estimated 8.4
million people and double-counted or improperly tallied 4.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   To improve its performance, the bureau has proposed taking a
sample of households that do not mail back their census forms.
Using scientific means, statisticians would use that sample to
estimate the size and demographic characteristics of those houses
that failed to return the forms.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's opponents, mainly Republicans, say it is illegal and
subject to partisan manipulation. But both Democrats and
Republicans say the fight is over political power, because many who
are missed using the traditional census method are minorities
living in solidly Democratic areas, while many of those who are
counted twice are whites living in Republican-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, getting a more accurate count could result in the
redrawing of district lines in a way that would make them more
favorable to Democrats and harmful to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his opinions of sampling, Prewitt said he supported it.
But he seemed, in the face of having to be confirmed by a
Republican-controlled Senate, to play down the partisan nature of
the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weight of professional opinion, which I share, is that
sampling, if properly used can contribute to a more accurate
census,'' Prewitt said. ``Reasonable people can come to a different
conclusion. This is a matter of technical and scientific review. It
is not a matter of partisan disagreement. It is not a matter of
ideological positioning, and it is not question of whether data can
be manipulated or not.''

`AIDS IS WINNING,' REPORTS INTERNATIONAL AGENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to correct figures in story) 
 
By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the World AIDS Conference approaches, the primary
international AIDS agency paints a bleak picture of the spread of
the AIDS virus in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most of the world, AIDS is winning,'' said said Dr. Peter
Piot, executive director of the Joint U.N. Agency on AIDS, an
international umbrella organization coordinating the fight across
national borders. The World AIDS Conference begins Sunday in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis the group has issued,
its experts estimate that 30.6 million people are living with HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, or AIDS across the world, with 16,000
new infections daily.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 5.8 million new infections and 2.3 million deaths were
attributed to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the disease has become one of the
leading causes of infectious death in the world _ ranking with
malaria and tuberculosis as a mass killer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the industrialized world that includes the United
States, the AIDS death rates and rates of new infection
arestabilizing or dropping, Piot said. In most of these countries,
people with AIDS have ready access to drugs that fight the virus
and the illnesses to which infected people are vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   While attempts to prevent the spread of AIDS have met with some
success in industrialized nations, that is not true of Asia or most
of sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   At least one in 10 people living in 13 countries in sub-Saharan
Africa are infected with HIV. Southern Africa _ the part of the
world hardest hit by the disease _ has 3 million people living with
HIV, Piot said. Of those, 700,000 were infected in the last year,
an example of how fast the disease is spreading there.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is doubling and tripling adult death rates in the many of
these countries, Piot said. Specifically, in Botswana and Zimbabwe,
one in four adults in urban and rural areas carry the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   HIV is still an emerging epidemic in the nations of Eastern
Europe and Asia, he said. Because of that, overall rates of disease
are low, but in the past two years, many of these nations have
experienced a six- to 10-fold increase in the numbers of reported
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said gaps contribute to the increasing death and infection
rates in countries where people are uneducated and poor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the numerous gaps include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Disparities in access to treatment for all diseases related to
HIV, including tuberculosis and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   _ Differences in the rates of transmission, with spread of the
disease slowing in countries where prevention is stressed and
speeding up where AIDS is ignored.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gaps in knowledge about HIV status, leading to increased
spread of the disease and the threat that more children will be
born infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there are bright spots.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand and Uganda have managed to slow the increase of disease
in their AIDS epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda has cut its AIDS infection rate by 25 percent _ from 13
percent in 1994 to 9.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has reduced prevalence of the disease in that country
from 2.7 percent in 1994 to 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, prevention programs stressing condom use, delayed
age at first intercourse and reduction of sexual partners played a
big role in lowering infection rates.

MOLINARI QUITS CBS, ENDING ANCHORWOMAN EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was either CBS News' experiment with creating an
anchorwoman from a congresswoman, or Susan Molinari's experiment
with transforming herself from a Republican Party star into a
television star. From either perspective, the experiment failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ms. Molinari and CBS News president Andrew Heyward
announced that she would leave the network, nine months after she
began as the co-anchor of ``CBS News Saturday Morning'' with Russ
Mitchell. Saturday's broadcast will be her last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel she was terribly comfortable with the format or
material, even though she was very devoted to it and worked very
hard at it,'' Heyward said in a telephone interview. ``I think she
has a lot of ability and a lot to offer, but the program was not
the best venue for her. I think she missed the political arena _
not being in politics per se, but political commentary and
analysis. There's very little of that on a Saturday morning show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari, in a statement, praised everyone she had worked
with at CBS News and added: ``I look forward to my next opportunity
in broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement said she had accepted a visiting fellowship at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of government starting in the
fall, and was considering ``several broadcasting options, including
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference 13 months ago announcing her hiring,
after almost seven years as a congresswoman from Staten Island, Ms.
Molinari described her vision for the program as ``a sort of `60
Minutes' meets Rosie O'Donnell,'' in which she could report on
important issues but also interview celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Ms. Molinari's, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said she had been dissatisfied because the program dealt
with substantive issues less often than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   A senior-level producer at CBS News, also insisting on
anonymity, said Ms. Molinari ``didn't have a lot of talent for
television reading, interviewing, or being spontaneous; she just
didn't have the performance skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Her hiring was widely criticized for blurring the line between
politicians and the journalists who cover them. Many media
personalities have gone into politics, and vice versa, although
some former politicians appear on television as commentators rather
than as reporters or anchors.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Molinari's popularity as a politician did not attract
many viewers. The show, a new venture for CBS News, has averaged a
1.3 Nielsen rating (each rating point represents 980,000
households), lagging about two points behind the more established
Saturday edition of NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The show will continue with Mitchell and various substitute
co-anchors until a permanent successor to Ms. Molinari is named.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari had a multiyear contract, but the settlement terms
were not disclosed.

CELTICS WILL TRY TO KEEP UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No matter what your opinion is of them, you would have
to say they are better today than they were 12 months ago. Any
observer, objective or subjective, can tell you that.
</P>
<P>
   Remember June 24, 1997? The Celtics still retained the rights to
Frank Brickowski, who was known more for hanging out on a Montana
ranch with actor Charlie Sheen than doing damage on basketball
courts. They had Nate ``Grave'' Driggers, who inspired Cedric
Maxwell to wail, ``He's not a basketball player; he's a boxer. He's
playing the wrong sport.'' A shooting guard who couldn't shoot
consistently, Todd Day, was making his case for additional minutes.
And a man from a one-stoplight, one-movie theater town in
northeastern Iowa, Brett Szabo, was listed on the roster as a
center and part-time Clark Kent double.
</P>
<P>
   So yes, they are better. But tonight at 7:30, when the Celtics
enter the second draft of Rick's Reign _ Year Two of the Rick
Pitino Era _ they will go in knowing that being better is not good
enough. Maybe the very American attitude of keeping up with the
neighbors is trite, but that has to be your philosophy in the NBA.
If the people next door have secured the new Volkswagen, you have
to be prepared to counter with nothing less than a Benz.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, general manager Chris Wallace, and head scout Leo Papile
realize this. This is the Internet NBA, where improvement is not
enough. You may have something fast, but tomorrow someone is going
to come by with something faster. That's why the Celtics aren't
overwhelmed with staying in the No. 10 draft position. Can they get
a good player there? Certainly. But they aren't going to get anyone
who will help them scale the Non-Playoff Mountain and get past the
Nets, Knicks, Cavaliers, and Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we'll get better,'' Pitino said.
``We'll improve on 36 wins, there's no question about that. But
everybody is going to get better. New Jersey, Washington,
Philadelphia, Orlando. They're all going to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are coach and president of a team, you don't have the
luxury of thinking about yourself solely. That was evident just
before last season's trading deadline. Pitino was standing in a
Sacramento locker room and being asked about his team's trade
possibilities. He said things were quiet. A few minutes later, he
was told about the 76ers' acquisition of Joe Smith and Jim Jackson.
Moments after that, he had a meeting with salary cap specialist
Rick Avare, and that night the deal sending Chauncey Billups to
Toronto for Kenny Anderson was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the timing was coincidental. More likely, the Celtics were
trying to keep up. And that's what they're doing right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hottest rumor in the country is that Rick came out here to
work out Michael (Olowokandi),'' said Bill Duffy, the
California-based agent for the draft's top prize. ``He didn't work
him out. But that's interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy added that the 7-foot-1-inch Olowokandi doesn't care where
he plays. He'd be willing to run and trap in the Pitino Press just
as much as he'd be willing to put a happy face on the perpetually
sad organization that is the Los Angeles Clippers, who hold the No.
1 pick. The Celtics, in their quest to become a mid-level
contender, are trying to wrest the top pick from the Clippers while
creating some salary cap room for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to take a quantum leap,'' Pitino said, ``you have to
develop your own players as well as make trades and bring in free
agents.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Celtics have asked themselves in the past year is, how
will our own players' development help us? In other words, if
Anderson, Ron Mercer, Antoine Walker, Andrew DeClercq, and Walter
McCarty play at their optimal levels for an entire season, is that
enough to get the Celtics into the playoffs for the first time
since 1995? Once again, the answer would have to be ``no.'' The
Celtics have a solid backcourt of Anderson and Mercer. But the
Wizards now have Rod Strickland and Mitch Richmond. If you
conducted an All-NBA poll among NBA players, Strickland-Richmond
would win out over Anderson-Mercer. The challenge, then, is to
counter what the Wizards have done and what the Nets, Knicks, and
Magic plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when you're talking about moving up in the draft, you have
to understand there is a price paid for that,'' Wallace said.
``Last year the Nets and Sixers just didn't exchange the second and
seventh picks. The Nets were able to get Keith Van Horn, but they
had to take a lot of salary cap junk from Philly. There's always a
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The space junk the Nets had to absorb included the awful
long-term contracts of Lucious Harris and Don MacLean. But Van Horn
helped them get into the playoffs. Now they are thinking about
47-49 wins while the Celtics are trying to get to 42-44.
</P>
<P>
   Word around the league is what you would expect. The Celtics are
trying to move the contracts of Travis Knight and Greg Minor so
they can create some salary cap breathing room. They also kneel
down each night and pray that something miraculous will happen,
resulting in another team taking Pervis Ellison. All of that could
happen, but it's still contingent on someone else wanting what you
have.
</P>
<P>
   If the Celtics are left to improve themselves by themselves,
they will probably walk away from tonight's draft with someone such
as Pat Garrity or Keon Clark. Solid players, both of them. They
will help the Celtics. But they won't bring Boston any cap
flexibility for free agents. They won't make Boston a playoff team
immediately. And in this super microchip, super baud world, they
won't help fast enough.

COURT NIXES TURNPIKE TOLL REFERENDUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A move to take down all highway tolls in Massachusetts
was ruled unconstitutional Tuesday by the state's highest court,
which also said Attorney General Scott Harshbarger erred when he
certified the initiative for the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a victory for officials at the Massachusetts
Turnpike Authority and the Big Dig, who said elimination of the
tolls would exact financial chaos on the state and cause the
pricetag for the $10.8 billion Central Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel
project to skyrocket further.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers, meanwhile, will have to continue paying tolls but will
be spared gas tax increases that likely would have been imposed to
replace the lost toll revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Judicial Court, in a forceful decision, said both
the initiative's proponents and Harshbarger failed to consider the
state's bondholders whose interest payments are guaranteed by
revenue collected from the state's tolls on the turnpike,
underharbor tunnels and the Tobin Bridge. Turnpike bonds, $1.7
billion of which are now committed to help pay for the Big Dig, are
backed up by approximately $200 million a year in toll revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petition's elimination of toll revenue constitutes a
full-blown appropriation of the bondholders' right to that property
... an interest which was expressly bestowed on them by contract _
and therefore would violate their constitutional rights,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Barth and Harold Hubschman, co-chairmen of a group
called the Free the Pike Coalition, said that the decision would
probably spell the end of their group, which fought for five years
to remove the tolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason to continue,'' Barth said. ``We're going back
to our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   After an unsuccessful attempt at collecting signatures two years
ago, the group this year collected enough signatures to put the
toll-removal question before voters on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   With their quest snuffed out by the court, Barth and Hubschman
issued a parting shot at the judges, the Legislature and the
Cellucci administration for what they said was putting the concerns
of special interests _ especially Wall Street _ ahead of
Massachusetts taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's institutionalized is the grip of the bond holders on
the political process,'' Barth said.
</P>
<P>
   Barth and Hubschman, who organized a final and last-minute rally
at the State House Tuesday, appeared by themselves. They continued
to assert that the cost of building the Massachusetts Pike has been
paid for since 1984, and that the bond obligations now satisfied by
tolls could easily be handled by the state in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, who had conspicuously declined to
take a position on the ballot initiative despite the fact that the
state is in desperate need of toll money, Tuesday issued a
statement unusually favorable to Free the Pike _ though clearly too
late to help the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that the voters won't have a chance to have a say
on this issue in November,'' said Ilene Hoffer, a Cellucci
spokeswoman. ``But Governor Cellucci has his own plan to free the
pike of tolls.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that tolls have been eliminated under the
Weld-Cellucci administration at Exits 1 through 6 and Exit 16.
</P>
<P>
   James J. Kerasiotes, chairman of the turnpike authority, which
depends on tolls and is responsible for managing the Big Dig, has
avoided public debate on the Free the Pike issue.
</P>
<P>
   As perhaps the public official with the most to lose had the
measure reached the ballot and passed, Kerasiotes said, ``From the
day I was appointed I have made sure that we're on a path to
eliminating tolls west of Route 128. ... That's the plan we thought
was the most responsible to maintain the road and help the state to
finance the Central Artery project.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes said he continues to seek non-toll revenues at the
authority to help pay its costs. At Tuesday's turnpike board of
directors meeting, in fact, he suggested the new electronic toll
system, scheduled to begin operating this fall, will be the first
in the nation to have ``a corporate sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dimino, president of the Artery Business Committee,
which led the challenge to Free the Pike, could not hide his
elation about the court decision. ``I'm psyched,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this did proceed to the ballot and had won, in effect the
taxpayers would have been voting for a hidden tax,'' Dimino said.
Toll supporters estimated that up to 11 cents would have to have
been added to the existing 21-cent-a-gallon state gasoline tax to
offset the loss of approximately $200 million a year in tolls.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative's opponents also argued that elimination
of tolls would have seriously affected the state's overall
financial picture.
</P>
<P>
   The high court agreed with the challengers' position. Writing
for the court, Justice Charles Fried said that, ``in certifying the
petition, the Attorney General should have considered the security
interests held by the 1997 bondholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's spokesman, Ed Cafasso, said the attorney general
was obligated to answer a narrow set of questions in certifying it
for the ballot. ``We applied those standards, and ... based on his
analysis it was constitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Cafasso acknowledged that the court disagreed with
Harshbarger, who is running as a Democrat for governor, on the
matter of the rights of authority bond holders.
</P>
<P>
   But, Cafasso added, ``Would Scott Harshbarger have voted for
this had it made it to the ballot? No.''

PARTS OF AFRICA SHOWING HIV IN 1 IN 4 ADULTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In certain areas of Africa, one in four adults is
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, and around the world the
disease now rivals the greatest epidemics of history, according to
a United Nations report issued today.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis of the disease, the
United Nations said that last year 30 million people worldwide were
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, and that 21 million were in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Countries south of the Sahara account for the world's 21 highest
rates of HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 years, the most sexually
active segment of the population. In 13 of those countries, HIV has
infected at least 10 percent of adults, and in Botswana and
Zimbabwe, a quarter of adults are infected, a rate that even an
expert described as ``shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released ahead of the 12th international AIDS
conference that begins here on Sunday, paints the gloomiest
pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is hitting Africa so fiercely that it now rivals the great
epidemics of history _ the Black Death of the Middle Ages that
killed 20 million people, or one-quarter of Europe's population, in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 that killed 20
million people, including half a million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But where plague and influenza killed in days, death from
untreated AIDS takes about a decade, making it a more silent
epidemic that officials have too easily ignored, AIDS officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HIV killed as rapidly as plague and influenza, the epidemic
would be controlled by now,'' Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the U.N.
AIDS Program, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report contained a glimmer of good news, showing a slowing
of infection rates in countries that have adopted strong prevention
programs, like Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot and other officials warned that South Africa, Namibia
and other African countries could soon reach a 25 percent adult
infection rate unless national leaders undertook similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates exceed one in three adults in some major African
cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in some prenatal
clinics. Many infected women pass the virus on to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of the Africans are doomed to die from
AIDS, the officials said, because they live in countries that
cannot afford the costly combinations of drugs that have helped
keep the virus in check among infected people in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The African figures compare to a worldwide adult HIV-infection
rate of 1 percent for adults and 0.76 percent in the United States.
Moreover, officials said, 90 percent of the African patients
probably do not know they are infected because testing is not
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide last year, 5.6 million people were newly infected
while 2.3 million died from AIDS. AIDS is now on the verge of
moving into the top five leading causes of death in the world,
overtaking diarrheal diseases. The viral infection now kills as
many people as malaria and is second only to tuberculosis, which
itself is a common complication of AIDS and a source of infection
to non-HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Piot, a Belgian who has worked with AIDS in third world
countries for more than 15 years, called the new HIV figures
staggering and said he was ``shocked'' when he learned that 25
percent of an entire country's adults were infected. At first, both
Piot and Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, the U.N. epidemiologist who
led the analysis, said they suspected a statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   But checking found them accurate and erring on the side of
underestimates, they said. It took the U.N. AIDS program more than
a year to gather and verify the figures with each country, and the
figures on AIDS are considered the most reliable of any
international health statistics, Piot said. Health officials have
been hampered since AIDS was first recognized in 1981 in getting a
handle on such information because of the notoriously poor quality
of health statistics in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. researchers obtained data from published material,
surveys conducted in clinics and health department data. Among the
methods used was computer modeling, using census data and infection
rates, to verify trends reported by the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said the epidemic could eventually be controlled if other
countries matched successful prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda was the first country to respond to a massive burden of
HIV infection, and the African country has cut HIV prevalence more
than a quarter, to 9.5 percent in 1997 from 13 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, which has experienced what the U.N. said was probably
the best documented epidemic in the developing world, has cut its
prevalence by nearly 15 percent _ to 2.3 percent in 1997 from 2.7
percent in 1994. A drop in new infections was noted especially
among sex workers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the industrialized world, reductions of this magnitude
are virtually unheard of,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal instituted campaigns for safer sex that has kept its
infection rate at about 2 percent. ``Senegal acted before it had a
major problem, but there are not enough of those countries,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than money will be needed to match such efforts
elsewhere, Piot said. ``The overriding need is political courage _
deciding to move ahead with effective approaches despite cultural
constraints such as promotion of condom use, sex education in
schools and widespread health education programs,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   As HIV is spread, it insinuates itself into communities little
troubled in the past and strengthens its grip on areas where AIDS
is already the leading cause of death.

   In Botswana, the infection rate has more than doubled to 25.1
percent in 1997 from 10 percent in 1992. Surveys have found 43
percent of pregnant women infected in 1997 in the major urban
center of Francistown. In 1995 in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,
32 percent of pregnant women were infected.
</P>
<P>
   In one town on the Zimbabwe-South African border, 70 percent of
women attending prenatal clinics in 1995 were found to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   HIV rates are lower in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America.
But an alarming trend is the doubling and tripling of transmission
rates in some countries in these areas since 1994. ``Because over
half the world's population lives in the region, small differences
in rates can make a huge difference in the absolute numbers of
people infected,'' the U. N. report said.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing alarm about the widening gap in infection and
death rates between industrialized and developing countries, Piot
said the gap ``shines the spotlight on the have-nots of the
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. group attributed the gap to inadequate measures to stop
transmission of HIV and to make available the combinations of
anti-HIV drugs that help forestall development of deadly
AIDS-related infections and cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, deaths from HIV left 1.6 million children without at
least one parent. From the time the epidemic was first recognized
in 1981 to the beginning of 1998, 8.2 million children lost their
mothers to AIDS. Many also lost their fathers as well. In East
Africa, 40 percent of children 15 or younger have lost their mother
or both parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the number of orphans grows and the number of potential
caregivers shrinks, traditional coping mechanisms stretch to the
breaking point,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. AIDS program cited four reasons why the infection rates
are so high in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One is that more women of childbearing age are HIV infected in
Africa than elsewhere. A second is that African women have more
children on average than those in other continents. Thus, one
infected woman may pass the virus on to a higher average number of
children.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that nearly all children in Africa are
breastfed, which is thought to account for between a third and a
half of all HIV transmission from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth reason is that new drugs are less readily available
than in industrialized world. Also, other sexually transmitted
diseases are known to speed transmission of AIDS and may go
untreated in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. said it saw early warning signs that epidemics of
similar magnitude could occur among Asian countries, where HIV has
been a relative latecomer. However, the report said the figures for
Asia are less reliable than elsewhere because only a few Asian
countries have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the
spread of the virus.

</P>
<P>
   India has the largest number of HIV-infected people _ 4 million
_ in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One survey in Pondicherry found four percent of pregnant women
infected. The prevalence of infection among truck drivers in Madras
quadrupled to 6.2 percent in 1996 from 1.5 percent in 1995. In
Manipure state, 73 percent of the patients in a clinic for
injecting drug users were infected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although HIV has infected less than 1 percent of adults in
India, the figure is 10 times higher than in neighboring China.
</P>
<P>
   Two major epidemics are occurring in China, the U.N. said. One
is among injecting drug users. The other is among heterosexuals in
the prosperous eastern seaboard where prostitution is re-emerging
as the gap grows between rich and poor. The incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases has soared in recent years. Health officials
regard the trend in sexually transmitted diseases as a warning sign
of HIV rates because sexually transmitted diseases can enhance its
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report also includes the first country-by-country
information about the availability and use of condoms. But on
condom use, the report's tables contain many blanks _ purposeful by
challenging national leaders to take tougher stands on controlling
HIV infection, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   With a vaccine against HIV a distant hope, Piot said that ``AIDS
is with us to stay for a long time.''

COMMENTARY: TWO IN THE BUSH  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I'm melting! I'm melting!
</P>
<P>
   I don't care about the Spot any more. I haven't checked it in
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell I'm really depressed when I don't even enjoy looking
in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that seal pups have a million hairs on every square
inch of their bodies? Oh, never mind. My vanishing hair is the
least of my troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Bush. Bush. Bush. That's all anyone's talking about. I can't
believe America wants to elect another George Walker Bush. This
one's missing his Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   I know what it's like to grow up with a presidential spoon in
your mouth. And there's nothing wrong with a little privilege. But
George W. just got his first real job. He's only been governor of
Texas for ten minutes, and he's already beating me in the polls?
 &UR; Excu-u-u-use &LR;  me? Don't we have some dues to pay? W. has never
even run for national office. He's never been dragged by the hand
and humiliated by Ed Koch in a New York primary. He's never had to
shake down Buddhist nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, W. has nice hair, and his Southern accent beats his
daddy's. Shucks, it beats mine. But let's get real. He was just
some do-nothing, know-nothing hothead hanging around his dad's
White House. The only thing W. did the whole four years was tell
John Sununu to clear out his desk. Even his own parents didn't
think he'd be any good as a politician. They placed all their chips
on Jeb.
</P>
<P>
   W. is running a state, but I'm running a country _ until Bill
gets back from China. Let's see how the Smoothie in Chief handles
those sneaky butchers of Tiananmen Square when they bring  &UR; him &LR; 
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency is  &UR; my &LR;  birthright. I can't let it slip away to
some other scion. I've worked too hard. I've had secret strategy
meetings on Gore 2000 for more than a year. I've invited all those
nasty reporters to my house every Halloween, getting done up in
some silly costume, standing in line for hours to shake their hands
and tell them how adorable their rugrats are.
</P>
<P>
   I'm wearing out Air Force Two on the shrimp-and-pander circuit,
and W. has yet to lift a finger. He's too highfalutin to even
bother leaving Austin to share the stage with Quayle, Forbes, and
Lamar at cattle shows.
</P>
<P>
   So now I'm the past and he's the future? Has everybody forgotten
that I'm the one who got the Earth on line?
</P>
<P>
   I never sowed any wild oats. I've always been the Good Son. And
now they say W.'s carousing past gives him character and manliness.
</P>
<P>
   All the stupid pundits are saying I'm weak. They're asking why
Bill's mud sticks to me and not to him.
</P>
<P>
   They're saying  &UR; I'm &LR;  the one who has inherited George Bush Sr.'s
weaknesses. I'm the wimp. I'm the uninspiring speaker. I've got a
secret plan to raise taxes _ trying to hook up classrooms to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason W. gets more popular with every poll is that
people are confusing their Bushes. My dad was a great man, too _
but who remembers? Gosh, I wish he'd been president.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it's even more embarrassing if people are preferring
W.'s old man to me. I thought they couldn't wait to vote him out of
the White House. This was a guy even the Republicans wanted to
forget. Then he jumps out of a plane and now all of a sudden he's a
great ex-president?
</P>
<P>
   You want to talk about derring-do? I came home from Iowa and ran
the Marine Corps Marathon on three hours' sleep. And without a
parachute.
</P>
<P>
   W. was in Washington for a big fund-raiser the other night. He
raised a mil. I was so upset I called Jeffrey at Dreamworks. He
talked me down.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, W. I may act like a Boy Scout but I know how to fight
dirty. Why do you think the president and I blocked W.'s little
plan to streamline applications for public assistance in Texas?
He's not going to run on that issue. And why do you think Gary
Mauro, his opponent in the governor's race, is my new best friend?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I haven't been at the top of my game lately. I called
Michael Jordan Michael Jackson. And I messed up by only giving $353
to charity last year. That stupid W. gave $16,500.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that I'm not perfect. But even perfect people make
mistakes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China,
Senate Republicans on Tuesday mounted a wide-ranging critique of
the administration's China policy, but Democrats blocked any votes
on politically embarrassing bills.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats rallied behind Clinton in a rare show of unity.
``I'm not going to allow one single vote on China this week,'' Sen.
Thomas Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said on
Tuesday. ``We're not going to embarrass this president.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a package of amendments sponsored by Sen. Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., that would deny travel visas to Chinese
officials involved in religious persecution or forced-abortion
policies, ban new American-backed international loans to China, and
shift the licensing authority for commercial satellites back to the
State Department from the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Through delaying tactics, the Democrats avoided a test vote on
that package and allowed only an ambiguous procedural vote. The
Senate decided, by 84 to 12, not to kill the amendments but to
leave them in legislative limbo.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unwritten rule that Congress will not vote on
legislation affecting a foreign country while the president is
visiting that nation. But some Republicans, angry over what they
perceive as the administration's failure to press Beijing
aggressively on China's record on human rights and religious
tolerance, sought to put the president on the spot before he left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should make our point before the president leaves,'' said
Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, Lott agreed to postpone a vote on the China
amendments until after July 6, when Clinton will have returned from
his trip.
</P>
<P>
   The decision appeared to free the Senate to finish consideration
of the a $270 billion military authorization bill for fiscal year
1999, to which the China amendments had been added.

 &HT;    Chlorinated water called an odd source for E. coli bacteria
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the link between this week's cluster of E. coli
cases and the White Water themepark in Marietta, Ga. is proved, it
will mark only the second time that chlorinated swimming water is
believed to have transmitted the sometimes-deadly bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Disease detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention are aware of only one other such cluster, which was also
in Georgia: Eleven children infected by a neighborhood pool in
south Georgia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most waterborne transmission has been through drinking
unchlorinated water _ there was one large outbreak from well
water,'' said Dr. Larry Slutsker of the CDC's foodborne and
diarrheal diseases branch. ``And it has been transmitted from
swimming in unchlorinated water such as lakes and ponds. But
chlorinated water is an unusual source; one would suspect either
that the chlorination wasn't working properly or the chlorination
system wasn't able to keep up with the bacterial burden in the
pool.''
</P>
<P>
   Though O157:H7 have now been found in three states _ Georgia,
South Carolina and Tennessee _ there is still no guarantee that
disease detectives at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention will become involved in the investigation. Their
mandatory involvement is triggered when an infectious material,
such as a food, is carried across state lines; otherwise, they must
be invited in by a state government, and by Tuesday evening, none
of the three states had issued such an invitation.
</P>
<P>
   But E. coli experts at the Atlanta-based agency are informally
advising the Georgia Division of Public Health, which also has
former CDC scientists on its staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking down the ways in which E. coli is transmitted has
become an increasingly important task. The O157:H7 strain is only
the third most common foodborne organism, trailing salmonella and
campylobacter; though no one has estimated the total number of
infections it causes, about 20,000 Americans seek medical care for
its effects each year. But it causes a much more serious disease
more frequently; about 10 percent of the infected develop hemolytic
uremic syndrome, a potentially fatal complication.
</P>
<P>
   And it's become an increasingly difficult task. Since it was
identified in 1982 as a cause of disease, the bacterial strain has
hitchhiked on ground beef, cured meat, unpasteurized fruit juice
and raw vegetables - so many routes of transmission that the usual
measures of pasteurizing liquids and cooking foods well hasn't
provided enough protection.
</P>
<P>
   (A second strain currently being blamed for an outbreak in the
Midwest, enterotoxigenic E. coli _ known as ETEC _ is believed to
have been transmitted by potato salad. So far, it has sickened
4,000 adults and children with less serious ``travellers'
diarrhea.'')
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the problem is that E. coli O157:H7 (named for two
proteins on the bacterium's surface) has unique characteristics,
said CDC epidemiologist Dr. Paul Mead. At some point before it
emerged as a threat, the bacterium became infected with a virus
that changed its genetic material, giving it the ability to produce
a virulent toxin that can destroy red blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``(O157) has a relatively low infectious dose; from
10 to several hundred organisms are all that are necessary,'' Mead
said. ``For comparison, it takes more than 100,000 salmonella
bacteria to make someone sick. And the other feature that makes it
a particular problem is that it is fairly resistant to acid, so it
can survive in foods such as cider that we previously thought were
safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Most outbreaks of O157:H7 have been linked to cow manure or
human feces. Recent research has shown that up to 1 percent of
commercial cattle have the strain - though deer, sheep and goats
may also carry it - so that any large lot of cattle taken to a
slaughterhouse is likely to contain infected animals.
</P>
<P>
   Using information from a laboratory technique called
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which allows scientists to
isolate a unique ``DNA fingerprint,'' the CDC has been building a
national E. coli information network. It allows state health
departments to electronically compare strains found in outbreaks as
a way of pinpointing a common source. E. coli O157:H7 is the only
foodborne organism for which the CDC has done this, a measure of
how seriously the agency takes the bacterial threat.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, E. coli is so widely distributed that some
national action such as the proposed federal Food Safety Initiative
_ which includes intensive monitoring as well as the use of food
irradiation - may be necessary, Mead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're dealing with multiple sources, you need multiple
methods of prevention,'' he said. ''Cleaning up the meat supply
won't stop it if it's coming from fruits and vegetables as well.''

   ATLANTA _ A popular kiddie pool area at White Water park north
of Atlanta is the source of an E. coli bacteria outbreak that has
sickened at least a dozen children in three Southeastern states,
Georgia health officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a 98 percent certainty children defecating in the
water resulted in an acute contamination,'' Virginia Galvin,
director of Cobb County Public Health department, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The contamination occurred June 11 and 12 in the White Water
wading pools in an area called ``Captain Kid's Cove.'' Authorities
said it is unclear which specific pool spread the contamination and
which child , or children, triggered the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the children also attended the same day care facility
run out of a private home in Bartow County, Ga., but they were all
taken to play at White Water on those particular dates, Galvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   White Water spokeswoman Deedie Dowdle said it is unclear where
the contamination occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we could know where the kids played when they
were here,'' she said. ``We do know that the group from the day
care center did play in Captain Kids' Cove area.''
</P>
<P>
   No other link, such as bad beef or juice, or other common risk
usually associated with E. coli 0157:H7 has been established, said
Dr. Kathleen Toomey, director of Georgia's Public Health Division,
which is leading the investigation. ``The single common exposure of
all these cases was attending White Water Park on June 11 and June
12.'' Beef was ruled out when one of the children was found to be
vegetarian, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence exists of ongoing risk in the pools, said health
officials who deemed the pools to now be safe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, health experts said children or adults who were
exposed on those days and have not had symptoms of E. coli
infection by now should be in the clear. Symptoms of infection _
including severe abdominal cramping, watery or bloody diarrhea and
urinary tract infections _ typically develop within nine days
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The number of extremely ill children hospitalized from the E.
coli O157:H7 contamination rose from four to six Tuesday afternoon
in Atlanta hospitals. Ranging in age from 2 to 4 years of age, they
all suffer from hemolytic uremic syndrome, HUS, a serious
complication of E. coli infection that attacks kidneys, blood, and
potentially the brain and heart. It requires treatment by kidney
dialysis, blood transfusions and respirators.
</P>
<P>
   The cases also expanded beyond Georgia's state borders. Two
children from Tennessee and one from South Carolina _ all of whom
played in the White Water kiddie pools during a June 11 visit _ are
confirmed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 to 7 percent of children under 5 years of age who are
sickened by this E. coli strain develop HUS. Most survive but only
after months of hospitalization and a multitude of problems: severe
dehydration, kidney and respiratory failure. Antibiotics do not
kill the strain and treatment involves keeping the patient alive
while the body rids itself of the toxic matter. The condition is
fatal in 5 to 15 percent of cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``As ill as these these children get, they can regain their full
function, '' Galvin said. ``They need very aggressive and
supportive care.''
</P>
<P>
   The conditions of two girls, 6- and 2-year-old sisters, who were
felled by the bacterial infection were upgraded Tuesday afternoon
to good, while a 3-year-old boy remained in fair condition at
Egleston Hospital for Children. Scottish Rite Children's Medical
Center is also caring for a 4-year-old girl in critical condition
and Brody Weiss, the 3-year-old son of Atlanta Braves shortstop
Walt Weiss. He is in serious condition, one step better than
critical.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals have not identified the children; the elder Weiss
confirmed that the middle of his three boys was among them.
</P>
<P>
   Two older Atlanta-area children, ages 8 and 12, also have
confirmed strains of the bacteria but are not being treated in
hospitals. Only the case of the 12-year-old is considered unrelated
to the other clusters in Atlanta because he did not visit White
Water.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, seven cases of diarrhea in a group of children and
adults who visited the park June 11 and 12 are under investigation.
In Atlanta-area hospitals, emergency rooms have been alerted to
symptoms of the infection that is often brushed off as a less
serious stomach ailment. All public health departments in 50 states
have also been notified by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention to be on guard for more cases from residents who may
have visited White Water during that critical time period.
</P>
<P>
   State and Cobb County, Ga. health officials deemed White Water
now to be safe pools but cautioned parents from letting their kids
swim or wade in any pools while they are feeling sick.
</P>
<P>
   They also revealed the pools did not meet safe levels of
chlorination during an investigation last weekend. The level of
chlorine was 1 part per million, Galvin said. The safe level is
between 1.5 to 3 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Cobb Health Department officials doing an
inspection at the park found the chlorine level in one of the
kiddie pools was below the required level. The officials requested
that the pool be closed to the public until the level was brought
back up, Dowdle said. But at the time they made the request, the
park was already closed for the day, and the level was back up to
the normal reading by the opening of business on Sunday, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not characterize the commercial waterpark as
negligent, saying the fecal water contamination is an unusual route
of transmission for the potentially fatal strain of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   E. coli, a common bacterium that lives in the digestive tracts
of humans and other animals, is most often spread through food,
primarily ground beef. The strain affecting the children, E. coli
0157:H7, is highly toxic, particularly to young children and the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, there were 39 reported cases of 0157:H7 illness in
1996, the last year for which figures are available. Nationwide
each year, E. coli infections will sicken 20,000 people, killing
200 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear is how the potentially fatal strain of bacteria
managed to survive two days in water treated with chlorine, which
usually kills bacteria. The filtering system at White Water's
wading pools provides a constant hourly circulation, and it is
separate from the bigger swimming pools. Diapers are also not
allowed to be worn in the wading pools, Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible some of the bacteria could have survived
overnight or the same sick kid could have come back June 12 to
swim,'' said Jane Koehler, Georgia state epidemiologist. ``He could
have had liquid diarrhea and that's why it went unnoticed. Parents
of the sick children have told me their kids were gulping down
water while playing in this wading pools so that could explain how
the transmission immediately occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is any evidence of negligence (on White
Water),'' Galvin said. ``This is an unusual route of transmission
but if a child had an accident in a pool, it would not take much
bacteria to get in your mouth to lead to infection.''

 &HT;    As Florida fires burn, officials worry about Georgia
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Firefighters in deep South Georgia snuffed out two
fires that ignited after a thunderstorm Tuesday, threatening a
repeat of the wildfires that swept woods near the Okefenokee Swamp
until they were extinguished this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the rain, but we didn't need God's lightning,'' said
Deputy S.L. Malcomb of the Charlton County (Ga.) Sheriff's
Department. ``We got on them pretty quickly and got them out pretty
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires continue to spread ruin across north Florida, which
Georgia got a dose of last week, and the heat continues to blister
crops in both states.
</P>
<P>
   The stifling heat shows no sign of easing with temperatures in
the upper 90s forecast for metro Atlanta today. Temperatures should
stay in the 90s at least until the weekend, according to the
National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures in the Atlanta area, which recorded a high of 91
degrees, were mild Tuesday compared to the southern half of the
state, where temperatures reached 100 in Alma, Ga. and 99 in Fort
Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave played a role in wildfires that swept 16,000 acres
in southern Charlton County and burned timber valued at more than
$14 million. Searing temperatures and lack of rain have cost north
Florida famers $100 million in crop damage and are threatening
Georgia's $159 million corn crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn in the southern part of the state is gone,'' said Georgia
agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin. ``We already have disaster
situations in as many as 20 counties, and that number could soar to
more than 50.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, two deaths have been attributed to the heat wave. In
Dothan, Ala., a 3-year-old boy died of apparent heat stroke Monday
after being left in a locked van at a Mobile day-care center,
police said. Earlier this month, a 73-year-old Henry County, Ala.,
woman succumbed to heat stroke at her home.

   MATAMOROS, Mexico _ In one of General Motors' sprawling auto
parts plants in a Matamoros industrial park just south of the Rio
Grande, thousands of Mexican workers earn $1 to $2 an hour
producing instrument panels and steering wheels for GM cars and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Until just a few years ago, U.S. workers earning close to $22 an
hour at GM's Delphi East factory in Flint, Mich., made the
instrument panels. And those at a plant to the north in Saginaw
produced the steering wheels.
</P>
<P>
   GM's shift of production from Flint and Saginaw to this border
city facing Brownsville, Texas, was part of a sweeping 20-year
transfer of its U.S. auto parts industry across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, GM has built more than 50 parts factories in Mexico,
which today employ 72,000 workers, making its parts subsidiary,
Delphi Automotive Services, Mexico's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies from the United States have, of course, also
moved plants to Mexico. Ford Motor Co. has 11 parts factories in
Mexico; Chrysler has none.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of production to Mexico and other countries has
become a focus of the United Automobile Workers strike against GM,
which began at a stamping plant in Flint and at the Delphi East
factory. UAW officials in the United States have accused General
Motors of ``putting America last.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, where the strike has idled 23,000 workers at two
dozen Delphi plants, Delphi managers have told workers that the
union is demanding that GM close its Mexican plants and return its
parts production to the United States, said Juan Villafuerte
Morales, a union officer representing workers at Delphi's Matamoros
factories. The plants have been partially idled by the strike in
Flint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our workers understand that they're doing work that
used to be done in United States factories because managers explain
that to them on the plant floor,'' Villafuerte said. ``And let me
tell you, the jobs are very welcome here.''
</P>
<P>
   GM says that transferring production south has enabled it to cut
costs in labor-intensive assembly production, compete more
effectively against Ford, Chrysler and Japanese automakers, and
also to keep engineering and other operations in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The financial advantages of producing parts in Mexico are
substantial, and some economists say that the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which went into effect in January 1994, has only
increased them.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants have no union, and those that do are represented by
the Confederation of Mexican Workers, which is controlled by
Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party and works with
the government to avoid strikes. The union has kept the UAW at
arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Mexican workers at GM and other U.S.-owned
factories live in dirt-floor shacks in slums ringing the industrial
parks where they work. Yet many say that they are delighted to have
their jobs, which often start at Mexico's minimum wage of $3.40 a
day but can pay experienced workers several times that. A Delphi
spokesman said the company would in the next 18 months help 7,000
employees buy their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good job,'' said a 23-year-old woman who earns $1.36 an
hour painting buttons on car radios at Deltronicos de Matamoros, a
Delphi plant. The woman, who asked that her name not be used during
an interview at her one-room wood-frame shed in a gritty,
wind-blown Matamoros squatters' settlement, said the choking smell
of solvents at her work station gave her headaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult work,'' she said. ``But I'm glad to have it.''

</P>
<P>
   GM opened its first factory in Mexico in 1935, assembling trucks
in the capital from parts imported from the United States. After a
1962 Mexican law required foreign automakers to increase the local
content of their vehicles, GM built three engine and vehicle plants
in the 1960s and '70s. The new plants, like similar factories built
by Ford and Chrysler, assembled vehicles for the Mexican market. In
the decades since, GM has continued to assemble vehicles in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1970s, in response to an earlier law encouraging
foreign manufacturers to produce goods here for export tax-free, GM
changed strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM began to see Mexico as a supplier for its U.S. vehicle
assembly plants, and in the 1980s built an entire parts industry
here,'' said Arnulfo Arteaga, a Mexico City professor who studies
the auto industry. ``Now, Delphi's Mexican plants basically turn
out parts once produced in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   GM erected its first Mexican parts plant, to assemble wiring
systems, in the large border city of Juarez in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is now Delphi Automotive had run into unprecedented
competition,'' said Michael Hissam, a spokesman at Delphi's Mexico
headquarters in Juarez. ``We embarked on a plan to reduce costs by
focusing final assembly in Mexico while keeping our more
capital-intensive engineering, tooling and prototyping activities
in the U.S. Did we come to Mexico for lower labor costs? Yes. But
we also found something else _ excellent Mexican management and a
dedicated Mexican work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto industry analyst with Merrill Lynch,
said General Motors had no choice but to seek lower-cost labor for
parts production. GM is not doing anything that their competitors
and that independent auto suppliers aren't doing,'' Lobaccaro said,
adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been tremendous pressure on parts pricing. To compete
in the global economy, you need labor to be paid commensurate with
value added. And you can't pay $46 an hour do wire harnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of other GM parts plants would be built across northern
Mexico in the years that followed. In Matamoros, four Delphi plants
were built in an industrial park near the intersection of Ohio
Street and Michigan Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   One Delphi plant, Componentes Mecanicos, opened in 1980. About
10 years later, Delphi began shifting production of instrument
panels to the factory from Delphi East in Flint, said Larry
Mathews, a spokesman for Flint's UAW Local 651, which is currently
on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just crated the equipment, hoisted it onto a
tractor-trailer, and sent it away to Mexico,'' Mathews said.
``There's hardly anybody at this plant who hasn't seen machinery
moving out in a crate with an address on it that says Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Mathews added, the Delphi East plant had 13,000
workers; today, it has fewer than 6,000.
</P>
<P>
   A 37-year-old worker at Componentes Mecanicos who asked that his
name be withheld, said in an interview outside his two-room
Matamoros home that if he qualifies for a weekly attendance bonus,
he earns about $1.90 an hour. Newly hired workers receive $1.05 an
hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife also works at a GM assembly plant in Matamoros, and by
pooling salaries, the couple has managed to rise slightly above
subsistence. They own a battered Ford pickup truck, and although
their home has no indoor plumbing, they have equipped it with a
television set and an electric fan. He coaches his three sons in a
soccer league.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to Componentes Mecanicos is the Deltronicos plant,
built in 1979. In the mid-1980s, GM shifted much of its car radio
production from its Delco plant in Kokomo, Ind., to Deltronicos,
UAW officials said. The work force at Kokomo has dropped to 4,800
from 11,000 in 1977, the union said. The Deltronicos plant employs
5,400 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street from Deltronicos is a Matamoros plant owned by
Trico Products Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y., a unit of Tomkins PLC, which
supplies windshield wipers to GM as well as Ford and Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of much of Trico's production to Mexico since 1987,
which came despite entreaties from Buffalo city officials, has
reduced Trico's Buffalo work force to 200 from 2,400, UAW officials
said. &QL;

HINE, SKIP AWAY SET FOR TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With the Hollywood Gold Cup contenders'
major workouts complete, the only question for Skip Away trainer
Sonny Hine is, Where do we eat?
</P>
<P>
   Hine, one of horse racing's real characters, and his wife
Carolyn, owner of Skip Away, claim they haven't taken a three-day
vacation in 35 years of marriage. So the Hines plan to make the
most of a rare visit to Los Angeles to run their popular horse
against Silver Charm, Gentlemen and as many as five others Sunday
in the $1 million Gold Cup for 3-year-olds and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The track is taking us to dinner Saturday night. Maybe I'll
get to go to _ what do they call it? _ the Farmer's Market,'' Sonny
Hine said on the phone from New York. ``Somebody said we should go
to Catalina Island, it's so beautiful. I said, `My wife gets
seasick in a bathtub, how the hell are we going to get over
there?'''
</P>
<P>
   At least it looks certain that Skip Away will make it to
Hollywood Park, site of the 1997 Breeders' Cup Classic romp that
clinched his older-horses championship. Skip Away is booked on a
Thursday-morning flight to LAX.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, with jockey Jerry Bailey aboard, Skip Away
breezed 6 furlongs in a quick 1:11 1/5 at Belmont Park. The effort
eliminated Hine's doubts about the 5-year-old's health.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away had swelling in his forelegs for about a day after an
incident Friday in which he dumped his exercise rider while dodging
a fallen horse during a gallop, and ran free for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really ready to run,'' Hine said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby winner, also worked out
Tuesday, going 5 furlongs in :58 3/5, the fastest of 41 at the
distance at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``All systems go,'' trainer Bob Baffert said from his barn.
</P>
<P>
   As well as stars Skip Away, Silver Charm and Gentlemen, the Gold
Cup is expected to draw Puerto Madero, Budroyale, Don't Blame Rio,
probably Bagshot and possibly Mud Route. Entries will be announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Livening the three-way battle of the nation's richest older
horses is the recent war of words between Hine and Baffert. Hine
accused the Silver Charm camp of ``ducking me'' but says a quote
calling Baffert a coward was taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they want me to wrestle Baffert, that's the last thing I
heard,'' Hine said Tuesday. ``I could probably arm wrestle him. I'm
67 right now. I like a good meal and sitting in a chair.''

PANEL APPROVES DEEP CUTS IN PROGRAMS CHAMPIONED BY CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting Congress on a collision course with
President Clinton, a House panel on Tuesday approved a proposal to
slash the president's education initiatives as well as the annual
financing for home heating subsidies for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal provides substantial increases for the National
Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, underscoring the Republicans' emphasis on popular
health and research programs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it takes a $2.6 billion bite out of
administration priorities, cutting the Goals 2000 education program
in half, eliminating the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program,
terminating the Summer Youth jobs program and decreasing money for
tutoring for disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   The energy assistance program, which costs $1.1 billion, pays
for home heating for 4.4 million poor households. Two-thirds of the
recipients earn less than $8,000 a year. The summer jobs program
spends $871 million for employment of 530,000 youths.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, passed by the subcommittee on Labor, Health and
Human Services by a vote of 8 to 7, calls for the most drastic cuts
so far as the Republican-controlled Congress works its way through
13 appropriations bills that Congress must pass to keep the
government running in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials responded harshly on Tuesday night to
the subcommittee action, saying that the president would almost
certainly veto the measure in its current form.
</P>
<P>
   The president said in a statement that the cuts were
``arbitrary'' and ``extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is out of step with our values and the wrong vision
for America's future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said the cuts were so extreme that the
Republicans were setting the stage for a confrontation that could
result in the kind of standoff that shut down the government two
years ago and damaged the Republicans' image with the public _ a
gamble that some aides said Republicans might be willing to take
this year because the president appeared politically weaker than he
has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they were straight-jacketed by last year's
budget agreement, which virtually froze discretionary spending, and
they played down the need for social programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that we don't have more money to throw at problems,''
said Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, chairman of the
Appropriations Committee. ``But it's the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans also acknowledged that the bill was constructed
by House leaders to attract the maximum support of the House's
vocal conservatives. This is part of the Republican strategy to
activate the party's base of conservative voters in the November
elections, when many other voters, content with the strong economy,
may not be motivated to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the proposal is so appealing to conservatives
that it may alienate Republican moderates, without whom the
proposal could not pass. This could deepen the factions within the
party and weaken its chances of retaining control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   The full Appropriations Committee is to vote on the proposed
cuts in mid-July, and then the bill will move to the House floor.
Senate Democrats said on Tuesday that they would strongly oppose
the measure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The cuts in domestic social programs help Congress keep within
the spending limits it agreed to last year with the administration
to balance the budget. They are not designed to make room for the
tax cuts that Republicans are promoting as their main election-year
agenda, but they could if Congress changes its rules to allow tax
cuts to come from discretionary spending. At the moment, tax cuts
can come only from entitlements, which are not discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked for discretionary spending of about $538
billion for next year, up from $523 billion this year. The House
has proposed spending $532 billion and the Senate about $534
billion, sums that because of inflation amount to a virtual
spending freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. DavidObey, the top Democrat on the Appropriations
Committee, said that the Republicans were cutting programs to come
up with money for medical research that would have come from
tobacco companies under a bill that died last week in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``By killing the tobacco bill, Republicans have made it much
harder to fund the president's health initiatives,'' Obey said.
``In order to pay for an increase in NIH funding, instead of using
money from the tobacco settlement, they have decided to take that
funding out of the hides of the weakest and most vulnerable people
in society.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor-education bill increases financing for the National
Institutes of Health by $1.3 billion, up more than 9 percent from
this year and $126 million more than the president has requested.
It increases money for the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention by $202 million over this year, $89 million more than
the president sought.
</P>
<P>
   On policy matters, the bill bans the use of federal money for
research using human embryos, bans the distribution of needles and
syringes for the injection of any illegal drug and prohibits
federal financing for a rerun of the Teamsters election.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's program cuts in the labor-education subcommittee
follow House votes on Monday to increase spending on local energy
and water projects and on military construction.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved $21.1 billion in energy and water programs,
or about $700 million more than the President requested. These
include about 200 local projects for flood control and stopping
beach erosion, projects eagerly sought by lawmakers in an election
year.
</P>
<P>
   But it slashed Clinton's request for more money for research
into solar power and other forms of renewable energy like wind. It
also cut his request for more money to maintain the nation's
nuclear weapons arsenal.

HOUSE HEARS ABOUT ENCODED CIRCUIT BOARD MISSING FROM CHINESE
ROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: adds new information through top 11 grafs)  (ps) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A secret encoded circuit board containing sensitive
technology was missing from the wreckage of an American satellite
aboard a Chinese rocket that exploded in 1996, and American
officials said Tuesday they suspected that Chinese authorities took
the board.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the missing circuit board, which tells an
orbiting satellite which way to point to receive and transmit
signals to and from Earth, was made Tuesday at an unusual joint
hearing of two House committees, National Security and
International Relations.
</P>
<P>
   If China did steal the circuit board, it would be a violation of
a technology safeguards agreement that Beijing and Washington last
amended in 1993, to prevent the transfer of sensitive American
military technology.
</P>
<P>
   In raising that possibility, the news disclosure opened a new
front in Congress' inquiry into whether sensitive space technology
was transferred to China by American aerospace corporations using
Chinese rockets to launch their satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said the missing circuit board would be
a main focus of a special select committee the House created last
week to investigate the wide-ranging China accusations. The control
box containing the circuit board was recovered at the crash site,
he said, ``but the card is gone. We better call the Chinese on this
issue. That is a very serious concern.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 15, 1996, American military monitors had watched the
Chinese rocket launch from a command post in southern China as it
streaked toward space carrying a $200 million American
communications satellite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But 22 seconds after liftoff, the Long March rocket exploded,
showering debris, burning fuel and chaos on a nearby Chinese
village, where by American accounts as many as 200 civilians were
killed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For five hours, American officials said, Chinese authorities
barred them from the crash site, saying it was for their own
safety. When the Americans finally reached the area and opened the
battered but intact control box of the satellite, a supersecret
encoded circuit board was missing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now congressional investigators are asking whether there could
be any explanation for the missing technology other than that the
Chinese took it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing, Weldon quoted a statement he said was
given to him by the National Security Agency that warned: ``If the
encryption board were reversed-engineered, the knowledge gained
could be used to strengthen adversaries' knowledge'' of the devices
the United States uses to safeguard its communications systems.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A senior Defense Department official said on Tuesday night that
he was not aware that the government had demanded that the Chinese
account for the missing encoded card. ``We're not 100 percent sure
they filched this encryption card,'' the official said. ``It may
have just fallen out, but we have to assume they do have it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Congress also disclosed that the Justice
Department has begun an investigation of a second failed China
missile launch that also involved an American satellite. This
second inquiry is centered on the possible sharing of sensitive
information with the Chinese without American government
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The new revelation also adds a new dynamic to an ongoing Justice
Department inquiry into the matter. Federal investigators are
trying to determine if the two satellite-makers, Loral Space &AMP;
Communications and Hughes Electronics, divulged sensitive
technology to Chinese rocket scientists during an analysis of the
failed launch.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department oversees exports of the encoded boards as
militarily sensitive technology. But when the same components are
embedded in a satellite, the whole unit falls under the export
controls of the Commerce Department. A government auditor told a
Senate inquiry earlier this month that the Commerce rules are
looser than the State rules.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insist that American satellites launched on
Chinese rockets are protected with armed, 24-hour American guards.
But the Commerce rules provide little protection against sensitive
technology being released in accidents like the February 1996
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, an undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, told a House hearing last Thursday that there
``there would not have been any effect on national security'' if
Chinese engineers illegally obtained the encoded device.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense Department said in a statement it provided to
Weldon that the ``loss of the chips'' would actually have a
``minimal impact'' _ not no impact at all _ on national security.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, according to Weldon, the National Security Agency,
the government's code makers and code breakers, said that it had
changed the encoded algorithms in satellite circuit boards after
the failed February, 1996, launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was only 'minimal impact' to national security, why
did the NSA change the algorithms?'' Weldon asked Tuesday's
witnesses from the State, Defense and Commerce departments, which
included Reinsch.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials did not have a ready answer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's hearing also provided new details into the Justice
Department's investigation of the role of American satellite makers
in helping China's troubled rocket program.
</P>
<P>
   One year before the 1996 accident, a Chinese rocket containing a
Hughes satellite failed, and Hughes did a study of that failure.
The Commerce Department permitted Hughes to provide the study to
the Chinese after the company assured the department that its
review was done ``independently'' of the Chinese and the department
determined that the review complied with the license, according to
testimony by Reinsch.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch said the Justice Department had recently requested all
its documents on the 1995 accident. Bert Brandenburg, a Justice
Department spokesman, said the department's review of the 1995
study was part of their investigation into the 1996 study by Loral
and Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy J.K. Tiffany, general counsel for Hughes, said company
employees had held meetings with the Chinese to obtain data for the
1995 study and that the Commerce Department had reviewed the scope
of those meetings to assure they would be in compliance with the
license.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch told the panel that the Hughes study would not help
China's missile program because it only involved the integration of
the Hughes satellite with the Chinese rocket.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. and chairman of the House
International Relations Committee, questioned why the Commerce
Department didn't seek advice from other agencies before allowing
Hughes to share the report with China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You quietly authorized a United States company to share
information regarding a Chinese launch failure in 1995 without
sharing that decision with any other agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsch replied, ``This was a judgment we made on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie K. Fowler, R-Fla., questioned why a Pentagon agency
didn't seek additional expertise on another technology sale to
China, which congressional and industry officials said involved
Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fowler asked Pentagon officials about why they approved the
1996 sale of encrypted ground station terminals to a Chinese
military company, China Electronics Systems Engineering Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The terminals, called Vsats, are the heart of a closed
telecommunication network in which the users, typically businesses,
transmit data via satellite. The communications can be coded
through separate equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fowler wondered why officials from the Defense Intelligence
Agency, who are supposed to be consulted on such technology
transfers, were apparently not consulted.
</P>
<P>
   David Tarbel, the head of the Defense Technology Security
Administration, the Pentagon agency responsible for reviewing
technology transfers, said he would reply later to the inquiry.
Tarbel did not return a reporter's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tiffany, the Hughes lawyer, said ``we comply with all
American laws and restrictions in our overseas sales and those laws
do not prohibit the sale of Vsats to the Chinese military.''

O'DONNELL'S DAYS AS JET ARE AT AN END, AGENT BELIEVES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ Neil O'Donnell's brief, bizarre run as
quarterback of the Jets has ended.
</P>
<P>
   His agent, Leigh Steinberg, came to that conclusion Tuesday
night after receiving an unexpected phone call from Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill called me and said that because of Neil's unwillingness
to restructure his contract, he is talking to and pursuing other
quarterbacks, which could result in Neil's release,'' a surprised
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   One of them could be Vinny Testaverde, who grew up on Long
Island wanting to be a Jet.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old Testaverde, who was cut by the Baltimore Ravens,
said Tuesday his agent ``just two days ago'' started talks with the
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Testaverde's remarks, Parcells said, ``We've
had some talks with Vinny Testaverde and his representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Glenn Foley is the No. 1 quarterback, which he held for
two games during 1997 before suffering a season-ending knee injury.
But Testaverde is good enough to give Foley a battle for the
starting job during training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Testaverde produced 18 touchdowns and 15
interceptions while completing 57.7 percent of his passes.
</P>
<P>
   That followed his best season in 1996, when he went to the Pro
Bowl while generating 33 touchdowns and 4,177 yards with only 19
interceptions. But in the offseason, the Ravens traded for the
Colts' Jim Harbaugh, and cut Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been attempting since January to induce O'Donnell
to restructure the $4.2 million salary he was to earn this year.
O'Donnell has steadfastly refused. Even after he is cut, though,
the Jets will still be charged $2.8 million against this year's
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neil has understood for some time there's been a difference of
opinion. But he was hoping his tenure would be much longer,''
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell joined the Jets in 1996, shortly after leading the
Steelers to the Super Bowl. He signed a five-year deal worth a
potential $25 million. But in the first year he suffered a shoulder
tear after six games. And when he was finally ready to return, he
went into a routine backpedal in practice-and tore his calf.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was benched in consecutive weeks and replaced by
Foley, who eventually became the starter after leading the club to
victory as a back-up. Foley himself was injured, though, and
O'Donnell returned to lead the Jets the final five games. Still,
Parcells, who has been reserved in praising O'Donnell, felt he was
overpaid and told him not to attend the recent offseason workout
that the coach demands of every other player. The stated reason was
that if O'Donnell were injured, the club might be responsible for
his salary.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell's last game as a Jet steeled his resolve when he
didn't take the fall for a 13-10 loss to the Lions in the
regular-season finale that cost New York a playoff berth. He was
lifted several times for trick plays by the mobile Ray Lucas and
Leon Johnson, each of whom threw interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, O'Donnell told friends ``they can't pin that loss on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, meanwhile, seemed reluctant Tuesday to say that
there was a good chance he would be a Jet. ``Certainly if I had a
chance to play for Bill Parcells, that would be a great opportunity
for me, knowing his past in taking teams to the Super Bowl,'' said
Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' phone call surprised Steinberg, who also represents
Foley. Just a few hours earlier, Steinberg had contended, ``It's
been pretty clear to me the entire offseason that Neil O'Donnell is
coming back. ``My assumption is that the quarterbacks of the New
York Jets will be Glenn Foley and Neil O'Donnell and someone who's
third.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking during a practice round for the Cadillac NFL Golf
Classic, which begins Wednesday, Testaverde said he would not
discount the possibility of being a backup, ``if the club has a
good defense and seems to be going somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Jets' insiders had been saying that Parcells had
no interest in Testaverde. However, there doesn't appear to be
another quarterback out there. And it doesn't seem likely Parcells
is willing to go with his untested third-stringers, Ray Lucas or
Chuck Clements.
</P>
<P>
   In his career, Testaverde has completed 55.1 percent of his
passes, thrown for 29,223 yards, and tossed 175 touchdowns to 183
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played well when I was under Bill Belichick in Cleveland,''
said Testaverde, referring to Parcells' second-in-command. The
quarterback, who grew up in Elmont, N.Y., added, ``Me being from
Long Island, I'd be coming home.''

CHINA CANCELS VISAS FOR RADIO FREE ASIA JOURNALISTS
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., see related CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-PIRACY, CHINA-MEDIA,
CHINA-U.S.-ECON, CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-MISSILES, CLINTON-CONGRESS.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of a state visit the White House has
billed as a chance to encourage greater openness by the Chinese
government, China has canceled visas for three journalists from
Radio Free Asia who had planned to cover President Clinton's trip
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to depart for China on Wednesday,
denounced the Chinese decision as ``highly objectionable'' and said
that ``we will protest it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is depriving China of the credit that it otherwise would
have gotten for giving more visas to a more diverse group of
journalists,'' he told reporters at a White House event. ``We hope
they will reconsider.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as the president was voicing his disappointment over
China's action, Radio Free Asia, which was established by Congress
in 1994 to broadcast news and other programs to China and other
authoritarian nations in Asia, was expressing its disappointment
with the handling of the issue by White House.
</P>
<P>
   It said the Clinton administration could have challenged the
order by allowing the three journalists to board the jet chartered
by the White House for news organizations covering the president's
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists from Radio Free Asia, which has frequently drawn
protests from Beijing over its coverage of human rights abuses in
China, have Chinese visas stamped in their passports.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the visas were issued last week that the
Chinese authorities telephoned the journalists at home and told
them that the visas had been canceled. The developments were first
reported in The Washington Times and The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Richter, the president of Radio Free Asia, said in an
interview that he had urged the White House to allow the reporters
to travel to China aboard the chartered jet, leaving officials in
China with the final decision over whether to admit them. But
Richter said that the White House refused to risk a last-minute
confrontation with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCurry, the White House spokesman, said the White House
had decided to prevent the reporters from going after the airline
handling the charter, Cathay Pacific of Hong Kong, indicated that
``they're going to abide by international aviation requirements,
which state that you have to have a valid visa in order to board
the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio Free Asia began broadcasting Mandarin-language programs to
China in September 1996, and its programs are routinely jammed by
the Chinese government.

SCIENTISTS HONING IN ON `BLOODLESS' SURGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Using ultrasound instead of scalpels, scientists are
honing in on ways to do ``bloodless'' surgery without ever making
an incision.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are already doing early-stage clinical trials using the
new technique, which is called High Intensity Focused Ultrasound,
to destroy various solid tumors and to stop internal bleeding
without opening the body. The University of Washington is one of
the few institutions in the world studying surgical ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope that within a few years hand-held ultrasound
devices will be used to detect and stop internal bleeding for
trauma patients in remote locations, such as the mountains, or on
the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, it may be possible to do ultrasound scans of the
whole body, and eradicate tumors that show up at the same time,
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that far away,'' said Larry Crum, chairman of the UW
department of acoustics and electromagnetics at the Applied Physics
Laboratory. ``It's not a Star Trek thing. People are doing it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crum's research group is studying how to use the technique to
stop internal bleeding and is doing experiments to determine how
ultrasound can be used to break up blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   The technology was the subject of talks Tuesday at the
Acoustical Society of America Meeting, which is being held in
Seattle this week and has drawn scientists from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is based on the same principle as the old
childhood trick of using a magnifying glass to focus light on an
object, such as a leaf, and causing it to smolder.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the ultrasound waves pass harmlessly through the
skin and other organs without damaging them until they get to the
``focal site.'' At this focal point, they cause a rapid, intense
heating of the tissue, cauterizing it. If the beam is focused on a
bleeding vessel or artery, it will cause the blood to coagulate and
stop the bleeding. If it is focused on a tumor, it will destroy the
tissue, rendering the tumor harmless.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are familiar with ultrasound for its ability to
reflect images of the developing fetus in a pregnant woman. Those
ultrasound waves, which are not harmful, are very low intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound used for surgical purposes is 10,000 times as intense
and must be focused using mechanical or electronic means before it
can act to destroy tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of it is how precise it is, said Gail ter Haar f the
Royal Marsden Hospital in England, who was at the Seattle meeting
and is conducting clinical trials on patients with tumors of the
liver, kidney and prostate.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is so precise that doctors can control within six
cells exactly where the ultrasound waves cause the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very sharp boundary,'' she said. ``It's sharper than a
scalpel.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with many surgeries is that ``you do a lot of
cutting and damage to normal tissue to get to something abnormal,''
said Dr. Stephen Carter, a radiologist at the UW School of Medicine
who works with Crum. That's especially problematic in areas, such
as the brain, where damaging normal tissue can have serious
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can not damage normal tissue, it's a tremendous
advantage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound, which is very high frequency sound energy, is
ideally suited to surgical applications. Microwaves can't be
focused on such small areas, X-rays damage tissue on the way in,
and lasers can't penetrate the tissue, Crum said.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment is especially promising for tumors in areas where
operating is risky or impossible, such as the liver.
</P>
<P>
   Many patients survive treatment for their primary cancers, only
to die when tumors spread to their livers, ter Haar said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, such as prostate cancer, surgery can have
unintended consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In men with advanced prostate cancer, the treatment sometimes
requires removal of the whole prostate, Crum said. But that's
tricky, since severing nerves on either side can cause complete
impotence, or complete incontinence, or both.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ultrasound treatment appears to work with no adverse
effects.
</P>
<P>
   In early trials, patients tolerated the treatments well and
didn't require anesthesia, Crum said. ``It's a fantastic thing for
medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultrasound has other new applications for medicine as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ekos, a Bothell-based company, is developing ways to use
ultrasound to improve the delivery of medications to certain parts
of the body. Ultrasound has been used in conjunction with drugs to
dissolve blood clots and to improve the uptake of the drug at its
intended target.
</P>
<P>
   Sound waves are also being studied as a substitute for needles
for ``injecting'' drugs such as insulin, or interferon directly
through the skin.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, using ultrasound during chemotherapy or gene
therapy appears to increase the effectiveness of these treatments
as well.

CHINESE CRACK DOWN _ FOR NOW _ ON PIRATED VIDEO DISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., see related CHINA-CLINTON, CHINA-VISAS, CHINA-MEDIA,
CHINA-U.S.-ECON, CHINA-PEONY, CHINA-MISSILES, CLINTON-CONGRESS.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Accustomed to putting its best face forward
for an important guest, China is cleaning itself up for President
Clinton's arrival on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are roads being repaved, buildings whitewashed and
entrance ways decorated on countless routes where the president is
expected to travel during his nine days in China, but the
authorities are also cracking down on many of the illegal
activities that are ordinarily tolerated these days, like the sale
of pirated video and music compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   The fight against piracy of software, music and movies, an issue
that loomed large in American-Chinese relations a few years ago,
has been pushed into the background and is unlikely to be raised
seriously during Clinton's visit, even though it remains as rampant
a problem as ever.
</P>
<P>
   An explosion in the video compact disk industry in China in the
last two years has created an enormous demand for cheap videos, and
pirated versions have been openly advertised and sold in cities all
over China.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in video compact disks _ ``Titanic'' was sold on
Shanghai street corners for $2, even before the film's theatrical
release in the United States in December _ seemed to signal a
failure of a 1995 agreement between the United States and China
that promised strict enforcement against both producers and
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the U.S. trade representative who
negotiated the agreement in 1995, tried to deflect such concern
when she met with reporters in Beijing last week. She expressed
approval of Beijing's efforts to crack down on producers of
illegally copied disks and cited a laundry list of numbers: 69
illegal producers shut down, more than 800 arrests, countless
master tapes destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barshefsky even argued that China had ceased to be a
high-scale exporter of pirated goods, moving way down the list of
offending countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a far bigger problem now with Italy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But industry experts who follow the situation closely say the
only real change is that the pirates, many of them Taiwan
businessmen with histories of organized crime, have moved their
operations from the Chinese mainland to Macao, the Portuguese
colony scheduled to revert to Chinese rule in 1999. The pirates
continue to export from Macao, both to Southeast Asia and even more
into China, where demand remains the strongest.
</P>
<P>
   The International Federation of Phonographic Industries, by far
the best-informed among trade groups monitoring piracy in China,
estimated that in the first half of this year an average of 500,000
illegally copied video compact disks were smuggled back into China
from Macao each day, or roughly 15 million disks a month.
</P>
<P>
   Video compact disks, the same size as audio compact disks,
typically contain up to 70 minutes of a movie, often requiring two
disks for a Hollywood feature. In China, video cassettes are
rapidly disappearing, and video compact disk players that cost
about $100 have become a staple of virtually any Chinese family
with disposable income.
</P>
<P>
   So while Chinese and American officials are each claiming
victory in rooting out pirates, more illegally copied material is
on sale in China than ever before. And until the recent crackdown,
temporary or not, it appeared as if the Chinese authorities had
altogether abandoned efforts to stop the sale of illegal disks.
</P>
<P>
   Until this month, that is. The current crackdown may wear off in
a cycle, as previous crackdowns have, but last week the authorities
in several Chinese cities brought out bulldozers to destroy
millions of pirated video compact disks, in yet another effort to
show they meant business.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one day, the authorities destroyed 2.8 million video disks in
the southern city of Guangzhou, the center of piracy in China until
last year, when many illegal operations moved to Macao.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is a further proof of Guangdong's long-term
commitment to protecting intellectual property rights and nipping
the spreading trend of illegal video products in the bud,'' Li
Lanfang, deputy governor of Guangdong province, where Guangzhou is
situated, told the official newspaper China Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials staged the same kind of display of destroying
confiscated illegal goods in 1995, when the important guest was Ms.
Barshefsky, who was threatening trade sanctions. That threat may
have been a ploy to put pressure on her Chinese counterparts, but
both sides signed an agreement in February 1995 to fight
intellectual property violations and to enforce anti-piracy
provisions strictly, with regular progress reports.
</P>
<P>
   Yet trade talks between the United States and China have
inevitably been an extension of diplomatic politics. When relations
between the countries were strained in 1996, the Clinton
administration wanted to appear tough on China.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with diplomatic ties improving and each side working
to orchestrate an atmosphere of convivial summitry around the
visits of Clinton and President Jiang Zemin to each other's
countries, fighting a trade dispute has receded as a political
priority, as has enforcing the intellectual property rights
agreement.

HYGIENE CHOICES ROLL ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This occurred to me recently as I stood in a supermarket aisle,
puzzling over the array of deodorants available to me.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it seems simple enough to just stick with what you've been
using and move on to the frozen foods, assuming no one has
complained about a funky aura following you around, but the
plethora of choices always amazes me. I stood there for several
minutes as a steady stream of shoppers swirled past, trying to make
a choice.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of labels included Suave, Mum, Mitchum, Ban, Arm &AMP;
Hammer, Secret, Soft and Dry, Dry Idea, Degree, Gillette, Right
Guard, Sure, Teen Spirit, Crystal Clean, Degree, Arid, Brut, Old
Spice, Speedstick, Lady Speedstick and Speedstick Ultimate.
</P>
<P>
   Speedstick Ultimate? I love that. Why does the company make any
other kind of deodorant? Who is going to settle for Speedstick
Inferior when they know Ultimate is out there?
</P>
<P>
   But these were just the brands available. Once you've narrowed
that choice down, you still have the various types to contend with:
</P>
<P>
   Wide-ball roll-on, clear soft solid, scented, unscented, wide
solid, ultra-dry soft solid, unscented wide solid, silken solid,
clear gel, invisible dry, powder fresh, shower fresh and, in a nice
nod to a simpler time, regular. &QL; 
THINKING TOO MUCH
</P>
<P>
   Winnow these choices down and you finally . . . wait, one more
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Deodorant?
</P>
<P>
   Antiperspirant?
</P>
<P>
   Or deodorant AND antiperspirant?
</P>
<P>
   The idea, as I understand it, is simply to prevent stinking.
Anything beyond that and you're thinking about it too much.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, I spotted razors. Lots of razors. Bic
Sensitive Skin. Bic Tough Beard. Bic Twin Sensitive Skin. Bic Twin
Tough Beard. Bic Silky Touch. Bic Original (sigh). Gillette Good
News. Gillette Custom Plus. Gillette Sensor XL. Gillette Sensor XL
for Women. Gillette Custom-Plus Pivot. Gillette Daisy Plus.
Gillette Agility. Schick Protector (ah, the anti-Van Gogh model).
Schick Tracer. Schick Tracer FX. Schick Personal Touch Silk
Effects.
</P>
<P>
   I could be wrong, but I don't believe it was always thus. I grew
up in a small town, so maybe stores there didn't stock staples in
so many different varieties.
</P>
<P>
   My father relied on my mom to pick up his hygiene supplies. And
he didn't have to specify his order. ``Pick up some deodorant and
razor blades'' did the trick. &QL; 
FAR FROM FATHER
</P>
<P>
   So, for the duration of my life, anyway, he always used the same
brands. He enveloped himself in a small cloud from sprays with
standard Right Guard in the old brown can, which managed to make
him smell like a doctor's office. He shaved with a single-blade
Gillette razor better suited to scraping paint off furniture (tough
beard).
</P>
<P>
   Proving that the apple sometimes does fall a good distance from
the tree, I am a sucker for variety. I hate to use the same thing
twice, which is why I bought the Schick Protector. I was perfectly
happy with my Gillette Sensor. But the Protector offered, in
addition to an Ultra Glide Comfort Strip, Pivoting Blade,
Rubberized Grip, Protective Cover and Holding Stand, ``Safety
Wires,'' which ``provide unsurpassed safety from nicks and cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   I've not noticed any real difference. I've tried shaving with
one razor and then another. I've even tried shaving half my face
with one razor and half with the other to see whether anyone
noticed a cleaner, closer look.
</P>
<P>
   No one did.
</P>
<P>
   All these choices could drive a man to drink. Let's see, there's
Fat Tire, Shiner Bock, Pete's Summer Brew, Pete's ESB Lager, Pete's
Wicked Ale, Pete's Wicked Strawberry Blonde, Samuel Adams Cherry
Wheat, Samuel Adams Summer Ale, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Henry
Weinhard's Dark, Henry Weinhard's Blue Boar Ale, Budweiser, Bud
Light, Coors, Coors Light, Miller, Miller Lite, Miller Genuine
Draft, Miller Genuine Draft Lite . . .
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. By the time I decide, I won't be thirsty anymore. &QL;

NOMINEE TO HEAD FDA IS CALLED A CONSENSUS BUILDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN.: Kan., N.M.) (ja) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Six years ago, when Dr. David Kessler was new to
the job of commissioner of food and drugs, he flew to Kansas to ask
a woman he had never met to become one of his chief deputies. Dr.
Jane Henney, a cancer specialist who was an administrator at the
University of Kansas School of Medicine, had a reputation, Kessler
said, for being ``very smart, very talented, very
independent-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, Henney managed the daily activities of
the Food and Drug Administration, a vast agency with 9,000
employees and a mandate to monitor the safety of $1 trillion worth
of products each year. Before leaving in 1994 to become vice
president for Health Sciences at the University of New Mexico, she
hired many of the top officials who now work at the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the cadre of people at the agency, they
certainly reflect Jane's imprint,'' said Kessler, who left the job
16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Henney, 51, was asked to leave academia for Washington
once again, this time by President Clinton, who nominated her to
fill Kessler's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Tuesday they expected Henney to
win Senate confirmation but not necessarily without a fight. Urging
the Senate to hold hearings quickly, Clinton said the agency needs
``a full-time and confirmed commissioner,'' and pronounced Henney
``extremely well qualified to serve as commissioner as the agency
prepares itself to meet the challenges of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who know Henney say she will be no clone of Kessler, whose
six-year tenure was marked by crusades against tobacco and dietary
supplements and by repeated fights with congressional Republicans
who wanted to wanted the agency to be more cooperative with the
pharmaceutical industry in bringing drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, one phrase often chosen to describe Henney is
``consensus builder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't come into this with a lot of baggage one way or
the other,'' said Chris Jennings, deputy assistant to the president
for health policy. ``She has not really been involved in causes of
the day. David Kessler was the right person for his time but Jane
is the right person for this time.''
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, Henney will face a daunting task. After years of
debate and resistance from the agency, Congress last year adopted
legislation to speed the review of new medicines; it will be up to
Henney, who says she supports it, to put the new law into effect.
In addition, she will have to navigate a political minefield of
issues, from tobacco control to the safety of the food supply to
questions raised by critics about whether the agency, already using
speedier reviews, has allowed unsafe drugs to reach consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She faces a Republican Congress with expressed antipathies to
her predecessor,'' said Thomas Moore, a senior fellow in health
policy at George Washington University Medical Center who studies
drug safety. ``There are well-organized pressures by industry to
approve drugs more quickly, and on the other hand there are going
to be people beating on the door when there is a safety crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   One agency official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified, said: ``It's a much harder job than when Kessler took
it. He made it into that, in a way. The agency is just so much more
public and so much more visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Henney (pronounced HAY-nee) grew up in Woodburn, Ind.,
population 512. In interviews with local newspapers, she has
recounted how, while watching a good friend die from breast cancer,
she decided to become a doctor. She came of age in medicine at a
time when there were few women in the field; she was one of just 12
in a 250-member class at the University of Indiana Medical School.
If her nomination is approved, she would be the first woman to head
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But confirmation may not come quickly. ``I don't think it is
going to be easy,'' said one top official of the Department of
Health and Human Services, of which the FDA is a part. ``Most
important is that she is going to make clear that she supports the
law passed last year and is going to fully implement it, and that
is going to be her top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than expressing an interest in food safety, Henney has
said little about what she would do if she gets the job. She
declined requests for interviews Tuesday, issuing a brief statement
that said she is committed to the new drug legislation. ``There is
no greater honor,'' she said, ``than to be asked to return to
public service and to lead the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Henney already knows the agency well and is popular there. ``She
is a person that people like working for,'' said Linda Suydam, who
worked for Henney both at the FDA and at the University of New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research
Group, an advocacy organization in Washington that has been
critical of the agency's willingness to approve new drugs quickly,
expressed concerns that Henney would not be tough enough for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very worried about the crisis of the FDA, which is the
rush to approve to many drugs.'' Wolfe said, adding that he feared
that Henney ``doesn't handle crisis well.''

HOUSE BILL PROTECTS INTERNET FROM NEW TAXES FOR 3 YEARS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to throw cold water on the frenzy to tax the
Internet, the House passed a bill Tuesday that would bar state and
local governments from imposing new Internet taxes for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Framing the measure as a ``pre-emptive strike'' on taxes during
a period of rapid Internet growth, including the online sale of
goods, the House passed the bill after months of careful
negotiations by state governors, businessmen and the Internet
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information should be made available as freely and widely as
possible throughout the world,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., who wrote the bill out of concern that new taxes could
slow the Internet's growth. ``It should not be taxed and it should
not be regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate wants a six-year moratorium on taxation, and is
expected to take up its bill sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill would temporarily prohibit most state and local
governments from imposing new kinds of taxes on the Internet, like
taxing users for access. It would also stave off taxes on sales
that would ordinarily not be taxed if they had taken place over the
telephone or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   Eight states already tax Internet access, and the bill would
allow them to continue the tax if they pass a law to do so within
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the three-year deadline, the bill would create a
commission to study the issue of Internet taxes and make
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill seeks to balance the interests of those who use the
Internet to find information and buy goods, businesses that want to
use the Internet to sell their goods, and state and local
governments that see an opportunity to expand their tax bases.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the National Governors' Association has opposed the
measure, saying it would unfairly infringe on the right of state
and local governments to levy taxes. The opposition stemmed mainly
from the future possibility of taxing goods sold on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   By some estimates, Internet sales are expected to reach between
$200 billion and $500 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials have long sought to plug a legal
loophole that deprives them of billions of dollars in taxes in
mail-order sales, and by extension, Internet sales. Existing law
does not require companies to collect sales taxes from customers in
states where those companies do not have a physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   For the support of the Governors' Association, Cox agreed to
expand the Internet study group's mission to include
recommendations on a way to tax out-of-state customers.

SEC RELAXES ARBITRATION RULES AT BROKERAGE HOUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday
that brokerage industry employees would no longer be required to
arbitrate claims of employment discrimination before industry
panels.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change, which takes effect on Jan. 1, was sought in
December by the National Association of Securities Dealers Inc., an
industry self-regulatory body, after several years of pressure from
disgruntled employees and civil rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have maintained that the securities industry's
insistence on mandatory industry arbitration in employment disputes
has resulted in a pattern of unfair treatment, including widespread
discrimination against women at securities firms and the frequent
denial of employees' civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt Jr., the chairman of the SEC, who announced the
commission's approval Tuesday, said in a statement that it was ``a
big step in a positive direction,'' and encouraged other
self-regulatory organizations to follow the lead of the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, under pressure from lawsuits, the big securities
firms have changed their stance on the issue of mandatory industry
arbitration of employment disputes. Mandatory industry arbitration
of employment disputes is generally a condition of employment for
brokers and other employees who are registered with self-regulatory
organizations such as the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, for example, which recently settled a class
action suit alleging employment discrimination brought by eight
former women employees, is now changing its way of resolving such
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   From July 1, it will allow employees who are registered members
of the association to have the option, in certain cases, of going
to court rather than industry arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are supportive of this change and it is consistent with our
new dispute resolution program,'' said Bill Halldin, a Merrill
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. criticized the change, contending that
it would add to the legal costs for securities firms. ``We just
firmly believe that having dispute proceedings in two places _
court and arbitration _ raises the costs,'' said Thomas Taggart, a
Schwab spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the securities industry's practices were happy
to hear of the commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Mary Stowell, a lawyer who helped win a
class-action settlement for hundreds of women from Smith Barney
Inc. after several women at the firm sued, contending that there
was a pattern of discrimination and abuse at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time,'' she said. ``It eliminates one roadblock,
but there's more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But other critics characterized the move as a belated
concession. ``It's a real slap in the face for'' the Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission, said Cliff Palefsky, a civil
rights employment lawyer who has for years sought to end mandatory
industry arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule change should have been made effective immediately,''
he said. ``The SEC has no jurisdiction for enforcing the civil
rights laws. The EEOC does. The SEC either needs to enforce the
civil rights laws or get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other securities industry organizations are also expected to
address mandatory industry arbitration soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do plan to address the matter at our September board
meeting,'' a spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange said
Tuesday. &QL;

KNICKS QUIET ON DRAFT, SEE NO KNIGHT IN ARMOR  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Phone lines are open. But while there were plenty of
panic-stricken calls being made concerning trades as the National
Basketball Association draft approached, few of them were emanating
from the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks and Nets have been subdued in their approach to this
year's draft, which takes place Wednesday night in Vancouver. The
Knicks have no first-round picks, the Nets have no picks at all,
and neither appears so seduced by this year's pool of prospects as
to think that a move is imperative.
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks, this could change in a hurry if deals start
coming their way. They are not desperate to move up from their
second-round picks, Nos. 38 and 44, but the Knicks would be
interested in moving Chris Childs and Chris Mills for a top pick.
They might even consider trading John Starks if they could land a
point guard in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to make a trade, it would likely have to be for a
player we felt could come in and give us minutes,'' the team's
president, Ernie Grunfeld, said. ``Right now, it's the status quo.
But if the right opportunity to move up presents itself, we'd
act.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a big if considering how little interest has been
expressed in the Knicks' aging, high-salaried roster. Although
Milwaukee has been testing the market recently to see what trade
value point guard Terrell Brandon has, and Phoenix might be
persuaded to trade Steve Nash, the Knicks have not been able to
entice either team with the players they are willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have been trying to move Childs and Mills for the
last two weeks, but teams are wary of reserves with starters'
salaries and years left on their contracts. At some point, if the
deal were as right, the Knicks might add a more coveted player to
the mix. Although he is erratic and is coming off a season marked
with personal problems, Starks has value.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is still coveted, and still has the potential to win games
for you,'' one general manager said. ``But he is probably in the
best situation for him, playing in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Salary-cap rules would make a trade involving Starks difficult
to work out, too. He is a base-year compensation player, which
means that although his salary is $4 million, his salary-cap slot
with the Knicks is only $1.9 million. Beyond this, he is possibly
the most popular Knick and is Patrick Ewing's close friend.
</P>
<P>
   With their trade possibilities limited, the Knicks may be just
as happy to stick with their second-round picks. In a draft full of
uncertainty, they may find a player who is just as capable of
making their roster at No. 38 as they would with a late first-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talent in this draft is pretty close through the top
eight,'' Grunfeld said. ``Then there's another group of about five
or six players. After that, it's a crapshoot. The depth is not bad,
but there isn't the impact players you've seen in the past. There's
no Tim Duncan or Keith Van Horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn was grabbed by the Nets last year in a clever draft-day
trade engineered by Coach John Calipari and General Manager John
Nash. This year, the Nets are not even feigning interest in the
draft. They have no picks, and have little desire to acquire one
because they have a roster bubbling over with young talent.
Calipari is so convinced his team is in for a quiet draft day that
he is on vacation in Florida.
</P>

   ``There was no definite, `This guy makes us better,' '' Calipari
said before leaving town. ``There was no Keith Van Horn. We knew he

   The Knicks are keeping their options open. They have talked
about a trade with teams that have multiple first-round picks, like
Milwaukee (Nos. 9 and 19), Houston (14, 16 and 18) and Orlando (12,
13, 15). To cover themselves, they have worked out Arizona forward
Michael Dickerson, Valparaiso guard Bryce Drew and the curiosity Al
Harrington, a high school forward from Elizabeth, N.J., who could
go in the middle of the first round. If the Knicks stay with their
second-round position, they might have a chance to select St.
John's guard Felipe Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Whomever the Knicks select, the player will be hard-pressed to
find his way into a roster already packed with players who have
long-term deals and cemented positions on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like our nucleus,'' Grunfeld said. ``We do not have much
roster space. We feel like we are pretty solid where we are. Very
seldom do you find a rookie that will come in and have an impact
right away.'' &QL;

MANY SMALL COMPANIES HOPING FOR TAKEOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is there any hope for the small-stock investor? J.D. Sullivan,
vice president of Carleton, McCreary, Holmes &AMP; Co., believes that
there are only two ways for small companies to get out of the
orphanage.
</P>
<P>
   One is to be acquired, the other is to do a merger of equals
that lifts the company out of the small _ and ignored _ market-cap
range.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sullivan thinks that leveraged buyout funds, flush with
more than $50 billion that they raised last year from investors,
are prime potential buyers of orphaned companies. His firm
identifies companies with solid balance sheets and double-digit
returns on stockholders' equity that buyout fund managers might
consider buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good companies with good managements, reasonable
products and growth rates,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Sullivan's group advised Linsalata Capital Partners, a
private equity fund, on its purchase of Transzonic Cos., a
diversified company with businesses in industrial textiles,
cleaning and safety products.
</P>
<P>
   Transzonic, whose stock traded roughly 15,000 shares a week on
the American Stock Exchange, was a classic orphan. For two years
before the buyout, its stock fetched an average $14 a share. When
Linsalata bought it, shareholders received $29 a share in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan and his colleagues at Carleton, McCreary, Holmes, which
is the investment banking arm of Keycorp, have compiled a list of
six orphaned companies that they think would make attractive
candidates for buyout funds.
</P>
<P>
   They are: Alltrista Corp., a 1993 spinoff from Ball Corp., the
home-canning supplier; Dravo Corp., the world's largest publicly
traded producer of lime; Fansteel Inc., a specialty metals
manufacturer; Figgie International, the maker of aviation
navigation devices and breathing equipment; Midland Co., a
property-casualty insurer and inland waterway shipper; and Oglebay
Norton, a shipping company in the Great Lakes region that is also a
maker of industrial sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these companies are moving toward the kind of radical
change needed to unlock the intrinsic value of the enterprise,''
Sullivan said. &QL;

   LENNOX, S.D. _ Clouds the color of gunmetal billowed across the
South Dakota sky as Merlyn Steever slouched in a metal chair in a
now-empty barn, his arms folded in weary resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give up,'' the 50-year-old farmer said as he waited for the
trucks to load the last of his pigs and take them to slaughter,
ending his career as a hog producer. ``I just can't compete with
the big corporates. I don't see how any farmer can.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of big hog factories, which are more akin to
the corporate efficiency of General Motors than the ethos of the
American family farm, has emerged as perhaps the most contentious
issue in the nation's farm country.
</P>
<P>
   While some big-scale corporate hog farming has existed for
years, it is now starting to dominate this sector of agriculture,
with companies increasingly owning the hog plants, the
slaughterhouses, and the distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of smaller farmers, along with anger among
townspeople in rural areas offended by the foul smell of the huge
hog barns, has stirred debate in a dozen states that are now
considering plans to curb such plants, which can threaten
underground water supplies. A ballot initiative in South Dakota, to
be voted on in November, would effectively outlaw corporate
livestock production. And Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma recently
signed a bill restricting big hog operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency is
preparing to work with the states to impose strict
pollution-discharge permits on all large farms by 2005. The agency
said in March that it would propose regulations that could range
from the installation of equipment to capture methane fumes to
changing the composition of animal feed to control certain
nutrients in the waste.

 &HT;    Plans for Jewish cemetery may again be blocked
 &HT;    By Marc Freeman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Plans for Palm Beach County's third
Jewish cemetery are being revived, but a Catholic cemetery
inadvertently could stand in the way again.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the state rejected a cemetery license application
from a Jewish burial company because Our Lady Queen of Peace _ a
Catholic cemetery in Royal Palm Beach, Fla. _ had an abundance of
open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   The state won't allow new cemeteries in a county if existing
cemeteries have too much room. To the disbelief of Levitt-Weinstein
Memorial Chapels &AMP; Cemeteries, state laws don't recognize that Jews
cannot be buried in gentile graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To ignore that fact seems to be kind of ridiculous,'' said Ira
Sheskin, the South Florida Jewish community's top demographer and a
paid consultant to Levitt-Weinstein. ``People get buried
religiously for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   With the county's Jewish population still soaring,
Levitt-Weinstein again is asking the state for a license for its
planned 38-acre Mount Nebo Cemetery of the Palm Beaches in suburban
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials in Hollywood, Fla. hope that potential changes
in licensing rules will land them the cemetery by year's end. The
property already is zoned to permit Mount Nebo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mount Nebo was a victim of a rule designed to make sure
that Florida counties aren't stuck with more cemetery plots than
will be needed in 30-year time spans.
</P>
<P>
   New cemeteries are allowed when the projected number of burials
outnumbers available spaces at the time of an application. Without
this legal safeguard, a glut of cemeteries would waste developable
land, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The state rejected Levitt-Weinstein's 1992 application on the
grounds that Our Lady and other county cemeteries within 12 miles
of the planned Mount Nebo could handle all county burials for the
next 30 years. At the time, there were 334,000 spaces for 238,000
expected burials for people of all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Grossberg, Levitt-Weinstein's executive vice president,
said it didn't matter that ``the archdiocese is not going to bury
Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Walsh, attorney for Florida's Department of Banking and
Finance, which reviews cemetery proposals, said, ``The (state's)
position is that we don't license religious cemeteries _ the
statutes don't allow us to do that. We just license cemeteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Mount Nebo's rejection was a victory for the county's two
existing Jewish cemeteries, Menorah Gardens in West Palm Beach's
northwestern suburbs and Eternal Light Memorial Gardens in suburban
Boynton Beach, Fla. Combined, they have about 70,000 open spaces;
they had fought against competition.
</P>
<P>
   If Mount Nebo is rejected again and the other cemeteries fill
up, Jewish burials eventually would have to be moved out of the
county. Under another scenario, Levitt-Weinstein or another company
might buy a portion of Our Lady and try to open a new Jewish
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But Levitt-Weinstein believes it has a chance to win the Mount
Nebo license this time. That's because, last June, a state
administrative law judge threw out the rule used to tabulate
available cemetery spaces in a county.
</P>
<P>
   That rule required totaling all acres of unused cemetery land to
count spaces. One acre equaled 1,200 spaces.
</P>
<P>
   When Levitt-Weinstein first applied for Mount Nebo, the state
counted all 100 acres of Our Lady Queen of Peace. The state review
found more than enough room in the Catholic cemetery to accommodate
Jewish burials.
</P>
<P>
   Because the space rule is out, Levitt-Weinstein will argue
against counting the Catholic cemetery's acreage against Mount
Nebo, said Bill Furlow, Levitt-Weinstein's attorney in Tallahassee,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state can now use common sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the state has proposed a new space rule that differs only
slightly _ allotting about 1,100 spaces for each acre of unused
cemetery land, said Walsh, the state's lawyer. A judge is expected
to review it next month.
</P>
<P>
   To help bolster its case, Levitt-Weinstein is using population
projections and death rates prepared by Sheskin, the Jewish
demography expert.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 209,000 Jews in the county, up from about
161,000 in 1990. The steady increase means the community will need
more Jewish gravesites, said Sheskin, a University of Miami
associate geography professor. ``The Jewish population here has
increased so dramatically it would be very difficult to believe
that there's not enough demand there for a third cemetery,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheskin figures that there will be more than 100,000 Jewish
deaths in the county during the next 30 years _ justifying Mount
Nebo.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Menorah Gardens declined comment, and Eternal
Light representatives did not return phone calls. The archdiocese
has not opposed Mount Nebo.

HUNDREDS OF FIRES BURNING IN RAINLESS FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ With scarce rainfall and record-breaking heat turning
Florida into a tinderbox, about 258 fires were burning across the
state on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Across the state thousands of weary firefighters have for weeks
been chasing dozens of new wildfires a day that have burned about
100,000 acres and destroyed at least $80 million in crops so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have been so extensive and numerous that President
Clinton has declared the entire state a disaster area, and
firefighters from as far as Alaska have come down to help exhausted
local crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``They send us here. They send us there,'' said Robert Kondos, a
firefighter from Holly Hill, north of Daytona Beach. ``We don't
know where we are going to go next.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are experiencing an array of problems, from
respiratory ailments and heat exhaustion to thick smoky haze,
highway closings and town evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, more than 650 wildfires have sprung up in
rural areas of north and central Florida, spanning a wide swath in
the northern part of the state from Pensacola to Jacksonville and
south nearly to Orlando, state emergency management officials said.
The chief factors are the relentless heat, with temperatures from
the mid-90s to more than 100 degrees, and meager rain. Only 2
inches of rain has fallen in northern Florida in May and June,
compared with the normal amount of 10 inches, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere that fires are contained they're not actually put
out. Thunderstorms come along and lightning strikes and re-ignite
the fires,'' said Craig Fugate, bureau chief of the state division
of emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has not been this dry in at least 50 years, the
officials said. With the worst drought in 50 years, 66 of Florida's
67 counties have already had fires, ranging from a few acres to
several thousand acres.
</P>
<P>
   The damage from the fires and dry weather totals about $100
million, the officials said, including $80 million worth of corn,
peanuts, hay and other crops in the Panhandle and northern Florida
(about one-third of the region's $242 million annual harvest) and
another $10 million of commercial timber.
</P>
<P>
   About 23 people have been injured, many of them firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is used to hot summer weather, but this is the worst,
state officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, we get three or four days of hot weather and then we
get rain,'' said Greg Thayer, a spokesman for the state Department
of Community Affairs' fire information center. ``We've been over a
month and there hasn't been a break.''
</P>
<P>
   County workers in some areas have sometimes had to go door to
door ``to find out who's breathing and who isn't,'' Thayer said.
</P>
<P>
   Although residents have been spared the brunt of the damage,
about 116 homes have been destroyed and 600 to 800 people have been
forced from their homes because of smoke. Hospitals have reported
more cases of respiratory problems and heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other residents have had to cope with hazy skies
and highway closings, and on Monday, Agriculture Commissioner Bob
Crawford encouraged counties to refrain from setting off fireworks
displays for the Fourth of July celebrations. In some counties,
barbecues have been banned.
</P>
<P>
   In Volusia and Flagler Counties, health officials urged
residents on Tuesday to stay indoors as firefighters fought
desperately to stop 16 new wildfires that burned timber and brush
and threatened water pumps and power lines not far from Interstate
4. In some neighborhoods, homeowners had sprinklers soaking their
roofs while others hovered in small groups, waiting for word to
evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   Ash fell like snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are holding out,'' said Lon Hull as he kept water
spraying on his home near the city of Port Orange in Volusia County
while his wife, Kelly, and their two children went to stay at a
church.
</P>
<P>
   In Taylor County, near Tallahassee, 127 firefighters from other
states, including Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina,
fought a fire on 17,300 acres of pine trees and commercial timber
property that has been burning since Thursday; it was about 40
percent contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on them,'' A.C. Almarode, a fire official from
South Carolina, said in a telephone interview, referring to the
crews. ``The humidity and temperatures are dragging them down
quick. You need a lot of shade breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the state, the smoke was so heavy that National
Guard helicopters had to use infrared equipment to find some of the
fires.
</P>
<P>
   The fire hazard can only subside with rain and lower
temperatures, but neither is expected immediately. Andy Devanas, a
state meteorologist, said relief will likely come in July and
August, months in which the state averages 8 to 10 inches each
month. But on Tuesday, it actually rained in parts of northern
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could go a good week like this it would be over,''
Devanas said as he watched the light shower that fell on
Tallahassee. ``We're going from flooding to drought to hurricanes.
I've never seen anything like it.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: AMEX MAY ADD TO AIRLINE-SEAT BULK PURCHASES; MORE
MARKETS, FEWER CUSTOMERS; FLYING TO KUALA LUMPUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Malaysia)  (Duplication warning: Also being filed in `f' category)

 By JANET PIORKO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The planned bulk purchase of airline seats between the United
States and London may be only the first in a series of such deals
by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   The company is buying seats on Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic
Airways flights from Continental Airlines, Virgin's partner, on
routes between London and New York, Los Angeles, Washington, San
Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Other similar arrangements are possible, ``with Continental and
with other airlines, as well as hotel companies,'' according to
Melissa Abernathy, a spokeswoman for American Express.
</P>
<P>
   No company the size of American Express has previously bought
tickets this way for resale to corporate customers, according to
Norman Sherlock, executive director of the National Business Travel
Association. He said he expected to see similar deals in the
future, adding, ``The problem is how much cash people have to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all large corporate travel companies are rushing to jump on
the bandwagon. Travis Tanner, chief executive of the Carlson
Wagonlit travel agency chain based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., was
skeptical about bulk buying of airline seats. ``We haven't seen yet
where that creates any greater value,'' he said. Carlson Wagonlit
has so far preferred to contract for volume discounts without
purchasing the seats outright, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbluth International, the corporate travel agency based in
Philadelphia, has been negotiating bulk purchases for clients for
about three years, with the clients putting up the money. However,
it turned down a bulk-purchase deal with Continental similar to
American Express', according to Patty McMenamin, a spokeswoman, who
said the company would be open to other offers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither party to the transaction between American Express and
Continental would disclose the number of seats or the amount of
money involved, though both said it was a multimillion-dollar deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Abernathy said the discount on the fares, estimated at 25 to
30 percent, was greater than what most of American Express'
corporate clients would be able to negotiate on their own.
</P>
<P>
   The seats, in both first class and coach, will be sold mostly as
fully refundable unrestricted tickets to American Express'
corporate clients, according to Ms. Abernathy, although she said
some might be made available to the company's retail travel agency
network for sale to individuals. The seats will be on flights over
the next year that match the preferences of the company's corporate
customers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which airline might be a candidate for similar deals in
the future, Ms. Abernathy said, ``Any time an airline gets into a
new market or expands in a market, they have to put a lot of
resources into building their presence. That would be one place to
look for another opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Continental, which began code-sharing
with Virgin Atlantic in February and has been ``looking to broaden
awareness and availability of our new seats,'' said Dave Messing, a
Continental spokesman. The agreement between Continental and Virgin
Atlantic called for the airlines to buy seats on one another's
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Competition Report
</P>
<P>
   Though low-fare airlines served more markets around the country
last year than in 1996, fewer people had access to them, according
to a new study by the Department of Transportation. In 1997, 1,115
city pairs had ``competitive service'' _ defined as at least 10
percent of market share _ by carriers such as Southwest Airlines,
Tower Air, Vanguard Airlines and Airtran Airlines; in 1996 there
were 984. Yet the total number of passengers on those routes last
year was 120 million, down from 122.9 million in 1996. The reason
is that the low-fare carriers have been entering markets that are
traveled by 50 or fewer passengers a day, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, fares were lower in city pairs that had
competitive low-fare service, the department said. The differential
was greatest in short-haul markets. For example, average fares for
city pairs of between 251 and 500 miles without low-fare
competition were 121 percent higher than for those that did have
such competition. The study was part of the department's quarterly
report on domestic airline fares, covering the fourth quarter of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another New Airport in Asia
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's new airport at Chek Lap Kok, set to open July 6, may
be getting all the attention, but Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is also
getting a new international airport, scheduled to begin operating
June 30. It is situated near Sepang, about 35 miles south of the
city, on a 39-square-mile site that allows for future expansion. In
the first phase, the airport will be able to handle 25 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
   The main terminal, measuring 2.6 million square feet, will be
connected by an automated shuttle train to a satellite building for
international passengers. Express rail service from the city is
expected to begin in late 1999 or early 2000. Taxi fare is about
$18 and travel time about 45 minutes, depending on traffic.
</P>

   A new Pan Pacific Hotel is set to open Thursday at the airport.
It is linked to the main terminal by a walkway. The 450 guest rooms
will have fax machines, modem jacks and two phone lines. An
auditorium will seat 200; a ballroom will seat up to 1,000, and 10
meeting rooms can accommodate up to 360. The hotel will also have a
business center, video teleconferencing facilities, a health club
and pool. Regular rates start at around $110 a night, but the hotel
is planning to offer a 50 percent discount for the first three
months.

EX-PREMIER OF SPAIN DENIES CONDONING ANTI-BASQUE TERROR
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID _ Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez repeated under
oath in the Supreme Court here on Tuesday what he has said for
years: he never ordered his Socialist government to conduct illegal
counter-terrorism against armed Basque separatists in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to me to break the law,'' Gonzalez said in
the trial of 12 political aides and police officers who served
under him. They are accused of kidnapping a suspected Basque rebel
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors, in this and four related cases, are seeking to
prove that Gonzalez's government sponsored a ``dirty war'' from
1983 to 1987 that killed 27 suspected Basque rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is considered crucial not only for the former
interior minister, Jose Barrionuevo, the most senior ex-aide on
trial, who faces 23 years in jail if convicted of kidnapping and
belonging to an armed group. It could also affect Gonzalez's own
political future.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who led Spain from 1982 to 1996, is now being
mentioned as a candidate to head the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gonzalez, 56, is not a defendant in any of the
lawsuits, many in Spain have accused him of complicity in the
illegal counter-terrorism, notably the deputy prime minister,
Francisco Alvarez Cascos. Cascos testified on Monday that Gonzalez
must have been involved in organizing and running it.
</P>
<P>
   The man who was kidnapped, Segundo Marey, 66, testified last
week that on the night of Dec. 4, 1983, two men abducted him in the
southern French Basque region.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first action claimed by a group called the
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups. It apparently aimed to strike at
the French sanctuary of the Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
   But Marey, it turned out, was a furniture dealer, not a Basque
rebel. His captors, realizing their mistake, released him after 10
days.

MAUREEN O'SULLIVAN, ACTRESS AND MOTHER OF MIA FARROW, DEAD AT 87  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maureen O'Sullivan, a leading Hollywood actress in the 1930s and
early '40s best known for playing Jane to Johnny Weissmuller's
Tarzan in the series of popular jungle adventure movies, died
Tuesday at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz.
She was 87. Ms. O'Sullivan, who was the mother of the actress Mia
Farrow, had homes in Phoenix, Ariz., and Grantham, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brightest of ingenues, the actress appeared in more
than 60 films, from ``Tugboat Annie'' to ``Pride and Prejudice,''
starring with everyone from Robert Taylor to the Marx Brothers. But
she was always identified with the lovely, legendary Jane, teaching
the niceties of civilization and romance to the yowling Tarzan,
Edgar Rice Burroughs' King of the Jungle. It was a notable pairing
of opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Her other movie successes included ``The Thin Man,'' ``The
Barretts of Wimpole Street,'' Greta Garbo's ``Anna Karenina,'' ``A
Day at the Races,'' ``A Yank at Oxford,'' ``The Crowd Roars'' and
``David Copperfield'' (with W.C. Fields).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Sullivan never studied acting and was modest about her
talents, telling a 1986 interviewer: ``I didn't pretend to be an
actress. I just tried to be natural, the best I could.''
</P>
<P>
   In another interview, she recalled that the praise she received
in 1935 for her performance in the death scene of a child bride in
``David Copperfield'' was not because of her skill, but because of
the directorial wizardry of George Cukor. ``They raved about my
agonized look and the tears in my eyes,'' she said, ``but it was
all because George was twisting my feet off camera.''
</P>
<P>
   She retired from full-time filmmaking in 1942 to bring up the
children (eventually seven) she had with her husband, John Farrow,
a movie writer, director and producer, and made only occasional
films until 1963. In that year, Farrow died of a heart attack. She
then moved her family from Southern California to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, she made her Broadway debut in Sumner Arthur Long's
``Never Too Late,'' playing opposite Paul Ford as a suddenly
expectant middle-aged wife. Both also appeared in the movie version
of the comedy. After that, Ms. O'Sullivan had an active career as a
Broadway actress, starring in ``The Subject Was Roses,'' ``Keep It
in the Family,'' ``No Sex Please, We're British,'' ``Charley's
Aunt'' and the 1980 revival of Paul Osborn's ``Morning's at
Seven.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Woody Allen gave Ms. O'Sullivan her most luminous screen role,
when she was 75, in his 1986 hit ``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' in
which her children included her daughter Mia. The script required
the aristocratic Ms. O'Sullivan to call herself ``a boozy old flirt
with a filthy mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   In her major scene, she resumes drinking after her husband
(Lloyd Nolan) has repeatedly berated her for flirting with a young
television crewman while the couple were acting in a commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Hailing her performance, Vincent Canby of The New York Times
wrote that Ms. O'Sullivan ``never had five minutes on the screen to
equal her work here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Sullivan compared Allen favorably to Cukor, who was
renowned for his skill in directing women.
</P>
<P>
   ``George had a preconceived idea, and he made you do his concept
of what he wanted,'' she recalled. ``I liked working with Woody
more because I felt he would, in his gentle way, find out in you
what you could do and let you do it.'' After the highly public
breakup of Allen and Ms. Farrow, Ms. O'Sullivan was very outspoken
about siding with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen O'Sullivan was born on May 17, 1911, in Roscommon,
Ireland, to Maj. Charles Joseph O'Sullivan and the former Mary
Lovatt Fraser. She was educated in convents of the Sacred Heart in
London, Dublin and Paris. Desiring an acting career, she read
widely and concentrated her studies on writing and music.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 18, she had a chance meeting with Frank Borzage,
the American director, who was in Dublin filming ``Song o' My
Heart,'' starring the celebrated tenor John McCormack. She passed a
screen test to perform as his daughter and went to Hollywood to
complete the film. She appeared in several more Fox movies and then
won longterm contracts with MGM.
</P>
<P>
   She was first matched with Weissmuller in ``Tarzan, the Ape
Man'' in 1932. As Jane Parker, Ms. O'Sullivan was rescued by Tarzan
and chose to stay with him in the jungle. Five other Tarzan
pictures followed. The last with the two actors (and Cheetah the
chimpanzee) was ``Tarzan's New York Adventure'' in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Her later films included ``Peggy Sue Got Married,'' Francis
Coppola's 1986 fantasy in which her granddaughter (played by
Kathleen Turner) visits her from the future. ``There's nothing to
worry about, dear,'' Ms. O'Sullivan lovingly assures her. ``You're
just browsing through time.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress' honors included a Roman Catholic Interracial
Council's 1980 award as ``a distinguished Catholic who has worked
to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Sullivan also wrote ``The Umbrella'' and other short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, she was married a second time, to James Cushing, a
construction company executive.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cushing and Mia Farrow (who lives in
Connecticut), she is survived by five other children, Patrick and
Theresa, both of Vermont, John Jr. of Maryland, Prudence of Iowa,
and Stephanie of New York City; 32 grandchildren; and 13
great-grandchildren. Michael, her oldest son, was killed in a plane
crash in 1958.

THE POP LIFE: CREATION OF A SHINY, HAPPY BAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the era of the Spice Girls and the Backstreet
Boys, the notion of a manufactured band _ carefully molded and
shaped by record executives _ has become a repellent one. But in
decades past, whether it was Motown's Berry Gordy putting the
Supremes through an intensive program of dancing, singing, manners
and biography adjustment or Phil Spector constructing the sound and
image of bands like the Crystals and the Ronettes, acts that today
would seem manufactured recorded some of the greatest songs of
their era.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, there is a noble pop experiment taking place at
Mercury Records. The band is called Swirl 360, and in many ways its
aim is to make manufactured pop credible and artistically valid
again.
</P>
<P>
   The band's members and Mercury executives resist the label
manufactured _ it has such bad connotations in the '90s _ but the
facts are these: Swirl 360 consists of two tanned, handsome
28-year-old twin brothers who came to Mercury Records looking for a
record deal. They signed with Steve Greenberg, known for producing
the nine-CD stax/volt boxed set as well as bringing the group
Hanson to Mercury. In an attempt to make a pop record he had always
wanted to hear, he put them into a 10-day songwriting program in
Scotland and gave them pop tips like veering toward a high note
instead of a low one at the end of a sung phrase.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of trying to turn them into vapid pinups, Greenberg
and the band decided to try something new. They sat around and
listened to as much catchy '70s pop as they could. Afterwards,
Greenberg compiled two tapes titled ``Sugar Pop'' (three hours of
bands like the Sweet, Badfinger, Edison Lighthouse and Cheap Trick)
and gave it to Swirl and most everyone else involved in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he and the band recruited alternative music songwriters
known for making albums that reach for a shiny, happy, pre-grunge
era of classic pop yet who have remained consigned to a small
college-rock audience. (The songwriters were from the Posies,
Eugenius, Superstar and Fountains of Wayne, though mainstream
hit-makers like Desmond Child also helped.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We approached a lot of really sophisticated alternative rock
writers and said, `What if instead of writing a song for college
radio or the music press, you wrote a song that would go straight
to the heart of every teen-aged girl you ever saw?''' Greenberg
said. ``And those people were thrilled to take up the challenge,
because that's what they all really want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is an infectious, upbeat, guitar-driven album that
looks to pop in its simplest guise, as an escapist balm to lift the
spirits. The experiment is one that will either create a ubiquitous
summer single on the order of Hanson's ``MMMBop'' or slip by
unnoticed. Mercury is banking on the former outcome. Though the
band's music won't be commercially available until next month, its
first single, ``Hey Now Now,'' was the most added new song on
modern-rock radio for the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president of Mercury came in and played it for me,
and I put it right on the radio,'' said Jon Zellner, the director
of programming at KMXV-FM in Kansas City, Mo. ``I hadn't done that
in a long time. The great thing about Swirl is that it's pure
straight pop. It's a great summer song: It should be on in every
car that has its top down and every radio on the side of a pool.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the record's ambitions seems to be to bring pop (as
opposed to popular) music back to the radio, and to make music
that, like an old Warner Brothers cartoon, can be appreciated on
two levels. ``I wanted a record that those who love pop history
will have a field day with and will love because it will remind
them of so many things from long ago, while at the same time a
15-year-old is going to love it because it sounds cool,'' Greenberg
said. ``It's not that easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, the Swirl brothers, Denny and Kenny
Scott, waxed rhapsodically about their love of pop, from the
Beatles and Kiss to Jellyfish and Redd Kross to Beck and Imani
Coppola. Born into a Navy family that moved around the country, the
brothers first thought about a career in music after winning a
high-school talent show with a version of the Cheap Trick-inspired
Poison song ``Talk Dirty to Me.'' A year and a half ago they moved
from Jacksonville, Fla., to Los Angeles, recording several EPs by
themselves before meeting their future manager, Christopher Sabec,
at the South by Southwest music convention in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact that Sabec also manages Hanson and met its
members at South by Southwest, there are a number of similarities
between the two bands. Like Hanson, Swirl's members are attractive,
clean-cut brothers, they work with Greenberg at Mercury, they make
upbeat pop music with beautiful harmonies, they used two of the
same songwriters and they are music fans with wide-ranging tastes.
Though the Scotts aren't blond like Hanson, they sound like they
should be. Though Hanson admirers, the Scott brothers resist such
comparisons, citing obvious differences like Hanson's youth and
allegiance to classic soul over later pop-rock. ``It's been
frustrating because our stories are similar,'' Kenny Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Is Swirl 360 prepared to be hated as much as Hanson? ``Yes,''
Kenny Scott said. ``I see Hanson has 20 or 25 hater Web sites, and
I know there are going to be some Swirl 360 hater Web sites. It's
definitely going to happen. It's going to be funny to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the band's long-range plans, Denny Scott said:
``We don't want to come in as a one-hit wonder. We want to come in
and be an incredible band that plays pop music that girls and guys
are going to like, and then hopefully maintain a career of that.
But music now is like fast food, so Kenny and I are being
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is the theme of the band's debut album. Its lyrics
serve as transportation to an imaginary world where life is as
simple and sweet as eating a chocolate bar, as demonstrated in
lyrics like ``Don't ask how but dreams come true,'' ``I know a
place where the sun is always shining,'' and ``If you think that
innocence is dead, I'll say it's all inside your head.'' When
someone threatens to rupture that bubble, the band warns ``Don't
shake my world.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether that world really exists, the brothers
respond, laughing, ``No, it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tamer Woodstock
</P>
<P>
   The producer Danny Socolof announced that there would be a new
festival at a very familiar place with very familiar artists this
year. It is called a Day in the Garden and will take place on the
site of the original Woodstock festival in Bethel, N.Y. The
festival is to feature a mix of Woodstock veterans and
first-timers, including Stevie Nicks, Don Henley, Ziggy Marley and
Ten Years After on Aug. 14 and Joni Mitchell, Pete Townshend, Lou
Reed and Richie Havens on Aug. 15. There will also be several acts
performing on Aug. 16, though the lineup won't be announced until
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Where the first Woodstock concert became a free-for-all, Socolof
said that this one was made for baby-boomers who have matured, have
families and want a tame atmosphere. To that end, he is letting
children under 12 in free. ``We want to send a very clear message
out there that this is going to be safe, it's going to be
comfortable and it's going to be gracious,'' he said. ``The adults
that we're targeting for this don't want to be hassled, they don't
want to wait in line and they want conveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 30,000 tickets for each day will go on sale beginning
Saturday at 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster outlets. The price is $69.98
per day plus service charges.

AT AN ALTERNATIVE SCHOOL, PRESENTATION MEANS ALL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MACARENA HERNANDEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While his friends were out in the halls scribbling
``don't ever change'' in their yearbooks, Jermaine Harris was
sweating it out scribbling math problems on the chalkboard in Room
600 at the School of the Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, this is how the stock would do,'' he said,
pointing to a chart he had prepared on the computer his grandmother
bought him. ``X represents years, and y represents money.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 18, a senior at the school, on the East Side of
Manhattan, was trying to convince a committee of five that
investing $5,000 in Nike and Xerox stocks and $5,000 in mutual
funds would be a sound idea.
</P>
<P>
   But for Harris, the stakes were higher than a mere $10,000. His
high school diploma was on the line. As part of requirements for
graduation, students at the School of the Future, as well as at 20
other small alternative public schools in New York City, must pass
four such ``exhibitions'' in their last four years there. For an
exhibition, students write and present a research paper in science
and math and two in humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Topics have ranged from the Vietnam War to Israel, slavery to
racism, immigration to New York City tenements.
</P>
<P>
   Kasia Kedzia, 18, a junior, presented her first humanities
exhibition last year on The Relationship Between Love and Death in
Poetry. After months of analyzing sonnets, she concluded that the
focus of her own poems was not broad enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My poems had the same plot: You like this guy, and then it
doesn't work out,'' Ms. Kedzia said. ``And then the
you-are-miserable-at-the-end type of poem. The exhibition forced me
not to be narrow. I can use symbolism now. I can write about grass,
things that I never thought about before.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, which has 525 students from grades 6 through 12,
focuses on technology, with an emphasis on computer science. It
models itself on the theories of Theodore Sizer, the school
reformer and author who emphasizes an interdisciplinary curriculum
and small class sizes where students can actively engage in their
own learning. Forty New York City schools are members of the Center
for Collaborative Education, the local affiliate of Dr. Sizer's
national Coalition of Essential Schools. At least half of the
Collaborative Education schools require exhibitions from their high
school students.
</P>
<P>
   The schools currently operate under a five-year waiver that
exempts them from administering the state's standardized tests. No
graduates have received a Regents diploma, given to students who
pass advanced state tests, but almost all have gone on to college,
said Kathy Pelles, the principal of the School of the Future, whose
third class is graduating this week.
</P>
<P>
   While students at the School of the Future receive traditional
grades for course work, the exhibitions provide another way to
gauge progress. They are evaluated by four categories: mastery with
distinction, mastery, satisfactory and needs improvement.
</P>
<P>
   For her presentation, Caryle Ann Francis, 17, analyzed why black
male characters in Toni Morrison's ``Beloved'' and ``The Bluest
Eye'' struggled with issues of intimacy. She had written five
drafts _ now dogeared and stuffed into a folder decorated with an
enlarged passport photo of herself as a tot. She had recited her
paper three times in front of the mirror in the girls' restroom,
and even tacked a huge sheet of paper with her outline on the wall
she would be facing when presenting.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ms. Francis was given only a mastery. She plans to
appeal for a higher evaluation. Although she is one of the school's
top students, she may have had a harder time because she stocked
her committee with literature teachers and students. Presenters can
select their own panelists, as long as there are at least two
teachers. Students tend to take the task seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine Harris sat on the committee of his friend, his friend
Shangari Meleschi, in March, and Meleschi sat on his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to let him off easy,'' said Meleschi, who had
also researched the stock market for his exhibition, as did
Jermaine's twin brother, Tremaine. ``But I wasn't going to fail
him, either. I know how hard he works.''
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine's presentation, which lasted more than an hour, was
full of graphs and statistics, and in his grilling he was asked to
rethink a number of equations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does x always represent years and y represent money?'' one
teacher asked.
</P>
<P>
   Harris coughed nervously.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher rephrased the question: ``Is time dependent on
money, or is money dependent on time?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked for a hint in the teacher's face but couldn't find it,
and though he had done well on other questions, in the end, he was
awarded a mastery.
</P>

   Scotland wastes another second chance
</P>
<P>
   Brazil also loses, but defending World Cup champions still
advance to next round
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAINT ETIENNE, France _ And so the disaster called the World Cup
only continues for Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Could it just be beginning for powerful Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, a nation with a history rooted to the game and
boasting the vocal and loyal ``Tartan Army'' of fans, had a chance
to advance to the second round of the World Cup for the first time
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 Scottish fans descended on this quaint, refined
city of artists and street musicians, turning the town center into
a sea of plaid. The whole place buzzed with hope, anticipation and
World Cup scenes as memorable as any.
</P>
<P>
   Kilted Scot fans danced their way into the stadium. Chants of
``We will win'' rang in the air. An estimated 8,000 ticketless
Scots filled a town square where the game would be shown on
giant-screen TVs. Scottish players saluted the boisterous masses
moments before kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But Scotland forgot that Morocco had been invited to this party,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Scots were overwhelmed 3-0. Morocco left little to chance,
hammering in goals in the 22nd and 47th minutes against a
sluggish-looking defense and adding a third goal just before the
final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland yet again disappointed its enthusiastic supporters, as
was clear in the waning moments when a Scottish fan ripped off the
red-haired wig she wore and threw it in the direction of the Scots'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was enough to pull your hair out.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco's victory swept away Scotland's cursed World Cup hopes
and extended to eight the streak of World Cup tournaments in which
Scotland has failed to reach the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to apologize to Scotland,'' team captain Colin Hendry
said. ``We will keep trying our damnedest to make it. This is tough
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no consolation that the result of Morocco's victory
proved to be meaningless, since Norway stunned Brazil with a late
goal and 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian victory means that in the next round it will join
Brazil, which already had guaranteed a berth with victories in its
first two games. It also meant that even had Scotland won, Norway
would have advanced.
</P>
<P>
   But Norway did not score its inspired go-ahead goal against
Brazil until after it was announced in Marseille that Scotland was
being romped. Scotland's troubles definitely seemed to jolt the
Norwegians into a higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that we didn't take advantage of the chance
we had,'' Scotland coach Craig Brown said. ``We came out and hoped
to fight bravely. I thought we had the heart, but we didn't have
the game. Morocco was the better team.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprising news in the Group A games, however, was that
Norway was better than Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the defending Cup-champion Brazilians had little
to play for in the game, but as coach Mario Zagallo said, ``Brazil
never takes a loss well. We wanted to win, and we expected to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   But it lost for the first time since the 1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not just very pleased; I'm also very very proud,''
Norwegian coach Egil Olsen said. ``It's quite amazing what's
happened tonight and that we're moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   In its round-of-16 game next week, Norway will play Italy, which
eliminated the Norwegians four years ago despite playing with only
10 men because of a disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil moves on to face Chile at the Parc des Princes in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   And Scotland goes home. Again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in expecting to play well and expecting to get it
done,'' Brown said of Scotland's defeat. ``We didn't expect to be
outplayed, but we were.''

EXCERPTS FROM APPEALS COURT RULING ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-SUIT) 
(th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the decision by a three-judge panel
of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
overturning the injunction against Microsoft Corp. Judges A.
Raymond Randolph and Stephen F. Williams found for the company;
Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented in part.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   We find that the district court erred procedurally in entering a
preliminary injunction without notice to Microsoft and
substantively in its implicit construction of the consent decree on
which the preliminary injunction rested. ...
</P>
<P>
   We must decide whether the preliminary injunction was correctly
granted. ... Microsoft argues that the district court failed to
comply with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(1)'s command,
``No preliminary injunction shall be issued without notice to the
adverse party.'' We agree. Obviously the department's request for a
contempt citation provided no such notice, for the governing
criteria are completely different. To defeat the contempt petition,
all Microsoft had to do was to show that the department failed to
meet its burden of showing that the consent decree unambiguously
barred its conduct. For a preliminary injunction, by contrast,
traditional equitable standards would require the Government to
show substantial likelihood of success on the merits (here, that
the decree, properly construed, barred the conduct), plus risk of
irreparable injury, lack of substantial injury to the opposing
party and consistency with the public interest. ...
</P>
<P>
   At oral argument the department claimed that when the Government
seeks a preliminary injunction under a statute, its showing of a
likelihood of success on the merits supplants the normal need for
assessment of the interim risks. This is true under some
circumstances. First, it is clear that if a statute confers a right
to an injunction once a certain showing is made, no plaintiff _
neither governmental agencies nor private parties _ need show more
than the statute specifies. ... Second, and not entirely distinct
in the cases, lurks the proposition that when a governmental entity
sues to enforce a statute, irreparable injury is presumed to flow
from the violation itself. ...
</P>
<P>
   The district court did need to find irreparable injury before
granting the preliminary injunction. The absence of notice had the
effect of precluding the introduction of evidence and argument on
this requirement, and the omission was far from trivial. At oral
argument, the department conceded that it had offered no evidence
on the subject, and Microsoft suggested that it could have
forcefully contested anything the department might have offered,
alluding to information _ obviously not in the record _ that no
O.E.M. had, since entry of the preliminary injunction, sought to
take advantage of its terms. ...
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the department engage in a brief battle over the
extent to which antitrust law may be relevant to this dispute.
Without wasting time on the parties' somewhat exaggerated
positions, we can simply say that Microsoft is clearly right that
the decree does not embody either the entirety of the Sherman Act
or even all ``tying'' law under the act, and the department is
equally right to point out that the consent decree emerged from
antitrust claims, unresolved though they were, so that we must keep
procompetitive goals in mind in the interpretive task. ... However,
an antitrust consent decree cannot be read as though its animating
spirit were solely the antitrust laws. ...
</P>
<P>
   The court's task, then, is to discern the bargain that the
parties struck; this is the sense behind the proposition that
consent decrees are to be interpreted as contracts. ... To find the
meaning of an ambiguous provision we look for the intent of the
parties, just as we would with a contract. ... In that quest we may
rely on the same aids to construction as we would when interpreting
an ambiguous contract. ...
</P>
<P>
   For antitrust criteria, the department draws on Jefferson Parish
Hosp. District No.2 v. Hyde, 466 U.S. 2 (1984), for the proposition
that products are distinct for tying purposes if consumer demand
exists for each separately. (The department notes correctly that
this does not require demand for one product without the other but
simply demand for the two products from different sellers.) ... We
are not convinced that these indicia necessarily point to
separateness, especially those that depend on Microsoft's
treatment. ... The department offers no means of distinguishing an
upgrade from a separate product. Versions developed for different
operating systems may be better understood as different products
altogether; hence, their relevance to separateness is obscure.
Distribution of software code on a separate CD-ROM shows nothing at
all about whether the code is integrated into an operating system.
...
</P>
<P>
   And while the department says that the proviso would protect
Microsoft from a charge that it had violated the decree by adopting
a technology incompatible with other firms' products. ... In its
attempts to define the ``product'' I.E. , the department
consistently invokes the concept of ``browser functionality.'' ...
But if functionality is the criterion of identity (which the
department asserts so as to claim that the ``browser
functionality'' in Windows 95 is the same product as I.E. 4 for
other operating systems), Windows 95 looks like a tie-in of two
products (MS-DOS and Windows 3.11) that were sold separately in the
market: it contains the functionalities of both. On the
department's reading, it should thus be prohibited unless Microsoft
refrains from marketing MS-DOS separately. There is some suggestion
that Microsoft has in fact continued to license MS-DOS separately,
at least to end users. ... More significantly, the consent decree
does not condition its approval of Windows 95 on Microsoft's
marketing behavior with respect to MS-DOS. The failure to produce
the right result when applied to Windows 95, one of the situations
clearly resolved by the decree, is a fatal flaw. ...
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, in both parties' readings Microsoft's behavior
determines the permissibility of conditioned licensing. This would
be no defect if the behavior were in some way relevant to the
economic principles of tie-ins. But it is not. The department
offers no theory as to how a seller's abstaining from separate
marketing of the tied good might blunt the possible anticompetitive
effects of bundling. .. It seems especially beside the point where
the goods are complements used in fixed proportions. A monopolist
who ties two such goods has no obvious reason to market the tied
good separately: since all buyers of the tying good will also take
the tied good, the residual market for the tied good will be
minimal. ...
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's goal was to preserve its freedom to design products
that consumers would like. Antitrust scholars have long recognized
the undesirability of having courts oversee product design, and any
dampening of technological innovation would be at cross-purposes
with antitrust law. Thus, a simple way to harmonize the parties'
desires is to read the integration proviso of s IV(E)(i) (a proviso
in the consent decree) as permitting any genuine technological
integration, regardless of whether elements of the integrated
package are marketed separately. This reading requires us, of
course, to give substantive content to the concept of integration.
We think that an ``integrated product'' is most reasonably
understood as a product that combines functionalities (which may
also be marketed separately and operated together) in a way that
offers advantages unavailable if the functionalities are bought
separately and combined by the purchaser. ...
</P>
<P>
   The second point is. ... there should be some technological
value to integration. Manufacturers can stick products together in
ways that purchasers cannot without the link serving any purpose
but an anticompetitive one. ... Thus if there is no suggestion that
the product is superior to the purchaser's combination in some
respect, it cannot be deemed integrated. ...
</P>
<P>
   The test for the integration of Windows 95 then comes down to
the question of whether its integrated design offers benefits when
compared to a purchaser's combination of corresponding stand-alone
functionalities. ...
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is thus that integration may be considered
genuine if it is beneficial when compared to a purchaser
combination. But we do not propose that in making this inquiry the
court should embark on product-design assessment. In antitrust law,
from which this whole proceeding springs, the courts have
recognized the limits of their institutional competence and have on
that ground rejected theories of ``technological tying.'' A court's
evaluation of a claim of integration must be narrow and
deferential. ...
</P>
<P>
   We defer to neither party in interpreting the consent decree; in
fact, we reject both parties' readings. We suggest here only that
the limited competence of courts to evaluate high-tech product
designs and the high cost of error should make them wary of
second-guessing the claimed benefits of a particular design
decision. ...
</P>
<P>
   The parties agree that the consent decree does not bar a
challenge under the Sherman Act. ... On the facts before us,
Microsoft has clearly met the burden of ascribing facially
plausible benefits to its integrated design as compared to an
operating system combined with a stand-alone browser such as
Netscape's Navigator. ... The ultimate sorting out of any factual
disputes is a different question, and one we, of course, cannot
resolve on the limited record before us. ...
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion that integration brings benefits does not end the
inquiry we have traced out. It is also necessary that there be some
reason Microsoft, rather than the O.E.M.'s or end users, must bring
the functionalities together. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the products have no separate existence, it is incorrect to
speak of the purchaser combining them. ... What, then, counts as
the combination that brings together the two functionalities? Since
neither fully exists separately, we think the only sensible answer
is that the act of combination is the creation of the design that
knits the two together. ...
</P>
<P>
   It seems clear that there is a reason why the integration must
take place at Microsoft's level. This analysis essentially replays
our comparison of Windows 95 to a bundle of MS-DOS and Windows 3.11
and concludes that the Windows 95/IE package more closely resembles
Windows 95 than it does the bundle. The factual conclusion is, of
course, subject to re-examination on a more complete record. On the
facts before us, however, we are inclined to conclude that the
Windows 95/IE package is a genuine integration; consequently, s
IV(E)(i) does not bar Microsoft from offering it as one product. ..
</P>
<P>
   Special masters may not decide dispositive pretrial motions. ...
The department also proposes that this is a case of such
technological complexity as to be ``exception(al). So far as the
meaning of the consent decree is concerned, that is clearly false;
the words are in plain English, and if their meaning is not clear
it is not because of some deep technological issue but because of
uncertainties in the purposes of the parties that drafted the
decree, the sort of uncertainties that pervade contract actions.
...
</P>
<P>
   The reference to the master was in effect the imposition on the
parties of a surrogate judge and either a clear abuse of discretion
or an exercise of wholly nonexistent discretion.

UNITING THE PASSION OF ART AND THE PEACE OF THE SOUL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: R.I.)   Christopher Reardon, an arts journalism fellow at Columbia
University, first met William Congdon in 1985.  
 (af)  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ The death of any artist, from the unsung to the
oversold, is an occasion for looking back. With the work complete
and the artist no longer subject to slights and flattery, criticism
can be more candid and conclusive than before. Yet taking the
measure of William Congdon, who died April 15 on his 86th birthday,
proves trickier than that.
</P>
<P>
   As a painter associated with the New York School, the cluster of
Abstrac Expressionists who shook up the art world in the late
1940s and 50s, Congdon distinguished himself with his spirited
cityscapes of New York and Venice, often rendered in thick strokes
of black and gold. Like many of his peers, most notably Jackson
Pollock, he worked with a swift intensity that kept the intellect
at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, his interest in action painting focused less
on baring his psyche than on tapping into a higher consciousness.
And in 1959, after years of creative and emotional crisis, he went
to Assisi, Italy, and converted to Catholicism. Gradually
retreating from public view, he spent his last decades painting in
a Benedictine monastery on the outskirts of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   Famous, then forgotten, Congdon left one of the more puzzling
artistic legacies in recent memory. While some of his earlier
pieces have entered the collections of leading museums in Boston,
New York and Washington, a trove of later paintings sits in a
climate-controlled vault near Milan, waiting for someone to open
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 1960 or so he just disappeared,'' said Fred Licht, a
curator at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, which owns
three Congdons. ``I heard about his conversion, but there was such
silence after that that we all thought he was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption, as Licht discovered a few years ago, was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One foggy afternoon last January, Congdon sat in his studio at
the monastery, a working farm that is home to a dozen monks, and
tried to explain his artistic creed. ``I paint the same way that I
always painted,'' said Congdon, a tall man with striking cerulean
eyes. ``An image forms within me, and I give birth to it.''
</P>
<P>
   If few Americans recall Congdon and his work, it's not because a
writer made him up. Unlike Nat Tate, the shadowy Abstract
Expressionist celebrated in a recent book by William Boyd, Congdon
is the genuine article. And in many respects his true story is both
stranger and more illuminating than Tate's.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Providence, R.I., the night the Titanic sank, Congdon
was the second of five sons of an Episcopal steel baron and a
cotton heiress. After some early success as a sculptor, he
volunteered as an ambulance driver in World War II, nursed
survivors back to health after the liberation of the concentration
camp at Bergen-Belsen and then helped rebuild villages in Italy
before going to New York in February 1948 to resume his career as
an artist.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled by the shallowness of America's growing consumer
culture, he rented a cold-water studio just off the Bowery and
began to see Hermann Vollmer, a psychoanalyst who trained under
Freud. Living among the city's downtrodden and wrestling with his
inner demons each contributed to the expressive nature of his
painting, which he took up that winter in a new professional tack
he later called ``my first conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically Congdon applied paint with a palette knife, then
incised the encrustations of oil with a jackknife or awl. The
technique suited him to the end. ``With a brush, it's a kiss,'' he
said after painting one of his final landscapes last winter. ``You
have to fight with a knife.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1949 he held his first show at the pioneering Betty Parsons
Gallery. His tangled views of the city, hovering between
representation and abstraction, sold out, and before long he was
profiled in Life magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congdon had the feeling,'' Parsons later said. ``He didn't
give a damn for pretty pictures. He wanted to capture the
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Guggenheim, who liked to say that Congdon was the
reincarnation of her father, who went down with the Titanic, called
him ``the only painter since Turner who has captured Venice, its
mystery, its poetry, its passion.''
</P>
<P>
   While closely allied with the New York School, Congdon never
fully fit in. One factor was his wanderlust, which repeatedly drew
him away from the gallery openings and carousing of his
contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   A list of his paintings reads like an itinerary: ``Mexico Sand
Birds'' (1950), ``Paris No. 1'' (1951), ``Piazza Venice No. 12''
(1952), ``Istanbul No. 1'' (1953), ``India Temple (Tanjore)''
(1954), ``Sahara No. 12'' (1955).
</P>
<P>
   Travel wasn't his only inspiration. He also used alcohol and
sleeping pills. In a letter from Guatemala City in 1957, he
described his motive to his cousin, the poet Isabella Gardner, a
descendant of the Boston collector Isabella Stewart Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to have a pure birth,'' he wrote, using his favored
metaphor for painting, ``I must go through scenes little short of
suicide and not a bit short of madness and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace proved untenable, and not just for him. Between 1948
and 1970, four New York School artists _ Arshile Gorky, Pollock,
David Smith and Mark Rothko _ met early, violent deaths, cementing
a reputation for nihilism. Congdon seemed destined to be among
them.
</P>
<P>
   Then he found God.
</P>
<P>
   Peers called his religious conversion artistic suicide, and for
a time he seemed to confirm their fears that loyalty to the Church
would erode his artistic integrity. Playing the Prodigal Son, he
traveled to India with the entourage of Pope Paul VI and turned out
representational biblical tableaux that greatly pleased the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The overt liturgical subject matter stood in contrast to major
works of modern religious art like Barnett Newman's 14 abstract
``Stations of the Cross'' (1958-1966) and the nondemoninational
Rothko Chapel in Houston (dedicated in 1971).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Even Congdon came to rue some of his first work as a Catholic.
Near the end of his life, while still approving of his series of
abstract crucifixions, he singled out ``The Conversion of St.
Paul'' (1961), a piece owned by the National Gallery of Art in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a betrayal,'' he said, ``as if it was painted on
commission.'' To Congdon, the self-referential painting became a
mirror; when he looked, he saw an artist who had lost his faith in
the creative moment and was instead putting his talents to use as a
pious propagandist.
</P>
<P>
   As a tractor droned outside, Congdon continued his story. Not
long after his final show at the Parsons Gallery in 1967, he
underwent his third and last conversion. ``I pulled back from the
Church because I felt it was threatening my freedom,'' he said.
``The religious subject got in the way, and so I stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving from Assisi to Milan in 1968, Congdon slowly saw his work
open up. It was the result, he said, of striking a better balance
between his art and spirituality. Just as an inheritance from his
wealthy parents had freed him from the art market, his role as the
monastery's artist in residence (he never became a monk or gave up
his American citizenship) loosed his creativity again.
</P>
<P>
   A lifelong bachelor, he had an apartment to himself, with an
adjoining studio that overlooked two fields cleft by an irrigation
ditch and a stand of trees.
</P>
<P>
   He painted the scene hundreds of times, but made a point of
never looking out the window while painting. He preferred to
observe at his leisure and then, if the urge arose, paint from
emotional memory. Repetition was not a concern. ``To paint the same
subject is to paint no subject,'' he once wrote, ``but rather
always one's ever changing self.''
</P>
<P>
   His work grew quieter and more abstract, in many ways resembling
Rothko's Color Field paintings. Yet it retained much of the
spontaneity and texture that he had always sought. And though he
gave up religious subjects, his faith still suffused the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't that much good religious painting going on in our
period,'' said Peter Selz, who, together with Licht and Rodolfo
Balzarotti, wrote a 1995 monograph on the artist. ``But Congdon did
it with immense conviction and the result was the direct opposite
of all that pious stuff you usually see.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of his paintings have been acquired by the Solomon R.
Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of
Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. But none of them
comes from his monastic period, and none of them are on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art in
Providence, which recently hung ``The Colosseum'' (1951) and
``Christ on the Lake No. 2'' (1961), most museums store their
Congdons with countless other works deemed too marginal to show and
too meaningful to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for a man who liked to paint in the late afternoon, racing
dusk's advance, it seems somehow fitting that Congdon's reputation
as an artist should remain in twilight.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, his place in history will likely turn on how critics
and curators answer the question of whether he was a Catholic who
painted to save his soul, or a painter who embraced the Church to
save his art.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen O'Brien, curator of painting and sculpture at the Rhode
Island School of Design's Museum, has reached her conclusion. ``I
wouldn't want to put Congdon in a niche where he's a Catholic
artist,'' she said, taking a position that is shared by few of her
peers. ``As an art historian, I think the painting stands on its
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Brien visited Congdon last winter and was pleased with
what she found. ``There's the great physicality of paint handling
like Pollock,'' she recalled, ``the scriffiti that comes out of
Klee and Mark Tobey, and the luminosity of Rothko's Color Field
paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall the Whitney will present a major retrospective on
Rothko, and the Modern will mount one on Pollock. Congdon, in a
lesser way, will also get some attention. In November, the
foundation he set up to preserve and promote his work will pull 70
paintings from its vaults, and the walls of its private collection,
for a show in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   But Congdon was never overly concerned with worldly success.
``Any true painting is a state of soul, not an exercise in
esthetics,'' he wrote in a notebook in 1953. ``I don't paint with
physical colors but with spiritual combinations.''

 &HT;    Michael Jordan sounds like a man who's staying
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Michael Jordan wore no shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some 45 minutes after his expected arrival, he emerged, flanked
by two uniformed police officers, from a back entrance at the
Austin Convention Center. He was nattily dressed in a burnt orange
pullover shirt, light khaki slacks and ... white cotton socks.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes stayed behind, presumably because they were golf
cleats. He'd already played 20 at the Great Hills Golf Club and was
at the turn before being transported by a white limousine to Barton
Creek Country Club for the back 18.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball royalty's preeminent member might have been casually
dressed _ this is Austin, after all _ but this wasn't a case of the
emperor wearing no clothes. Anyone with six rings on his fingers
qualifies as fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   Fully satisfied? Hardly. Golf's his love, basketball's his life.
</P>
<P>
   It's fine for Kobe Bryant and Grant Hill to be like Mike, but
they're not Mike. We're not as interested in the next Michael
Jordan as we are the current Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   As Dallas Mavericks forward Michael Finley said at a recent
charity basketball clinic, ``The only slippage in his game is he
doesn't dunk as much as he used to. But that's not slippage. Half
of the players in the NBA want him to stay because of what he does
for the game. The other half wants him to leave so they have a
chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since MJ and those coattail-riders put the Utah Jazz out of
their misery in six games a week ago for the Chicago Bulls' sixth
NBA championship in eight seasons, this country has become obsessed
with his retirement. Get out now while you're on top, the experts
tell Michael, before you tarnish our memory of you as the best
basketball player in the history of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything more selfish? Why are we so eager to send the
Michael Jordans and John Elways out to pasture before they're
ready? Can't we just revel in their still-spectacular skills? If
their decline is too precipitous, their play will determine that.
MJ could play at this level another _ what? _ two, three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Are we too scared to see our heroes stumble? Can we not accept
their legitimate challenge to rise above the encumbrances of
advancing age and more youthful rivals?
</P>
<P>
   For every floundering Willie Mays or Johnny Unitas far past
their primes, we should salute the Cal Ripken Jrs., Paul Molitors
and Reggie Whites as they continue to bring credit to their sports
with an enviable work ethic and lasting legacies.
</P>
<P>
   We are so consumed with interest in Jordan, the kids wanted to
know everything about him, from the size of his shoes (13) to the
brand of gum he chews (in the playoffs, Doublemint). We can't get
enough of MJ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to continue to play,'' MJ said, ``but I want to
continue with the same guys I've played with. If not, it's been
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, 35, should forget us and do what he wants to do. Play if
he wants to play. Retire if that makes him happy.
</P>
<P>
   More than 730 campers flocked around MJ as he fielded their
questions for half an hour. The once-wide circle tightened around
him like animals after their prey, adolescents practically pawing
at his pant legs, thrusting hands toward him to physically touch
his greatness.
</P>
<P>
   As 8-year-old camper Taylor Oran said, ``He should stay if he
wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Javier Gutierrez, a lanky 14-year-old wearing a red No. 23 Bulls
jersey and one of his 16 pairs of Jordan shoes, thinks MJ's ``too
good to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Buzz-headed Kirby Wottrich from West Ridge Middle School said if
MJ is as fatigued as he said he was from this season's 103 games,
he should ``maybe play half a season.'' If so, make it the last
half, MJ.
</P>
<P>
   Thrall's Janice Mitchell, a brown-eyed seventh-grader, wants
Jordan to ``prove to the world he can win without Phil Jackson,''
his coach until he officially resigned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decision came as news to MJ, who said he would
consider it a rumor until he heard it from Phil. Jordan once said
he wouldn't play for another coach, but the ebullient tone in his
voice suggests he's not the least bit ready to leave the game.
</P>
<P>
   He adamantly insisted he won't return to baseball and will not
fantasize about the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   MJ could follow Larry Bird into the coaching ranks or be a
player-coach, but he said he doesn't think he has the discipline to
handle that. ``But I can't ever say never,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling, like Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't wrestle, and I don't watch a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't his departure leave the NBA in disrespectful hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still enjoy the game,'' he said. ``And there are a lot of
young players in the league who still need some lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   MJ left behind more hints that he'll remain in the league than
he does defenders in his wake. He said he hopes Scottie Pippen and
Rodman return, adding, ``And there's a strong possibility they
will.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he wanted to leave these youngsters with the advice of
listening to their parents and teachers ``if I don't see you again,
but I'm pretty sure you will.''
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: FORGET ABOUT IT, GEORGE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another night, another event, another thumbs-up
referendum on the state of George Steinbrenner's baseball team and
the stadium it reluctantly calls home.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez against the Turnersville Braves was only the
latest in a season of fascinating attractions that continue to just
wash ashore, bringing with them hundreds of thousands of fans.
After 53,000 showed up at Yankee Stadium on Monday night, another
50,000-plus braved the rain, the traffic, the parking and the
prices Tuesday night to watch El Duque try to baffle the best
bullpen-challenged team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, Steinbrenner huffed, albeit good-naturedly, in the
Yankee clubhouse beforehand. ``This is a natural setup, with the
World Series,'' he said. ``What will we do with the Phillies next
week? That's more of a test.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell us another one. Keep raising obstacles in the Bronx and
daring New York to cross them. Face it, big guy, they will build a
nuclear test site in Manhattan before they build you a ballpark.
You blew it. You put together this splendid team, brimming with
homegrown stars and smart and intriguing acquisitions, and nurtured
by a calm, street-smart native New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   You have let it breathe, like an excellent wine. You said you
learned that you ``can't go undefeated in baseball'' and you proved
it by not overreacting after losing in the playoffs to Cleveland
last October. Now New York loves your Yankees for how they are
doing and what they stand for, and its fans are visiting the
Stadium at a near-record pace that will only improve now that
school is out. By the end of the season, your cries and those of
the mayor for a park on the West Side of Manhattan will sound like
whistles in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   In your advancing age, you have become too smart for your own
good, even if you did get yourself stuck in two hours' worth of
traffic after landing at Newark International Airport from Tampa,
Fla., on Monday night in the middle of rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw what some of these people have to go through to get to
the games,'' Steinbrenner said. ``You have to love the Yankees to
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spotting a couple of kids in Yankee caps in the next car, he
said, ``I rolled down the window and said, `Don't worry, they ain't
starting until I get there.'''
</P>
<P>
   He's still the Boss, but these kids, Steinbrenner said, didn't
even know who he was, and why would they? While busily romancing
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani these past few years, he has surrendered the
back pages of the tabloids, allowed his players to be the stars of
his baseball team. They are merely authoring one of the most
feel-good stories in American sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any bad apples, no one barking at the manager,
and that's why people like this team,'' said Darryl Strawberry. ``I
know that we have a feeling like the Chicago Bulls have _ the
unity, knowing how to play, how to win, that you don't panic. We've
won a World Series, been together a while. Today in sports, it's
very rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Braves visit baseball's 24-hour supermarket for rich
teams later this summer, the Yankees are more charismatic, deeper
and have the vastly superior bullpen. Best team in baseball. As the
20th century nears its end, we have reached the point where
Steinbrenner's franchise is one of the sport's two or three most
reliably stable, the one El Duque and Hideki Irabu chose over all
the others. The Yankees are what the Dodgers were until Rupert
Murdoch took over in Los Angeles and the era of television
executives bypassing the general manager to make multiplayer trades
commenced.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Foxies have fired the Dodger manager, for the first
time in 45 years, and jettisoned an accomplished general manager to
boot, there is already a whisper circulating that they also want
the elegant Dodger uniforms changed. By the time Murdoch is done,
Steinbrenner's respect for history and tradition will be compared
to Wimbledon's. Sooner or later, he will realize he isn't getting
the Manhattan stadium, that he would be insane to go to New Jersey
and that luxury boxes, a Metro North train stop plus improved
highway access and parking will solve most, if not all, of his
riddles. He will embrace the Bronx, make himself a hero.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Steinbrenner will continue to insult New York
by comparing it to Cleveland and Baltimore, limp tourist towns with
only one team. He will persist in contradicting his own turnstiles'
count.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not come up here for mid-week night games,''
Steinbrenner said.
</P>
<P>
   Go tell that to the Mets.

   GENEVA _ In certain areas of Africa, one in four adults is
infected with the virus that causes AIDS, and around the world the
disease now rivals the greatest epidemics of history, according to
a U.N. report issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first country-by-country analysis of the disease, the
United Nations said that last year 30 million people worldwide were
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus, and that 21 million were in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Countries south of the Sahara account for the world's 21 highest
rates of HIV among adults aged 15 to 49 years, the most sexually
active segment of the population. In 13 of those countries, HIV has
infected at least 10 percent of adults, and in Botswana and
Zimbabwe, a quarter of adults are infected, a rate that even an
expert described as ``shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, released ahead of the 12th international AIDS
conference that begins here on Sunday, paints the gloomiest
pictures of the HIV epidemic since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is hitting Africa so fiercely that it now rivals the great
epidemics of history _ the Black Death of the Middle Ages that
killed 20 million people, or one-quarter of Europe's population, in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 that killed 20
million people, including half a million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But where plague and influenza killed in days, death from
untreated AIDS takes about a decade, making it a more silent
epidemic that officials have too easily ignored, AIDS officials
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HIV killed as rapidly as plague and influenza, the epidemic
would be controlled by now,'' Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the U.N.
AIDS Program, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report contained a glimmer of good news, showing a slowing
of infection rates in countries that have adopted strong prevention
programs, like Senegal, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot and other officials warned that South Africa, Namibia
and other African countries could soon reach a 25 percent adult
infection rate unless national leaders undertook similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates exceed one in three adults in some major African
cities and reach 70 percent of women tested in some prenatal
clinics. Many infected women pass the virus on to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of the Africans are doomed to die from
AIDS, the officials said, because they live in countries that
cannot afford the costly combinations of drugs that have helped
keep the virus in check among infected people in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The African figures compare to a worldwide adult HIV-infection
rate of 1 percent for adults and 0.76 percent in the United States.
Moreover, officials said, 90 percent of the African patients
probably do not know they are infected because testing is not
widely available.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide last year, 5.6 million people were newly infected
while 2.3 million died from AIDS. AIDS is now on the verge of
moving into the top five leading causes of death in the world,
overtaking diarrheal diseases. The viral infection now kills as
many people as malaria and is second only to tuberculosis, which
itself is a common complication of AIDS and a source of infection
to non-HIV-infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Piot, a Belgian who has worked with AIDS in third world
countries for more than 15 years, called the new HIV figures
staggering and said he was ``shocked'' when he learned that 25
percent of an entire country's adults were infected. At first, both
Piot and Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, the U.N. epidemiologist who
led the analysis, said they suspected a statistical error.
</P>
<P>
   But checking found them accurate and erring on the side of
underestimates, they said. It took the U.N. AIDS program more than
a year to gather and verify the figures with each country, and the
figures on AIDS are considered the most reliable of any
international health statistics, Piot said. Health officials have
been hampered since AIDS was first recognized in 1981 in getting a
handle on such information because of the notoriously poor quality
of health statistics in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. researchers obtained data from published material,
surveys conducted in clinics and health department data. Among the
methods used was computer modeling, using census data and infection
rates, to verify trends reported by the countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said the epidemic could eventually be controlled if other
countries matched successful prevention programs in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda was the first country to respond to a massive burden of
HIV infection, and the African country has cut HIV prevalence more
than a quarter, to 9.5 percent in 1997 from 13 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand, which has experienced what the U.N. said was probably
the best documented epidemic in the developing world, has cut its
prevalence by nearly 15 percent _ to 2.3 percent in 1997 from 2.7
percent in 1994. A drop in new infections was noted especially
among sex workers and their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in the industrialized world, reductions of this magnitude
are virtually unheard of,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal instituted campaigns for safer sex that has kept its
infection rate at about 2 percent. ``Senegal acted before it had a
major problem, but there are not enough of those countries,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than money will be needed to match such efforts
elsewhere, Piot said. ``The overriding need is political courage _
deciding to move ahead with effective approaches despite cultural
constraints such as promotion of condom use, sex education in
schools and widespread health education programs,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   As HIV is spread, it insinuates itself into communities little
troubled in the past and strengthens its grip on areas where AIDS
is already the leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, the infection rate has more than doubled to 25.1
percent in 1997 from 10 percent in 1992. Surveys have found 43
percent of pregnant women infected in 1997 in the major urban
center of Francistown. In 1995 in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe,
32 percent of pregnant women were infected.
</P>
<P>
   In one town on the Zimbabwe-South African border, 70 percent of
women attending prenatal clinics in 1995 were found to be infected.
</P>
<P>
   HIV rates are lower in Asia, Eastern Europe and South America.
But an alarming trend is the doubling and tripling of transmission
rates in some countries in these areas since 1994. ``Because over
half the world's population lives in the region, small differences
in rates can make a huge difference in the absolute numbers of
people infected,'' the U. N. report said.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing alarm about the widening gap in infection and
death rates between industrialized and developing countries, Piot
said the gap ``shines the spotlight on the have-nots of the
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. group attributed the gap to inadequate measures to stop
transmission of HIV and to make available the combinations of
anti-HIV drugs that help forestall development of deadly
AIDS-related infections and cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, deaths from HIV left 1.6 million children without at
least one parent. From the time the epidemic was first recognized
in 1981 to the beginning of 1998, 8.2 million children lost their
mothers to AIDS. Many also lost their fathers as well. In East
Africa, 40 percent of children 15 or younger have lost their mother
or both parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the number of orphans grows and the number of potential
caregivers shrinks, traditional coping mechanisms stretch to the
breaking point,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. AIDS program cited four reasons why the infection rates
are so high in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One is that more women of childbearing age are HIV infected in
Africa than elsewhere. A second is that African women have more
children on average than those in other continents. Thus, one
infected woman may pass the virus on to a higher average number of
children.
</P>
<P>
   A third reason is that nearly all children in Africa are
breastfed, which is thought to account for between a third and a
half of all HIV transmission from mother to child.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth reason is that new drugs are less readily available
than in industrialized world. Also, other sexually transmitted
diseases are known to speed transmission of AIDS and may go
untreated in poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. said it saw early warning signs that epidemics of
similar magnitude could occur among Asian countries, where HIV has
been a relative latecomer. However, the report said the figures for
Asia are less reliable than elsewhere because only a few Asian
countries have developed sophisticated systems for monitoring the
spread of the virus.

</P>
<P>
   India has the largest number of HIV-infected people _ 4 million
_ in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One survey in Pondicherry found four percent of pregnant women
infected. The prevalence of infection among truck drivers in Madras
quadrupled to 6.2 percent in 1996 from 1.5 percent in 1995. In
Manipure state, 73 percent of the patients in a clinic for
injecting drug users were infected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although HIV has infected less than 1 percent of adults in
India, the figure is 10 times higher than in neighboring China.
</P>
<P>
   Two major epidemics are occurring in China, the U.N. said. One
is among injecting drug users. The other is among heterosexuals in
the prosperous eastern seaboard where prostitution is re-emerging
as the gap grows between rich and poor. The incidence of sexually
transmitted diseases has soared in recent years. Health officials
regard the trend in sexually transmitted diseases as a warning sign
of HIV rates because sexually transmitted diseases can enhance its
spread.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report also includes the first country-by-country
information about the availability and use of condoms. But on
condom use, the report's tables contain many blanks _ purposeful by
challenging national leaders to take tougher stands on controlling
HIV infection, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   With a vaccine against HIV a distant hope, Piot said that ``AIDS
is with us to stay for a long time.'' &QL;

<P>
   LENNOX, S.D. _ Clouds the color of gunmetal billowed across the
South Dakota sky as Merlyn Steever slouched in a metal chair in a
now-empty barn, his arms folded in weary resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give up,'' the 50-year-old farmer said as he waited for the
trucks to load the last of his pigs and take them to slaughter,
ending his career as a hog producer. ``I just can't compete with
the big corporates. I don't see how any farmer can.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of big hog factories, which are more akin to
the corporate efficiency of General Motors than the ethos of the
American family farm, has emerged as perhaps the most contentious
issue in the nation's farm country.
</P>
<P>
   While some big-scale corporate hog farming has existed for
years, it is now starting to dominate this sector of agriculture,
with companies increasingly owning the hog plants, the
slaughterhouses, and the distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   The desperation of smaller farmers, along with anger among
townspeople in rural areas offended by the foul smell of the huge
hog barns, has stirred debate in a dozen states that are now
considering plans to curb such plants, which can threaten
underground water supplies. A ballot initiative in South Dakota, to
be voted on in November, would effectively outlaw corporate
livestock production. And Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma recently
signed a bill restricting big hog operations.
</P>
<P>
   On the federal level, the Environmental Protection Agency is
preparing to work with the states to impose strict
pollution-discharge permits on all large farms by 2005. The agency
said in March that it would propose regulations that could range
from the installation of equipment to capture methane fumes to
changing the composition of animal feed to control certain
nutrients in the waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nasty,'' said Barbara Dunham, 37, whose house, about a
half mile from a big hog plant in central Illinois, saw its
assessed property value drop 30 percent recently because of the
smell. ``It gets so bad you can't go outside. And you have to scrub
down your inside walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the big hog plants say the producers can scarcely
be blamed for delivering the kind of lean, low-cost pork that
American consumers demand. The hog companies say they operate in
scarcely populated areas, and take every precaution to ensure
health and safety. Moreover, they say they contribute mightily to
state tax coffers and rural regions that are starving for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has divided communities and turned neighbor against
neighbor,'' said John Bixler, a spokesman for Dakota Rural Action,
an advocacy group for small farmers in South Dakota. Indeed, the
passions over the big hog plants can become so pitched that people
who work in such plants often decide to live many miles away to
avoid the wrath of local townspeople angry about the odors.
</P>
<P>
   Premium Standard Farms, which is owned by the Continental Grain
Company and is the nation's third largest pork producer, pays about
$200 million in income to about 3,000 workers in Missouri,
according to a study by the University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Randy Mahoney, a 31-year-old supervisor for the hog company,
said that when he was a teen-ager in the early 1980s, he watched
the terrible pain on his father's face when the family farm was
foreclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a story you could hear from a lot of people around
here,'' said Mahoney, who makes nearly $40,000 a year and never has
to worry about prices in on the hog markets. ``I never dreamed I
could stay close to home, continue doing the kind of work I'm doing
and make a good living.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving work, Mahoney must shower and change clothes. Pig
manure, he concedes, stinks.
</P>
<P>
   That is the smell of money, say the hog plants' defenders,
echoing a refrain that has been used for generations to defend
steel mills, oil refineries and rubber incinerators.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   To people whose image of pig-raising evokes Old McDonald's farm,
the sight of big confinement operations would conjure something
more from George Orwell.
</P>
<P>
   For example, each steel building at a Premium Standard plant
near Harris, Mo., houses 1,150 hogs in 48 pens that measure 20 feet
long and 9 feet wide, each holding 25 pigs. The animals are
genetically designed to produce an identical cut of meat, and their
hooves never leave concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the independent farmers have also moved to the
confinement method, using the pens to reduce labor and save space.
The bottoms of the pens are slatted, so that waste drops and
collects in a lagoon. This water, which is full of hog waste, is
then spread over cropland as fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hoogestraat, who farms his family's century-old hog
operation near Lennox, 15 miles southwest of Sioux Falls, moves
through the hog pens to check on the newborn piglets.
</P>
<P>
   Hoogestraat, a former biology and physics teacher who said he
returned to farming after realizing that pigs were better behaved
than junior high school students, leaves an oldies rock music
station playing on a radio in the hog pen.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he selected a music station for the pigs, Hoogestraat
deadpanned: ``Because they get upset if they hear the broadcasts of
the hog reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his upbeat ways, Hoogestraat worried aloud that if hog
prices fell much lower than $35 per 100 pounds of a live hog he did
not know how he could stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Many bigger hog companies now breed the animals, own the
slaughterhouses and market the meat. This control of the process _
``gestation to consumption'' as one economist dubbed it _ allows
the big companies to withstand lower hog prices, since they can
make it up on the retail end. For the independent farmers, on the
other hand, a drop in producer prices can spell doom. And lately,
that is exactly what has been happening.
</P>
<P>
   Prices per hundred pounds of live hogs have been in the range of
$33 to $45 this year, the lowest prices in the last
quarter-century, and a disaster for many pig farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have a mixed view about the power of laws aimed at
stopping corporate farming. Nebraska has perhaps the nation's
toughest law of its kind, forbidding any corporation from engaging
in farming. The measure has endured federal court challenges. And
it has, indeed, kept out corporate farmers. The South Dakota
measure was crafted along similar lines, exempting family-owned
corporations. But huge family-owned operations can cause as many
environmental problems as the corporate concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, producer prices are based on national markets. Keeping
the big companies out of state does nothing to help the producer
prices for local farmers. For that reason, the South Dakota measure
is unlikely to help small farmers survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss to understand what would be achieved by the
South Dakota measure,'' said Ron Plain, an agriculture professor at
the University of Missouri. ``In a large sense, this is an
emotional issue.''
</P>
<P>
   As in the rest of agriculture, the trend toward bigger
operations is unmistakable. The average swine farm today produces
432 hogs. Twenty years ago, the average farm produced 87.5 hogs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, about one million farms were raising hogs. Today, about
150,000 farms raise hogs, a number that is inflated by the ``hobby
farmers'' who raise pigs as an avocation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most significant, meat packers get about 30 percent of
their hogs from their own hog-breeding operations, or from
large-scale contracts with farms. That compares with 2 percent in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   When slaughterhouses and breeders have such close arrangements _
or, in fact, are the same company _ the market shrinks for
independent farmers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Hunhoff, a South Dakota Democrat who is running for
governor against the incumbent, William Janklow, contends that this
trend is reducing competition and creating monopolies for big
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cut off access to markets, that's not free
enterprise,'' said Hunhoff, who grew up on a hog farm near Yankton
and supports the anti-corporate farming measure. ``We're at a
crossroads here. Are we going to defend and protect family farms?
Or are we going to let everything to the control of the
corporates?''
</P>
<P>
   Janklow has opposed the ballot initiative and defends the big
hog farms as good corporate citizens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; END OPTIONAL TRIM &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The anti-corporate farm measure has also divided farm groups.
Organizations that represent the bigger, more conservative farmers
and ranchers, like the Pork Producers Council, have expressed
opposition to the measure, while the more liberal National Farmers
Union has supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers like the Hoogestraats look down the flat gravel roads
near their farm and recite the names of 10 farmers who have stopped
raising hogs in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not win this thing,'' said Craig Hoogestraat, talking
about the anti-corporate measure on the ballot. ``But we're not
going down without a fight.''

DISNEY BRINGING ABC OUT WEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Walt Disney Co. plans to beef up the presence
of its ABC operations on the West Coast by giving the network a
prime location on its studio lot within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's plans, disclosed Tuesday, call for ABC to occupy most
of a 10-story building just north of the Ventura Freeway in
suburban Burbank by mid-2000. The ``modern classic'' structure will
sit next to the entertainment giant's feature animation
headquarters, the whimsical building fronted by a 50-foot version
of the blue-and-white sorcerer's hat worn by Mickey Mouse in
``Fantasia.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 300 and 400 ABC employees will move from the network's
New York headquarters to the new building, an ABC spokeswoman
confirmed Tuesday. The entertainment giant recently began
construction on the site, now a parking lot for the animation
building.
</P>
<P>
   The plans to move part of ABC's operations were contained in an
internal memo issued this week by ABC Inc. President Robert Iger
and reported in Tuesday's Hollywood Reporter. Iger has been working
in both Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The memo said ABC corporate headquarters will remain in New York
and that senior staff members would have offices in both locations.
It did not detail which departments would move.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spokeswoman Julie Hoover said the new building will also
house the ABC Entertainment executive offices now in Century City
and headquarters for Stuart Bloomberg, Jamie Tarses and the
network's standards and practices department.
</P>
<P>
   The move will transfer about 10 percent of ABC's work force in
New York as part of an effort to give the network a higher West
Coast profile. Speculation that Disney would take such a step began
emerging three years ago when it announced its $19 billion buyout
of Capital Cities/ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Disney obtained approval from the city of Burbank in 1992 for
the project as part of its master plan for expansion, contingent on
the building remaining consistent with the plan, according to the
city's Planning Department. It had not previously announced what
operations would be housed in the new building.
</P>
<P>
   The structure will contain 390,000 square feet of office space
and was designed by Aldo Rossi, a prominent architect who died last
year. Those plans called for colors and design consistent with the
art-deco theme of most buildings on the lot.

<P>
   BEIJING _ In his global vision, it seems, Bill Clinton ranks
right up there with Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon will ever be revered here for reviving ties between the
United States and the formerly isolated China. Now, in the days
before Clinton arrives for his first state visit to China, he is
being lionized in the official press and among elements of the
intelligentsia as a far-sighted statesman who had the wisdom to
change course with China, shifting from his initial attack stance
to his current policy of close engagement.
</P>
<P>
   It's a politician's dream: newspapers, magazines, and television
shows are showing a deep fascination with Clinton the political
leader, dissecting his recent speeches on China policy and
extolling his courage in the face of the China-haters who are
trying to derail the emerging ``strategic partnership'' between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
   One newspaper ran a large picture of the president in a suit of
armor, while Chinese journalists who visited Arkansas reveled in
Clinton's record as governor in promoting education, not
Whitewater. (So far, oddly, there has been relatively little
attention to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who will accompany him on the
visit that begins on Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   The adulation of Clinton was evident on Tuesday afternoon at the
monthly salon of the XSH Book Club, in its headquarters in the
middle of a park in northwest Beijing. The directors of the club _
which markets books at a discount to its thousands of members
through catalogues and seminars like Tuesday's _ assembled foreign
policy experts and a few dozen Chinese journalists and book lovers
to discuss three major American titles recently published in
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Clinton's ``Between Hope and History: Meeting
America's Challenges for the 21st Century'' (Random House, 1996),
the manifesto of his second administration written with William
Nothdurft. This month, the book went into its second printing in
China after the first several tens of thousands sold out. (``Not
quite a `Titanic','' said the book club editor, Xi Hong, ``but a
consistent top-seller over the last year.'')
</P>
<P>
   The second featured title, just published here this week after a
rush translation job, was Monica Crowley's new memoir, ``Nixon in
Winter'' (Random House, 1998). The third was Henry Kissinger's 1994
tome ``Diplomacy'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), which appeared in Chinese
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever American critics may have made of the Clinton book and
Ms. Crowley's deferential memoir of the former president who took
her under his wing in his final years, the assembled professors
here treated these works seriously, as offering insight into the
men who made today's emerging Chinese-American partnership
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Qian Wenrong, deputy director of the Xinhua World Issues
Research Institute, noted that by the time Clinton published his
book, he had already made his momentous shift in China policy, and
recognized the leading role China will play in world affairs in the
next century. Back in the 1970s, Qian said, Nixon too had
presciently seen how the world system was changing, and China's
inevitable rise.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yizhou of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences called the
Nixon book ``excellent, a reminder of how far-sighted the man
was.'' Kissinger's book he declared a classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kissinger book is very deep,'' he said, ``but I like the
Clinton book better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jia Qingguo, a political scientist at Beijing University who
spent several years in the United States, was less taken with the
books per se, but noted that through Clinton's book, and his rags
to riches story, Chinese could better understand the American
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth scholar, Huang Annian, a historian at Beijing Normal
University, listed the three most important American presidents
from China's perspective. The first was Franklin D. Roosevelt,
leader during World War II, ``the most glorious period in
Chinese-U.S. relations'' as the countries fought together against
Japanese aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The second was Nixon, who set the process in motion that led to
normalized relations. And third was Clinton, who despite concerns
over human rights and other issues has realized that the isolation
of China does not serve America's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three men _ they all have strategic vision,'' Huang
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even greater praise has appeared in the official media.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton gave an interview to visiting Chinese journalists
in Washington last week, an article in The Economic Daily here
said: ``The 40-minute interview was unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``foresight, courage, and insight deeply impressed the
Chinese correspondents,'' the article said.

   ATLANTA _ At least eight children who played in a wading pool in
northwest Atlanta were infected by a potentially lethal strain of
E. coli bacteria, state and local health officials reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the children were said to be suffering from kidney
failure, including Brody Weiss, 3, son of the Atlanta Braves
shortstop Walt Weiss. The boy was reported to be in serious
condition Tuesday at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although tests at the wading pool at White Water Recreation Park
on Saturday revealed chlorine levels below the level adequate to
kill the bacteria strain, E. coli 0157:H7, Virginia Galvin,
director of the Board of Health of Cobb County, Ga., said, ``It
would have been difficult to prevent this.'' She added, ``There is
no evidence to suggest negligence on the part of White Water.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, public health officials in Illinois reported Tuesday
that another form of E. coli bacteria rarely seen in the United
States had sickened more than 4,000 people in the Chicago area. It
was the largest outbreak of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Of 20 people taken to hospitals, most were treated in emergency
rooms for dehydration and released, said Sean McDermott, a
spokesman for the Cook County Department of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of bacteria, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, is
believed to have come from potato salad served by a popular
delicatessen and caterer at more than 530 parties over the weekend
of June 6, which was a busy weekend for graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Cook County health officials are waiting for test results from
the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta,
which are expected to confirm that the bacteria was in the potato
salad, said McDermott, but officials have closed Iwans Deli and
Catering, in suburban Orland Park, Ill., until they can determine
exactly how the food was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   The strain causes a much less serious illness than that of E.
coli 0157:H7, the strain that caused the illnesses at the Atlanta
wading pool. That strain has been linked to the deaths of several
people nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials in Atlanta declined to identify any of the
stricken children, but Brody Weiss' family confirmed that he was
among them. Two other children with kidney failure were in critical
condition at Scottish Rite hospital. No information could be
obtained about the fourth child with kidney failure. All of them
were between the ages of 2 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Health Department has deemed the water at the wading
pool safe for all visitors and the park remains open. Public health
officials do not expect many more cases to surface from the
exposure, which occurred almost two weeks ago, since the E. coli
infection's incubation period is usually three or four days. &QL;

COMMUTERS BRACE FOR NEW WAVE OF CROWDS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 10 days, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
will roll out the biggest discounts in the history of the city's
subway and bus system: a package of monthly, weekly and daily
passes that officials say will draw hundreds of thousands of riders
to a system that is already saturated with passengers attracted by
past fare deals.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say they are ready to handle the extra 100
million trips a year that subway and bus riders are expected to
take with the new passes. But the officials have few concrete plans
to add service _ no new trains have been ordered, and the only
scheduling change they have made is the cancellation of the
traditional summer service cut.
</P>
<P>
   The transit officials said that in the fall, when the full
impact of the passes is felt, they will monitor the flow of
passengers and add service only if needed _ a process that could
take months.
</P>
<P>
   The expected surge in new riders will come on top of a
significant increase in passengers since New York City Transit
began offering discounts: free bus-to-subway transfers last July
and an 11-rides-for-the-price-of-10 bulk discount in January.
Weekday subway ridership for the first four months of 1998 is up by
nearly 400,000 a day compared with the same period in 1996, the
last year for which comparable figures are available _ an 11
percent increase. But the number of trains has increased by only 4
percent during that time, transit officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And the Straphangers Campaign, an advocacy group that released a
report on the state of the subway system Tuesday, said the
situation is even bleaker. The group contends that the transit
agency's own documents show an increase of only 15 trains a day
since 1996, a rise of 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the M.T.A. has no current figures for how crowded its
buses and subways are, the Straphangers analysis found that from
October 1995 to October 1996, a subway commuter's chances of
getting a seat at the height of rush hour fell to 29 percent, from
31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bus ridership, too, spurred by the free transfers, is up by 37
percent since 1996. But while the authority boasts that it has
added 2,300 buses a day since then, that amounts to only a 5
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher P. Boylan, an executive deputy director of the
authority, said that the crowding was generally within the agency's
service guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are there more people on the trains and buses?'' he asked.
``Yes. That's good. But have you heard of any customers who were
unable to use our service because there was no room for them? No.
We're moving huge numbers of people and everybody gets where they
want to go. We don't leave anyone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency expected a fairly gradual increase in
ridership beginning in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Rappaport, staff coordinator for the Straphangers
Campaign, said that providing the bare minimum of service was no
way to introduce the new passes, which will be available starting
July 4 and offer unlimited rides for $63 a month, $17 a week or $4
a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will there be a huge crush in the fall?'' he asked. ``Well,
there's already a crush. The proper response would be to add enough
service so that riders who are already being crushed can more
comfortably get to or from work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many regular commuters on the N train _ ranked last in the
Straphangers Campaign report, which measured frequency,
reliability, cleanliness and crowding _ said last night that they
feared the new passes as much as they looked forward to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very crowded, especially during rush hour, over the
past few months,'' said Raquel Herreros, 48, an editorial assistant
in midtown on her way home to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. ``You can never
even think of getting a seat. People are pushing more to get on the
train. With new cards giving more free rides it's going to be
ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials are expecting only a small surge in ridership
during the summer, when school is out and many commuters are on
vacation. To accommodate it, they canceled the traditional summer
service cut of 5 to 10 percent. But as for fall, Lawrence G.
Reuter, the president of New York City Transit, the M.T.A. arm that
runs the subways and buses, stated in a letter to the parent
agency, ``We have an extensive monitoring program to measure
ridership and will use the information from this program to
determine where and when additional service is required.''

OFFICERS DISCUSSED '94 ARREST BEFORE GIVING STATEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York police officer testified Tuesday that he
and other officers, who had been present at the 1994 incident in
which Officer Francis X. Livoti was accused of using a choke hold
on a Bronx man who later died, met at the police union's
headquarters to discuss the incident before giving statements to
the police or prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony, which suggested that the officers were trying to
coordinate their accounts to support Livoti's contention that he
had not used a choke hold on Anthony Baez, came on the sixth day of
a trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan in which Livoti stands
charged with depriving Baez of his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, a Supreme Court justice in the Bronx
unsealed portions of a deposition that gives more details about a
former supervisor's recommendation in 1991, three years before the
death of Baez, that Livoti be transferred from a Bronx precinct
because of the number of police brutality complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court Tuesday, Officer Anthony Farnan, who was
testifying for the defense, said he had not seen Livoti use a choke
hold, an assertion that has been made by other officers who were at
the scene outside Baez's home on Cameron Place in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination, Farnan acknowledged that he and
four to eight other officers who were at the scene met with their
lawyers in the offices of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association to
discuss the events that occurred on a wintry night in December
1994, when Baez died after a struggle with Livoti.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a police sergeant, William Monahan, testified that he
and Livoti had met at union headquarters to hear Livoti's version
of events before they gave official statements.
</P>
<P>
   Farnan's account expands the number of officers who met after
the incident and appeared to bolster an assertion made last week by
federal prosecutors to the jury that it might hear testimony from
police officers ``who covered up what happened on Cameron Place on
Dec. 22 in order to protect a fellow officer and in order to
protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Livoti's lawyer, Stuart London, who had no comment after court,
told Judge Shira Scheindlin that he expected to rest his case
Wednesday. He says that his client is innocent and that Baez's
death was caused by a severe asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition that was partly unsealed in the Bronx on
Tuesday, William Casey, a former supervisor of Livoti's who is now
a deputy police chief, testified that he had recommended that
Livoti be transferred from the 46th Precinct because of the number
of police brutality complaints against him.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition, which was taken in a pending wrongful death
lawsuit filed against the Police Department by the Baez family,
shows that by 1991 there were 12 complaints against Livoti, of
which nine were assertions that he had used excessive force. &QL;

NEW YORK LACKS POWER TO CURB ILLEGAL MANUFACTURING, OFFICIAL SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN with DAVID ROHDE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after an explosion and fire destroyed what
officials called an illegal storefront furniture shop in Queens and
badly burned five people, the city's buildings commissioner said
Tuesday that there were hundreds of illegal manufacturing
businesses operating in New York, but that city officials lacked
the power to close them quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston Silva, the buildings commissioner, called on the City
Council to grant his agency increased power to close manufacturers
that operate without proper city permits. Current city ordinances
lacked the power to stop the furniture maker from operating in an
area that was not designated for manufacturing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the furniture shop that exploded on Monday afternoon,
R &AMP; N Custom Furniture at 102-26 Jamaica Ave. in Richmond Hill,
were fined in May 1997 for operating a manufacturing business in a
commercial area.
</P>
<P>
   But Silva said current city laws allowed the Buildings
Department to close an illegal manufacturer only if it was
operating in a residential neighborhood. Building officials do not
have the same power in neighborhoods that are designated as
commercial areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In those areas, like the Jamaica Avenue location, the Buildings
Department can only fine an owner for illegal use of the building,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I am proposing is an additional enforcement tool that
would allow us to close up illegal manufacturing facilities in
commercial districts,'' Silva said. ``The goal is not to fine
people or to punish people but to get compliance with the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Silva said he could not say precisely how many illegal
businesses there are in New York City. He said they varied from
furniture manufacturers like the shop in Queens and garment
manufacturers to improper service companies like auto repairing or
metal working concerns. They can be hazardous or merely a nuisance
to their neighborhoods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva said he would ask the City Council to for an ordinance
that would allow the Buildings Department to close dangerous
manufacturers operating in commercial as well as residential areas.
</P>
<P>
   Since a 1994 law allowed the Buildings Department to close
manufacturers in residential neighborhoods, it has closed 257
illegally operated businesses, department officials said. The
department does have the power to ask a judge to close an illegal
business operating in a commercial district, he said. But such a
proceeding, called a nuisance abatement, can take months and is
usually only begun after repeated complaints against the business
have been received, Silva said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can do up to now is give violations that could be paid
or not paid but do not force people to leave,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Buildings Department records, the Queens furniture
shop was fined $800 in a May 1997 hearing and ordered to stop using
the building as a factory by Aug. 11, 1997. Ilyse Fink, the
Buildings Department spokeswoman, said there was no indication in
the department's records that R &AMP; N complied with the order.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the person that city officials identified as the owner
of the building, Yongwattie Betat, were not returned Monday or
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gribbon, a Fire Department spokesman, said fire marshals
still believe that highly flammable fumes from contact cement
workers were improperly using in the basement caused Monday's
explosion and fire. But he said fire marshals were still trying to
determine what ignited the fumes.
</P>
<P>
   An employee of the manufacturer of the contact cement, Pilot
Chemical Co., which is based in Long Island City, said the product
must be used with proper ventilation. The employee, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said the company sold it only to
businesses, not to individuals, because it is so dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sell this to people if they walk in the off the
street,'' the worker said. ``If they brought it in any kitchen and
set it next to a stove, or any flammable thing, they're risking an
explosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the federal Occupational Safety and Health
Administration office and the federal Department of Labor's Wage
and Hour Division said Tuesday that they were investigating whether
the store had been violating federal safe workplace and child labor
regulations. A 15-year-old and 17-year-old apparently working at
the site were among the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond Hill residents complained Tuesday that they warned city
officials more than a year ago that the store was releasing noxious
fumes. And city officials confirmed Tuesday that at least three
city agencies had inspected the store prior to Monday's accident.
</P>
<P>
   In response to complaints of fumes from a woman living in the
apartment above the shop, city buildings inspectors visited the
store on March 11, 1997, and issued the illegal manufacturing
violation that resulted in the $800 May 1997 fine, records show.
But the store remained open.

FEARING LAWSUITS, TEACHERS GROW MORE RETICENT WITH THEIR TOUCHES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a charter school opened last fall in Hoboken, N.J.,
director Lydia Becker warned her small staff of teachers to be
careful not to hug students who do not want to be hugged or
otherwise touched.
</P>
<P>
   The topic has also dominated discussions that Ms. Becker has had
at home with her husband, a third-grade teacher at another school.
So, she was asked recently, when was the last time she hugged a
student at the Elysian Charter School?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, about 10 minutes ago,'' she said, laughing. ``Today was
the last day of school, and the kids were sure gushy-mushy.
Sometimes kids want to be loved. It would be a sad world if we cut
all of that out, especially in early childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's Supreme Court decision that schools may not
be held liable for sexual abuse by a teacher when school officials
were not aware of the offense, teachers and principals everywhere
have been quietly but determinedly changing the way they act toward
their students, touching less, hugging not at all in some schools
and making sure they are not alone with them.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of criminal legal action against them _ and there have
been plenty of cases nationwide _ has left many teachers and
teacher groups wary that a squeeze of the shoulders or a pat on the
back will be misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools tell their teachers during seminars or workshops
not to touch children, under any circumstances. Others make them
aware of what can lead to claims of sexual abuse and train them how
to identify the problem and report it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We advise our members not to touch the children, especially as
the children get older,'' said Karen Joseph, a spokeswoman for the
New Jersey Education Association, the teachers' union in the state.
``We have to be careful because there have been so many false
accusations against teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Joseph knows that the changes are hard for many teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People enter the teaching profession because they like kids,''
she said. ``But we tell them that there are many, many ways to show
positive reinforcement besides touching.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Joel Berger, a teacher for almost 30 years in the New York City
schools, said that all his colleagues have been warned to watch
themselves with students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're told, if you have to have an after-school conference
with a kid, especially with someone of the opposite sex, don't do
it one-on-one if you can help it,'' said Berger, who teaches social
studies at Intermediate School 383 in Brooklyn. ``When you have to
have a conference, keep the door open at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Berger said, if a student wants comfort, he might give
him a handshake or an encouraging look. ``If a child hugs me, I
don't push them away,'' he said. ``But if they're expecting a hug
in return, they usually don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The changes have left some teachers and other educators,
especially those dealing with small children, in a quandary about
whether to follow their nature to nurture or to hold back, possibly
at the cost of alienating a child.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Recchia, a professor of early childhood education at
Teachers College at Columbia University, said teachers of very
young children have to help them with such things as tying their
shoes or putting on their coats. It is easy, and indeed part of the
nurturing, to touch, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child's own learning takes place on a really physical
level,'' she said. ``It is part of our own training in early
childhood to hold when they are hurt, to comfort when they are
upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of somehow removing that from the curriculum is not
something we would even consider,'' she said. ``On the other hand,
the heightened awareness of sexual abuse raises some issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality of claims of sexual abuse has changed the scene for
everyone, she acknowledged. In New York State, Dr. Recchia said,
all teachers must take, as part of their certification, training in
child abuse identification and reporting, and workers at day care
centers and other places with very young children can change a
baby's diaper only in the presence of another worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a heightened sense of suspicion for everyone,''
said Dr. Recchia, who is also the director of Teachers College's
Center for Infants and Parents. ``And that colors your interaction
with a child, if you're constantly thinking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Educators also say some children need hugs more than others, and
sometimes that is determined by their culture, home situation, age
and emotional development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see kids who don't come from loving households, and
sometimes a hug is what they need to boost their self-esteem,''
said Norm Tankiewicz, a teachers union leader in Perth Amboy, N.J.
``But we're living in a very litigation-happy society now. I used
to openly hug my kids, but I don't do that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In special education, in which children are more apt to need
physical contact, the hugging issue comes up in another way.
Michelle Massimi, whose daughter has Down's syndrome and attends a
public school in Fair Lawn, N.J., said that teachers try to help
the children learn appropriate hugging. They have them draw a
circle on a piece of paper, and the names of people it is
appropriate to hug, like mothers and fathers, are written inside,
and those whom it is not appropriate to hug, like strangers, go
outside the circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want children to go up and hug everyone,''
Mrs. Massimi said. ``Some teachers hug the kids more than others.
For some, it's just a way of saying you did a great job. Some
people just like kids. It's still very important for the kids and
the teachers to know that what they're doing is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the Daniel Webster School in Pelham, N.Y., principal Diane
Ramos Kelly said she does not tell teachers not to hug students,
but leaves it to their own professional judgment to discern when
hugs are appropriate and when they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the culture created in each classroom has to be a
nurturing one,'' she said. ``A place where the children can grow
socially, emotionally and academically. Do I think it's sometime
natural for little kids to throw their arms around a teacher? Of
course. The cornerstone of early childhood education involves
touching. You have to tie their shoes, wipe away tears, hold
them.''

LAWYERS CONTEND EVIDENCE WAS MOLDED IN ZODIAC CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In impassioned final arguments Tuesday, lawyers for
the man accused of being the Zodiac killer depicted police
investigators as so desperate to close a case that had haunted them
for six years that they shaped and molded evidence to connect their
client to the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for the defendant, Heriberto Seda, 30, also sought
to discount a confession from Seda as tainted and unlawfully
obtained because, they said, police officers ignored repeated
denials and refusals to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Masters, an assistant district attorney, countered with
what he termed ``an avalanche of evidence'' that included 45
witnesses' testimony and 150 exhibits said to link Seda to the
Zodiac crimes without a doubt. The evidence included fingerprints,
DNA, ballistics and handwriting samples. Seda's lawyers did not
call any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The trial in State Supreme Court in Queens, which lasted six
weeks, was turned over to the jury for deliberation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman who came to be known as the Zodiac terrorized the
city in 1990 and again in 1992 and 1993 when he randomly shot at
people and sent letters to police and to news organizations
promising to kill one person for each of the 12 signs of the
Zodiac.
</P>
<P>
   Seda is accused of killing three people and wounding one in
Queens. He has also been charged with shooting three people in
Brooklyn and one in Manhattan. If convicted in the Queens case, he
faces a maximum of 83 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Although the courtroom has largely been empty throughout the
trial, with Seda's mother appearing only a few times, the room was
packed Tuesday with members of the prosecutor's office, including
Queens District Attorney Richard Brown. ``This was a case that
captured the imagination of the entire city,'' Brown said. ``And
hopefully when the jury comes in, it will close that chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the scene at the station house of the 75th Precinct
in East New York, Brooklyn, where Seda was first linked to the
Zodiac crimes in 1996, John Wallenstein, one of Seda's lawyers,
said the squad room was ``wall to wall'' with police chiefs eager
to see an end to one of the city's most notorious unsolved crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think that's a lot of pressure for the detectives?''
he said. ``With all that brass in the next room, failure was not an
option.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Wallenstein and the other defense lawyer, David
Bart, said that ``failure was not an option'' for police
investigators and experts who, the lawyers asserted, felt obliged
to say that the fingerprints, DNA and handwriting of the Zodiac
killer matched Seda's.
</P>
<P>
   The experts were merely offering their opinions, Wallenstein
said. ``They've decided he's the Zodiac and that's what the puzzle
looks like,'' he said. ``And if the pieces don't fit, then you've
got to trim them a little bit to make them fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Seda, known as Eddie, was arrested in June 1996 in the shooting
of his half-sister, of whose friends he was said to disapprove.
Police tied Seda to the Zodiac slayings when they noticed that he
signed his confession to shooting his half-sister with the Zodiac
killer's familiar symbol, a circle with an overlapping cross and
three sevens surrounding the cross.
</P>
<P>
   Bart said that once that link was made, police detectives set
out to ``badger'' a confession out of Seda. The lawyer said that
during 20 hours of interrogation, Seda repeatedly said, ``I'm not
the man,'' and, ``I don't have to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   And though Seda refused to sign a card saying he was willing to
answer questions, Bart said, detectives persisted with a variety of
tactics to wear him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask yourselves, did Eddie Seda invoke his right to remain
silent, and whether that right was trampled on,'' Bart said to the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   But Masters, the prosecutor, said that the confession was not
only voluntary but ``almost proudly announced'' and that Seda was
told four times of his rights to remain silent and to have a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Masters produced a huge color-coded chart for the jurors listing
each of the crimes and the evidence that linked Seda to them. ``I
submit that each of these pieces of evidence alone would prove that
he is the Zodiac,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that if detectives were so bent on coercing a
confession out of Seda, they would not have included information
that was inconsistent with the evidence. For example, Seda's
statement says he both shot and stabbed one of his victims, when
only stab wounds were found on the victim. &QL;

BRONX DEMOCRATIC OFFICIALS AT ODDS OVER SECRET TAPES
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic
Party chairman, demanded Tuesday that former state Sen. Pedro
Espada Jr. release secretly recorded tapes on which Espada says
Democratic officials are heard planning to undermine his campaign
to recapture his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Espada has said he recorded his meetings with Ramirez and other
officials in the spring. During those meetings, Espada claims,
Ramirez said he would ask District Attorney Robert Johnson to call
off an investigation into the finances of a health clinic operated
by Espada if the former senator withdrew his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ramirez said, ``I demand that Mr. Espada release
all recordings to myself, to the press and to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Espada announced June 12 that he would run for the seat he lost
two years ago. A week later, he was indicted along with two
employees on charges of illegally diverting $221,000 in Medicaid
money to his failed 1996 re-election campaign and to that of his
son Pedro Gautier Espada, who was then an assemblyman and is now a
city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Ramirez said Espada ``is trying to portray
himself as a victim hoping that he will distract people from
focusing on the charge that he embezzled more than $200,000 to run
his failed re-election campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Espada released a secretly videotaped
conversation that took place on May 23 between his son and state
Sen.David Rosado. On that tape, Rosado boasted of the Democratic
Party's ability to influence Johnson to drop the investigation if
Espada pledged not to run against him.
</P>
<P>
   Espada maintains that he also has audiotapes on which various
Democratic officials, including Ramirez, suggest that Johnson's
office was collaborating with Ramirez and other Democratic leaders
to keep Espada out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Ramirez said he met with Espada six times
between March and early June. ``I will not allow anyone to suggest
that I have tried to illegally influence the criminal justice
system in any way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Espada said, ``I have never been good
at following Ramirez's orders, and I'm not going to start now.''
</P>
<P>
   Espada added that he plans to release all of the tapes over the
next several months ``to journalists and to law enforcement
officials who have expressed interest in them.'' He said the pace
of the release would depend on the advice he received from his
lawyers and from investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Espada said state and Federal investigators had listened to
several of the tapes, but he declined to identify them. He said he
had tapes of ``several dozen conversations'' with a number of
Democratic officials in the Bronx. The conversations in their
entirety, Espada said, make it clear that Bronx Democratic
officials had urged him to make a deal with Ramirez to refrain from
seeking office.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Ramirez has insisted that there never was a deal with
Espada, Johnson has said political considerations have never played
a role in his office's investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Espada's allegations have rocked the political landscape
in the Bronx and created the most serious crisis for Ramirez since
he became party chairman four years ago. Under Ramirez's
stewardship, Democratic politics in the Bronx have largely avoided
the scandals of previous years, which led to convictions of party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several Bronx politicians and political strategists
maintain that the indictment and the tapes have placed a blemish
not only on Espada but also on the borough's Democratic
organization. They suggest that Espada's allegations against
Johnson and Ramirez might resonate with many voters because the
party worked vigorously last year on the successful campaign of
Dianne Renwick, who is Johnson's wife, to become a Bronx Civil
Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez complained Tuesday that the allegations had begun to
tarnish his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For four years, I have worked to raise the level of discourse
and openness in this county,'' Ramirez said in an interview. ``I
have walked a very straight line. Mr. Espada, with his despicable
action, has put into question four years of hard labor. It's a pure
political attempt to jaundice the indictment that was brought
against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Gautier Espada, Espada's son, said Tuesday that his family
and their supporters planned to hold a candlelight vigil ``calling
for justice'' Thursday evening outside the catering hall where the
Bronx Democratic Party will be holding its annual dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Espada's brother Jose R. Espada is running for the Assembly seat
held by Ruben Diaz Jr., another Bronx Democrat. And the younger
Espada is running against Rosado for district leader.

GIULIANI TAKES THE UNFLATTERING COMPARISONS IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In satire and in protest, the mayor of the City of
New York is again being likened to some of the vilest figures in
history. But this time Rudolph Giuliani is learning to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   At the Legislative Correspondents Association's annual follies
in Albany this month, Gov. George Pataki and his staff staged a
``High Noon'' skit that lampooned many of the state's prominent
political figures. One joke referred to the ``mean old mayor down
the road who got the trains to run on time,'' a reference to Benito
Mussolini, the Fascist dictator.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, a Daily News editorial cartoon depicted a
shrunken woman with a swastika armband standing at the door to the
emergency command center that the mayor plans to build in lower
Manhattan. ``Uh, Rudy,'' the caption said, ``there's an Eva Braun
to see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, such comparisons _ and there were more than a few _
sent the mayor and his aides into apoplexy. But he and his aides
have come to view the comparisons as a perverse validation of his
aggressive approach toward molding the city into a Gotham of order
and glitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten used to it,'' Giuliani said in an interview
Tuesday. ``At first you get very offended by it, but after a while
I learned that it's part of the political debate these days. The
way they marginalize you is by the grossest and most absurd
analogies that people can come up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro goes so far as to detect a touch of
flattery in the Giuliani-as-dictator analogies. ``A lot of the same
kind of stereotyping was done by the press and political opponents
when Fiorello La Guardia was mayor,'' he said, referring to one of
La Guardia's nicknames as the ``midget Mussolini.'' ``And he was
one of the greatest mayors in history.''
</P>
<P>
   His brief political career suggests that Giuliani has become
less concerned with loathsome analogies as he has grown more
comfortable with his message, a progressive form of Republicanism,
he has called it, that combines putting welfare recipients to work
with championing gay rights. And it is also possible that he has
gradually learned to try to contain the insults by responding
coolly.
</P>
<P>
   But he wasn't always so tolerant, or so naive as to ignore the
political value of expressing outrage, especially during campaigns.
Few in New York politics have forgotten the painful lesson learned
by Robert Abrams, then the attorney general, after he called Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato a fascist toward the end of the 1992 senatorial
campaign. D'Amato framed the comment as an inexcusable anti-Italian
slur, and went on to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks before he was elected in 1993, Giuliani lashed out
at supporters of his opponent, Mayor David Dinkins, for saying that
his camp contained fascist elements. ``They then went on to
elaborate that I was surrounded with people like Hitler, Mussolini
and Franco,'' he said at the time. ``I don't regard associations of
my people that support me as fascists as a light matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And when a City Council member accused the mayor of wanting ``to
be another Mussolini,'' his communications director, Cristyne
Lategano, described the insult in the most personal terms. ``It
cuts deep, it's very painful, it hurts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In recalling his first term Tuesday, the mayor said that the
dictator analogies were particularly prevalent when he was
relentlessly pushing for the ouster of Ramon Cortines as schools
chancellor. ``But it's ultimately the results that matter,'' he
said. ``Now, several years later, the schools are a lot better
under Rudy Crew,'' Cortines' successor.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons resurfaced this year when he stepped up his
``quality of life'' campaign. He went after jaywalkers, issued a
call for urban civility, regulated the sidewalk space used by
street artists and reined in taxi drivers. And while the city's
collective head was still spinning from his very public fight with
cabdrivers, the mayor's Street Vendor Review Panel proposed tough
restrictions on where street peddlers could operate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration soon suspected that the mayor ran the risk of
being seen as a bully. A poll conducted in early June by the
television station NY1 showed that a growing number of city
residents _ 45 percent, up from 36 percent in February _ thought
that the mayor had an abrasive style that made it difficult for
city government to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over that perception, aides say, is partly why the city
administration recently postponed putting the new street
restrictions into effect. Giuliani said that none of his recent
proposals were ``done in a bullying way,'' but also acknowledged
that his panel is ``trying to come up with a more moderate
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, protesters began carrying posters depicting the
mayor with a Hitlerian mustache and peek-a-boo bangs. The City
Council speaker, Peter Vallone, accused him of being a power-crazed
chief executive. The Rev. Calvin Butts III, a prominent Baptist
minister from Harlem, called the mayor a racist whose policies were
moving the city toward ``a fascist state.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, like a gift from the gods of satire, came the recent news
that the mayor and his staff planned to build a $15 million command
center to protect them from terrorism and natural disasters.
Whatever merits the center might have were lost in its immediate
depiction as a ``bunker,'' a term that brings to mind the last days
of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that the Eva Braun cartoon or the crack about
making the trains run on time would have been attempted in
reference to Bill Clinton, or Newt Gingrich, or Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. Only, it seems, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that he attributed the Pataki administration's
train joke to the silliness of the event. ``I've done those skits,
and if everybody took them seriously, I'd be in a lot of trouble.''
And he called the Eva Braun joke ``the most absurd, based on no
reality at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, it bothers the people around you more than it
bothers you because you've seen it before,'' he said. ``The end
result of that particular controversy is that two years from now,
the city is going to have an emergency management center. And when
I leave office, I bet you that's one of the things that I'll be
commended for.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Russianoff, a senior attorney for the New York Public
Interest Research Group who frequently criticizes the mayor's
policies, said that comparing Giuliani to Hitler and Mussolini
``are way over the top and not deserved in the context of municipal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You'll never hear them from me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Russianoff said that the mayor's actions, such as blocking
cabdrivers from Manhattan last month because he suspected they were
planning to shut down the city, are heavy handed and reflective of
his earlier career as a prosecutor. There is also the mayor's
style, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor himself has debased public discourse by calling
people stupid, silly and ignorant, and by questioning people's
integrity and motives,'' he said. ``So you inherit the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani's aides and supporters say they are not alarmed by
the analogies, because the polling results they see indicate that
the Republican's approval rating, citywide and nationally, is
exceptionally high. They dismiss the unflattering comparisons as
cheap shots from the media elite and bitter Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media and certain adversaries smirk and wink and assume
that people share this underlying sense that's very negative,''
said Jay Severin, a consultant to Republicans. ``And then lo and
behold, voters aren't in on the joke. And guess what? He keeps
winning elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the administration has also learned to respect the fine
line between perceptions of an aggressive mayor and those of a
bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an odd thing with very strong executives,'' said Norman
Adler, a consultant mostly to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either love the fact that they're very, very strong
because you benefit,'' he said, ``or you hate that they're very,
very strong because you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``One man's Hitler is another man's Abraham Lincoln.'' &QL;

STEINBRENNER PLAYS DOWN UPCOMING MET SERIES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner, the ultracompetitive principal
owner of the New York Yankees, said Tuesday that his team's
three-game series against the New York Mets next weekend really
wasn't that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said it at 4:20 p.m., at Yankee Stadium, in the middle of the
Yankees' clubhouse. There were many witnesses. It should be noted
that his right hand was at his side. Should the Yankees fall behind
the Mets in the fist inning on Friday night, it will be the owner's
prerogative to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hype that is being generated about this series _ to me,
that's for the city championship,'' Steinbrenner said. ``I'm more
concerned with getting to the world's championship.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the Yankees lose two of three games to the Mets, it isn't
important? ``No,'' Steinbrenner said. ``What does it mean? I'm not
bitter against the Mets. They have a very good team; I'm happy for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories of Steinbrenner's reacting angrily to exhibition losses
against the Mets are legendary. Maybe the defeats galled him in his
early years as the Yankees' owner, conceded Steinbrenner, who has
owned the team for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe early on, in the first years,'' he said. ``I didn't want
to lose to anybody. I thought you could go undefeated, when I first
came into baseball. I had a hard time understanding you can't go
undefeated in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, my focus is entirely on October and getting the
New York Yankees into the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at length, Steinbrenner discussed many matters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Chili Davis, the designated hitter who is coming back from
surgery on his ankle, is ``working very hard'' in Tampa, Fla.,
Steinbrenner said. ``You'd hardly recognize him.'' Steinbrenner
said Davis' weight has dropped to 232 pounds from about 245.
``Chili challenges me,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He works out twice a
day so he can catch me on one of the days I work out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steinbrenner said Bernie Williams, who is coming back from a
sprained knee, is getting close to returning; others in the
Yankees' organization continue to hope Williams will rejoin the
lineup this weekend. ``Bernie wants back bad,'' Steinbrenner said.
``He's working very hard down there _ very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steinbrenner is impressed by the 1998 Yankees, who have won 51
of their first 69 games. ``In the Reggie-Munson-Chambliss era,
there was a little difference, a little bit of turmoil, but they
were champions and they won back to back,'' Steinbrenner said,
referring to the 1977 and 1978 teams featuring Reggie Jackson,
Thurman Munson and Chris Chambliss that won World Series titles.
``This team is very focused. I've never had a team any more focused
than these guys, on a game-to-game basis.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steinbrenner, who is trying to get a new stadium, acknowledged
that he was surprised by the crowd of some 53,000 in the Bronx on
Monday night for the first game of the interleague series with the
Atlanta Braves. But he noted the difficulty some fans had in
getting to Yankee Stadium and parking, citing his own experience.
Steinbrenner flew into Newark and drove to the stadium, winding
through the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough, but I saw what some of these people have to go
through to get to the games,'' Steinbrenner said. ``You have to
love the Yankees to do that, and they do, and I give them credit.
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper. I pulled up alongside one
wagon full of kids and the driver. I could tell they were all upset
_ they all had their Yankees hats on. I rolled down the window and
said, `Don't worry, they ain't starting until I get there.' They
didn't have any idea who I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Word was later relayed to Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, that
Steinbrenner had played down the importance of the series against
the Mets. ``That's what he tells you,'' Torre said, grinning
slightly as he walked away from a crowd of reporters.

TALENTED BALLPLAYERS CAN BE FOUND IN CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reggie didn't need a last name. Junior doesn't need a
name at all. El Duque is just El Duque to so many people that some
don't even know he has a name.
</P>
<P>
   When he made his fourth start for the Yankees against the
Atlanta Braves at Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night, Orlando
Hernandez was not the name emanating from the throats of the crowd
of 54,775. The fans cheered for El Duque, or just plain Duque, the
remarkable Cuban expatriate who has become an instant honorary
citizen of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, however, were not the only people at the Stadium who
had arrived eager to see El Duque make the fourth start of his
major league career.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before El Duque threw his first pitch, Leo Mazzone, the
Braves' pitching coach, sat on the top step of the visitors' dugout
and said: ``I'm looking forward to seeing him pitch. They say he
has a lot of motion and good control, a lot of different arm
angles. It's kind of refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mazzone saw, though, was not the El Duque of his first
three starts. His form was the same all right, but his control and
his effectiveness were not and he suffered his first major league
loss in a 7-2 Braves victory. Hernandez did not survive the fourth
inning, leaving after he issued two consecutive bases-loaded walks
and gave up a two-run single to Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a highlight here and there,'' Jones, the Braves' third
baseman, had said before facing El Duque. ``He throws strikes and
changes speeds a lot. We have to come out and be aggressive, and
hopefully some balls will fall in for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Braves' hitters were aggressive, swinging at El
Duque's pitches early in the count. Ryan Klesko singled on the
second pitch he saw in the second inning, and Michael Tucker sent
him home later in the inning with a first-pitch single.
</P>
<P>
   The two-run single by Jones that finished El Duque's night came
on the first pitch, too. Others took many pitches as El Duque went
to three-ball counts six times in the third and fourth innings.
</P>
<P>
   This was the El Duque who had dazzled Tampa Bay, Montreal and
Cleveland, allowing 4 runs and 23 base runners in 23 and two-thirds
innings. That was why he took a 2-0 record and a 1.52 earned run
average into his meeting with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi, one of the Yankees' catchers, attributed El Duque's
early success to ``his location and the many different arm angles
he can give a hitter and still make quality pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi added: ``Hitters aren't able to see a lot of the same
arm angles consistently. It's like facing a different pitcher every
time at bat. It makes it tough on hitters. He can change any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his mind he knows how to pitch. He knows what he's doing.
He changes pitch to pitch. Maybe a couple pitches the same way and
then he'll change. He knows what he's doing out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Girardi thought for a moment and added, ``It must have been hard
for amateurs.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to the players around the world who encountered El
Duque in international tournaments, no professionals allowed. Those
matches often were mismatches.
</P>
<P>
   If Mark Grudzielanek, the Expos shortstop, could go hitless in
three at-bats, striking out twice, what was a kid from Taiwan
supposed to do?
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of El Duque and Rolando Arrojo, the Devil
Rays' nine-game winner, and shortstop Rey Ordonez, the Mets' human
highlight film, it is clear what an impact Cubans would have had on
the major leagues the past 40 years if they had been allowed to
leave their country to work elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``From one end of Cuba to the other,'' said Jose Valdivielso, a
former Cuban major leaguer and now a New York sportscaster,
``they've got thousands and thousands of Duques and Ordonezes,
great ballplayers who if given an opportunity would fill the major
leagues. But they don't have the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdivielso, who left Cuba in 1960, during his major league
career with the Washington Senators and Minnesota Twins, said he
was sure ``a lot of scouts'' would go to Cuba if Castro unlocked
the borders and allowed the baseball-hungry youngsters to seek
fortunes in America.
</P>
<P>
   That is an understatement. It would be the modern baseball
version of the gold rush, scouts from every organization flocking
to Havana and all of the island's tiny towns as well. If the
Dominican Republic and Venezuela are fast becoming the most fertile
hunting grounds for American scouts, Cuba would be Shangri-La.
</P>
<P>
   You like El Duque? Make sure you see those 15-year-olds with the
wicked curves. You like Ordonez? Check out those players who make
him look as if he had limited range. If only the Cuban commissioner
named Castro would accept reality and let his people go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our scouts who saw those teams said so many could play in the
big leagues right now,'' said Bobby Cox, the Braves' manager.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American teams and fans settle for the advance guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's zippy quick,'' Cox said of El Duque. ``Not fast, but
sneaky, and those are the toughest guys to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the manager thought about El Duque's saga. ``Fleeing an
island, a dictatorship and two months later you're pitching in
Yankee Stadium,'' he said. ``It's quite a story.'' &QL;

ENVIRONMENTAL ENTREPRENEUR CLOSES A DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fortunately for Tom Fox, the story of his little
yellow water taxis no longer works as a perfect metaphor for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the boats were supposed to have been buzzing around the
waterfront several times a day, moving people to various stops from
the Brooklyn Bridge to the Intrepid museum, but Fox had to shut
down the whole enterprise in August after only three months because
the boats didn't have enough power to navigate the harbor. New
York's currents proved too much for them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what a halfway imaginative biographer could make of this
detail if Fox were still the blue-jeaned environmentalist of his
youth, hopelessly proselytizing for more green space in the city of
mortar, writing position papers on the importance of community
gardens. But Fox makes money these days as an environmental and
development consultant, wears a tie to work (some days), and last
week watched a longtime dream come true when the state and city
finally agreed on how to build and operate a pulsating strip of
park along the Hudson River on Manhattan's West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has been crusading for that park for years, including three
as founding president of the Hudson River Park Conservancy, which
drew up the plans for the five-mile park and worked out its
fundamental compromises with the surrounding communities, deciding
when the green of chlorophyll should give way to the green of
economic development. The Pataki administration replaced him in
1995, preferring someone with more direct loyalty to the governor's
staff, but the plan that will now proceed is virtually unchanged
from the one developed by him and his staff, and so the moment is
finally sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it feels like closure,'' he said this week in his
consulting-firm offices at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue. ``We're
actually going to have the largest riverfront park in the United
States right here in river city, and we the people made it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the people, of course. There are still those who oppose
the park as a development grab, environmentalists once on the same
side as Fox in fighting Westway and other large projects around the
city, who now spit out his name in derision as a sellout. In the
never-ending wars that rage between real estate interests and
Manhattan's community boards, he is the necessary go-between,
someone who can talk to both sides but is not trusted fully by
either one.
</P>
<P>
   Marcy Benstock, the implacable (but increasingly marginalized)
foe of Westway and the proposed park, says Fox was never an
environmentalist and calls the park twice as bad as Westway. Gene
Russianoff, senior attorney for the New York Public Interest
Research Group, says he knows of no other advocate in the city as
focused and ferocious as Fox, but fears that the ``develo-park''
will be slowly whittled by economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is frustrating for Fox, who used to lob seeds into
vacant lots as a leader of the Green Guerrillas and remembers with
pride working to stop Mortimer Zuckerman's proposed tower at the
southwest corner of Central Park. He says his colleagues have
become so used to stopping things that they can no longer create
and the Hudson park would never happen without developments like
the Chelsea Piers to pay for its operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're naive,'' he said, windmilling his arms around as if to
shed some of his excess energy. ``In the 21st century, without all
the government funding we used to have, you have to find other ways
to finance and build parks. And if there's any contribution I've
made, it's the idea that parks can be self-financing, so that the
money generated in the park can only go to its design,
construction, management and operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, 51, grew up on Ocean Avenue in Flatbush _ only a few blocks
from the rambling Victorian where he and his wife and son live now
_ and he played in Prospect Park as a boy, but he never cared much
about the spaciousness of nature until he volunteered for the Navy
in Vietnam, serving in combat from 1966 to 1968. Seeing jungles and
marine life up close transformed him, and he came home to study
biology at Brooklyn College and to develop environmental programs
as a ranger in the federal Gateway National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   If the war didn't quite radicalize him, it made him realize the
value of fighting for a cause, and he spent years fighting for
community gardens and open space on various boards and commissions
around the city. But he says there was always a pragmatic aspect as
well. He enlisted the support of construction unions by convincing
them that open space in a city generates development and economic
activity, citing Frederick Law Olmsted's arguments for Central Park
more than a century earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Though some advocates criticize him for trying to cash in on the
planned park with his water taxi plan after being removed from the
conservancy, he says it was a natural way to ``do well by doing
good'' with a service that will benefit the public and, perhaps
someday, his own bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be an environmental entrepreneur here,'' he
said. ``Some environmentalists just call attention to problems. I
come from the group that tries to figure a way to solve those
problems, and as near as I can tell, that almost always involves
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Of which he needs $2 million for boats with a bit more power.

 &HT;    Braves rip Hernandez in 7-2 win
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no drama this time. Round 2? Atlanta, in
Tom Glavine's favorite place: The road.
</P>
<P>
   Despite allowing two homers, Glavine got his 10th win of the
season Tuesday with a 7-2 victory over the Yankees before 54,775 at
Yankee Stadium. In raising his road record this season to 7-0 in
eight road starts, Glavine (10-3) worked eight strong innings and
got lots of help throughout the lineup as Yankees starter Orlando
Hernandez lasted just 3 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen, batting ninth, had two doubles, two key walks and
scored three times. Ryan Klesko, back in the lineup against the
right-handed Hernandez, singled three times and scored twice while
Keith Lockhart had two RBIs. A night earlier, the Braves had
squandered three leads in a 6-4 loss. This time, before another
boisterous Bronx crowd and in their first look at ``El Duque''
Hernandez, there was no bullpen trepidation for the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban defector and older brother of the Marlins' Livan
Hernandez, El Duque won his first two starts after being called up
from the minors before getting a no-decision last Thursday. He got
some early help Tuesday: Derek Jeter's opposite-field, first-inning
homer for a 1-0 Yankee lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves tied it in the second on three straight one-out hits.
After the first of Klesko's three straight singles, Javy Lopez
doubled into the right field corner. Michael Tucker singled in
Klesko, then took second on the throw home. But on Andruw Jones'
fly to fairly shallow right, Tucker was doubled off when Tino
Martinez cut off the throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen then drew vital walks in each of the next two innings.
After walking to lead off the third, he took third base on a single
to right by Curtis Pride, leading off as Bobby Cox's left-handed
designated hitter. Guillen then scored on Lockhart's slow roller.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta broke it open in the fourth inning. After Klesko's
leadoff single, Lopez just missed a third-deck homer before
walking. When Scott Brosius booted Andruw Jones' grounder, the
bases were loaded. Guillen fell behind 1-2, then took three
straight balls just off the outside corner to score Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez then walked Pride on a full-count fastball that forced
in another run. El Duque fanned Lockhart but Chipper Jones struck a
two-out single to center to score two and make it 6-1.

APPEALS COURT DISMISSES WINDOWS 95 INJUNCTION  
 BY JULIA ANGWIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - MICROSOFT   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Microsoft won a short-lived legal triumph _ and sparked hopes of a
long-term victory _ against federal antitrust enforcers yesterday
when a federal appeals court overturned an injunction against
Windows 95.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ruling will become moot tomorrow when Microsoft launches the
successor to Windows 95 _ the Windows 98 operating system _ at a
party in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the U.S. Court of Appeals decision bodes
poorly for the government's separate lawsuit against Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an uphill battle for the government,'' said Sam
Miller, a San Francisco attorney who led the anti-Microsoft case at
the Justice Department four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused Microsoft stock to soar $4.94 to an all-time
high of $100.75 and boosted the value of Microsoft chief executive
Bill Gates' holdings by $2.7 billion to $54.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts cautioned investors against irrational
exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' said David Readerman, analyst at
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. ``But it gives Microsoft some
support for its September 8 trial (on Windows 98).''
</P>
<P>
   Government antitrust enforcers are currently battling Microsoft
on two related fronts: Windows 95 and Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   On Windows 95, federal prosecutors accused Microsoft in October
of violating a 1995 antitrust agreement by requiring
computer-makers that want Windows 95 to install Microsoft's Web
browser. In December, a federal judge temporarily barred Microsoft
from forcing computer-makers to accept both products.
</P>
<P>
   On Windows 98, the Justice Department and 20 states accused
Microsoft last month of violating a broader set of federal
antitrust laws by using its monopoly power in operating system
software to muscle its way into the Internet market. A trial is set
for September 8.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's decision by a three-judge panel overturned on
procedural grounds the December preliminary injunction issued by
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson against Windows 95. The panel
unanimously found that Microsoft was not given adequate notice
before the injunction was issued.
</P>
<P>
   That means that in 90 days Microsoft will be free to require
computer-makers to install Internet Explorer with Windows 95.
However, while Microsoft will continue to offer Windows 95,
customers are likely to pick Windows 98 instead.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also unanimously overturned on procedural grounds the
lower court's decision to appoint Harvard law professor Lawrence
Lessig as a ``special master'' to help on the case.
</P>
<P>
   However, the panel stopped short of calling Lessig biased _ a
claim Microsoft made after discovering that the professor had once
written an e-mail that contained anti-Microsoft sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   And the panel split 2 to 1 on the most important part of the
ruling _ the question of whether Microsoft has the right to include
separate products such as its Web browser in the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long argued that it has the right to put anything
it wants in its software _ even a ham sandwich _ if that is what
customers want.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Stephen Williams and Raymond Randolph appeared to
substantiate Microsoft's argument in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine how the ruling could have been better for
Microsoft,'' said Joe Sims, antitrust attorney at Jones Day, Revis
&AMP; Pogue in Washington DC.
</P>
<P>
   In their 38-page decision, the two judges wrote that Microsoft
should be allowed to integrate any two products that work better
together than separately ``regardless of whether ... (they) ... are
marketed separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Patricia Wald wrote in a dissenting opinion that the
benefits of integration should be balanced against evidence that
the two products serve separate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorney William Neukom said he believes the 2-to-1
victory will give ``substantive guidance'' to Judge Jackson, who
must decide later this year whether Windows 98 illegally includes
Microsoft's Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty fatal to the government's case,'' added Charles F.
Rule, a Washington antitrust attorney who consults for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said it was ``disappointed'' with the
appeals court decision and was ``reviewing its options.'' It could
ask the entire &UR;  &LR; District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals to
review the panel's decision or it could appeal directly to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft competitors said it's too soon to count them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real battle will occur ... in September,'' said Mike
Pettit, executive director of ProComp, an anti-Microsoft coalition
based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's just another twist in the protracted legal
battle between the government and the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is a very good day for Microsoft,'' said Rich Gray,
a San Jose antitrust attorney. ``But the Justice Department's
lawsuit is still very much alive.''

ASCEND COMMUNICATIONS IS BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ASCEND   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Alameda-based Ascend Communications is finally living up to its
name again, after costing many investors their shirts in 1997.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year, a free-fall in the data networking company's share
price _ from a high of $78.75 in January to $22.63 in November _
slashed $6 billion off its net worth. This year, however, Ascend's
stock has doubled in price to $48.81 a share, giving it a market
valuation of $10 billion, just below last year's peak of $10.2
billion. (The share price is lower but more shares are outstanding
than last year.) Most analysts now applaud the company's prospects
and suitors are eyeing it hungrily as an acquisition target.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The turnaround reflects Ascend's core strength in the surging
market for data gear aimed at telephone companies and Internet
service providers, who are reengineering their networks to slash
costs and offer new services.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend ``will be one of the most significant infrastructure
suppliers for the explosion in spending on next generation carrier
voice and data networks,'' predicted analysts Chris Stix and Vijay
Rajamani in a report for Cowen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The company is the subject of hot merger speculation,
particularly in the wake of last week's $7 billion takeover of Bay
Networks by Northern Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Fabbi, an analyst with the Gartner Group, said of Ascend,
``they have a lot of value and deliver strong solutions, but are
they truly big enough to stay independent? Ultimately, we think
tier-two vendors (like Ascend) will disappear. Ascend's stock has
gone way up on acquisition rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts have picked telecommunications equipment giant
Lucent Technologies as the most likely buyer. Last week, Bloomberg
Business News reported that Swedish telecom equipment supplier
Ericsson was in merger talks with Ascend. On Monday, however,
Ericsson suggested it was looking for smaller acquisitions,
knocking Ascend's price down a couple of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend has prospered recently while many other networking
companies _ Cisco Systems excepted _ have floundered. Bay and 3Com
Corp., which both have more revenue but lower market caps than
Ascend, have suffered ruthless price competition in the corporate
networking market.
</P>
<P>
   But Ascend is strong in the less cut-throat public network
market, selling to companies like AT&AMP;T and WorldCom that build
Internet backbones and other data networks to connect homes and
offices to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Ascend has long been a leading seller of ``remote access''
devices, which let Internet service providers or corporations take
incoming calls from computer modems. In the past few months, Ascend
has won an impressive string of contracts to sell data switching
equipment to some of America's hottest telecommunications
companies, including Qwest Communications International, LCI
International, GTE Internetworking and Williams Cos. These carriers
are using advanced fiber optics to carry voice, video and data
together over high-speed networks, slashing operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental shift in the market is that data now accounts
for more than 50 percent of traffic on many networks,'' said Hassan
Ahmed, vice president of Ascend. ``Customers are now thinking about
building their network first and foremost for data, then letting
voice ride along. This wave plays to Ascend's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Ascend's switches let carriers set priorities for what kinds of
traffic get through the network first, a critical feature so voice
conversations can arrive uninterrupted by bursts of data carried
over the same pipe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While Ascend is on the upswing today, investors who've stuck
with the stock have ridden a wild roller coaster worthy of the new
Invertigo ride at Great America in Santa Clara. Founded in 1989,
Ascend originally focused on remote-access equipment to handle
long-distance video-conferencing. But it quickly shifted to ride
the Internet tidal wave with its dial-up remote access gear.
</P>
<P>
   Investors entranced by the Internet fell in love with Ascend as
its equipment found a home in nearly every large ISP. It went
public in 1994 at a split-adjusted price of about $1.60, then
rocketed to a speculative peak of almost $80 early last year. Then
fickle investors soured on the entire networking industry,
hammering Ascend along with blue chips like Cisco. Ascend's decline
accelerated in April 1997 after it announced plans to swallow
Massachusetts-based Cascade Communications in a $3 billion stock
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Matters only grew worse last summer when Ascend tossed too many
buggy new products on the market, forcing embarrassing recalls and
shipping delays. It had particular problems getting its remote
access equipment to work with the new breed of 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Ascend's earnings per share were up only
a dismal 6.3 percent (not counting acquisition-related charges).
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say Ascend has since refocused the company, putting
in place a rigorous new quality control systems. ``They've had no
snafus since last summer,'' said Deb Mielke of TeleChoice. ``They
are being conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Cascade _ a company Cisco had eyed for its
own portfolio _ als has proven a winner, accounting for Ascend's
big data switch contracts with major carriers this year.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, Ascend also got a boost when its shares joined the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index. Ascend's stock rose 2 to 49, as index
fund managers added it to their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   But Ascend still faces major challenges _ reflected in the fact
that 8 percent of its shares were held by short-sellers last month.
An awesome array of competitors, including giants such as Lucent,
Nortel and Cisco, are all vying for Ascend's major customers.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco recently announced new equipment aimed directly at
Ascend's high-end switches. UBS Securities predicts they will
``provide some very stiff competition for Ascend.'' But Cisco won't
ship its products for several months. Until Cisco delivers, Ascend
officials say they aren't too worried. ``We maintain a healthy
sense of paranoia about Cisco, but don't think they are a strong
carrier player,'' said Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
   Nortel's purchase of Bay Networks doesn't much concern Ascend
either. Bay's strength lies within corporate networks where Ascend
isn't a player, said Bob Machlin, vice president of marketing at
Ascend. But Lucent and Nortel both purchased network equipment
companies last year that could put competitive pressure on Ascend's
core remote-access products. For now, though, Ascend remains the
clear market leader in that segment.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is a wild card. Its economic woes have hurt Ascend's sales,
but not catastrophically. Ascend does most of its overseas sales in
Europe, where business is booming.
</P>
<P>
   While the signs look good for the Alameda company today, wise
investors know its stock remains a gamble, given the volatility and
intense competition in its industry. As a recent analysis by J. P.
Morgan's William Rabin noted, ``Ascend's business prospects are as
promising as they have ever been.'' But with just one slip up,
``investor confidence could once again be shattered, as we believe
that its current strength is still paper thin.''

SAMPSON: JOB OFFERS AWAIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Steve Sampson's future remains uncertain with
the U.S. national soccer team in the wake of its World Cup failure,
but that's not to say he's refusing to look at his options.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. coach, who lives in Agoura Hills, has acknowledged
there are others interested in what he can provide if U.S. Soccer
is not. But U.S. Soccer has not made any public declarations about
who might guide its top team after it returns from France.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, U.S. Soccer's president, said before Sunday's
2-1 loss to Iran, which ended the Americans' chances to reach the
second round, he envisioned Sampson remaining in charge. After the
match, he wasn't so specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be replaced during the tournament (such as
Saudi Arabia's Carlos Alberto Parreira and South Korea's Cha
Bum-kun), that's for sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a vote of confidence. Sensing that, Rothenberg added:
``As I was watching the game, I was thinking if there was something
I would've done differently. And I couldn't think of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who took charge in April 1995 after Bora Milutinovic
was fired, wasn't U.S. Soccer's first choice. Portugal's Carlos
Queiroz turned down an invitation and so did Parreira, who guided
Brazil to the 1994 title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said the Americans achieved their most pressing goals in
this tournament, demonstrating to the world they can play the sport
with a certain level of prowess and sophistication. He's repeatedly
said it is important an American be coach of the squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gained enormous international experience,'' he said.
``I'm one of two coaches out of 40 in North and Central America to
have survived this process. That experience is very rare and hard
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope U.S. Soccer will want to continue to use that
experience. If not, I've already had offers the last six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what kind of offers, whether from foreign national teams
or Major League Soccer clubs, he replied: ``International offers.
It wouldn't be right for MLS to make offers at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been speculation Sampson might become head coach of
the San Jose Clash once the sale of the team to a group headed by
Rothenberg is finalized. Rothenberg, when asked about that, said he
wasn't sure Sampson would be the Clash's coach because ``that would
mean he's no longer'' coaching the national team.
</P>
<P>
   If U.S. Soccer decides his tenure is over _ and a strong
performance against Yugoslavia here Thursday might convince
officials otherwise _ there are several coaches waiting in the
wings. Queiroz would have been the most likely, but he resigned as
the federation's technical director last week to accept the
national-team job with United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Parreira, who like Queiroz coached the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars, is available, and three American coaches also are in
the pool:
</P>
<P>
   __ Clive Charles, an English-born assistant to Sampson and the
U.S. Olympic coach, who also is in charge of the men's and women's
programs at the University of Portland.
</P>
<P>
   __ Thomas Rongen, the Dutch-born coach of the New England
Revolution, also a Sampson assistant.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bruce Arena, who has guided D.C. United to the first two MLS
titles after leading the University of Virginia to five NCAA crowns
in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Arena is widely considered the best coach in America, but he is
arrogant and has made enemies within the federation. ``He'll never
be the U.S. coach as long as the (current regime) is in charge,''
one U.S. Soccer official said.

WIN 98 WON'T BE ANOTHER WIN 95 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - WINDOWS 98   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prospects for Windows 98, which goes on sale tomorrow, pale by
comparison with the phenomenal success of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But before you start feeling sorry for Bill Gates, consider
this: Windows 98 is still expected to be the best-selling new
software of the year, and one of the top hits in any
consumer-product category.
</P>
<P>
   As the latest version of the operating software that runs most
of the world's personal computers, Windows 98 can't possibly miss.
International Data Corp. estimates that Microsoft will sell 12.8
million copies by year-end.
</P>
<P>
   But by comparison, some 19.5 million copies of Windows 95 were
sold in just four months after its release in August of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Why the ``modest'' forecast for Windows 98? Analysts say it's
because the software is just a modest upgrade with the same look
and feel as Windows 95 and no new killer features.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't really a very big product,'' said analyst Eric
Brown of Forrester Research. ``It's bug fixes, a couple of nice new
features and Internet Explorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95, on the other hand, was a radical new piece of
software that redefined the way users interact with PCs. In
addition, the computer industry badly needed Windows 95, which
ushered in a new generation of faster applications and powerful
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 will make it easier for PCs to run the latest
hardware, such as DVD drives, but there is no sense of urgency
attending its introduction.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many corporations and small businesses are expected to
eschew Windows 98, preferring to wait for Windows NT 5.0. That's
the next version of Microsoft's network operating system, which is
due out in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business decision-makers are confused whether Windows 98,
Windows NT or some other technology is the best choice,'' said
IDC's William Peterson. ``When confused, business decision-makers
wait for the dust to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself is discouraging corporations from switching to
Windows 98, claiming that they'd be better off with the current
version of Windows NT, which is more powerful (and at $149 to
upgrade, more expensive) than Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're definitely downplaying Windows for business,'' said
Cara Walker, a spokeswoman with Microsoft's public relations firm.
``This is the first OS Microsoft has ever marketed strictly for
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   According to IDC, some 6.9 million consumers are expected to buy
Windows 98 this year to upgrade their systems. Priced at $89, it
will be available at computer superstores, software stores and
warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   PC-makers will put Windows 98 on most new multimedia systems _ a
move that's expected to boost sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said all along it will be an enhancement,'' said Dell
spokesman T.R. Reid. ``A new version of an operating system helps
folks who might have been looking for that last excuse to trade up
to a new system.''
</P>
<P>
   Some industry executives said PC sales may have dropped off
during the past two months as consumers put off purchases while
waiting for Windows 98. ``Retailers especially were not eager to
take in new inventory that did not have Windows 98,'' said Mal
Ransom, vice president of marketing for Packard Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is expected to gain steam during the next few years.
IDC said that by 2000, Microsoft will ship 66 million copies of it,
surpassing the 53 million copies of Windows 95 in its third year. &QL;

 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   Merger Mania Has Finally Penetrated the Internet `Space'  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Pssst. Lycos is on the block.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or at least everybody and their brother is darn certain that it
is. And they're probably right. Even Lycos management is saying as
much. The Waltham, Mass., company is considered one of the next,
ahem, Internet portals that is expected to hook up with a media
giant or telecommunications behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, merger mania has penetrated the Internet ``space,'' as they
say on Sand Hill Road. Last week, Disney acquired 43 percent of
Infoseek for more than $70 million. Just recently General Electric,
which owns NBC, acquired 5 percent of Cnet for $26 million, and
agreed to buy as much as 60 percent of its Snap! online portal
(there's that word again) for $38 million.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was Zapata Corp. of Houston, the fish
meal folks who made an unsolicited and unsuccessful bid to buy
Excite to get a piece of the Internet pie.
</P>
<P>
   You can be sure that all of this deal-posturing has investment
bankers ordering a lot of take-in these days. What's more, all of
the merger talk has Internet stocks frothier than ever. Yesterday
Yahoo soared $8.50 a share, hitting a 52-week high of $148, and
Lycos closed at $68.75, up $4.25. (Yahoo's rise was attributed to
false rumors that it would be added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that Disney, which owns ABC, and GE, which owns NBC, have
made acquisitions that could make them the first stop for Web
surfers, conventional wisdom is that the likes of Time Warner or
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. are sure bets to invest in the
remaining free-agent Internet portals. (And now that News Corp. has
wreaked havoc with its Los Angeles Dodgers investment, it can
concentrate on an Internet deal.)
</P>
<P>
   But the point is that an investment in Lycos, or in most other
portal companies, is akin to making a wager at the tables in Tahoe.
It's a bet that the company will be bought out, says Michael
Murphy, publisher of the California Technology Stock Letter in Half
Moon Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fad going on to turn your (company) into a portal
company because the contest to become the dominant search engine''
is close to over, with Yahoo being the winner, Murphy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now everybody's scrambling for partners, including Lycos,''
says Murphy, who has a short position on Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy generally believes that there is too much hot air in
Internet stocks, and recently published a blanket recommendation
shorting almost all Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He, like many other stockpickers and analysts, contends that
these Internet companies are grossly overvalued and don't possess
the basic earnings and revenue streams to support their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Internet stocks continue to defy gravity, squeezing the
short-sellers and causing them severe financial pain.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that the majority of financial analysts
on Wall Street recommend that their clients buy Lycos at its
current price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it. I don't love it,'' says analyst Keith Benjamin of
BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, who rates the stock ``long-term
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   At its current price of about $68, Lycos shares are approaching
his 12-month price target of $72, which is based on annual earnings
projections for 2001 of $1.45 a share. (That's right, 21/2 years
from now.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if someone like Time Warner made an
investment in Lycos,'' Benjamin says.
</P>
<P>
   Or someone like News Corp. Or Germany's Bertelsmann AG, Lycos'
joint-venture partner in Europe. Or a telephone company, such as
AT&AMP;T, which last month teamed with Lycos to develop a co-branded
Internet service.
</P>
<P>
   Another Lycos bull is analyst Andrea Williams of Volpe Brown
Whelan, who has issued some skeptical and cautious research on
Internet concerns in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, she's more upbeat. Given the red-hot
merger and acquisition climate, Williams is high on Lycos and rates
it a ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent (Cnet and Infoseek) deals have kind of woken up a
number of media companies and that seems to have created an urgency
in their (M&AMP;A) talks,'' Williams says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect Lycos and others to announce new partners.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lycos chief operating officer and CFO Ted Philip
is doing little to dispel notions that his company is for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stated publicly that we would be interested in an
investment by the appropriate media or entertainment company,''
Philip says.
</P>
<P>
   The Lycos executive would not comment on what companies have
shown an interest in Lycos. Nor would he characterize what size
stake management might be inclined to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he sounded like someone who is willing to cut a
deal. Shareholders can only hope.  &QL;

AT&AMP;T REPORTEDLY NEAR DEAL TO ACQUIRE TCI 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story has been added to The Times Page 1.) 
(th) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. is close to an agreement to acquire the nation's
second largest cable television operator, in a deal worth more than
$20 billion. The deal would sharply expand AT&AMP;T's ability to
provide Internet access and other data services to millions of
American homes, an official who was informed of the discussions
said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. could be
announced as soon as Wednesday, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would represent the biggest sign yet that attempting to
deliver high-speed access to the Internet and other advanced
services is one of the strongest imperatives in today's business
world.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Internet has emerged as new sort of media
that could rival radio and television in its impact on the nation's
economy and culture. The technological bottleneck that has kept
cyberspace from becoming a true mass media has been the difficulty
in transmitting large amounts of digital data to everyday homes.
</P>
<P>
   Average consumers access the Internet at speeds a mere fraction
of those available to people in modern offices. That has kept the
process of linking to cyberspace a relatively awkward process in
some ways akin to using a ham radio.
</P>
<P>
   But by acquiring Tele-Communications, which serves 14.4 million
homes, AT&AMP;T would gain the ability to directly access homes and
apartments for the first time since the company spun off its local
telephone operations in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Although new telecommunications carriers boast more advanced
networks, AT&AMP;T retains a vast capacity to transmit information of
all sorts from coast to coast at lightning-quick speeds.
</P>
<P>
   By merging with Tele-Communications and gaining its many wires
into homes, AT&AMP;T would gain an ability to bypass its ornery
progeny, the Baby Bell local phone companies. That could allow AT&AMP;T
to create an end-to-end network that would allow the company to
deliver not only Internet data but also everyday phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Financial details of the agreement were unclear Tuesday night.
Speculation about a possible alliance emerged Tuesday, and The
Washington Post reported in its early edition Tuesday night that a
deal was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The technology to transmit phone calls over cable television
networks is not fully mature. The technical obstacles to creating
such a system on a mass basis would be formidable. But many
technology experts believe that allowing people to talk through
their television system is a goal well within the reach of
companies with the financial muscle of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   With their control of the copper wires that stretch into most
every home and apartment, the Bells have appeared to have an
advantage in some ways over long-distance companies such as AT&AMP;T
and MCI Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 cleared the way for the Bells
to enter the long-distance market once they convinced regulators
that they had opened their local networks to potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, long-distance telephone companies won the right to
compete in local markets. The Bells have not yet won that approval,
but were they to gain the go-ahead, they could be expected to win
large chunks of the long-distance market away from traditional
long-distance carriers by buying long-distance capacity in bulk and
reselling it at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance companies such as AT&AMP;T, however, would face the
huge cost of building elements of local networks on their own.
Indeed, in January AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire Teleport Communications
Group Inc., a competitive local phone company, for $11.3 billion in
a bid to jump-start that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of all major cable companies rose sharply Tuesday on Wall
Street rumors of some kind of possible alliance with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   TCI rose $3 to $38.6875; Cablevision Systems Corp. rose $7.25 to
$62; MediaOne Group Inc. gained $2.125 to a record of $41.25; Cox
Communications Inc. increased $1.75 to $46.25, and Comcast Corp.
rose $2.375 to a record $39.75.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry has been spending billions of dollars to
upgrade its lines to offer more options at faster speeds. TCI in
particular has been busy upgrading the capacity and speed of its
cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   Its TCI Ventures subsidiary has been testing Internet services
as well as digital wireless telephone services, known as personal
communications services, through ventures with Comcast, Cox
Communications and Sprint. &QL;

EDITORIAL: JERUSALEM'S BOUNDARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 &HT;     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 24:
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has chosen an awkward
moment to redraw the boundaries of Jerusalem, one of the most
sensitive issues in the Mideast peace talks. The point of those
talks is to resolve disputed issues by negotiation and compromise,
not by one side's acting on its own.
</P>
<P>
   At Netanyahu's behest, Washington has been trying to find a
formula to move the peace talks forward to the toughest remaining
issues. These include boundaries within greater Jerusalem, the
future of Jewish settlements and the political status of
Palestinian-controlled areas. Netanyahu says he still wants such
accelerated talks. But if he means to negotiate in good faith, he
should not now be redrawing the political boundaries of greater
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The new boundaries would expand Jerusalem's territory by 50
percent, by annexing Israeli land to the west. Although only
Israeli territory is involved, Netanyahu should not be redefining
Jerusalem's borders in advance of negotiations about its future.
</P>
<P>
   More provocatively, the expansion plan also contemplates
including several West Bank settlements east and north of the city
in an ``umbrella municipality,'' with Jerusalem responsible for
their public services. The political status of these and other
Jewish settlements should also be resolved at the negotiating
table. Although they may end up under Israeli sovereignty, that
should come about as part of a broader package, perhaps in exchange
for Israeli compromises on other issues.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's actual bearing on the peace talks will largely depend
on details still to be worked out. In response to strong criticism
from Washington, Netanyahu seems to have retreated a bit,
reassuring the Clinton administration that no decision has yet been
taken to extend Jerusalem's municipal authority farther into the
West Bank. That clarification is more constructive than his earlier
boast that the new arrangements were ``a basic change in
Jerusalem's status, which will be remembered as a turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   But past experience, including the opening of a controversial
tourist tunnel two years ago and the approval of new Jewish housing
in East Jerusalem last year, should have taught Netanyahu that any
abrupt changes in the city's delicate status quo, particularly in
the absence of negotiating progress with the Palestinians, can be
explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu faces increasingly sharp divisions within his own
Cabinet over whether to take the next steps toward peace. By
causing new tension over Jerusalem, he may be trying to change the
subject. If so, he can expect only a temporary respite. Most
Israelis believe in a negotiated peace with the Palestinians, and
reasonably expect their government to move ahead toward this goal. &QL;

GETTING THE BIRD 
MAD-UH-LINN OR MAD-UH-LINE? 
HANGING OUT 
RANCHER DAVE 
I-MAN TO BUILD
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This may rank right up there with the notion of
alligators in the sewer: a bright blue parakeet on a Park Avenue
doormat. Now he is living in _ what else? _ a gilded cage. And the
bird is a he. The salesclerks at Bernardaud, a store better known
for Limoges porcelain than for avian biology, checked.
</P>
<P>
   But first they had to coax him off the doormat and into the
store, at Park Avenue between 60th and 61st Streets. ``We tried to
encourage him to do something _ get on a pencil _ but no, he was
uncomfortable with that idea,'' said Mary Kay Denning, a
spokeswoman for the store. ``We were able, with the help of a
chauffeur who pulled a beach towel out of the car and someone
passing by who told us that if we covered him, we could handle
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schwarz, a lawyer who passed by while prospective brides at
Bernardaud were watching the salesclerks chase the parakeet, said
that the bird was ``swooping around the moldings and too close to
the $200 wine glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denning said that the bird, whom the salesclerks have named
Barbu (it means bearded, in French), ended up in a high-ceilinged
stockroom. He eventually did a, uh, swan dive for a snack, landing
on someone's muffin, and was moved to a restroom (``so no one could
go to the bathroom for the next six hours''), then to the cage.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Denning said she had hoped to hear from Barbu's previous
owner, but so far, not a peep.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline Moves to the Big Screen
</P>
<P>
   All together now: ``In an old house in Paris that was covered
with vines lived 12 little girls in two straight lines.'' That
sentence was uttered more than once at a party at Tavern on the
Green after the New York premiere of ``Madeline,'' a film based on
the Ludwig Bemelmans series of books, the first of which begins
with that much-memorized line.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews from the crayons-and-ice-cream set were generally
positive. ``I liked when she sank into the water,'' said Adrienne
Fishman, who will be 6 next month, after reciting the opening line
with her sister, Julia, 9.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lawford was doing no such recitations. ``Not on your
life,'' he said. He had a question about pronunciation: ``Is it
Mad-uh-linn or Mad-uh-line?'' A chorus that included his daughter,
Savannah Rose, 8, favored the second. ``I'd never read it until I
had my daughter,'' Lawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Table Hopping
</P>
<P>
   Table 45 has become the hangout for literary types at Della
Femina, a restaurant in East Hampton, N.Y. One night, Salman
Rushdie, who went underground after the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
pronounced a death sentence against him in 1989 after the
publication of his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' had dinner at
Table 45. The next night, Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of
Barnes and Noble, was seated at the same table ... ``Inflation has
taken place, to the tune of 6 cents,'' said Danny Meyer, an owner
of Gramercy Tavern and the Union Square Cafe. He was talking about
the fixed-price lunches being offered by more than 100 restaurants
this week, a custom begun in 1992, when the price was $19.92. ``Our
two restaurants were completely booked even before it was
announced,'' he said ... Tim and Nina Zagat, compilers of
restaurant guides, issued their predictions for food in the 21st
century at the restaurant 21: They foresee computerized cookbooks
and kitchens with ``essentially one computerized food storage
unit'' that can freeze or cook.
</P>
<P>
   Give Them Land, Lots of Land
</P>
<P>
   David Letterman may accumulate more than just speeding tickets
in Montana. He reportedly has his eye on a ranch in bear country.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Salmond, a fourth-generation rancher, says that Letterman
is considering buying a chunk of the Salmond Ranch in northwestern
Montana. ``We're in the talking stage now,'' said Salmond, who
would not say how much land or how much money was being talked
about. He said that he had listed 10,000 acres for sale last fall
for $7 million but had taken the land off the market.
</P>
<P>
   Letterman, who has made his speeding on parkways in Connecticut
a running gag on his late-night talk show, visited Montana last
month and was stopped in Darby for, yes, speeding. He also passed
through Choteau, 250 miles northeast of Darby, where he told the
Choteau Acantha newspaper, ``I've never seen anything so beautiful
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Salmond, he is not a big ``Late Show'' watcher. ``Don't
know very much about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nesting
</P>
<P>
   With his wife expecting, the radio personality Don Imus wants a
house with a nursery and a nanny's room.
</P>
<P>
   Imus has filed plans to build a seven-bedroom, seven-bath house
on 3.8 acres he owns in Westport, Conn. A public planning and
zoning hearing is scheduled July 23. Imus needs a construction
permit, as well as a demolition permit to tear down the existing
two-story house on the property, which he bought last year for $4.6
million.

HOUSTON COUNCILWOMAN SEES TOO MANY BLACKS IN CITY DEPARTMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JULIE MASON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Councilwoman Martha Wong complained in a letter to
Mayor Lee Brown that the city's Health and Human Services
Department has too many black employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an obvious over-representation of African-American
employees and a shockingly low representation of Asian American and
Hispanic employees,'' Wong wrote in a letter to Brown and Health
and Human Services Director Mary desVignes-Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Kendrick, both of whom are African-American, responded
carefully to Wong's letter Tuesday, saying they both share Wong's
interest in diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to see is that we have a city government that is
open to everybody, in terms of the benefit of employment, and no
one should be left out,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Kendrick said the 53 percent black work force in her department
reflects in part the past inability of African-American health-care
workers to find better paying jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Wong's letter) negates the past history in this
department and many others where individuals for racism-related
reasons were unable to get positions in many of the white
hospitals,'' Kendrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Marsh, the director's office liaison for Kendrick, said
the city department is 53.2 percent black, 16.3 percent Anglo, 27.7
percent Hispanic and 6.9 percent other, which includes Asians,
Native Americans and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary concern is a diverse work force to meet the needs
of the community we serve, and we take affirmative action very
seriously in this department,'' Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the department places ads for employment
opportunities in Houston's Asian and Hispanic community newspapers,
Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the department has made recent gains in hiring
Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making progress,'' Brown said. ``When you have a long
history of under-representation of any group, it takes some time to
bring it up because you just can't lay off people in order to make
up for a lack of Asians.''
</P>
<P>
   Wong said Tuesday her problems with the department also include
concerns about the ``work ethic'' of employees, although she did
not raise that issue in her letter to Kendrick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (ethnicity) issue is important because Mayor Brown
said he wanted the staff to look like the city, and in this case it
doesn't,'' Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to the work habits in the department, Wong said a
friend of hers recently took a job there, and told the council
member the employees were lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was told that if she worked too hard, she was going to be
in trouble,'' Wong said. ``So I have a concern that the work ethic
isn't there in that department.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he has never heard that complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what she means by that,'' Brown said. ``I have
not heard anyone say that nor have I heard her say that. I have
confidence in the director of that department.''
</P>
<P>
   With an annual budget of $55 million, the city's Health and
Human Services Department employs 1,067 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to setting the city's health policy, the department
provides animal regulation, inspects food service vendors and
swimming pools, and treats nearly 200,000 patients a year at city
health clinics, among other services.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its programs are funded by state and federal grants.

EDITORIAL: PROTECTION FOR MEDICARE CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 24:
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's new Medicare regulations will
provide important consumer protections for 38 million elderly and
disabled beneficiaries as more of them move into the managed-care
system. Given Medicare's size and reach, these regulations could
also set an operating standard for the rest of the health insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
   By moving aggressively to protect Medicare recipients, President
Clinton has seized on a powerful political issue. Republicans who
have opposed consumer protections for the millions covered by
private insurance must now explain why they would deny working
families the safeguards that publicly funded Medicare patients will
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, a wide array of health
insurance plans, in addition to health maintenance organizations,
will be allowed to compete in the Medicare market against the
traditional fee-for-service coverage that serves most beneficiaries
now. Only 17 percent of Medicare recipients are now enrolled in
some form of managed care. That is expected to increase to 30
percent by 2005, making the need for managed-care guidelines more
urgent.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations contain many key elements of the ``patients'
bill of rights'' proposed by a presidential advisory commission.
Women may demand direct access to women's health specialists for
routine and preventive care. Patients with chronic illnesses must
also be allowed reasonable access to specialists, and emergency
care must be covered in all cases where a prudent person has reason
to believe an emergency exists.
</P>
<P>
   The rules guarantee swift review by an independent panel for
patients appealing a denial of services. They would require all
plans participating in Medicare to release information about how
doctors are paid and to keep medical records confidential.
</P>
<P>
   Leading health plans already provide many of these protections
to all patients. The Medicare regulations will probably encourage
more plans to adopt these standards for all enrollees since that
would be easier than applying different standards to different
patient groups. Even so, a fair-minded Congress would extend these
basic protections to all consumers, including those trapped in
low-quality plans. States have very limited ability to regulate in
this arena. The administration's approach to Medicare could have a
positive effect on the managed-care system as a whole, but more
needs to be done. &QL;

 &HT;    Waddell flush with recent success
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some people suspect that their career has gone into
the toilet. Eleven years ago, Don Waddell could say it without
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   His hockey-playing career winding down at the age of 27, Waddell
entered the portable-toilet business in 1987. In his words, ``I was
Mr. Port-A-John,'' proudly selling and setting up his product.
``It's all part of the Waddell history that some of us would like
to forget,'' Waddell said, smiling, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell not only returned to hockey, he evolved into one of the
game's top young executives. He accepted the position as the
Thrashers' first general manager after spending only one year in
his ``dream job'' as an assistant GM with the Detroit Red Wings,
the team he grew up following.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell's success in the front office of three minor-league
teams and his ability as a talent evaluator had drawn the attention
of several NHL teams. Waddell said he turned down ``a half-dozen''
offers from NHL teams during his two years with Orlando of the IHL
``because they just weren't the right job,'' and had been
interviewed for the general manager's position in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would be a general manager one day, and I thought it
would be with one of the expansion teams,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But even Waddell didn't imagine himself as Atlanta's general
manager when the city was awarded a team last year. He had signed a
lucrative four-year deal with the Red Wings, expecting to complete
at least half of it. But Thrashers president Harvey Schiller, who
became aware of Waddell through a casual conversation with Orlando
Magic/Solar Bears executive Bob Vander Weide, soon realized he was
the best available candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for somebody with leadership qualities,''
Schiller said, ``somebody with a knowledge of the game and somebody
who could draw the best people and had a formula for success.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell once was named the IHL's defenseman of the year, but his
playing career might be known more for two low points: He made the
1980 Olympic team but suffered a broken leg in a pre-Games
exhibition. And less than a minute into his first shift in his only
NHL game, with Los Angeles, Waddell was knocked down inadvertently
by teammate Jerry Korab, allowing New York's Ron Greschner to
score.
</P>
<P>
   He had greater success off the ice. As a rookie GM, he turned
around a minor-league team in Flint, Mich., in 1989-90. Then came
seven years in the IHL and two executive-of-the-year awards. In
Orlando, Waddell also was instrumental in the construction of a new
practice facility shared by the Magic and Solar Bears. Here, he
will assume the responsibility to land a site for the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, he was put in charge of minor-league Adirondack,
evaluated NHL players before potential trades and free-agent
signings and negotiated some contracts for general manager Ken
Holland. Detroit went on to win the Stanley Cup, and Waddell's
stock rose again.
</P>
<P>
   Even as late as Saturday, Schiller was receiving phone calls
from hopeful GM candidates. He declined any further interviews and
selected Waddell Monday over agent Mike Gillis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don was first choice,'' Schiller said. ``My only choice.''

...) MOLINARI QUITS CBS, ENDING ANCHORWOMAN EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(SUBS 8th graf pvs, A senior-level ..., to SUB anonymous quote with
paraphrase from several producers; Pickup 9th graf, Her hiring(nk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was either CBS News' experiment with creating an
anchorwoman from a congresswoman, or Susan Molinari's experiment
with transforming herself from a Republican Party star into a
television star. From either perspective, the experiment failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ms. Molinari and CBS News president Andrew Heyward
announced that she would leave the network, nine months after she
began as the co-anchor of ``CBS News Saturday Morning'' with Russ
Mitchell. Saturday's broadcast will be her last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel she was terribly comfortable with the format or
material, even though she was very devoted to it and worked very
hard at it,'' Heyward said in a telephone interview. ``I think she
has a lot of ability and a lot to offer, but the program was not
the best venue for her. I think she missed the political arena _
not being in politics per se, but political commentary and
analysis. There's very little of that on a Saturday morning show.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari, in a statement, praised everyone she had worked
with at CBS News and added: ``I look forward to my next opportunity
in broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Her statement said she had accepted a visiting fellowship at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government starting in the
fall, and was considering ``several broadcasting options, including
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference 13 months ago announcing her hiring,
after almost seven years as a congresswoman from Staten Island, Ms.
Molinari described her vision for the program as ``a sort of `60
Minutes' meets Rosie O'Donnell,'' in which she could report on
important issues but also interview celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   A close friend of Ms. Molinari's, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said she had been dissatisfied because the program dealt
with substantive issues less often than she had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Several producers at CBS News said that, while diligent and
intelligent, Ms. Molinari was not adept at certain skills needed in
television and often seemed stiff when reading the prompter or
interviewing guests.
</P>
<P>
   Her hiring was widely criticized for blurring the line between
politicians and the journalists who cover them. Many media
personalities have gone into politics, and vice versa, although
some former politicians appear on television as commentators rather
than as reporters or anchors.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Molinari's popularity as a politician did not attract
many viewers. The show, a new venture for CBS News, has averaged a
1.3 Nielsen rating (each rating point represents 980,000
households), lagging about two points behind the more established
Saturday edition of NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
   The show will continue with Mitchell and various substitute
co-anchors until a permanent successor to Ms. Molinari is named.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molinari had a multiyear contract, but the settlement terms
were not disclosed.

LIPA CHAIRMAN SAYS HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT LILCO PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMINGDALE, N.Y. _ The head of the state agency that bought
part of Long Island Lighting Co. testified Tuesday that he did not
know beforehand about the special payments LILCO made later to
executives totaling $67 million, and had he known, he would have
tried to block the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power
Authority, also said he had not raised the issue in negotiations
with LILCO because he believed that New York state's takeover
contract had a superseding clause barring such payments.
</P>
<P>
   His statements came in often tense and even bitter hearings here
as two state Assembly committees, Energy and the Committee on
Corporations, Authorities and Commissions, opened an investigation
into the payments, with Kessel as the first witness.
</P>
<P>
   The power authority bought part of LILCO on May 28 in a plan by
Gov. George Pataki to cut local electricity rates. The rest of
LILCO merged with Brooklyn Union Gas and its affiliates to form
Marketspan, which operates the electricity system under contract
with the authority. LILCO executives took new but similar jobs at
Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the takeover, Pataki and Kessel disclosed the fact
that special payments had been made, including $42 million to
LILCO's chairman, William Catacosinos, who is now chairman of
Marketspan. The governor denounced the payouts as ``a secret act of
greed'' that violated the agreement and demanded that Catacosinos
return the money and resign.
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said that ``neither I nor the governor nor LIPA knew
anything about it at all _ they concealed it from us.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the takeover, who contend it was a giveaway to
LILCO, have pointed to numerous public documents that said LILCO
executives would get benefits upon a change of control of the
company. They say the governor and Kessel chose to ignore them to
avoid stirring an outcry that might jeopardize the takeover deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Documents exist _ of course documents exist,'' Kessel
testified. ``We all know that, of course. But because they weren't
terminated, they shouldn't have been paid. Our agreement says you
can't make the payments.''
</P>
<P>
   For the payments to have been made properly, Kessel said, a
second condition had to be met besides LILCO's change of control:
The executives had to be dismissed. And that was supposed to be
blocked by a clause barring dismissals and any resulting benefits,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But former LILCO officials dispute that, citing other clauses
specifying that the demise of LILCO meant they would be dismissed
and would thus qualify for benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the conflicting legal interpretations, Assemblyman
Paul Tonko, a Democrat who presided over the hearing as chairman of
the Energy Committee, said: ``There are two wildly diverse tales
here.'' He added: ``There had to be a discussion of the issue'' in
the LILCO negotiations. ``At least I hope there was,'' he said,
``and if there wasn't, something was really wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the hearings revealed a major failure to communicate on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   A statement that a lawyer for Marketspan read into the record
concluded: ``Prior to closing, LIPA officials did not express the
view that anything in its agreement with LILCO prevented LILCO from
making these payments.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Kessel said that although he sat at the same table
with Catacosinos during negotiations and at the final signing
ceremony, ``He never said a word to me about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had raised the issue with LILCO, Kessel said: ``Why
would I ask them a question about something they were prohibited
from doing? I am saying it was not an issue of concern, because it
was prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel conceded that ``this was not an issue that dominated the
discussions'' with LILCO. One reason was that any such payments
would have come from shareholder profits. ``I was not as concerned,
because it was not ratepayer money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Kessel said: ``I would have recommended we not go
through with the LIPA deal, had I known. I would have held up the
deal till the money was given back. That would have been my
recommendtion to my board.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the session began, an unexpected guest arrived outside
the building. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who is running in the
Democratic primary for governor, attacked Pataki, a Republican.
``What did George Pataki know, and when did he know it?'' she said.
``Did he conceal the $42 million payout, or was he asleep at the
switch?'' She said the Assembly should call him and his aides as
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two important witnesses were no-shows: Dr. Catacosinos and
Marketspan's president, Robert Catell. Instead, a company lawyer,
John Reilly, read a statement with numerous attachments to show
that the payments were proper. ``Because there are a number of
legal proceedings concerning those payments,'' he said,
``Marketspan cannot amplify on this statement or answer questions
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing frustration, Assemblyman Tonko insisted that Catacosinos
and Catell would be recalled, and, ``if necessary, we will do a
subpoena.'' Assemblyman Steven Englebright, a Democrat, said: ``It
looks like they're trying to hide something.''

EDITORIAL: GRANDSTANDING ON TAXES 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 24:
</P>
<P>
   For sheer mischief-making irresponsibility, it is hard to top
the House's action last week in voting to repeal virtually the
entire federal tax code. What, you might ask, will replace it?
There is no answer, except for a promise that that question will be
addressed sometime in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted to make the repeal effective on Dec. 31, 2002,
and to require Congress to pass a new code less than six months
before that, by July 4. Even if one assumes that the deadline would
be met, the economic dislocations in the interim would be
substantial. Neither businesses nor individuals would be able to
plan their affairs with any firm idea of what the tax laws were
going to be. Will the interest on your new mortgage be deductible?
Will your IRA remain tax-deferred?
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent, the Oklahoma Republican who came up with
this idea, argues that the certain death of the old tax code would
make taxes a central issue in the 2000 presidential race. Congress
would also have to act by the deadline, or the government would see
its tax revenues vanish.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case to be made for tax reform, but any reform plan
will result in some people paying more than they do now, and some
less. Republicans at the moment cannot agree on whether to push for
a national sales tax or a flat income tax, so House Republicans
simply pushed the repeal through, on a 219-203 vote. No doubt they
are salivating at the prospect of campaign spots accusing Democrats
of voting for the current tax code.
</P>
<P>
   William Roth, the Senate Finance Committee chairman, suggested
it would be better for the Republicans to have figured out what
they were for before they acted on taxes. But the Senate Republican
leadership has lined up behind the bill, and so it may yet be
necessary for President Clinton to veto this outrageous example of
political grandstanding. &QL;

NOW IT'S LASORDA'S TURN TO DEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Surrounded by thick, black smoke, the Dodgers
opened all the windows. Perhaps now they'll set about putting out
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season is a three-alarm blaze that'll smolder or worse
until president Bob Graziano and interim general manager Tom
Lasorda tend to all the hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Lasorda, in particular, to exert far more energy looking
for a left-handed power hitter, a left fielder and/or a closer than
someone to take his place. It says here Lasorda, at last ensconced
in the seat he long has coveted, will search for a general manager
about as diligently as O.J. Simpson did for the killer of his
ex-wife and her friend.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have no Fireman of the Year candidate in their
bullpen. Fiery new interim manager Glenn Hoffman is fine. But what
the Dodgers really could use is his brother Todd, a closer for the
division-leading San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   That much was borne out for the umpteenth time Monday night
against regional rival Anaheim, when Scott Radinsky entered the
game in the eighth inning with a 4-1 lead and exited three batters
later with the score tied at 4. The Dodgers would eventually lose
by one when right-hander Jim Bruske walked in the winning run with
the bases loaded in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make Dodgers fans yearn for the return of Todd
Worrell. When they're not crying in their coffee over Pedro
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' starting rotation was supposed to be their strength
this year, but it has struggled. Ismael Valdes and Chan Ho Park
haven't lived up to their billing, another rotator cuff injury has
shelved ace Ramon Martinez and irreconcilable differences ushered
Hideo Nomo out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, everyone knows life can throw some pretty wicked curves.
The Angels have had to fend off a few themselves. Their manager,
Terry Collins, recently returned from an eight-game suspension.
They went into Tuesday's game against the Dodgers at Edison Field
without injured pitchers Mike James and Allen Watson.
</P>
<P>
   But on the strength of breakout performances by the likes of
pitcher Jarrod Washburn, who got the starting nod against the
Dodgers on Tuesday, and second baseman Justin Baughman, who has hit
safely in 15 of 27 games, the Angels haven't slipped a bit. Never
in its history has the team been on a streak as scintillating as
its current one, in which it has won 19 of 22 games to set the pace
in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Dodgers' real rivals, the second-place San
Francisco Giants, who enjoyed an eight-game cushion over the
Dodgers at Tuesday's start. They lost catcher Brian Johnson to a
fractured wrist at the start of the season and Brent Mayne stepped
forward and filled in nicely. Their regular first baseman, J.T.
Snow, has gotten off to a slow start. But it has been but a blip on
the screen because Charlie Hayes has spelled him so well.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers haven't had any players fill the voids created by
injury and inertia. Outfielder Roger Cedeno's talent can't hide his
tenuous grasp of the fundamentals. Paul Konerko homered and singled
in a run in his first two at bats, but he has struggled with his
consistency. Wilton Guerrero's defense, which cost the Dodgers a
run Tuesday, and lack of discipline at the plate continue to
confound.
</P>
<P>
   No player stepped up, so manager Bill Russell and executive vice
president Fred Claire were designated to take the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Russell probably was too laid back, as his critics claimed, and
Claire too indecisive. But that's not what killed them. A few
well-placed knives in the back by Lasorda did the trick, though
none too cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   You can say Claire effectively signed his pink slip by not
pursuing the likes of closer Rod Beck during the offseason and for
failing to deliver the deal in spring training that would have
brought Seattle pitching ace and former USC standout Randy Johnson
to the Dodgers for Valdes and Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   But it takes money to sign a free agent such as Beck, a Grant
High product who eventually landed with the Cubs, and the Dodgers
had tightened their purse strings in anticipation of their sale to
Murdoch's Fox Group. Claire was left to scrounge around for change
to sign infielder Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Claire might have survived without a closer if he had
only had a closer's mentality. General managers, like relievers,
have to be able to recover quickly from their mistakes and move on.
</P>
<P>
   But Claire was a little hesitant to deal young players after
trading Pedro Martinez to Montreal for Delino DeShields in 1993. He
bore the brunt of the criticism when that trade turned out to be
laughably one-sided, never mind that Lasorda, the manager at the
time, hadn't exactly been shocked and dismayed to see Martinez
moved.
</P>
<P>
   If Claire had a fault, it was his fealty to young players such
as Cedeno and Guerrero. He believed in them to the bitter end.
</P>
<P>
   As one general manager recently told the Seattle Times,
``Whether they believe it or just try to sell it around, (the
Dodgers) rate their players so highly it creates tension in dealing
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are the ones who will feel the tension now. After
all, they're the only ones left.

MICROSOFT WINS KEY LEGAL BATTLE; STOCK SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. won a key legal victory Tuesday that it said
affirms its freedom to design its software without outside
interference and erodes claims by antitrust regulators that it
doesn't compete fairly.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Washington,
D.C., propelled Microsoft's stock to a record high and prompted
jubilation among the company's top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Operating Officer Bob Herbold proclaimed Tuesday ``a great
day for consumers'' and said the decision ``reaffirms the central
principle ... that every company should have the freedom to improve
its products and integrate new features on behalf of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and legal experts agreed that the ruling was a
significant win for the company. But they warned that the issues
are far from settled, and that in any case Microsoft's market power
and hard-nosed business tactics will continue to draw regulators'
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are anything but out of the woods,'' said industry
analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group. ``They have an image
that leads people to assume they're guilty until proven innocent
... until they fix their fundamental image problem, their exposure
to litigation remains significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice said little. It issued a
three-sentence statement saying it was disappointed with the
ruling, which came in a relatively narrow case filed last fall, but
remained confident it would prevail in the broader antitrust case
it filed last month along with companion litigation filed by 20
states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Central to all of the cases has been the claim that Microsoft
has abused its Windows software monopoly by forcing computer makers
to also accept its Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of computers sold today are equipped with the
Windows operating system. Computer makers had no real alternative
to Windows if they wanted to replace Internet Explorer with an
alternative browser _ such as Netscape Navigator _ for computer
users to navigate the Internet and the World Wide Web, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft claimed it had combined the browser and the operating
system in a single ``integrated'' product on the basis of consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals panel supported that view, voting 2-1 in Tuesday's
ruling that it was ``inclined to conclude'' that the combined
operating system and browser was a ``genuine integration''
permitted under the 1995 consent decree at the heart of that case.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the Justice Department had not shown a ``reasonable
probability of success on the merits,'' the appeals panel decided
unanimously to cancel a preliminary injunction issued in December
by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that required
Microsoft to offer computer makers a browserless version of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It also was unanimous in vacating Jackson's decision to refer
the case to a special master, saying it found the case ``devoid''
of anything ``remotely `exceptional''' to trigger that procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In a rebuke to Jackson, the appeals court said his decision to
refer the case to Harvard Law School Professor Lawrence Lessig was
``either a clear abuse of discretion or an exercise of wholly
non-existent discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the appeals court had tentatively suspended Lessig's
appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday Lessig said, ``This is an extremely
difficult case, and I am grateful to both sides for the patience
and respect that they showed me during the brief time that I worked
with them on this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The appellate judges did not rule on Microsoft's claim that
Lessig was biased against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Most heartening to Microsoft, however, was that the ruling went
far beyond those procedural questions to scrutinize major issues of
product design and the proper role of courts _ issues at the heart
of the case filed last month.
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the appeals ruling will be an ``important and
weighty authority in guiding the trial court,'' Bill Neukom,
Microsoft's senior vice president for law and corporate affairs,
told reporters and analysts Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out passages in the ruling that he said supported two
of Microsoft's most important points: that the law should encourage
innovation and integration in pursuit of better products for
consumers, and that courts should generally avoid interfering in
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antitrust scholars have long recognized the undesirability of
having courts oversee product design, and any dampening of
technological innovation would be at cross-purposes with antitrust
law,'' the panel said in one passage that Neukom took care to point
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a validation of the company's legal right to continue
to do what it has been doing,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Browser rival Netscape Communications issued a statement late
Tuesday stressing that the ruling ``most certainly did not decide
the broad antitrust case'' filed last month and echoing the Justice
Department's view that Microsoft would ultimately lose that case.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., antitrust expert Phil O'Neill said the
government would likely seize on a portion of the dissenting
opinion in which the judge outlined an alternative view that she
said the two other judges hadn't adequately considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's basically saying ... `Since I am able to come up with an
equally plausible construction, you ought to wait until the
fact-finding is done before you declare the game over,''' O'Neill
said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neill agreed that overall, the ruling was a ``huge
victory'' for Microsoft, both symbolically and practically, and
predicted that Jackson would ``probably read this thing 100 times''
in weighing the next case, scheduled for trial on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said (to the lower court judge), `You got
nothing right here,''' O'Neill said. ``He's got to be pretty
discouraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the appeals ruling was replete with nuggets that looked
like gold to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The integrated version of Windows and Internet Explorer offers
more functionality than the sum of the two products separately, it
said, adding, ``This strikes us as an essential point.''
</P>
<P>
   And the integration must logically be done by Microsoft; it
would be ``absurdly inefficient'' for computer makers or end users
to do it, the panel said.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested in several places that courts should try to stay
out of the way, noting at one point, ``Courts are ill equipped to
evaluate the benefits of high-tech product design.''
</P>
<P>
   It even questioned the value of pursuing the consent-decree
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of our interpretation of the consent decree, tentative
though it be, the Department (of Justice) may well regard further
pursuit of the case as unpromising,'' the panel said, ``especially
given the alternate avenues developing in its recently launched
separate attacks on Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether those avenues lead anywhere is also far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``This cuts the legs out from under the Justice Department on
their new case,'' Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust office, told the New York Times.
``It's potentially devastating.''

CONGRESSMAN MAKES SURE A MISTAKE BECOMES TAX LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert ``an estimated'' before ``$880 million'' in the 3rd
graf. No other changes.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The tax code is chock full of benefits for the
wealthy. Most of them were put in on purpose. But last year, one
got in accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   Now a powerful congressman has used his influence to keep on the
books this tax break for rich people that no one intended to be in
the law in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The only beneficiaries of the mistake are the heirs of a few
hundred people who die each year and leave estates worth more than
$17 million. Each of those estates will be saved more than $200,000
in taxes. The government will lose an estimated $880 million in
revenue over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   After the mistake was caught, the Treasury Department and the
Senate took steps to correct it before it could be taken advantage
of.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, blocked them. At his insistence, a House-Senate
conference committee decided last week to keep the tax break in the
law. Archer says he prevented the correction to express his fervent
opposition to inheritance taxes, which he calls ``death taxes.''
Archer represents a district in Houston that is one of the
wealthiest in the country and presumably one of the likeliest to
have someone die and leave an estate worth more than $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   This all started when someone on Congress' technical staff made
a mistake in the drafting of the mammoth balanced budget and tax
cut law that Congress approved and President Clinton signed last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Such mistakes are common in big, complicated tax bills. Several
years ago, for instance, a measure dealing with tax write-offs for
race horses referred to ``houses'' instead of ``horses.'' Normally
the errors are repaired in what is known as the
technical-corrections section of the next tax bill to go through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 tax law increased the amount in estates that is exempt
from federal taxation. Under the old law, the first $600,000 of an
estate's value went untaxed. The new law raised the excluded amount
to $625,000 in 1998, to $650,000 in 1999 and, in continued
increments, to $1 million in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion is particularly important to heirs because the
estate tax rate is high, beginning at 18 percent and rising to 55
percent on the taxable amount over $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The old law required the value of the exclusion to be gradually
eliminated, a process called a phase-out, on estates worth more
than $17,184,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to the IRS, about 300 tax returns were filed on
estates worth more than $20 million in 1995, the last year for
which statistics are available. Because stock prices on average
have doubled since then, it is safe to assume that more such
estates will be taxed this year. But the total number should not be
more than several hundred.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the lawmakers who voted to increase the
exclusion intended to retain the phase-out. But somehow in the
drafting, that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   The error was quickly caught. A private tax lawyer apparently
spotted it and called it to the attention of the congressional tax
staff. The tax staff recommended that it be corrected, and tax
specialists at the Treasury Department agreed.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like one of the dozens of mistakes that would be
routinely repaired in this year's technical corrections bill before
anyone's taxes could be affected. Indeed, the Senate included a
correction in its version of the bill. But in the House, Archer
balked. And when the measure _ a small part of the legislation to
overhaul the IRS _ got to conference, he refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one in the Senate felt as strongly about correcting the
mistake as Archer felt about letting it go uncorrected, the
conferees agreed last week to leave the tax break in the law.
</P>
<P>
   Archer explained his position in a letter he wrote this month to
the National Federation of Independent Businesses, an organization
representing small businesses that opposes estate taxes but did not
specifically lobby on the provision in question.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some might argue that the proposed change is a mere
correction of a drafting error made last year, I view it as an
increase in federal death tax rates,'' Archer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The letter added: ``I believe we should reduce or eliminate the
unfair death tax. Accordingly, I cannot support any change in law
that would go in the opposite direction by increasing death tax
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's spokesman, L. Ari Fleischer, said the chairman's
position well illustrated the importance in which party controls
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Democrats controlled Congress and drafting errors
worked against the taxpayers, the Democrats let them stay in the
law,'' Fleischer said. ``Now, when one works against the government
and for the taxpayers, we're in no rush to correct it.''

   Rumor mill churns out &QL; 
its annual assortment
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ They're everywhere you go in the
Great White North these days as today's NBA draft draws near.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects?
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, there are more than a few of those wandering the streets.
You can't go more than 50 feet without bumping into North
Carolina's Antawn Jamison, Pacific's Michael Olowokandi or
Arizona's Michael Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   But what we're referring to are the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, reports of trades and maneuvers, both real and
imagined, start flying as the draft nears. This year is no
different. Some are truly far-fetched (``Hey, did you hear that
Philadelphia is shopping Allen Iverson?'') while others are, well,
not so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   How about the Knicks shipping Chris Mills, Chris Childs and John
Starks to Houston for picks Nos. 16 and 18 in today's draft? That's
one of the rumors that's out there. Sources close to the team
pretend to be amazed that something like that even gets started,
but that rumor has been floating around for more than two weeks, so
it can't be news to anybody in the Rockets' front office.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, here is a sampling of the rumors floating around the
league right now as the draft approaches:
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers need a point guard desperately. And
Michael Bibby, a true point guard who led Arizona to the 1997 NCAA
title, is there for the taking. It's a natural. Bibby is the son of
Henry Bibby, who helped UCLA to three straight titles in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clippers, who were definitely taking Bibby two days ago,
are now reportedly considering taking Olowkandi instead. Why?
Because they're afraid they will look like idiots down the line for
not taking Olowokandi should the native of Nigeria blossom (see the
Portland Trail Blazers and Michael Jordan for historical reference
here).
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are supposedly offering Nick Van Exel and Elden
Campbell, or Eddie Jones and Campbell, in exchange for Vancouver's
No. 2 pick.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk the Grizzlies will take Olowokandi, if he's
available, and then ship Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves to Phoenix
for point guard Steve Nash, a Canadian by birth. It's hard to
picture Reeves fitting in with whippets like Antonio McDyess and
Jason Kidd, but the Suns have been looking for an offensive-minded
center since Alvan Adams retired, so anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another rumor swirling around Olowokandi has Milwaukee offering
Terrell Brandon and two first-rounders (Nos. 9 and 19) to move up
far enough to take the 7-1 center. Hard to see anyone biting on
this.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a rumor that doesn't involve Olowokandi _ Cleveland
sending suddenly expendable Bobby Sura to Orlando for one of its
three first-round picks (Nos. 12, 13 or 15). The Magic loves Sura,
who's from Florida State, and the Cavs don't have a first-round
pick but want one. And with Wesley Person and Derek Anderson at
shooting guard, the Cavs can afford to ship Sura out. It could
happen.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the usual quota of veteran players being shipped
out, like Golden State's Latrell Sprewell, who may be headed to
Miami for P.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect Philadelphia to trade Iverson so the Sixers can
move up in the draft. No way. After selling the fans on Jerry
Stackhouse, the No. 3 pick in the 1995 draft, the Sixers traded him
away two years later. They can't afford another fiasco like that
with Iverson, who is too talented to be dealt anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Philly did offer Tim Thomas and the No. 8 pick to move up to No.
2 trying to get _ who else? _ Olowokandi, but the Grizzlies thought
that Thomas was too much like Shareef Abdur-Rahim.

JUDGE FAULTS AGENCY ON GROUP-HOME ESCAPE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a court ruling that illustrates New York City's
struggles to keep runaway foster children off the streets, a
Brooklyn Family Court judge found the city's child welfare agency
in contempt Tuesday for failing to prevent a 15-year-old boy from
running away from his group home.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Daniel Turbow, said that the Administration for
Children's Services should have considered locking the boy in the
home or physically restraining him. City officials and lawyers for
the child say that state law forbids them from physically detaining
foster children and that they plan to appeal the judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of the boy, who skipped school, tried to commit
suicide and ran away from home and from foster care, mirrors the
stories of thousands of other troubled teen-agers who repeatedly
run from group homes, which often lack adequate staff. The law
allows only juvenile delinquents _ not foster children _to be held
in secure, locked detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis conducted by the child-care agency found that
3,000 foster children _ or about 7 percent of foster children in
the city _ run away each year. The average runaway is about 16 and
returns in seven days or less, the study shows.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these children end up sleeping in the city's overnight
placement office because the city suffers from a severe shortage of
foster homes for troubled adolescents. And some commit crimes on
the street or fall victim to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, four teen-age boys who ran away from a group home
were arrested and charged with slashing a parish priest in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent such incidents, the city has required some group
homes to hire security guards and install video cameras and motion
detectors. The city has also lobbied the state to pass legislation
that would allow it to open a secure, locked facility for foster
children.
</P>
<P>
   But despite all those efforts, the boy in the current case,
identified only as Darren in court papers, ran away from the St.
John's Residence for Boys in Queens. After the boy ran away once
last September, Turbow ordered the Administration for Children's
Services to insure that he would stay put. But in October, an
employee at the group home gave the boy $8 to go to a movie, and
Darren ran away again. The boy is now in a different foster
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Turbow argued that Darren could have been locked up or
physically restrained because he was not technically a foster
child. He was not abused or neglected. Instead, he was placed in a
group home while his father was seeking to have him classified as a
``person in need of supervision,'' a truant who defied parental
control. As such, he would be eligible for special services.

PERUVIAN LEADER REJECTS U.S. CALL TO FREE AMERICAN WOMAN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori on Tuesday emphatically
rejected appeals by the Clinton administration to hold a new trial
for Lori Helene Berenson, the New Yorker imprisoned for life on
terrorism charges, saying she was guilty and should be treated so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the United States going to free those involved in the World
Trade Center bombing?'' Fujimori asked in an interview at the
Government Palace. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of speculation about the case of Ms. Berenson, a
28-year-old former Manhattan resident, began Sunday night when
Fujimori's new prime minister, Javier Valle Riestra, told a local
television station that her 1996 trial before a military court was
flawed and that she should be pardoned and expelled to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Ms. Berenson's family and U.S. officials who had
urged Valle Riestra to look into the case expressed cautious
optimism that there might be a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But Fujimori on Tuesday night distanced himself from Riestra,
who he appointed three weeks ago, stating that he had no doubt that
the military tribunal that tried and convicted Ms. Berenson of
helping plan a takeover of the Peruvian Congress had acted
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the power to pardon her and nobody else does
either,'' Fujimori said. ``My opinion is she is a terrorist.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Rhoda Berenson, Ms. Berenson's mother,
expressed disappointment, adding, ``I think the world would like
him to prove she is a terrorist, and let her have a fair trial in a
civilian court.''
</P>
<P>
   The military tribunal that tried Ms. Berenson was made up of
judges whose identities have been kept secret. Her lawyers were not
permitted to cross-examine witnesses, challenge evidence or call
witnesses of their own. Government prosecutors said the rebels she
supported planned to take Congress hostage and trade the
legislators for imprisoned comrades.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have personally
asked Fujimori to retry Ms. Berenson in a civilian court. Dennis
Jett, the American ambassador here, repeated the appeal last Friday
to Valle Riestra.
</P>
<P>
   Valle Riestra then startled American officials by suggesting
that while in his opinion Ms. Berenson was guilty, she should be
freed ``for reasons of state and for the sake of Peru's prestige.''
</P>
<P>
   Jett chose his words carefully Tuesday night in responding to
Fujimori's remarks. ``Our position continues to be she deserves to
have a trial in a civilian court with all appropriate due process
for her to have the ability to establish her guilt or innocence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials openly wondered if Valle Riestra had not done
more harm than good by pressing his position publicly rather than
lobbying behind the scenes. Ms. Berenson, they said, remains a
controversial figure here since she denied on television that the
Tupac Amaru rebels were terrorists and said she was only upholding
the interests of the Peruvian poor.
</P>
<P>
   A year after she and more than 20 Tupac Amaru guerrillas were
arrested, other members of the group took hundreds of hostages in
Japanese residence here demanding freedom of several hundred
imprisoned rebels. All 14 rebels were killed in a Government rescue
operation.
