JUROR AT CENTER OF SYMINGTON RULING FEELS VINDICATED
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah! Free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jane Cotey might have been talking about Fife Symington's
reaction to a court ruling overturn ing his bank-fraud convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But Cotey, a former juror in the case, was talking about freedom
for herself, not the ex-governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm free of notoriety,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey, 76, is the once-obscure juror whose strange and willful
behavior in the trial deliberations thrust her into the spotlight
and placed her in the role of last hope for Symington. She was at
the heart of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeal's 2-1 ruling that
reversed Symington's criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   But the attention she drew - and the eccentric image of her
painted by fellow jurors - has brought her sidelong looks from
strangers and sporadic fits of media scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she felt a sense of vindication.
</P>
<P>
   The justices decided that Cotey should not have been removed
from the federal criminal jury, noting it was ``reasonably
possible'' that she was kicked off because she had decided
Symington was innocent, while the other jurors were con vinced he
was guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like saying what I think,'' Cotey said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as she did in summer 1997, Cotey seemed to be of two minds.
At one point, she said that, before leaving the jury, she had not
made up her mind about Symington's guilt or innocence on 22 federal
criminal charges. But then she said she saw no evidence that he was
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she added, everyone's guilty of something, so who is
she to judge? And no one remains innocent throughout their entire
life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey maintained that the appeals court ruling vindicates her
unwaver ing resistance to group pressure during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   She also shared her wishes for Symington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey guy: High five!'' she beamed. ``I can talk his language if
I want to. (But) I don't feel pretentious today.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington praised Cotey in his noontime press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mary Jane Cotey is a very brave young lady,'' he said.
``She was right and I think she's just a courageous person.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey said she hasn't talked to Symington since the day he was
convicted in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She phoned him at the Governor's Office, she recalled, and when
the secretary patched her through, she said she expressed her
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey said she was shocked that the verdict prompted Symington
to resign as governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see if they would get two governors within 10
years because they were both Re publicans,'' she said she told Sy
mington. ``They'' were political types, she said. Gov. Evan Mecham
was impeached and convicted by the Arizona Legislature and left
office in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Symington dismissed her conspir acy theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he didn't blame me at all,'' she recalled. ``He
told me I did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey's comprehension of events two summers ago in the U.S.
District Courthouse in downtown Phoenix is at the heart of the
appeals court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Symington successfully argued that the court violated his Sixth
Amendment right to an impartial jury when Judge Roger Strand
dismissed Cotey.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey claimed other jurors were trying to railroad her into a
deci sion. And in an affidavit filed with Symington's appeal, she
stated that ``If I had not been excused from the jury, I would have
voted not guilty on all charges against Mr. Syming ton.''
</P>
<P>
   The other 11 jurors had ap proached Strand several days into
their deliberations, complaining that Cotey was unable to focus on
their talks. For example, she refused to repeat back to her
colleagues the topics they had just discussed, had trouble filling
out her lunch order and often would ramble on, jurors said.
</P>
<P>
   Strand, after individually inter viewing the jurors, dismissed
Cotey from the panel during its eighth day of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The judge concluded ``that this was not a case where eleven
jurors conspired to remove a single juror simply because that juror
was being difficult or held differing views in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But the appeals court found that it was ``reasonably possible''
that the jurors clashed with Cotey be cause she had reached
different conclusions on the case than they had. If that was the
case, it was wrong to drop her from the jury, the court held.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey said it took awhile before her problems with her fellow
jurors surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gradually happened that I was being pushed into decisions
on almost every charge on each page,'' she said. Cotey explained
that she still had questions, and therefore had to hold out on a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the tack that was being taken,'' she said of the
jurors' objections. ``Dementia!''
</P>
<P>
   The label of a daffy old woman hurt her, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cotey said she didn't think Sy mington should be retried. But if
he is, she said she would ``watch it closely. Attend it if I could
... to see how this little piece of the justice system expands or
retracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey turned 76 this spring, and said the song ``76 Trombones''
was the theme for her celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The former bookkeeper and tele-marketer said she prefers to see
herself as unemployed, rather than retired.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she busies herself with friends and amuses herself
with Charles Le Roi, her white teacup poodle. She described herself
as a ``philosophical dabbler'' when she was being screened for jury
duty.
</P>
<P>
   She said her sudden notoriety was hard on both her and her
neighbors, drawing camera crews and reporters to her modest home.
</P>
<P>
   She said when she walks around, she tried to deflect attention.
``I say, `Hey, don't look at me, I'm invisible today.' Which makes
you a little more kooky.''
</P>
<P>
   Cotey said she hasn't been called to serve on any other juries,
al though she chuckled when a Mari copa County Superior Court
summons arrived in the midst of her work on the Symington trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally involved in a federal case now,'' she said, recalling
the excuse she gave to the county court. &QL;

 &HT;    Diggers say they're close to remains of Confederate sailors
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Archaeologists, looking for the first
Confederate sailors who died aboard the submarine H.L. Hunley in
1863, have found what appear to be two grave shafts beneath The
Citadel's football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery late Tuesday comes amid growing notoriety for the
first sub in naval history to sink an enemy ship, a saga to be
depicted in the July 11 premiere of the Turner Network Television
movie ``The Hunley.''
</P>
<P>
   Designed to break up the Union's naval blockade of the
Charleston harbor, the cramped, steel vessel sank in 1864. The nine
sailors who died then were actually the sub's third crew to perish
aboard the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are under way to recover the Hunley, along with its final
crew, in 2001. Discovered in 1995, the submarine is buried under 30
feet of water four miles off Sullivans Island near Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the second crew of eight sailors _ who died late in
1863 during a test dive _ are buried in Charleston's Magnolia
Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of the remains of the original crew of five had
been unknown until last year. The original crew died when the
submarine sank at its mooring in August 1863 after waves flooded an
open hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War buff Glenn McConnell, a Republican state senator from
Charleston, discovered a reference to ``the men of the torpedo
boat'' in old documents related to the old Confederate naval
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a search by ground-penetrating radar found evidence of
the graves underneath the stands of The Citadel military college's
football stadium, the site of an abandoned cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Digging started Tuesday just inside the stadium's cinderblock
wall. Heading a team of volunteers from Confederate heritage
groups, deputy state archaeologist John Leader had hoped to
discover skeletal remains by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Digging resumes today for the skeletons, which could be just a
few feet from the surface, Leader said.Chris Burritt writes for the

PERSONAL DRAMAS ASIDE, YANKS CRUSH DEVIL RAYS, 7-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Baseball bends for births and funerals,
and rarely bends any further. The game is played every day, and the
players are expected to be ready, and to perform. Paul O'Neill,
whose father is ailing, fulfilled both obligations Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill drove in a run and walked, and Orlando Hernandez became
the first Yankee to pitch a complete game this season as he beat
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 7-0, on a three-hitter. Eighty-two games
had passed since the Yankees' last complete game, when Hernandez
beat the Boston Red Sox last Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, revitalized since moving to the No. 2 spot in
the batting order, had two singles and two doubles for the Yankees,
and Shane Spencer slugged his first home run since May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Playing baseball provides no protection against reality. Second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch's father is suffering from Alzheimer's
disease, and Scott Brosius' father is fighting cancer. O'Neill told
manager Joe Torre last week that his father was suffering from
heart failure; on Monday, Torre received a call from Nevalee
O'Neill, Paul's wife, who passed on the news that Paul had to fly
back to Columbus, Ohio, to be with his family.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O'Neill had surgery Monday, and Tuesday, his youngest
son rejoined the Yankees, arriving in midafternoon. Paul O'Neill
was in the starting lineup Tuesday night against the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays. The baseball schedule relents for no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you guys go to to work,'' Torre said, speaking directly
to reporters, ``there are other things going on in your life, and
it's the same thing here. The only difference is we don't call in
sick here. We have to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had a strange experience while driving from Miami on
Monday night. On Interstate 75, he smashed into an animal with his
white BMW. Unhurt, Hernandez got out to inspect the front of his
car and to check on the animal _ and in the headlights of his car
lay a dead panther.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's car was still running, and when he arrived at the
team hotel, he told Jose Cardenal, his closest friend on the team,
about the collision, and Cardenal laughed heartily.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get here, he had to go through water with sharks,''
Cardenal said of the pitcher who defected from Cuba, ``and once he
gets here, he runs into a panther.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident did not bother Hernandez on Tuesday night. He
required only 40 pitches to get through the first four innings. He
allowed a single to Wade Boggs in the fifth, the 2,962nd hit of
Boggs' career. &QL;

FEDERAL PROSECUTOR PONDERS RETRIAL AGAINST SYMINGTON'S DEFENSE
ATTORNEY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like two heavyweights brooding in opposite corners of the ring,
John Dowd in Washington and David Schindler in Los Angeles eyed
each other warily Tuesday, contemplating the possibility of
renewing their bitter legal slugfest.
</P>
<P>
   Dowd, the Fife Symington de fender whose defeat at trial in 1997
was reversed Tuesday by a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, was jubilant but cautious.
</P>
<P>
   He has reason to be wary. He knows that it's up to Schindler's
team, the federal prosecutors who had their victory snatched away,
to decide whether to continue the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took their shot,'' Dowd said. ``They unloaded all their
barrels. Now, I'm going to try to persuade them that enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd, a former Justice Depart ment lawyer who has enthusiasti
cally bashed federal prosecutors for what he calls a malicious,
politically motivated prosecution of Syming ton, struck a
conciliatory note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll give us a hearing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schindler was keeping his dukes up. He had doggedly pursued
Symington on a long trail of suspect financial statements that led
to the guilty verdict. The only way talk would settle the Symington
matter, he said, would be if the former governor agreed to plead
guilty to felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler emphasized the plural form, drawing an immediate re
sponse from Dowd that there would be no plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although disappointed by the appellate ruling, Schindler said he
is willing to present the case all over again, with the six counts
on which Symington was convicted and the 11 counts on which the
jury was unable to reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This opinion is in no way an exoneration of Mr. Symington,''
he said. ``Nothing that the judges have written detracts from the
underlying fact that 12 members of a jury found that Mr. Symington
made false statements to lenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that two judges con cluded that a juror should not
have been dismissed does not undermine the case we presented.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler, along with co-counsel George Cardona, presented the
jury with dozens of what they alleged to be bogus Symington
financial state ments.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler refused to talk about widespread reports that he may
soon be leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even if that were true,'' he said, ``George is still here.
And there are other attorneys who could try the case, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler noted that part of Tuesday's opinion actually vindi
cated his case against Symington. The court knocked down Syming
ton's claim that prosecutors had failed to present sufficient
evidence to convict him on three counts of defrauding Dai Ichi
Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Symington has consistently main tained that although he ``made
mistakes'' in his financial reporting, he never committed the crime
of deliberately deceiving the lenders on his ill-fated real estate
projects.
</P>
<P>
   DKB lent Symington real estate partnerships more than $100
million to build the Camelback Esplanade.
</P>
<P>
   In its opinion, the court reported on the bank's requirement, as
a condition of continued financing, that Symington maintain a net
worth of at least $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is undisputed that Symington did submit affidavits
reaffirming his agreement . . . even after his net worth had sunk
below that level,'' the court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It added that Symington submit ted the false affidavits ``for
the purpose of influencing DKB to continue to disburse funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Schindler said that over the next few weeks, his office will
weigh its options, which range from refiling the case in Phoenix,
dropping it, to appealing it further.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects to seek a 30-day extension of the usual
two-week deadline to file a petition for a rehearing before an
11-judge panel at the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``en banc'' reviews, al though rarely held, include the
court's chief judge, plus 10 others whose names would be drawn at
random.
</P>
<P>
   Schindler would also have the option of appealing directly to
the U.S. Supreme Court, which typically agrees to review less than
5 percent of the petitions it receives each year.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, a former fraud prosecutor in Schindler's
office, said the most likely course of action is a refiling of the
case in the Phoenix court of U.S. District Judge Roger Strand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's someone this impor tant, and they've already made
such a major investment in it, I think they'll retry it,'' said
Levenson, a law professor at Loyola University in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that got them into trouble here was not the
evidence, it was the juror, something totally outside the evidence.
As we say in trial work, things happen. And here that will probably
mean a whole new trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Dowd is hoping to avoid another courtroom showdown. Noting that
the federal investigation of Syming ton began a decade ago, he
said, ``Nobody can stand that kind of scrutiny. I don't think
anybody should have to go through that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in the late 1980s that federal investigators made their
first big Symington find: that although his tax return showed
income of $100,000 from his real estate devel opment company, his
financial state ment to lenders showed income of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   That led agents to shift the focus of an investigation they'd
begun a year earlier, prompted by a report by federal regulators of
possible crimi nal conduct by former directors of Southwest Savings
&AMP; Loan.
</P>
<P>
   Symington served on the board of the thrift, whose failure in
1989 cost taxpayers nearly $1 billion. He left the board in 1984,
shortly after it voted to become his partner in the Esplanade
project, a venture that ultimately left the thrift with a
multimillion-dollar loss.
</P>
<P>
   Though no charges were brought against Symington's colleagues on
the board, he was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1996. In
September of the following year, the jury in Strand's courtroom
delivered the verdict that was reversed Tues day.
</P>
<P>
   The case was handled by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los
Angeles because when it began the U.S. attorney for Arizona was
Republi can Linda Akers. Akers wanted to avoid any hint of
political conflict that might taint the investigation. &QL;

COLLINS' CONTRACT EXTENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Angels general manager Bill Bavasi made two things
clear Tuesday _ he's in charge, and Terry Collins is his manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels announced Tuesday they have extended Collins'
contract. The club did not release terms of the deal, including the
length of the extension. It is believed the extension was for two
years plus a club option for a third.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, in his third year with the Angels, makes about $400,000
per season.
</P>
<P>
   The extension put an end to speculation that Collins' job was in
jeopardy following clubhouse dissension over his managerial style
and the team's poor play. Bavasi made it a point to tell reporters
during a conference call that the players' complaints were heard
but ultimately had no effect on the coach's status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't factor into talks with Terry,'' Bavasi said. ``We
take things seriously. If one of the guys has complaints, we
listen. But once we looked into it, it was over. To tell you the
truth, I was not very impressed with the complaints. It did not
impact us at all. The only thing that was a concern was that what
Terry and I discussed with the players ended up in the
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was Bavasi's hire before the 1997 season, and Bavasi
wasn't about to allow the team's players to tell him he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man's the manager of the ballclub,'' Bavasi said. ``It's
(the players') responsibility to react to what (Collins) wants
done. Not his responsibility to react to what they want done.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he is happy the situation has been resolved and the
focus will be on the field instead of the clubhouse or manager's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got unfinished business here,'' Collins said. ``I'm real
excited it's done, and we can move forward. But it doesn't change
the way I go about my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Player reaction to Collins' extension was indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it doesn't matter,'' pitcher Chuck Finley said. ``I've had
12 different managers so... I don't make evaluations based on my
being coddled or kicked in the butt. Give me the ball 35 times and
that's it. I'm low maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Randy Velarde, one of the players who met with
Bavasi to discuss concerns with Collins, said he thought the
meeting was for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was healthy doing it,'' he said. ``(Bavasi) was
hearing things through the grapevine about what was going on. He
got the veterans around a table, and we spoke. It was neat.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde also said he's noticed a difference in Collins, whom
players complained the only times he spoke to many was to scream at
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a credit to him,'' Velarde said. ``He's molded his
character for years, then he's asked to change. It's not easy. He's
been a lot more vocal, and he's handled his temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he hasn't changed and that his office door has
always been open to players. As far as being too emotional: ``Am I
more emotional than Lou Piniella? Than Tommy Lasorda? Those are
pretty good managers. We can mention a lot more. We all care, and
that's what matters.''

METS RALLY LATE TO SINK MARLINS, 8-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Marlins have the worst record in the major leagues. The
Marlins had dropped six straight games on their road trip. The
Marlins started a knuckleball pitcher who had won just two of 11
starts. So when Florida arrived at Shea Stadium Tuesday night, the
Mets should have been smiling and styling all night, right?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but it took them a good portion of the night before they
could fully smile and fully style.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets were baffled by Dennis Springer's fluttering
pitches for six innings, they awakened to score three runs in the
seventh and four in the eighth for an 8-2 victory. The Mets had
looked listless and helpless against Springer's knuckleballs, but
that changed dramatically with a flurry of late hits that enabled
them to exhale.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez, the shortstop who was touted before and during the
game as an All-Star candidate, poked Antonio Alfonseca's first
pitch for a run-scoring single that gave the Mets a 3-2 lead in the
seventh. Ordonez drove in two more runs with a single in the
eighth, and the Mets won for the 12th time last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez's offensive revival is stunning. The shortstop, who
entered the season with a .242 career average, is now batting a
robust .303. The offensive surge has his manager behaving like a
campaign manager as he discussed the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to evaluate it, I don't want to analyze it, I
just want to appreciate it,'' Bobby Valentine said. ``And I am. If
all those fans who came to the game tonight appreciated it, they
should cast their ballot for him. He has his sights set on Boston,
and I think he deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez, who has become a more productive hitter because he is
not trying to pull the ball every time, tied his career high with
three RBI. The Mets said Ordonez is now performing in games the way
he has always hit in batting practice, and the patient yet
aggressive approach has worked splendidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel more confident with men on base,'' Ordonez said. ``I
see a pitch, and I know I can handle it better. I'm more confident
in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Ordonez motivated by starting in the All-Star Game?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm elected, I'll go,'' Ordonez said. ``If not, I'll keep
playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ordonez's continued hitting did not provide enough flair,
Mike Piazza certainly did. In his final at-bat of the game, Piazza
smacked a 2-2 pitch for a home run off Vic Darensbourg in the
eighth to extend his hitting streak to 24 games and tie Hubie
Brooks' 15-year-old team record.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have three games against the National League
East-leading Braves in Atlanta this weekend, helped their situation
by taking the cupcake the schedule makers offered and devouring it.
By rallying to defeat the Marlins, the Mets are now three games
behind the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Orie ripped a two-run homer off Masato Yoshii in the
second to put Florida ahead, and then Springer almost turned the
rest of the evening into his own show. It is irksome for batters to
face knuckleball pitchers because they rarely oppose them and it is
tough to know where the ball is going. If the knuckler is dancing,
batters can look and feel helpless.
</P>
<P>
   Until the seventh, the Mets did. Robin Ventura, who had homered
in the Mets' second, started the seventh with a double into the
left-field corner and scored when Roger Cedeno swatted a triple
past sprawling center fielder Preston Wilson to even the score,
2-2. Alfonseca replaced Springer, and Ordonez singled to right to
give the Mets a one-run edge.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo added a run-scoring single in the inning as the
Mets came back and did not waste a solid start by Yoshii. Greg
McMichael (1-1) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the victory,
and Armando Benitez was dominant in finishing the last two innings
for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   There was a runner on first and one out in the second when
Yoshii tried to pump a first-pitch fastball by Orie. It was a bad
idea. Orie crushed the inside pitch and it was obvious from the
sound of the bat meeting the ball that the ball would sail over the
fence. The only question was by how much.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Orie's homer leave the playing field, it left the
stadium as well and landed 436 feet from the plate to give the
Marlins a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The lead lasted for a while, or until the Mets finally decided
to style and smile.

REST MAKES SHEFFIELD ANTSY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield knows there are times to rest. He
also knows those times aren't in the midst of a strong stretch,
which is why he was itching to return to the Dodgers lineup. He
missed all three games against Philadelphia with a sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a sport every day, you're going to need some
time so you can get refreshed,'' Sheffield said. ``Sometimes it is
(good), but when you're hitting well you want to be in there every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Before injuring his knee on a sliding catch in left field
against Pittsburgh, Sheffield was swinging the bat better than any
Dodger. He was 5 for 11 (.455) and hiked his average to .305, best
among the Dodgers regulars.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, the only natural No. 3 hitter on the team, had four
homers in his last 13 games and has 14 homers and 41 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was because of my back, but the injuries aren't
related,'' Sheffield said. ``I don't know how it got there, but it
feels pretty good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase will wait: Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said the worst
part of his pursuit of 3,000 hits is answering the same questions
day after day. The second worst part are the injuries, which have
cost Gwynn the better part of three weeks this season and also
knocked him out of Tuesday's series opener with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn left Saturday's game against Pittsburgh with tightness in
his left calf. He didn't play Sunday and was scratched against the
Dodgers after originally being in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   However, before Gwynn was declared a no-go, he sat down and
talked for nearly two hours about seemingly everything, including
his impending 3,000th hit. Gwynn entered the night 18 hits shy of
the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks I've tried to remind myself to have
fun,'' Gwynn said. ``That's what I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After legging out an infield single against Pittsburgh in which
the ball hit off the pitcher first, Gwynn's mind flashed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the base I thought, `God, I hope 3,000 is
clean,''' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the bases: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Todd
Hundley would likely return to the lineup Saturday in San
Francisco, though it won't be for good. He'll catch lefty Carlos
Perez, who is fighting to keep a spot in the rotation.... For the
second straight game, Adrian Beltre batted second for the Dodgers,
and Jose Vizcaino batted seventh. Beltre is hitting .302, but the
last time Johnson tried to bat Beltre second (mixed in with one
leadoff appearance) he hit .185 (5 for 27) before the idea was
scrapped.... Angel Pena was batting .150 (3 for 20) since taking
over the Dodgers' catching duties from Hundley.... Tuesday's game
was the first of 16 straight the Dodgers play against division
teams; 10 of those are on the road.... The Padres were hoping first
baseman Wally Joyner (left shoulder injury) would return during the
series, but it appears he may not be ready until the weekend....
San Diego plans to activate pitcher Andy Ashby (strained lower
back), so he can start the series finale Thursday.

AVERAGE, NOT CONFIDENCE, DOWN FOR GRIEVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Forget the term ``sophomore jinx.'' It
doesn't apply here, says Oakland Athletics outfielder Ben Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   The struggles Grieve had at the beginning of this season, his
second in the major leagues, were quite simply a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing more, nothing less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a slump,'' Grieve said before yesterday's
Rangers-Athletics game. ``Whether it's your second year or your
15th year, you have them, and they're just slumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieve can talk more comfortably about his problems hitting at
the start of the season now. That's because they're long gone,
vanished like the fastball he hit off a Tiger Stadium light
standard against Detroit's Dave Mlicki on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening weeks of the season, the 1998 American League
rookie of the year looked nothing like the player who hit .288 with
18 home runs and 89 runs batted in a year ago. On May 19 _ six
weeks into his second season _ the 1994 Martin high School graduate
was hitting .131.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on,'' Oakland manager Art Howe said, ``he was swinging
at pitches he doesn't normally swing at.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problem, Grieve seems to have found the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 19, Grieve has hit .369 (32-for-87), raising his
average 106 points to .237, going into last night's game. For the
month of June, he's hitting .352 and has driven in 17 runs during
his past 21 games. That's five more runs than he drove in during
the season's first 39 games.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Grieve is now more aggressive at the plate, saying
he's actually being more selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just relaxing more and not trying to do too much,'' Grieve
said. ``I'm getting better pitches to hit and I'm getting good
counts. It helps when you don't get behind in the count as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Things could get even better for Grieve during Oakland's series
with the Rangers, considering his history in Arlington. Going into
last night's game, Grieve was a career .377 hitter against the
Rangers, including a .421 mark with three home runs at The Ballpark
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers like that hint that Grieve won't be a .237 hitter for
long. Rangers manager Johnny Oates agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ben Grieve is a .220 hitter,'' Oates said. ``I
think he's closer to what he hit last year.''
</P>
<P>
   What should scare opposing pitchers most is that Grieve seems to
have his confidence back. Though he's hitting .053 against
left-handers (he has just 38 at-bats against them) he believes he
can hit anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel good, I think I can hit anything,'' Grieve said.
``It doesn't matter if it's a left-hander or right-hander. If I'm
feeling good I know I can hit them.''

RULING GIVES SYMINGTON CAREER OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES 
 and CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Gov. Fife Symington awakened Wednesday to a brand new
life. For the first time since his convic tion in 1997 and
sentencing in 1998, he may buy whatever he wants, apply for a new
real estate license, vote and even run for office.
</P>
<P>
   Symington lost those and other rights after a federal jury
convicted him in September 1997 of financial fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He suddenly was faced Tuesday with a swarm of reporters who
wanted to know whether he might run again for office _ a dramatic
turnaround for a man who now makes his living as a pastry chef.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to step out to face a phalanx of journalists
Tuesday, he turned to former aide Doug Cole and said, ``Just like
the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Symington then stepped up to the microphones for his first full
news conference since his conviction and told reporters that he has
no current plans to return to political life.
</P>
<P>
   He said later that his baking career, which includes learning
how to make wedding cakes, pull sugar and craft sugar sculptures,
keeps him busy these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've devoted a full year of my life. It's five days a week,''
he said. ``It's very, very hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Symington said he will forge ahead with his fledgling
cooking career, which will include an internship as a pastry chef
at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Syming ton insisted that ``politics is
far from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well into the cooking world,'' he said. ``I'm really enjoy
ing what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists that he and his family have moved on from his
troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann (Symington's wife) has been senior warden at our church
and doing a great job, finding a new rector and helping to run the
largest fiscal parish in the state,'' Syming ton said in an
interview. ``All of our kids have been in school. You just get
right back into living life and you try not to be too sad about
nostalgia, and sort of dwell on `Oh gosh, this happened.' That's
just not a constructive way to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another option for the ex-gover nor might be to return to real
estate, where he made millions but lost everything in the early
1990s. As part of a consent decree, Symington surrendered his real
estate license after he was convicted of bank and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Arizona Department of Real Estate said the
matter was under review by the state Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Symington gave no indication that he would seek to have his
license reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   When Symington was sentenced, he was also prohibited from making
major purchases, incurring new fi nancial obligations, or entering
into any financial contracts without the prior approval of his
supervising officer. He is free from those restrictions as a result
of the court's ruling Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the political commu nity was abuzz with speculation
over whether Symington might seek to renew his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Grant Woods said that Symington retains
enough popularity within conserva tive Republican circles to
recapture the GOP nomination for governor, but not necessarily the
nod in a general election, if he were to choose to run in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not surprise me a bit to see him run for governor,''
Woods said. ``I think it's a part of his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   But ASU pollster Bruce Merrill said the chances were slim that
Symington could resume a success ful political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``His time has come and gone and there is no way he can
recapture any significant office in this state,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative Democrats, noting smoother relations with
Symington's replacement, Gov. Jane Hull, also hoped Symington would
remain focused on his life as a chef.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Fife Symington era is gone,'' said Rep. Ken
Cheuvront, D-central Phoenix. ``His political life has pretty much
been ruined and I would hope he would not see this as vindication
for him to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Cheuvront said Democrats do not rule out the
possibility that Symington might seek to retake his gubernatorial
perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a man who has a great ego and I would not put
anything past him,'' Cheuvront said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Republican leaders believe it unlikely that
Symington will attempt to kick-start his politi cal career.
</P>
<P>
   State Republican Party Chairman Mike Minnaugh said in the two
years since Symington left office, many voters have moved on, re
placed by a new crop of residents.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a GOP no longer connected to the Symington era.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it really means that much for the party
positively or negatively,'' Minnaugh said of the Symington
decision. ``We don't talk about Fife Symington issues at all down
at the party.''
</P>
<P>
   While wishing Symington and his family well, Minnaugh suggested
the party has moved on from the scandal-plagued final days of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new people in Maricopa County _ people don't
even know who Fife Symington is.''
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's news conference, Symington proclaimed his relief
over the news that his conviction was overturned. It was broken to
him by a member of the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely stunned,'' Sy mington said. ``I'm very
thankful. My heart is full of thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously combative former governor was noticeably low-key
about the decision, while still assert ing that he would achieve
victory should the case be retried.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it should happen that there is a second trial, we will
prevail,'' he said. ``I always thought we were right. But I wasn't
sure (we would prevail).''
</P>
<P>
   Symington returned to cooking school after the news conference,
where his white-hatted fellow cooks waved to reporters waiting
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the hands of a superb German pastry chef,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One classmate of Symington, Eddie Bayze, said Symington was
``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy. I had dinner at his house. I didn't even
know who he was when I met him the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before heading off to school, Symington said he was postponing
dealing with his upcoming legal options for at least one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just savoring the day,'' he said. ``Let me enjoy the
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This has been a very humbling event. . . .It's just
too bad this legal thing interrupted a won derful public life.''

JACKSON CLOSE TO TWO HIRINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers are close to hiring two assistant
coaches, and at least one member of Phil Jackson's staff will have
Laker ties.
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers' holdover coaches _ Kurt Rambis, Bill Bertka
and Larry Drew _ remain in limbo, Jackson has offered positions to
Jim Cleamons, a former Laker, and Jimmy Rodgers. Both were Jackson
assistants with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the process of trying to get a deal worked out,''
Cleamons said Tuesday from his home in Chicago. ``I would love to
be part of his staff.... We're not there yet. But there's interest
on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleamons served as a Jackson assistant for seven seasons in
Chicago, winning four championships before a brief and
unspectacular stint as Dallas Mavericks head coach in 1996-97. He
was fired 16 games into the 1997-98 season.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Cleamons coached the Chicago Condors in the ABL
until the league folded, leaving him in search of a job.
</P>
<P>
   That search is close to ending and will reunite Cleamons with
his first NBA team. Cleamons won an NBA championship as a rookie
guard with the Lakers in 1972, his lone season with the team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cleamons and Rodgers, Jackson is also trying to
hire Bulls assistant Tex Winter, meaning there may be little room
on his staff for the current Lakers coaches. He plans to meet with
them when he returns to L.A. later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Power source: The Lakers are interested in signing Toronto's
Charles Oakley to fill their greatest need _ a rebounding power
forward who can play strong defense. And Oakley might be interested
in the Lakers, but he's sending mixed signals.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Sun, citing sources close to Oakley, reported that
he would pass on a more lucrative deal in the $5 million range with
Toronto to sign with the Lakers for the $2 million exception. Asked
about the Lakers, he told the Sun, ``I'm available.''
</P>
<P>
   But that same day, the 35-year-old Oakley also told the New York
Post, ``Toronto is my No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams and free agents cannot begin negotiating until July 1 and
cannot agree to contracts until Aug. 1.

games.)

 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza has not worn the same pair of socks or
eaten the same meal or left for the ball park at the same time on
consecutive days during his hitting streak because he believes
superstitions are silly. Piazza has watched other players obsess
over such trivial preparation, and he has promised himself that he
will never be so compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Piazza is casual, not compulsive, about the streak he
extended to 24 games Tuesday night, matching the Mets' club record
on an eighth-inning home run off a 2-2 pitch during an 8-2 Mets
victory over the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza was asked before the game about a streak that
started in Pittsburgh on May 25, he might as well have interspersed
his comments with yawns. He insisted he has never measured his
accomplishments by how many games in a row he gets a hit, and
besides, 24 might be a career high, but it was premature to get
excited. Piazza was more animated about discussing an Iron Maiden
compact disk he received in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say if it ends tonight,'' Piazza said before he
batted Tuesday night, ``I won't have any problem getting to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Piazza lacks the kind of speed that comes in handy to
leg out infield hits, his performance was especially imposing. And
in addition to his offense, he handles the most demanding defensive
position on the field: catcher.
</P>
<P>
   During the streak, Piazza has gone 36 for 102 (.351), with
eighthomers, nine doubles and 18 RBI; he has raised his batting
average a modest 24 points to .326. Despite Piazza's nonchalance
about his streak, he did know that Benito Santiago has the major
league record for consecutive games with a hit by a catcher. When
told that Santiago hit in 34 straight with San Diego in 1987,
Piazza remembered that Santiago set the record in his rookie
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alomar Jr., who hit in 30 straight in 1997 with Cleveland,
is the only other catcher to reach the 30-game mark. Hubie Brooks
set the Mets' record of 24 in 1984, which Piazza tied Tuesday night
with a towering drive to left in his final at-bat, after going 0
for 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Pete Rose have, 44?'' asked Piazza, obviously agog
over that achievement, which came in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine rested Piazza once during the streak,
against the Reds in Cincinnati nine days ago, and said he would
probably rest him again soon. Valentine could face a delicate
situation if he rests the catcher and then needs to use him as a
pinch-hitter late in a game.
</P>
<P>
   When Valentine asked Piazza about such a scenario, which would
put the streak in jeopardy because Piazza might only get one time
at the plate, Piazza told Valentine not to hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take a day off and the game is on the line and I have to
hit, what the heck,'' said Piazza. ``It's not like I'm not going to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine evoked Joe DiMaggio's majestic 56-game hitting streak
by saying, ``I daresay, before he gets to 57, he's going to have a
few days off.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine obviously understands how difficult it is for a
catcher to hit safely in so many games. Piazza came into the season
as a .333 career hitter, so this is not a mirage. Still, it is much
easier to stand in right field for nine innings and strive for one
hit a game than it is to endure foul pitches off the fingers and
flash signs for 150 pitches and pursue a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty impressive character,'' said Valentine. ``I
think it's more impressive when you play one of the more difficult
defensive positions and you have to maintain both sides of the ball
to a high degree of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   As Piazza fiddled with the Iron Maiden compact disk Tuesday and
gushed about its three guitarists, he grudgingly admitted that he
might take the streak more seriously if he closed within a few
games of Santiago's record. Until then, Piazza will keep changing
his socks, eating whatever he wants and leaving for the ball park
whenever he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, a hitting streak is not really one of those things that
you worry about,'' said Piazza. ``I haven't done that at any point
in my career. It's kind of cool. It's a nice little footnote.''

MARINER OWNERS DEVELOP `OUT' PITCH ON BALLPARK OVERRUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If only the Mariner franchise were as good at finding
pitchers as it is ferreting out loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, what is the point in being so adept?
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers cost money. Loopholes make money.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as part-owner Howard Lincoln put it Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   ``The controversy is worth it to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the first clear statement in this ownership group's
seven-year tenure about its priorities and intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Field of Dreams'' claptrap about blue skies and green
grass has always been a ruse to dupe the rubes into believing that
there is something more at stake here than money. There isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that Tuesday's ploy by M's ownership will leave
them branded as liars, betrayers and symbols of of corporate
America's reckless indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that they will drag the franchise, its followers,
the local legal system, the Public Facilities District and King
County (read: thee and me) through a legal battle of at least many
months and perhaps multiple years.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that they've figuratively defaced baseball's most
glorious new park, the Guilty Pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter that nothing in the legal harangue will make the
team any less enfeebled.
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that they have found a narrow, nifty little
legal argument that gets them, using Lincoln's word, ``there'' _
$60 million richer, thanks to a windfall of excess public money
accruing from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   My degree in the infield fly rule is insufficient to help me
determine the merits of the owners' legal argument. What I do know
is over the last year they hired two local law firms, as well as
one from New York, plus an investment bank, to analyze the
agreement between the club and PFD.
</P>
<P>
   The hired guns came to the unanimous conclusion that the owners
have a solid legal case against the PFD's claim that it is not
obliged to fetch the excess tax money for the owners.
</P>
<P>
   I'm willing to bet that none of the high-priced counselors
issued a peep about the consequences of lost community goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it doesn't matter to the owners. Goodwill can't
be quantified in cash. Even if it could be quantified, it would be
negligible to them, for a simple reason: Baseball's a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't Nordstrom abandoning its return policy. This isn't
Radio Shack doubling its prices. This isn't the Dahlia Lounge
serving Spam.
</P>
<P>
   For those highly competitive businesses, goodwill means
everything. But Puget Sound fans of major league baseball have no
other choice. The owners, including this group's many predecessors,
have always known it, using the cudgel for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   That's why ownership never blinked in the last year when the PFD
presented the cost overruns, which were mostly due to the
preposterous number of change orders dictated by the oppressive
Mariner construction timetable.
</P>
<P>
   The owners knew, but never said, that they were mapping a
strategy to recover later much of what was spent at any moment to
open the park on time. They also never corrected their supporters,
who won legislative votes for the stadium in October 1995 by
assuring that the public contribution was capped.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Mariner CEO John Ellis had the audacity to claim that
the only ``cap'' in the legislation was the Mariners' $45 million
in naming rights. Even more audacious is the Mariner claim that
they weren't fibbing when they said they were picking up the tab
for the overruns.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true they have paid the bills, they stayed quiet
until Tuesday about coming after the PFD for additional taxes
already being collected, money that is supposed to go to early
retirement of the county's bond debt.
</P>
<P>
   A mediator, or an arbitrator, or a judge, ultimately will rule
on the law. But in the court of public opinion, the owners have
already violated the spirit of the legislation and the public will.
</P>
<P>
   To that, the owners respond:
</P>
<P>
   So what?
</P>
<P>
   They know nobody can stop them.
</P>
<P>
   They know they're going to get blasted from this column to
Kingdome come, and it won't make any difference.
</P>
<P>
   They are absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Because even if they lose the legal decisions, or even if the
King County Council sticks to its position of no more public money,
the owners will hold hostage Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   If the tax money is denied, the owners will argue they can't
afford to re-sign the Mariner stars.
</P>
<P>
   The council will eventually cave, because it can't resist public
pressure. And the owners know the public will eventually come
around to their side.
</P>
<P>
   The owners know because:
</P>
<P>
   -- The new park will prove irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   -- When the rest of America abandoned baseball in post-strike
1995, the Mariner team and fans practically saved the game.
</P>
<P>
   -- Over the last three seasons, 8.4 million fans have forsaken
Seattle summers to come inside a concrete cavern.
</P>
<P>
   They know that sports fans are gullible, foolish, demanding and
love to blame governments.
</P>
<P>
   The owners will get their way.

NBA SORELY LACKING ALLAN HOUSTON-TYPE MAGIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ NBA watchers desperate for anything vaguely
resembling decent hoops were still praising the 34-point breakout
of the Knicks' silky swingman Allan Houston Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who wanted the ball and who actually could knock down
shots, was the reason the Knicks won Game 3 Monday and why they
have infused the Spurs with a case of the yips.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Houston eliminate any chance of a Spurs sweep, he
breathed new life into the resurrected Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But if Houston's dazzling array of midrange jumpers had deeper
meaning, it was to remind everyone what's missing in today's NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty. Flow. Ball movement.
</P>
<P>
   Offenses that use more than two-fifths of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Players who use their skills and smarts to peel off screens and
stick a 15-foot jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches who don't insist on calling a play every time their
teams cross the half-court line.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, there isn't enough Allan Houston in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is in a world of hurt, thanks to Jaws of Life defenses
(where have you gone, Pat Riley?) that are better suited to strong
safeties and middle linebackers than small forwards and shooting
guards.
</P>
<P>
   And without you-know-who around to satisfy our craving for
basketball perfection, the problems have become more glaring than
all of Broadway's klieg lights.
</P>
<P>
   Even the master of the midrange fadeaway jumper, Michael Jordan,
knew how to use the bump-and-grind game to his advantage. Remember
how right before Jordan's final shot ever, Bryon Russell was first
to swoop his shoulder down low and take a swipe at Jordan? Once
Jordan knew Russell had initiated contact, Sir Air was free to swat
Russell down to the floor and launch that championship-winning
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the NBA is going to do something about all this.
</P>
<P>
   That's what members of a special NBA rules committee said
Tuesday after an all-day meeting produced a short list of
tinkerings that made it clear that the league is not happy when
players are perpetrating more incidental contact than what went
down in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have less contact. It is not intended as a knock
against the officials, but as the game has evolved, there is too
much contact away from the ball,'' NBA vice president Rod Thorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   For that, the NBA is going to introduce four rule changes, which
should get a test run in the summer leagues after their likely
approval in the next three weeks. If they fly, the changes will be
seen in the preseason and into the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Think David Stern's glamour league would mess around?
</P>
<P>
   Two of the items aren't really rules changes, just
clarifications on how games are officiated and how illegal defenses
are called.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the grabbing, holding, the impeding of progress. We're
going to take a real close look at those areas,'' NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to establish guidelines to make them more
understandable to fans, players, coaches and officials,'' Thorn
said.
</P>
<P>
   A new 14-second rule, however, will be a substantive change. Now
when a foul or violation occurs in the front court when there is
less than 14 seconds on the clock, the shot clock will be recycled
only to 14 seconds, not all the way back to 24 seconds. That
includes kicked balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could result in four or five more possessions during the
course of a game,'' Thorn said.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference could come from a new 5-second rule,
one that will prevent players from eating the clock as they back
their man down in the post.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to know what to call this rule. The Charles Barkley
Ordinance. The Gary Payton Clampdown. The Patrick Ewing
Annihilator.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all NBA teams have resorted to this primary offensive
mode in which your best post player relentlessly backs down his
defender until he either draws the double team or gets off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be three or four guys were involved in the offense.
Now it's down to two,'' Spurs reserve Jerome Kersey said. ``Now
you've got a lot of people standing around and watching. I like to
be part of the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Kersey isn't the only one sick of this scenario. This two-man
game has driven fans to fits of boredom, because other than the
pass out of the double-team for the outside or weak-side shot,
offense has stagnated with the lack of cutting and passing.
</P>
<P>
   All of these items are not necessarily designed to upgrade the
league's scoring average, which at 91 points per game is lower than
anytime since the introduction of the shot clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about how the game looks and having to address that.
This wasn't a mandate to increase scoring, but if the game looks a
little better, then that's what we're after,'' Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   While this post-Jordan era has dawned on a thuggish, low-scoring
day, there are a few players who understand the game is best played
when it flows like art.
</P>
<P>
   Slippery, confident, skilled Allan Houston is one such shining
light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like (Walt) Frazier, (Earl) Monroe, Oscar Robertson,
those guys lived off the midrange jumper because it was something
no one could do anything about,'' Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the NBA wants to do something about making sure shooters
like Houston have room to operate. If the rule changes are
successful, the NBA then will have to make sure enough of its
players actually can shoot.

ABBOTT RETURNING TO FACE RANGERS ON FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Paul Abbott, back from knee surgery after a winter
ball injury, will be recalled from Tacoma and start on the mound
Friday night for the Mariners against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott, 31, made two recent starts in Class AAA, going 1-1 with
a 6.43 earned run average. In 14 innings, the obviously rusty
right-hander gave up 21 hits, but struck out 10 and walked just
four. He last pitched Sunday against Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think right now, preparation-wise, he's about
three-quarters of the way through spring training,'' Mariners
manager Lou Piniella said. ``His velocity is there. His stuff was
better this start. His breaking ball was better.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott was 3-1 with a 4.01 ERA in four late-season starts for
the Mariners in 1998, earning Piniella's favor.
</P>
<P>
   STAR IS BORN: When we last saw her, Tina Mares was diving for
groundballs, grabbing more ESPN-TV airtime than the baseball team
that employs her.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners ballgirl since has recovered from three deep
Astroturf abrasions _ one on each knee, a third under her right eye
_ she received while stretching out for a hard-hit ball in
third-base foul territory on June 13 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   However, the attention showered on her because of her aggressive
approach to her job has barely slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Mares, 18, will fly to Miami this weekend to be interviewed by
Univision, a major Spanish-speaking station. This comes after two
days of nonstop ESPN-TV replays; newspaper and radio interviews,
including one with ESPN radio; and being the subject of countless
``Plays of the Night'' TV features.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never got this much attention before,'' said Mares, who
graduated from Inglemoor High School last week, her school the last
to hold its closing ceremonies at the ill-fated Kingdome. ``But I'm
keeping my feet on the ground, my head out of the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Mares is one of 10 Mariner ballgirls who rotate through each
home-stand as well as perform a host of duties, such as escorting
the Mariner Moose through the stands, babysitting children in the
players' wives' lounge, handing out promotional items and
supervising the speed pitch machine.
</P>
<P>
   To become a Mariners ballgirl, Mares, now in her second season
on the job, had to work one year in another capacity for the
Mariners, then attend a tryout. Each candidate was given 15
groundballs of varying difficulty and speed.
</P>
<P>
   Mares answered a flier she spotted at school. She played soccer
and basketball growing up, but her interest in the Mariners grew
after the club's 1995 playoff run and the emergence of shortstop
Alex Rodriguez drew her.
</P>
<P>
   The teen has never met Rodriguez, but she played catch with
third baseman Russ Davis before a game. Bullpen coach Matt Sinatro,
reliever Frankie Rodriguez and former Mariners reliever Mac Suzuki
rushed to her aid after she received turf burns on her diving
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You took a hit,''' Sinatro said. ``I liked her. She
was a nice girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Mares, who will attend the University of Washington in the fall,
said her approach to her job is all reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basic instinct,'' she said. ``I saw the ball coming
really fast and I knew I couldn't get it in a regular position. I
just dove for it. I didn't get it, but it was OK. I heard loud
cheers. And I saw myself on Diamondvision, and that was pretty
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   BONE DRY: Mariner right fielder Jay Buhner, on the disabled list
with a pulled hamstring since May 19, has been pushed back another
week, meaning he likely won't play in the Kingdome again. Buhner
underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd have him this time,'' Piniella said. ``We're
not exactly sure now. It could be a week.''
</P>
<P>
   SEGUI SORE: Mariner first baseman David Segui strained his left
knee during Monday's 4-3, 12-inning loss at Cleveland and sat out
Tuesday night's game. Piniella said Segui's condition would be
evaluated daily.

FROM DAD, A WEEK OF FAMILY PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAN HOFFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What inspired Josh Sapan, a media mogul with the
unlikely distinction of being both tall and modest, to make the
normally competitive leaders of 66 cable networks play nicely in
the sandbox together, and agree to schedule family-friendly
programs in prime-time hours this week?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the feel-good memory of watching shows like ``Bonanza''
and ``McHale's Navy'' with his father?
</P>
<P>
   The feel-lousy memory of a 14-year-old sitting in an East
Village theater, watching his mother in LeRoi Jones' bloody play
about racial warfare, ``The Slave''?
</P>
<P>
   Or was it Rep. Henry Hyde?
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, with legislation that was ultimately voted down,
Hyde, the Illinois Republican, became the latest politician eager
to blame graphic entertainment for violent outbursts in young
people. How very nice for Sapan, the chief executive of Rainbow
Media, a large programming company, that the cable industry's third
annual ``Tune In to Kids and Family Week'' kicked off on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, at least 23 of the networks, including the
Disney Channel, Nickelodeon and the USA Network, featured the same
starting-gun show, a frank discussion among children and their
families about hurtful, offensive language and actions.
</P>
<P>
   The participating networks agreed to schedule at least a
half-hour of family programming one night this week. Most have
arranged more, with some 650 hours of such shows available. Of
course, one network's definition of what's fun for the whole family
will be different from another's, which is exactly the point that
Sapan wants to convey.
</P>
<P>
   For, typical of many of his projects, the week has both
higher-minded and bottom-line incentives. Three years ago, Sapan,
the father of two young children as well as the Big Boss of 15
channels, including American Movie Classics, Bravo, the News 12
networks and seven regional sports networks around the country,
cooked up the cooperative week so that an array of cable networks
could promote their family fare with a united boost.
</P>
<P>
   The week would provoke parents to be more active, critical
viewers with their children, Sapan reasoned, and would also be a
tonic for the industry's rambunctious image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're subject to a lot of controversy,'' said Tom Rogers, the
president of NBC cable, which owns 25 percent of Rainbow, a
subsidiary of Cablevision. ``And Josh has taken on an awful lot of
our big, white-hat efforts.'' (For the family week this year, Sapan
was joined by the heads of Nickelodeon and the Fox Family Channel.)
</P>
<P>
   And for Sapan, a man colleagues describe as ``not your typical
TV executive'' _ they mean that as a compliment _ the week has yet
another veiled purpose: Let the media demonstrate that they can
produce and identify G-rated entertainment so Congress won't insist
on taking a development meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Striking the balance between concerns over the media's effects
on public behavior and First Amendment protections ``is not a
simple thing,'' Sapan said Tuesday at a Manhattan studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a full awareness of legislative initiatives, and it's
part of our concern to avoid censorship,'' said Sapan, who is also
chairman of the executive committee of People for the American Way,
a liberal policy and litigating group.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his standing in the cable industry as a voice of
social awareness, he said, without sounding self-important, ``It's
quite worthwhile, in the community in which one lives, to watch out
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapan, a 48-year-old New Yorker, came by his political
earnestness and his near-lifelong fascination with TV the
old-fashioned way: Mom and Dad. His mother, who hated television,
was an Off-Off Broadway actress with leftist convictions (his
children call their grandmother ``LaMama''). His father, who loved
television, made commercials and, said his son, wrote gems like
``Ask the man for Ballantine!'' and ``Kiss your clothes with
Softness.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus the son, a University of Wisconsin graduate who started his
media empire by renting halls around the Midwest and driving to
them in a station wagon packed with a projector and art-house
films, turned out to be an enlightened capitalist who can utter
``commercial environment'' and ``sincere'' in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Let us not kid ourselves: Sapan wanted to howl with the big
broadcast dogs as much as the next would-be mogul. But reading a
book that predicted the proliferation of diverse, local
programming, as well as not being able to get a network job, pushed
him toward the nascent cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   He is known there for ``niche'' programming, which addresses a
distinct region or interest. In recent years, Rainbow launched the
Independent Film Channel and started producing independent films
and a trio of Metro channels offering events and shopping guides,
weather and traffic, and education and home entertainment programs,
fine-tuned for the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Sapan, married to Ann Foley, an executive at Showtime, which is
also participating in family week programming, said they allow
their 3-year-old and 5-year-old to watch about an hour and a half
of television a day. But like many parents, they are not enamored
of the scheduling and some of the content of children's shows. So
their children see tapes, rather than shows fresh off the screen.
``That way, the programming is more in our control,'' he said.

STRONGER OVERSIGHT OF MUTUAL FUNDS IS SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mutual fund industry's leading trade group is expected to
recommend sweeping new rules to strengthen independent directors'
oversight of funds, going beyond earlier proposals by Securities
and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr.
</P>
<P>
   If widely adopted by the industry, the changes would represent a
victory for Levitt, who in the last year has made strengthening the
authority of independent mutual fund directors a top priority. In
February, he was host at a discussion in Washington, at which
leading industry executives explored ways to increase the
effectiveness of fund boards.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials said Tuesday that while many of the 15
proposals were already in practice at larger fund families, they
thought they could prompt many smaller companies to change the way
they operate.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations, by a special committee of the Investment
Company Institute, would require independent directors to meet
alone _ not with those also employed by the advisory firm that runs
the fund _ to consider many of the most important decisions about
the fund, such as whom to hire as investment adviser and what their
pay should be.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations would also require that only independent
directors sit on audit committees; that they be able to hire their
own lawyers, and that they have insurance policies or
indemnification agreements with the fund so they do not have to
worry about paying costs of any lawsuits or proxy fights out of
their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also recommended that independent directors make
up at least two-thirds of a fund's board _ up from the current 40
percent _ and that anyone who worked for a fund's investment
adviser be prohibited from ever serving as an independent director
of that fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's the smaller fund groups where you'll find
that these things won't be as prevalent and where they'll have to
consider making some changes,'' said John Hill, an independent
director and vice chairman of the board that oversees all of Putnam
Investments' funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, who is also vice chairman of First Reserve Corp., a
Greenwich, Conn., investment firm, said he thought that the 10
largest fund families already tracked most, if not all, the
practices recommended. ``Generally, I think it sounds like a very
good list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other recommendations expected from the institute Thursday would
call for these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Require independent directors to set all directors' pay, which
has become a controversial issue as annual pay for many directors
now exceeds $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require independent directors to be self-nominating, which
Levitt had already proposed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Require greater disclosure of directors' relationships with
the fund's adviser.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eliminate separate boards for each fund within a family,
placing multiple funds under one board.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the proposals tackle nearly every issue that Levitt had
addressed, either in a formal proposal or by suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   While the trade group's recommendations are only that _ and not
binding on any company _ past proposals by the Investment Company
Institute on fund-company regulations have generally won widespread
acceptance in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt's attention to the issue follows several difficult years
for independent directors. Some have become embroiled in costly
suits and proxy fights after they challenged the way the funds were
being run. Indeed, in recent years the SEC has been criticized for
failing to come to the aid of independent directors in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   But while the SEC regulates the mutual fund industry, it is
limited in imposing new requirements without legislation, and thus
the commissioners often use their positions to try to persuade the
industry to voluntarily adopt changes.
</P>
<P>
   Through a spokesman, Levitt and other SEC officials declined to
comment Tuesday.

ATHLETICS RALLY TO BEAT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The American League West-leading Rangers
began defense of that position with a thud.
</P>
<P>
   Closer John Wetteland _ who inherited a one-run, ninth-inning
lead _ surrendered four consecutive base hits, including Miguel
Tejada's game-winning, two-run triple as Oakland rallied for a 5-3
victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Athletics within three games of the
Rangers, who departed with a bitter taste in their mouths after the
first of 15 consecutive games against division opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was feeling for everything the first few
hitters,'' Wetteland said. ``My breaking stuff wasn't as sharp or
close to where I wanted to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland converted a major-league-best 23 saves in 25
opportunities before last night. Oakland manager Art Howe called on
Tim Raines and Mike Macfarlane to pinch hit, and the two greeted
Wetteland with consecutive singles.
</P>
<P>
   Raines scored on an ensuing single by Tony Phillips, and Tejada
drove a 1-2 slider into the gap in left-center field, scoring
Macfarlane and Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had a tougher time getting started tonight,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``He was getting his breaking ball up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers attempted to rally in the bottom of the inning, as
catcher Ivan Rodriguez led off with a single against Oakland closer
Billy Taylor, then Rusty Greer walked.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez then lined a pitch into the gap in
left-center field, but Phillips chased it down and made a diving,
back-handed catch to rob the Rangers of what appeared would be a
game-tying, extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, it resulted in a double play when Greer
passed Rodriguez on the base paths between second and third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I did it textbook, I should have gotten to second
and stopped and looked,'' Greer said. ``But when it left Juan's
bat, I didn't think anyone had a chance of catching it. I was
thinking, `Score,' as soon as it left the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics' late-inning heroics negated those of left-hander
Mike Venafro, who pitched 2 2/3 scoreless innings in relief of
right-hander Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   Venafro served as the bridge to right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, who
recorded the final out of the eighth inning before leaving the
outcome in Wetteland's hands. Wetteland's failure was the bullpen's
first loss in 15 decisions since Wetteland failed to convert a save
April 27 against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take my chances,'' Oates said, ``with three outs to go
and Wetteland on the mound any day of the week.''

PIETRO DEIRO, 85, MAJOR FIGURE IN ACCORDION WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pietro Deiro Jr., a music publisher devoted to the
expansion of the repertory for the accordion, died on Saturday at
St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. He was 85 and lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Deiro, who was known as Lee, played the accordion and, though he
did not give concerts, had an important influence on the accordion
world. His publishing house, Pietro Deiro Publications, had a
catalog of nearly 10,000 works, ranging from educational materials
and music in different national styles to serious concert works by
American composers, among them Henry Cowell, Paul Creston, Alan
Hovhaness and Virgil Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   By establishing a literature of serious works composed
specifically for the instrument, Deiro helped give the accordion a
reputation for versatility when it had been used mainly for folk
music.
</P>
<P>
   Deiro came by his passion for the accordion naturally. His
father, for whom he was named, is considered by many historians of
the accordion to be the father of the instrument as it is known
today. He was one of the first to perform on the piano accordion,
on which a piano keyboard replaced the buttons on the right side of
the traditional accordion. The elder Pietro Deiro also made
recordings, started the publishing company that bears his name, and
founded the Pietro Deiro Accordion School in Greenwich Village,
with which his son was also associated. He died in 1954, and was
the subject of an opera, ``Opera Fisarmonica,'' by William
Schimmel, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Deiro was born in New York on Sept. 30, 1913, and
went into the family publishing business when he was a teen-ager.
He also followed in his father's footsteps as a member of the
governing board of the American Accordionists' Association. His
father had been the first president; Deiro Jr. served as president
and vice president at various times and worked on projects for the
association that included arranging competitions and standardizing
the notation used in accordion music and the terminology used to
describe the instrument's registration, sizes and timbres.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped select composers for the association's
commissions and published some of the commissioned works, including
Cowell's Concerto Brevis and ``Iridescent Rondo,'' Nicholas
Flagello's Introduction and Scherzo, Otto Luening's Rondo,
Wallingford Riegger's ``Cooper Square,'' Alexander Tcherepnin's
``Tzigana,'' William Grant Still's ``Lilt'' and Thomson's
``Lamentations.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Sandra Cattani of Manhattan, and
three grandchildren.

HOME LENDER AGREES TO STOP PRACTICES SKIRTING CIVIL RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The biggest home-equity loan company in the state
agreed Tuesday to settle a lawsuit that state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer had threatened to file accusing the company of
violating the civil rights of thousands of minority residents in
Brooklyn and Queens by enticing them into loans they could not
afford.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer had planned to file suit Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn against the lender, Delta Funding Corp. of
Woodbury, which handles more than $1 billion in loans in New York
and 21 other states.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators said the five-month inquiry found that the
company violated a civil rights law that was enacted in the 1970s
at a time when big banks were red-lining troubled minority
neighborhoods. In this case, they said, Delta was doing the
reverse: blanketing minority neighborhoods in New York with offers
for loans and giving credit to people who did not need it, with
terms prohibited by federal lending laws.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks of settlement negotiations fell apart this week.
But after Spitzer indicated he was preparing to file suit, Delta
agreed in principle in last-minute talks Tuesday evening to end
several practices that the attorney general said violated lending
laws and discriminated against minorities, officials with Spitzer's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging of these practices, they said, was providing
loans to people based not on their ability to pay but solely on the
equity in their homes. Delta also agreed to end a practice known as
flipping, or refinancing its own loans to defaulting borrowers and
assessing high fees in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The company will provide $6 million to restructure loans of
borrowers whom the attorney general contends have been mistreated,
and it has agreed not to move forward immediately with imminent
evictions. The company also agreed that for the next three years it
will open its books to the scrutiny of a neutral monitor, who will
report to a federal judge in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, we got the type of remedial agreement that we
think will change the entire industry,'' Spitzer said. ``Now we can
go to everybody else and say, this is the standard we expect you to
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on high-interest lending called the inquiry into Delta
one of the largest civil rights cases ever pursued against such a
lender. While dozens of states have sued high-interest lenders
during the last several years as the industry has mushroomed, most
have focused narrowly on lending and usury laws and not on the
wider effects on poor minority neighborhoods, where most of the
lending is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators with the attorney general's office said that most
borrowers in the Delta cases they reviewed were elderly. The loans
drained equity they had built up over decades in their homes and
led to ``extreme financial privations'' for many, who lived without
utilities or skipped meals to meet loan payments, investigators
added. In the worst cases, the loans led to foreclosures and
evictions.
</P>
<P>
   Delta admitted no wrongdoing as a part of the settlement, but in
agreeing to stop many of its practices and submit to such close
scrutiny of its competitive business it in effect conceded to most
of the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement Tuesday, Delta officials said they hoped
to ``lead the industry in implementing `best practices' for lending
which go well beyond any federal or state law requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   The average value of the Delta loans examined was about
$100,000, and the attorney general's inquiry looked at loans over
the last three years. A statute of limitations prevents action on
bad loans originating before that time.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the interest on the loans was as high as 14
percent and fees could be as much as 10 percent of the loan value.
Investigators from the attorney general's office said that in as
many as 15 percent of the loans they reviewed, Delta charged a
punitive interest _ which could be as high as 24 percent _ if a
borrower defaulted, a practice that is prohibited by a federal
lending law.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the hallmarks of Delta's lending practices
were high-pressure sales tactics that prompted many borrowers to
take out bigger loans than they intended. Sometimes, without the
knowledge of borrowers, their unsecured debts _ such as credit card
bills, unpaid parking tickets and even city liens for welfare
repayments _ were lumped into the loans and secured against their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, investigators said, the Delta loans replaced
previous mortgages with easy terms that were almost paid off,
greatly increasing borrowers' monthly payments while leaving them
with little cash from the new loan.

FINLEY WAVERS ON TRADE ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Pitcher Chuck Finley hasn't run to management
offering to waive his 10-and-5 status as a player. But when asked
if that meant he he definitely wanted to remain an Angel, he said:
``I didn't say that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Players with at least 10 years of major league experience, the
past five with the same team, have a right to refuse a trade. There
have been reports recently that Finley would waive his 10-and-5
status to be traded to a contender so the Angels could acquire
prospects. That is, assuming the Angels are out of the race by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't start any of that,'' Finley said. ``Peter Gammons did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gammons is a national baseball writer for the Boston Globe and a
baseball analyst for ESPN. Finley, though, wouldn't say Gammons was
entirely wrong. Finley, who is a free agent at season's end, has
spent his entire career with the Angels, but hasn't played in the
playoffs since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Finley doesn't want to be perceived as someone eager to
abandon ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be the first guy to jump overboard after the
first leak in the boat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck is a real good guy,'' general manager Bill Bavasi said.
``He's not just concerned about Chuck. He's always been a good team
player. I'll sit down with Chuck when he gets back (from Seattle)
and we'll talk about it. His heart's always in the right place.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi said other trades are always possible, but he doesn't
want to give up on what the organization has tried to put together
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The club you see right now is not the club we want to see,''
Bavasi said. ``But if we make wholesale changes, we might not have
the club we want when everybody comes back (from injuries).''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game against the Mariners was the Angels' first of 15
in row against A.L. West opponenents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time we have to make things happen,'' manager Terry
Collins said. ``You can talk a lot about interleague play, and
games we just played in Toronto and New York, but it's time to get
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's game at the Kingdome marked the first game of the
stadium's final homestand. After three against the Angels, the
Mariners play three against the Rangers. Then they go on a road
trip that will take them into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' first game at Safeco Field will be July 15 against
the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' game Saturday against the Oakland A's at Edison
Field is being promoted as ``Turn ahead the clock'' night. Both
teams will wear futuristic uniforms and Edison Field will be
enchanced to give fans a look of baseball in the year 2021.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Mariners play the second game of their three-game
series tonight beginning at 7:35. Ken Hill (3-6, 4.76 ERA) will
start for Anaheim against Seattle's John Halama (5-2, 3.79).

ROGERS CONVICTED IN '95 STRANGULATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After deliberating less than two days, a jury
convicted Glen Edward Rogers of first-degree murder Tuesday in the
1995 strangulation of Sandra Gallagher, whom he met in a bar in the
Van Nuys community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rogers was convicted for a murder in Florida and is on
Death Row there, his conviction Tuesday qualifies him for the death
penalty in California. The penalty phase of the trial began
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers showed no emotion when a court clerk read the verdict.
But before the verdict, Rogers smiled at a white-haired woman that
Deputy Public Defender Jim Coady said is Rogers' mother, Edna
Rogers of Hamilton, Ohio. She wiped tears from her eyes and later
left the courtroom refusing to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher's mother, Jan Baxter, also left the courtroom crying
and wouldn't discuss the conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, a 33-year-old mother of three, was at McRed's
Cocktail Lounge celebrating a lottery win of $1,250 that night of
Sept. 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of eight women and four men, as well as six alternate
jurors, began hearing testimony on whether Rogers should receive
the death penalty or life in prison without possibility of parole.
Baxter and other relatives of Gallagher are expected to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of this case, I'm going to argue that the only
proper penalty for a man who's taken all these lives is the most
severe penalty we have in this state,'' Los Angeles County Deputy
District Attorney Pat Dixon told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Coady postponed his opening statement, but he questioned
witnesses about Rogers' consumption of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution said Rogers' killing of Gallagher was the start
of a murder spree that took the lives of three other women that
Rogers met while drinking.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted in Florida for the stabbing death of
34-year-old Tina Marie Cribbs, in Tampa, Fla., in early November
1995. He is accused of stabbing to death Linda Price, 34, in an
apartment they were sharing in Jackson, Miss., on Oct. 31, 1995. He
is also suspected of stabbing to death Andy Lou Sutton, 37, in her
Bossier City, La., apartment on Nov. 9, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide manhunt ended with his arrest in 1995 in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   During the seven-day trial downtown, Rogers adamantly denied
killing Gallagher. He claimed it was a business associate and
friend, Istvan ``Steve'' Kele, who killed Gallagher after a night
of drinking that began with Rogers meeting Gallagher at McRed's bar
in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers claimed he only helped dispose of Gallagher's body by
burning it in her pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony is expected to resume today.

SLEEPWALK KILLING CASE GOING TO JURY
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's a trial that's had the city and nation talking
for months. But Wednesday a Maricopa County Superior Court jury
begins the only discussion that matters about Scott Falater's
sleepwalking murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides finished presenting testimony Tuesday. Wednesday, the
prosecution and defense are set to begin their closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Then the jury will start deciding the fate of Falater, who
claims he was sleepwalking on Jan. 16, 1997, when he stabbed his
wife 44 times and dragged her into the backyard swimming pool and
held her under the water.
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys say the mild-mannered electrical engineer had no
motive for killing his wife of 20 years, and the mother of his two
children.
</P>
<P>
   They contend a sleepwalking Falater went outside to fix a pool
pump using a hunting knife when his wife touched him, sending him
into a violent rage.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Falater intentionally killed his wife. They are
seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Reinstein decided Tuesday to give the jurors the
option of finding Falater, 43, guilty of second-degree murder
instead of first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   For a second-degree murder conviction, the jury must find
Falater killed his wife ``by conduct which he knew would cause
death or serious physical injury,'' according to written jury
instructions released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A first-degree murder conviction would require the jury to
additionally find the murder was premeditated, the jury instruc
tions say.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of first-degree murder, Fala ter could be sentenced
to death. Second-degree murder carries a sentence of 10 to 20 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys wanted Reinstein to tell the jury that it is
the state's job to prove that Falater was not sleepwalking when he
killed his wife. Reinstein refused.
</P>
<P>
   The final day's testimony focused on Yarmila's missing wedding
ring.
</P>
<P>
   The state has hinted at trouble in the marriage, including
disputes over Scott Falater wanting more children, and Yarmila
Falater's waning dedication to the couple's Mormon faith.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy County Attorney Juan Martinez showed jurors close-up
photos of Yarmila Falater's hand, zeroing in on the white line
marking her absent wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Chapman, the police de tective who led the investigation
of the murder, said he looked for the ring around the home's
kitchen and bathroom sinks, but didn't find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My initial thought was maybe this could have been a robbery,''
Chapman said. ``And when an individual has two gold bracelets on
her, but yet she's missing a wedding band set, it just struck me
odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, sleep expert Mark Pressman answered jurors'
questions, read aloud by Judge Reinstein. One asked Pressman, who
directs two sleep clinics in suburban Philadelphia, why he was so
sure Falater was awake.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman gave a laundry list of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   He started with the fact Falater was dressed to ward off the
winter night's chill, wore his contact lenses and grabbed a
flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That all sounds like preparation for going outside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressman also said Falater re turned to the body twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second time he came back, he was putting on gloves,''
Press man said, ``and the act of putting on the gloves is
absolutely unlike anything a sleepwalker would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressman said the way Falater dragged his wife into the pool
also showed advanced planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, he concealed all of the evidence,'' Pressman said.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder, Falater put the bloody knife and his
splattered clothes in the spare tire well of his car, according to
court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think hiding evidence,'' Press man said, ``is something that
a sleepwalker just wouldn't do.'' &QL;

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles coach Orlando Woolridge on Tuesday morning anxiously
approached the Sparks' first meeting with the Comets, calling it a
barometer to determine where his vastly improved team stood in the
early part of the WNBA season.
</P>
<P>
   He found out the Sparks are capable of fighting on even terms
with the two-time defending league champions.
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge also learned there's still a difference between the
Western Division opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets, after letting a 12-point second-half lead slip from
their grasp under a heavy assault from former American Basketball
League standout DeLisha Milton and Mwadi Mabika, held the Sparks
scoreless in the final 2:34 and came away with an 84-76 victory
before 10,479 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that an unbelievable game for television?'' coach Van
Chancellor asked, after the Comets (5-0) matched their best start
in franchise history in a game televised nationally by ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   So unbelievable, perhaps, that Chancellor brought a Bible
someone had given him to the postgame news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody gave it to me tonight, and I wanted to make sure I
didn't lose it,'' he said. ``But my thinking is, when you win one
like this, you're always going to be thankful. The Lord blessed
you. If you're not thankful, something's wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor could be thankful for another stellar showing by
Cynthia Cooper, who on Monday was named the league's Player of the
Week.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper made 13 of 14 free throws and scored a season-high 36
points against a Sparks defense that was surprisingly strong for
most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor also could be thankful for Tina Thompson's 11 points
and strong defensive play on Sparks center Lisa Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   There was room to give thanks for the play of Polina Tzekova and
Tammy Jackson, who were a productive force in the middle for the
Comets in the absence of Monica Lamb, who was hurt during the
morning shootaround and had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   And in the final 1:23, with the Sparks (3-3) desperately trying
to fire in 3-pointers, Sheryl Swoopes blocked two shots and
Thompson blocked one.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' tandem of Mabika and Milton combined for eight
offensive rebounds as the Sparks battled back from a 65-53 deficit
with 11:59 to play.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a fast-break layup by Tamecka Dixon, the 1997 Player
of the Year in the Big 12 at Kansas, that gave the Sparks a 74-73
lead with 3:41 left and threatened the Comets' superiority as the
last undefeated team in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been the final straw on a day filled with
traumatic moments for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's status remains uncertain. And the appearance of point
guard Kim Perrot at halftime to receive her 1998 championship ring
was a deeply emotional moment for everyone present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gone through so many emotions today,'' said
Chancellor. ``When Monica went down, that put us all down in the
dumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then Kim comes out to get her ring, I thought that drained
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go behind by a point; we can't stop them. But some way,
somehow, we find a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The early part of the game was just what might be expected from
two teams predicted to fight it out for the West crown.
</P>
<P>
   There were nine ties before a minor skirmish between Swoopes and
Leslie underneath the Sparks' basket just before halftime seemed to
fire up the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes and Leslie were each assessed a technical foul. Swoopes,
who had been fouled by reserve La'Keshia Frett before the shoving
incident, missed both free throws.
</P>
<P>
   But a 6-2 spurt, with Cooper making two free throws, Thompson a
layup and Swoopes a fast-break layup after a steal, resulted in a
46-39 halftime lead for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to determine that from the scoreboard, which briefly
went haywire.
</P>
<P>
   And with the public-address announcer keeping track of the
running score aloud to start the second half, the Comets used six
straight points by Cooper and a 3-pointer by reserve Janeth Arcain
to take a 57-47 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It twice grew to 12 points, the final time at 65-53, before the
Sparks began to do some damage of their own.
</P>
<P>
   They held the Comets scoreless for almost four minutes, forcing
them into three turnovers, then used three straight points by
Milton (13 points, 12 rebounds) and one of two free throws by
Mabika (16 points, seven rebounds) to pull to within 69-68.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting a tough game from Los Angeles,'' said
Cooper. ``They're a tough team to play, no matter where you play
them, because they're so talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were definitely looking for a tough game.''
</P>
<P>
   The basket by Dixon gave the Sparks a short-lived lead. But when
Thompson missed from 3-point range, Swoopes' follow shot regained
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes came away with a steal and another fast-break layup to
make it 77-74. After Leslie (a team-high 19 points) connected from
the lane to make it 77-76, Cooper's floating layup over the
oustretched arms of Leslie provided a 79-76 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson then blocked a 3-point try by Leslie. Swoopes followed
with a block of a try by Mabika, then seconds later slapped a
would-be trey from rookie guard Ukari Figgs of Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Just for good measure, Swoopes, with the clock running out,
thwarted a 3-point attempt by Dixon. Swoopes got the rebound, and
the Comets had the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been happy with the way we had played to this point,''
said Woolridge. ``We wanted to use this game with the champions to
see where we stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we won, that would be good. If not, it will be a learning
experience.''

BENCHING SPARKS NEWCOMER  
 DAVIS-WRIGHTSIL KEYS 2ND-HALF RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It wasn't a $500 fine by the WNBA or even being
taken out of the Mercury's starting lineup Tuesday that woke up
Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil.
</P>
<P>
   She made that decision herself after managing no points or
rebounds Monday, her second double zilch in three games.
Davis-Wrightsil even stood up before her teammates to say as much
after an 80-76 loss to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't contribute yesterday,'' she said. ``I was in foul
trouble, and I couldn't do a dang-gum thing. That bothered me, and
I felt I had a responsibility to say that. I wanted them to know
that it matters that I'm not out there being able to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is go in and do what I did today.''
</P>
<P>
   What she did was shoot 7 for 11, including three three-pointers,
in a 19-point second half to lift the Mercury (2-3) from a 19-point
first-half deficit to a 79-76 win over the Washington Mystics
(1-5).
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Wrightsil finished with a team-high 23 points in 24
minutes, the kind of scoring Phoenix expected in expending a
second-round draft pick on the 6-foot-1 forward and essentially
handing her a starting job from that day forward.
</P>
<P>
   But the 32-year-old sat out much of training camp to prevent a
tender right foot from developing a serious injury. Then after
three quick buckets in the Mercury's opening game, she went south.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, for an elbow to the throat of Cleveland's Eva Nemcova
on Saturday, and benching in favor of Lisa Harrison served only to
reignite Davis-Wrightsil, who scored an American Basketball League
playoff-record 36 points in Game 5 of the 1998 Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking in the locker room, she said, `Coach, you didn't have
to bench me to get my attention,' '' Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller
said. ``I said I'll bench you for the rest of the season if I can
get that type of a performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it works out, that will have been the master plan all along
when we drafted Clarissa and Lisa (Harrison). To have that type of
1-2 punch in the three spot. If we can get that consistently, I
really like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   With Jennifer Gillom struggling and starting center Marlies
Askamp slowed by a nasty right knee bruise, Miller went down the
stretch mostly with a lineup of four perimeter players _ Michele
Timms, Kristi Harrower, Davis-Wrightsil and Harrison _ and 6-foot-8
Maria Stepanova.
</P>
<P>
   Davis-Wrightsil scored 13 points during an 18-2 run that brought
the Mercury from a 59-43 hole to even at 61 with 8:34 remaining.
From there it was a tight battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have players out there who have been playing a long
time,'' said Mystics rookie Chamique Holdsclaw, this year's No. 1
overall draft pick. ``They can make the crucial plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a 23-foot three-pointer by Timms with 54 seconds left to
erase Washington's last lead. Then, after Holdsclaw's short jumper
fell short, the 5-4 Harrower rebounded and Timms made the second of
two free throws for a 77-74 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, who was 5 for 12 for 14 points, rimmed a layup that
Davis-Wrightsil accidentally tipped in for Washington. But Timms
hit two free throws at 4.7 seconds to ice the Mercury's first road
win and fourth straight victory over the second-year Mystics.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix continues its seven-game swing at Charlotte (1-3) on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington led 36-17 in the first half before an 11-1 Phoenix
run, including five points by Edna Campbell, cut the deficit to
single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's defense early in the second half was critical, Timms
said, in bridging the gap. Then Davis-Wrightsil caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When coach had words with us after the (Monday) game and asked
for any comments, Chloe (Davis-Wrightsil) was the only person who
said anything,'' Timms said. ``She just said I'd really like to
apologize for what I didn't do, my mind wasn't there. That must
have been a real kick in the butt for her not to start tonight.'' &QL;

FIVE WASHINGTON STATE TOWNS MAKE LIST OF WEALTHIEST PLACES TO
LIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ An elderly Medina couple have finally decided to sell
their tiny two-bedroom home that's endured more than 80 soggy
winters.
</P>
<P>
   But they're hardly delighted with the prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Not because they're losing a place where they shared decades of
memories. Or because they know the buyer will simply tear it down.
</P>
<P>
   It's the $325,000 list price. They simply thought, their real
estate agent said, that they could get far more in Medina.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to one of the country's top 250 wealthiest towns.
</P>
<P>
   Five Northwest towns made Worth magazine's 1999 list, ranked by
median home prices. All are in Washington and all but one, Woodway,
are on the Eastside.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents who sell multimillion-dollar mansions in the
48th-richest U.S. town of Medina, 50th-ranked Yarrow Point,
110th-ranked Clyde Hill or 157th-ranked Mercer Island aren't the
least bit surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Microsoft and Amazon.com have turned affluent
waterfront communities into Meccas for some of the country's
wealthiest people. Gita Ansari, an Eastside Windermere Real Estate
agent who specializes in waterfront property, says billionaires are
now buying posh homes that millionaires could only dream of.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some people, five, 10, 20 million dollars is not a big
amount _ they just want the best,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no shortage of opulent choices. Dozens of homes are
listed at more than $1 million on the Eastside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the strength of the high-tech industry may be the most
important driving factor in the high-end market right now,'' said
Kory Bockman, an economist for the National Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Plush stock options and bonuses offered by companies are
creating a new phenomenon: An increasing number of people are
paying for high-end homes with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Medina, which moved up from last year's 92nd-richest town
ranking, has long been known for considerable wealth and monstrous
houses, trends emphasized by the 40,000-square-foot mega-mansion of
Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly a dozen houses now for sale in Medina are listed at
prices topping $1 million, according to the Northwest Multiple
Listing Service. In Clyde Hill, there are seven. On Mercer Island,
22 on-the-market homes surpass the $1 million dollar mark.
</P>
<P>
   One _ a 9,000-square-foot two-story with gold-plated bathroom
fixtures, a $125,000 chandelier and a view of Seattle's skyline at
sunset _ is the largest, priciest house ever for sale on the
island, according to Ansari, the agent. Its owners, a couple with a
grown son who lives with them and another in college, simply ``want
to buy something bigger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ansari notes that many people who sell their large homes don't
go far _ many end up trading their mansion for another one in
another affluent Eastside town.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents say these communities are appealing to the
wealthy because of seclusion and prestige.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute you get into Clyde Hill, you feel like you're not
in the hustle-and-bustle of Bellevue or the crammed-in feel of
Redmond,'' said Thuan Howard, a John L. Scott Real Estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in a little, peaceful enclave _ you don't go through
Medina to go anywhere,'' said Windermere agent Laurie Hope, who is
selling the 1917 Medina house for its elderly owners so they can
move into a retirement home. ``And, quite frankly, it's the brand
name.''
</P>
<P>
   In Yarrow Point, a tiny peninsula town that catapulted in one
year from 195th to 50th on the Worth list, none of roughly 400
houses were listed for sale Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor were any listed in Woodway, a small town off the southern
tip of Edmonds (although agents occasionally list Woodway homes
under the more-familiar heading of Edmonds). Woodway dropped to
103rd on this year's Worth list, after reaching 65th last year.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 on the list is Jupiter Island, Fla., an exclusive island
of 601 people where a one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of
waterfront can fetch up to $3 million. Its median home sales price
was $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 California towns also made the list, as did many
upscale communities in New York and New Jersey. Aspen, Colo.,
ranked second, dropping from first place last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, people are buying houses as never before: 1998 was a
record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78 million houses
changed hands, according to the National Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   The West showed the greatest year-to-year existing-home-price
appreciation: 7.23 percent, according to association's data.
</P>
<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the real estate
market shows few signs of slowing down. Nationally, says Bockman,
``our numbers are actually coming out ahead of where we were last
year.''

WITH KIDS, FULL SCHEDULE GETS FULLER  
 GROWING NUMBERS FACE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Intimidating ponderosa pines frame Camp Tontozona, but
they do not shield Willie Daniel from his reality. Despite the
horns, whistles and helmet-to-shoulder thuds, the Arizona State
safety hears one gentle sound loud and clear.
</P>
<P>
   ````Daddy.''''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's interaction with his 1-year-old son, Tristen, at the
Sun Devils' preseason camp last August was a moving snapshot, but
it told only one side of a complicated story. A wide-angle lens on
the athletic landscape of Arizona's high schools and universities
reveals a growing number of players with children.
</P>
<P>
   An already challenging situation _ early parenthood _ is
compounded by the demands of athletics. And it affects everything
and everyone it touches, from the program to the player to the
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard enough to go to school and play football,'' ASU
Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``You add anything else, any hardship, and
it makes life more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   How widespread is early parenthood?
</P>
<P>
   An informal survey by ``The Arizona Republic'' found 18 athletes
on last season's Arizona and Arizona State football rosters who
acknowledge fathering children. Five were married or were
subsequently married; two dropped out of school, in part because of
their added responsibilities; and at least one has been taken to
court for child support.
</P>
<P>
   High school athletes with children are also common in Arizona.
Although no records are kept, the high numbers likely reflect
reality in a state that, while making inroads, still ranks fourth
in the nation in teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here. I'm alive. I'm surviving,'' said Kisha White, a
senior on the ASU's women's basketball team last season who has a
4-year-old son. ``But there were times I was crying behind closed
doors. There was a two- or three-month period I felt like giving
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Their worlds blur.
</P>
<P>
   Timeout becomes a disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
   Dribbling implies the need for a bib.
</P>
<P>
   A sweep is something to do after the Cheerios have been dumped
for the 15th time.
</P>
<P>
   Real life invades sports as young men and women try to juggle
athletics, academics and parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had players miss practice to be in the delivery room,''
ASU assistant football coach Robin Pflugrad said. ``I don't know if
the numbers are greater, but it sure seems like the last five, six
years it has become more prevalent.''
</P>
<P>
   So have the questions. From where comes the financial support?
Who takes care of the children? How willing to adjust are schools
and athletic programs? How is the athlete's future affected? &QL; 
The price to pay
</P>
<P>
   Although Nichole Myers had been dating ASU safety Mitchell
Freedman for more than a year, when she found out in 1997 that she
was pregnant, ``it was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew I didn't want to be real old to have kids, but I
was nervous,'' she said. ``Where am I going to stay? How will I
support him? What about baby-sitting?''
</P>
<P>
   When Mitchell Freedman Jr. was born in November 1997, near the
end of Freedman's junior season, reality hit. After tuition and
fees, a full in-state scholarship at ASU leaves approximately
$3,050 for room and board. Divide that by nine school months, and
$339 a month for rent, food and baby necessities doesn't go very
far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scholarship was not meant for more than one person,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who was 20 when she found out she was pregnant, was
determined to make it work. She knew that because of Freedman's
academic and athletic demands, the brunt of child rearing and
financial support would fall on her. She had been there before for
Freedman's hard times _ academic and financial _ and she believed
they could weather this challenge as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one who kept me out of trouble, watched over me,
helped me out,'' Freedman said. ``When I was in college, she helped
support me. I owe everything in the world to her.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been easy. Myers wakes up at 5 a.m., loads her
sleeping son into the car, drops him off at Freedman's sister's
home in Phoenix and ends her 30-plus-mile drive at a Tempe Bank of
America, where she works in the legal department, by 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   As with many of the parents interviewed for this story, family
members have made the process easier.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and her son live with Myers' mother, stepfather and
siblings in a comfortable home. Family members from both sides have
helped with child care.
</P>
<P>
   Myers' salary from the bank takes care of most of her son's
expenses while Freedman participates in training camp with the
NFL's Oakland Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is, he knows who his daddy is,'' said Freedman,
who signed with Oakland as an undrafted free agent. ``It's hard
financially, and during school I didn't have much. I wanted to give
my son the whole world. We managed, had to budget a lot of stuff.
The main thing is we stay together as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers and Freedman are still together, and Freedman makes
frequent trips to Myers' house to see his son. He said he hopes for
a future in the NFL that will allow him to be a greater contributor
to his son's needs and envisions settling down with Myers
permanently in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be someone spreading children around,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Myers is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he isn't here, he wants to be here,'' Myers said. ``I've
pretty much said, `OK, just be here as fast as you can.' Although
his son comes first, I know football is his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Has it been worth it? Yes. It's stopped me from going out,
going to parties, drinking, whatever people are doing. Nowadays
they're getting into really bad trouble. Sometimes I miss it, but
then I think about my baby. He needs me first.'' &QL; 
Bumps in the road &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is able to juggle the demands of parenthood. Two of
ASU's key players heading into the 1998 season, linebacker Larry
Johnson and running back Marlon Farlow, never made it back to the
program. While academic ineligibility was the official reason, the
challenges both faced in trying to be good fathers weighed
significantly into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   Both declined to comment for this story, but Johnson, in a
previous interview with ``The Arizona Republic,'' said, ``The
demands of everything, school, family, got to be too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's son, Elijah, who was born after the player's sophomore
season, is now an upbeat 2-year-old with an attentive father and
mother who are both actively involved in raising him. &QL; 
Angels in the backfield &QL; 
Willie Daniel was a standout athlete at St. Mary's High School when
he learned that his girlfriend, Leah Vance, a Xavier student, was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, nervous, in awe and scared. ``Really''
scared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel's own childhood had been difficult. In his early teens,
problems at home resulted in him living in a variety of friends'
houses for several days at a time. He eventually moved in
permanently with Bill and Cindy Stine, a couple who had befriended
him several years earlier during their involvement with youth
basketball. The Stines, who are White, were particularly sensitive
to the plight of inner-city youth and had taken in Daniel's close
friend, Jacoury Houston.
</P>
<P>
   When Daniel told them his girlfriend was pregnant, they were
floored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to believe someone like Willie could be another
statistic,'' said Cindy Stine, a private investigator. ``Willie's
still in high school. Willie's the homecoming king. This doesn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Stine, a criminal defense attorney, took it hard. Although
they hadn't legally adopted Daniel, for all intents and purposes,
he was their son. He was hard on Daniel: ``You're just going to be
another statistic. You're going to have to drop out of school to
raise this child, or you're just going to walk away like all the
others do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty harsh,'' Bill Stine said. ``I was very
disappointed, very shocked. I really wasn't thinking right for a
while. I had all the normal reactions that a father would have to a
son.''
</P>
<P>
   Two promising futures looked bleak. Willie was fielding a
variety of football scholarship offers. Vance was a classroom
standout who is now on academic scholarship at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   Tristen Vance was born during the summer before Daniel's senior
year in high school. Tristen initially lived with his mother and
her family in Tempe and made frequent trips to the Stines' home in
north Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But by last fall, when Daniel entered ASU on a football
scholarship, it seemed to make sense, for all parties, that Tristen
live with the Stines so that Daniel and Vance could focus on
school. Now almost 2, Tristen has his own room, filled with
pictures of both parents, in the Stine's new north Scottsdale home.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Leah) has got her future ahead of her, Willie's got his
future ahead of him,'' Stine said. ``We feel it's important that
they be allowed to do what they need to do to benefit Tristen in
the end. We simply feel like surrogate parents until Leah and
Willie are old enough to step in and take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, the little guy isn't going to be helped by
Willie dropping out of school and flipping hamburgers at
McDonald's. That's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Vance and Daniel, who are no longer together, see and talk
to Tristen often. The Stines simply see their home as a temporary
one for Tristen until his parents are back on their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think I can describe what they are,'' Daniel
said. ``They're like guardian angels. They stepped up and wanted to
do this so that his mother and I can make a better situation for
him later on. A lot of kids do it by themselves. We're both very,
very grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the generosity of the Stines, who provide much of
Tristen's financial support, Daniel and Vance have paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel is working as a host at a Tempe restaurant this summer to
help with expenses. Free time that could be spent with friends is
often spent with Tristen instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your social life tends to deteriorate, but then again, (the
Stines) have stepped in and let me be a teenager again,'' Daniel
said. ``But I like to spend time with him anyway. He's brilliant,
he's smart, he amazes me every day. I'd give up anything for
him.'' &QL; 
Coping skills &QL; 
The challenges faced by female athletes who become parents can be
even more demanding.
</P>
<P>
   When Kisha White, then a member of the Yavapai College women's
basketball team, learned she was pregnant, she wondered if her
career was over. But after taking a year off to start raising her
son, Christopher, she was able to return to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The former South Mountain High School student lived with
Christopher's father in Prescott, so they were able to share
responsibilities. The coaches at Yavapai welcomed her son at
practices and on road trips during the 1995-96 season, which she
said made life easier.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest challenges came during her junior walk-on season at
ASU, when she had school, Chistopher and 30 hours of work a week at
a bank to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, even I don't know how I did it,'' White said.
``I was on borrowed time. I didn't have time for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   White, who recently completed her final season at ASU, lives
with Christopher at her mother's Phoenix home. She hopes to
continue her basketball career overseas. Although she and
Christopher's father are no longer dating, he is still a big part
of his son's life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ASU volleyball standout Terri Cox learned she was pregnant
midway through her senior season. She opted not to tell her coach,
a decision she now regrets. She already had a sometimes tenuous
relationship with Coach Patti Snyder-Park, and Cox's sudden
decision to tone down her aggressive play added to the tension.
</P>
<P>
   Justine Spann was born May 1, 1998. Although the following
school year was tough, Cox and her boyfriend, ASU wide receiver
Creig Spann, were able to work it out. Their combined scholarship
money took care of the basics, and the support of family and
friends, who gave them enough diapers at their baby shower to last
six months, helped them through.
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that Spann had just one class during his final
semester, the fall of 1998, so he could watch the baby while Cox
was at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last semester, I was only taking two classes, but it was
the hardest time for me ever,'' Cox said. ``I was juggling school
with her, and even though Creig was there helping me, there were
times I would be doing a paper and she would want me to play with
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped to have really supportive families, and Creig and
I have met a lot of good people that are in our lives now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the scholarship money ran out, Cox knew it was time to get
creative. While Spann is in training camp with the Oakland Raiders,
also trying to hook on as a free agent, she works as a nanny at a
home that allows her to bring her daughter. She hopes to land a job
as a volleyball coach, and the two plan to get married once they
are settled into their careers. &QL; 
Study shows mixed results
</P>
<P>
   Although research on pregnancy and young athletes is minimal,
one recent study gave high marks to female athletes and mixed
results to males. A Women's Sports Foundation study found that
female teen athletes are less than half as likely to get pregnant
as female non-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   No consistent pattern of differences emerged between male
athletes and non-athletes, although a survey of Western New York
athletes revealed that male athletes typically experience their
first sexual intercourse earlier than male non-athletes. The study
also found that African-American male athletes start earlier than
non-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we have sex-segregated social settings, whether
it's the military, a motorcycle gang or a football team, it tends
to lead to exaggerated macho posturing, and sometimes subsequently,
parenthood,'' said Don Sabo, a professor of social science at
D'Youville College in Buffalo, N.Y., who has written several books
and studies on sexuality and athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys will do things, or say things, in order to play
up to the cultural expectation. Masculinity is more a performance
than a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of race is one experts have cautiously tried to
address. While the majority of young parents interviewed for this
story are African-American, that's in large part a reflection of
the makeup of teams. In 1997, blacks had the largest race
representation among Division I college athletes in basketball (61
percent) and football (52 percent).
</P>
<P>
   It may be a societal statement as well. According to a recent
study by the National Center for Health Statistics, 70 percent of
Black children nationwide are born to unmarried mothers. But plenty
of non-Black athletes, particularly at the professional level, have
made headlines for paternity-related issues, including Indiana
Coach Larry Bird. &QL; 
What stigma?
</P>
<P>
   The shame that used to accompany a child born out of wedlock is
all but gone, and that's certainly the case in the world of
athletics. Children often are seen waiting outside college locker
rooms after games.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona guard Jason Terry would talk freely about his
daughter Jasionna, and had her name tattooed on his right arm.
Former Wildcats guard Mike Bibby, now a member of the NBA's
Vancouver Grizzlies, told ``The Arizona'' ``Republic'' last year
that his son, Michael Dane, made him a better person and player.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's Daniel said he's not worried about others' perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not anything I'm afraid of, or embarrassed about, or
really care if anyone thinks bad about that situation,'' he said.
``I'm young, I have a kid, things happen, but he's here now. I love
him more than life, and I don't care if anyone has a problem with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU cornerback Courtney Jackson, who does not have any children
but is friends with several teammates who do, said sometimes it's
the reputation of the female who gets involved with a male athlete
that suffers most.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's accidental, the truth is the girl may be the one
looked down upon more than the guy, just because of the
situation,'' he said. ``The perception, not to say it's fair, is
they know what you're about to have, and that's why they're doing
it.'' &QL; 
Issues for coaches
</P>
<P>
   College coaches now have to take children into account when
they're recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very challenging recruiting someone from out of
state if they have a child or two,'' said Pflugrad, ASU's
recruiting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   And how should missed practices be handled? Where does the coach
draw the line about a player attending to a child's needs? Does a
doctor's appointment take precedence over a practice in full pads?
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of what happened at Columbine High School, and the
message that we need to be there for our children, I think the
answer is pretty obvious,'' Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Jo Angelini, the executive director of the non-profit
Arizona Coalition on Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting, would like
to see coaches at all levels become more involved in helping to
lower the percentage of teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that coaches can be very influential, and sports is an
arena that we need to be entering,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Professional sports has seen a need to address the dangers of
casual sex. All four major sports leagues feature rookie
orientations that include discussions about sexual responsibility.
NFL teams are involved in an initiative sponsored by the U.S.
Department of Child Services that promotes involvement by fathers
in their kids' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christopher's the greatest thing to happen to me, but if I
could have delayed it, I sure would have,'' White said. ``Having a
kid, it's hard work, and anyone who says it's not doesn't plan on
being a good parent.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Phil Mickelson is not the first golfer to play in a
major championship while nine months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   OK, ``he'' wasn't pregnant. His wife was. But Phil was
``expecting,'' and the impending birth of the couple's first child
became a national story.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson announced that if Amy went into labor during the U.S.
Open, he would withdraw immediately and fly home to Scottsdale,
even if he were leading.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of their daughter was more important to him than
winning the national championship and $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   So the Open became a race against time. After each round,
Mickelson described his birdies and bogeys. Then someone in the
press tent would raise a hand and ask about Amy. His face lighting
up, the proud father-to-be said he had just spoken with her on the
phone. Everything was fine. No change. Then Phil would begin using
words like pelvis and cervix. Some in the audience traded sidelong
glances and thought, ``This is more than I want to'' ``know''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Loss was a blessing &QL; 
Sunday, Mickelson finished second to Payne Stewart. He flew home
and slept like a baby. Every two hours he woke up and cried.
</P>
<P>
   (Insert rim shot here).
</P>
<P>
   But in public Mickelson masked his heartache with a smile. He
reminded himself this isn't the end of his career. He will have
other chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next June, we're going to have another U.S. Open,'' Mickelson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a minute,'' one reporter said, ``I thought you were going
to tell us you're going to have another ``baby.''''
</P>
<P>
   The room broke up in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Payne Stewart did Mickelson a favor. Stewart sank
a 15-foot par putt on the last hole to win his second Open. Had he
missed, the two would have played 18 more holes on Monday _ the day
Phil's daughter was born.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson vowed he would go home if called, even during a
playoff. His wife went into labor about the same time Mickelson and
Stewart would have been playing the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   What if Lefty had been leading?.
</P>
<P>
   What a story. Phil, 2 under, picks up his ball on the 10th hole,
shakes Stewart's hand and concedes the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Phil would win Father of the Year. Oprah would invite him on her
show. But for the rest of his life. the former ASU star who hasn't
won a major would have asked himself, ``What if?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I had stayed? Would I have won the Open?''
</P>
<P>
   Other players have had to make difficult decisions that pit
career and family. The late Dave Marr won the 1965 PGA championship
the same day his son was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way Dave was going home,'' author Dan Jenkins said fondly
of his longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Calcavecchia decided not to play in the 1989 British Open
in Scotland because his wife was expecting. Sheryl insisted he go.
That weekend she experienced contractions. ``I knew he would come
back immediately,'' Sheryl told ``The Republic,'' ``but I didn't
think there was time.''
</P>
<P>
   Calcavecchia won the British Open. Two weeks later, the couple
had its first child. In honor of Mark's victory, the parents named
her Britney Jo. &QL; 
Timing is everything &QL; 
As it turned out, Mickelson got to experience that panicky
ohmygosh-keys!-don't-worry-honey! excitement that seizes husbands
when gently informed that they probably should get to the hospital,
and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Timing, they say, is everything, and the Mickelson's first child
(due June 30) timed her arrival perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Her dad had less than 24 hours to brood over the most
disappointing day in his golf career.
</P>
<P>
   Now he doesn't have time to dwell on what happened on those last
three holes. He has a little girl who demands all his time and
attention.
</P>
<P>
   So, welcome, Amanda. Say hi to your dad. And if the day comes
when your parents ask if you would like a baby brother or sister,
tell them yes, but this time, try to make it the second week in
July, during the Greater Milwaukee Open. &QL;

TRUCK DEBUT TURNS SOUR NEAR FINISH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - Memo to  &UR; Jack Sprague from rookie  &UR; Ross  &UR; Thompson:
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the slide job, pal.
</P>
<P>
   Just when Thompson believed a top-10 finish in his NASCAR
Craftsman Truck Series debut Friday at Portland, Ore., was within
grasp, someone stuck a pin in his balloon.
</P>
<P>
   Someone named Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Sprague had to flex his muscles and, unfortunately, he
got into us,'' said Thompson, referring to his NASCAR Craftsman
Truck Series debut last Friday at Portland. ``We were running fifth
for a lot of laps, then (Sprague), who was (several) laps down,
punted us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it was just one of those racing deals. Someone checked
up in front of me, and I had to swerve to the inside. I clearly had
the line, but the next thing I know, I'm in the grass spinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These (truck regulars) are gunfighters. Every lap it's 120
percent. Even if they're a couple laps down, they're racing for
blood. It's still extremely disappointing for me and very
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention very costly.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, which wasn't major enough to force a caution flag,
apparently broke the gearbox in Thompson's RoomStore/Sealy Ford
F-150, saddling the Phoenix driver with an eventual 19th-place
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteenth place paid $7,020.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place paid $13,670.
</P>
<P>
   More than the money, however, Thompson was hoping a good finish
would entice team sponsors to ante up more dollars for more races
this season.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, Thompson's next probable start won't be until
late August.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For never having driven a truck before, I was very
impressed,'' NASCAR official  &UR; Owen Kearns said. ``I felt like he
did a heck of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, however, could be  &UR; Richard Petty and it still wouldn't
matter without a major sponsor to help fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we can attract some more sponsors, we'll be sitting out
for a couple of months,'' said Thompson, who has one top-10 finish
in three NASCAR Winston West series starts this season for owner
Dan Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson won't be sitting on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, a former instructor at the Bob Bondurant School of
High Performance Driving, is working the telephone in hopes of
landing a ride in this weekend's NASCAR Southwest Series race at
Sears Point (Calif.) Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   If no one answers, Thompson remains in demand as an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson's preference is obvious. He'd rather be behind the
steering wheel, not outside coaching someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sealy Mattress wants to see what kind of exposure results they
got from the truck race,'' Thompson said. ``At this point, it's
kind of up to them how involved they want to be with us. But we're
hoping we can put something together for more races this season.'' &QL; 
Father's Day tribute &QL; 
 &UR; Chuck Trickle, whose son,  &UR; Chris, died last year following a 1997
shooting incident in which he was shot in the head by an unknown
assailant, celebrated his first career win Saturday in a NASCAR
Winston Racing Series late model race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional and very special,'' said Trickle, whose
brother is Winston Cup driver  &UR; Dick Trickle. ``This is my first
victory ever. My brother has won more races than anyone in the
world. Chris won a third of the races he was in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to race, but didn't start until late in life.
It is the one thing in my life that makes me closer to Chris.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Trickle won the race on his 55th birthday and one day
before Father's Day. &QL; 
Pit stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do not _ repeat, do not _ try this on the freeway:  &UR; Dave
 &UR; Marcis smashed into a concrete wall during Sunday's Cup race at
Pocono Raceway and somehow escaped with only a cut chin.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in NASCAR history, the top three circuits
(Winston Cup, Busch Series and trucks) are at road-racing venues
during the same weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Budweiser's  &UR; Dave Villwock stretched his Unlimited
Hydroplane Racing Association lead following Sunday's win over
runner-up Chip Hanauer. Drivers  &UR; Todd Yarling and  &UR; Mark Weber both
were involved in spectacular crashes but weren't seriously
injured. &QL;

TEEN: `YEAH, THIS WILL CHANGE MY LIFE'  
 HIGH SCHOOL KIDS STRUGGLE TO COPE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX - A baby cries. Lamar Woodberry's summer basketball game
at Trevor Browne High School will have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   There is somebody other than himself to worry about. A son, now
a little more than a week old, who is forcing the child in Lamar to
grow up faster, to look beyond his 17 years at a cold, harsh
reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, this will change my life,'' said Woodberry, a Trevor
Browne senior to be. ``I probably won't have that much time to
practice. I have to deal with it and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories are no longer all that uncommon _ high school
athletes dealing with parenthood. Some drop out. Some stick with
it. Some look for safety nets in family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids feel it's never going to happen to them,''
Camelback track and field Coach Jay Edelson said. ``The next you
you know, they're going up to you, saying, `I'm pregnant. I'm going
to have a kid.' In 19 years of coaching, I've had several, and you
never get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been two years since Paula Owens left Chandler High as an
outstanding basketball center and a mother seeking a good life for
herself and a son who was born between her sophomore and junior
years.
</P>
<P>
   Between taking Whakin to day care, being a full-time student,
working a job and trying to stretch her income to meet expenses,
Owens still clings to her dream: to be a major college basketball
player.
</P>
<P>
   But despite earning junior college All-America honors last
season when she averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds while leading
Mesa Community College to the national tournament, Owens has no
scholarship offer. Schools have been unwilling to give a
scholarship to a mother who is a semester short of earning her AA
degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going home and getting homework done, once again
the priority is picking (Whakin) up, getting him fed, trying to
spend quality time with him,'' MCC women's basketball Coach Pam
Olerich said. ``Something usually gives.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens perseveres. She said she will try to finish at MCC in the
fall and hopes to walk on at Arizona State at the semester break.
All the while, she goes to the gym, sometimes with Whakin in tow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret having my son or being with him,'' Owens said.
``The only thing I regret is colleges looking at me with a child.
They look over me. They don't look at me. It could have been
different.'' &QL; 
Too much for some
</P>
<P>
   High school and the pressures of plotting one's future are
difficult enough without the added stress of raising a child. Some
kids are emotionally equipped to handle it. Others aren't, and
parents or grandparents, aunts, uncles and siblings are left with
the task of raising the children.
</P>
<P>
   Last basketball season at Central High, boys Coach Bob Strong
became concerned when one of his players had lost his passion for
the game and school.
</P>
<P>
   The senior started missing class, Strong said, and eventually
quit the team, unable to deal with the prospects of fatherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real honest about it,'' Strong said. `He came up and
said this is what is going on, and I'm having a hard time with it.
I could understand why his focus wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong says he senses a drop-off in the number of athletes
fathering children compared with the '80s and early '90s. But
Trevor Browne basketball Coach Mike Ellsworth says next fall will
be the third consecutive year in which one of his players is
dealing with parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Woodberry's brother, Kevin, played for Ellsworth last
year. He was the state's Player of the Year and led the Bruins to
the 5A state semifinals, earning a scholarship to Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's main focus was basketball and class,'' Ellsworth said.
``You wish you could get them all going the same way. I'm not
saying that because they have a baby they're not looking forward,
but sometimes they get sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to the park and ask why they're not in the NBA, 90
percent will tell you, `Well, I had a baby and that got me away
from basketball and going to class.' So many kids just blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Browne assistant basketball coach Clinton Polk tries to
educate the players and his three children by relating the mistakes
he made in his life.
</P>
<P>
   After a stellar high school career in Indianapolis in the
mid-1970s, Polk starred two years at Phoenix College before getting
a scholarship at McNeese State in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But Polk said he quit school after getting involved with a girl
and fathering three children.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, Polk volunteers his time coaching at Trevor Browne and
works as a custodian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud of what I do,'' he said. ``I'm thankful to God
I've got a job. But I could have bettered myself. I had everything
there for me. I was one of the top players around. My school was
always going to be paid for. I didn't take advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Polk said he encourages his oldest daughter, Alysia, 16, who
will be a sophomore basketball player and track athlete at Desert
Vista High, and his 14-year-old son, Clinton Jr., who will be a
freshman basketball player at Trevor Browne, to abstain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad talks about when he was younger and his situations,
having jobs that don't have a salary,'' Alysia said. ``He also
tells me what's going to happen to me if I get pregnant, what he's
going to do to me.'' &QL; 
`Forces you to grow up'
</P>
<P>
   Jaylene Williams, an honor student who was 29th in her
graduating class at North High two years ago, had an academic
scholarship to ASU. But she's currently putting a
psychology/pre-med major on hold to work full time to support a
son, Alexander, who is now a year and a half old.
</P>
<P>
   She gets helps from the boy's father, Dante Murphy, who is
working toward a comeback in football at Glendale Community
College. Murphy said he gave up football his senior year at North
after he found out he was going to be a father.
</P>
<P>
   He said he worked up to 60 hours a week in a bakery to save
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really good dad,'' Williams said. ``That's why I'm
working full time. He has a lot of dreams and a lot of aspirations
in football and track. I think he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy and Williams share a home in south Phoenix, where they
split shifts in taking care of Alexander. There are no marital
plans at the present.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, they try to commit their time to Alexander and stay
away from a party life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forces you to grow up,'' Murphy said. ``You deal more
with people who you can benefit from than the ones you just have a
good time with. If you're around responsible people, you're going
to be responsible.'' &QL; 
Playpen at practice
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago, Maryvale High's gym at times looked like a
nursery during girls basketball practice.
</P>
<P>
   Three girls on the team had babies. Rather than turn his back on
the three, Coach Osborn Shackelford provided a playpen and gave
them no excuses for not being at practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt, `If you didn't have a baby-sitter, then bring them to
practice,' '' Shackelford said. ``I refused to change diapers, but
I can hold them and feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a student-athlete and keep up your grades is tough
enough. I personally felt that it was good for them to put in
extra-curricular activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all coaches are as sympathetic to a young mom's plight as
Shackelford.
</P>
<P>
   Camelback softball Coach Joyce Fredericks said she wouldn't ever
set up a playpen by the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had the choice to have a baby, and there are consequences
that go with that,'' Fredericks said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, however, Fredericks made an exception for a girl
who came out for the team four months after having a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did fine, but I told her up front, `I don't want any
interference. I don't support it (teens with children), so I don't
want to hear it,' '' Fredericks said. ``I never heard a peep about
it. That one worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempe McClintock football Coach Dennis Johnson said that each
year there is at least one player who has fathered a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the players and coaches have problems in their lives,''
Johnson said. ``There's drugs, there's alcohol, there's tobacco,
all sorts of things that are wrong. Sex is another. You have to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy solution to say, `You're done with athletics.' I
don't think it's always the solution. The more you can work with
them and correct it, the better off they'll be.'' &QL; 
Mom talks to classmates
</P>
<P>
   Chandler girls basketball Coach Mike Desper made an exception
for Owens, two years after telling another player she wasn't
welcome on the team because she had a second child while in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a game. That's life,'' Desper told ``The Arizona
Republic'' two years ago while Owens played basketball for him.
``You have to take care of life, and a game is not something you
should be doing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens won Desper's support by speaking to classmates during her
senior year about the trials and tribulations of early motherhood
and how they should refrain from sex.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who works at a Gilbert bank and says she received only
minimal support from her son's father, wants to get through school.
She wants to play basketball. She wants to be a good mom.
</P>
<P>
   She never used motherhood as an excuse, said Olerich, her coach
at MCC.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had extra baggage in that she had a son, but we took a
chance,'' Olerich said. ``I was pleasantly surprised. It didn't
hinder her responsibilities at school and on the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to be flexible. There were days when the baby was sick
and he couldn't go to day care and he would come to the gym. The
important thing was to communicate to the rest of the team that
she's not getting special treatment, because she has a son. Her son
was her priority. For the rest of the team, school was first and
basketball second, and family, social life came next.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerich feels basketball opportunities will materialize for
Owens but has advised her to keep her priorities in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've always stressed is, `Look at your son's future.
You've got to provide a good income for him,' '' she said. &QL; 
Prepared for sacrifices
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to say which direction Lamar Woodberry's life and
basketball career will go.
</P>
<P>
   He does not work and feels fortunate that family is around to
help out with Antwuan. Lamar says he has missed some basketball
games and practices this summer to be with his girlfriend,
Latrisha, as they take turns caring for the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He changes diapers, feeds him,'' Latrisha said. ``Lamar was
scared at first, but he's pulling through.''
</P>
<P>
   While in many cases the father ultimately drifts out of the
picture, Woodberry says he's prepared to make the sacrifices to be
there for his son.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent midafternoon, cradling his newborn son, he answers
the phone.
</P>
<P>
   A teammate reminds him about basketball practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go,'' he says. ``I have to take care of the baby.''

AS SINGLE MOM, SHE WASN'T ALONE  
 CAMPBELL GLAD FOR HELP WITH SON, CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - David Campbell, a mixed message in his Titleist
baseball hat, Nike basketball shirt and North Carolina blue shorts,
smoothly worked the basketball between his legs at a discreet
distance from Suns guard Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Close enough to get a good first eyeball of the All-NBA
first-teamer. Far enough away during the lunchtime shoot-around at
the America West Arena practice court for a 15-year-old to
fantasize in safety.
</P>
<P>
   His surrogate mother told him that he almost certainly would
meet Kidd and Reggie Miller this summer. For that, he can thank his
biological mother, Edna Campbell, playing her first season for the
Mercury and Coach Cheryl Miller, Reggie's sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to dust them,'' David tells Janet Davis, Edna
Campbell's high school coach in Pittsburgh and lifetime confidante.
``I'll give them my shake and bake just like I do to mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right, she replies.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, with practice and a TV public service announcement
already ticked off the day's agenda, David's mom settles into a
discussion of herself at his age. For her, it was an age of fear
and denial and growing up in a hurry. &QL; 
State of denial &QL; 
From a family splintered by alcoholism, Campbell refused to
acknowledge her pregnancy through the fall of 1983 and past her
15th birthday on Nov. 26. She was 17 games into her sophomore
season at Pittsburgh's Allderdice High School and 28 weeks pregnant
when Davis went with her to the doctor and learned the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid to tell anyone,'' Campbell said. ``And I kept
telling myself that I wasn't pregnant.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a female athlete, ultimately there's no avoiding the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are so . . . how do I put this?'' she said. ``They don't
get caught with the baggage. So it's easy for them to do something
and to walk away. The women have to sort of look out for
themselves. He (David's father) was like my first real boyfriend
and that was probably the first time I'd had sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she says she never considered an abortion, and her
aspirations didn't have to be shelved.
</P>
<P>
   David was born more than a month premature by C-section in
February 1984. Before the school year ended, Campbell not only had
been talked into attempting the high jump, but set a city record.
</P>
<P>
   With David being cared for by her family, Campbell went with
Davis to a Blue Star basketball camp in the summer of 1984. She has
been on the national/international basketball radar ever since.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Parade'' and ``USA Today'' All-American in 1986 who still
holds the Allderdice single-game scoring record (40 points),
Campbell played two seasons at Maryland, then transferred to Texas.
She played overseas in Brazil and Hungary before becoming an
American Basketball League All-Star in 1997 and, after the ABL's
demise, a first-round WNBA draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8 guard starts alongside Michele Timms in the Mercury
backcourt, averaging 12.8 points per game. She is tied for the WNBA
single-game season high with five three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept on with everything we were doing,'' said Davis,
who treasures a photo of young Edna on a bicycle with David on her
back in a carrier. ``Nobody ever said, `You had this child, you're
staying here.' Everybody moved forward.'' &QL; 
Counting blessings &QL; 
As a preschooler, David's primary caregiver was Campbell's maternal
grandmother, Jane McCloud. When McCloud died in 1991, late in
Campbell's senior season at Texas, the childless Davis accepted the
responsibility of raising a 6-year-old while Campbell was overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to be counted as a statis tic,'' said Campbell,
who has an exercise physiology degree and aspirations to be a
pharmacist or physical therapist. ``I wasn't going to be the high
school mother that became pregnant, dropped out, sat on welfare,
then ended up having two more kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see having my son as a blessing. Without my son, I'm not
sure I would have accomplished the things I needed to accomplish
because I look at my son every day and realize how much he needs
me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say, well, I had a child when I was 15 and I just
couldn't do it. But you know when you have that responsibility, it
makes you a bigger, better person.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Coach Jody Conradt says Campbell is not the type to shy
away from a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edna has improved as much as any player I've ever coached,''
said Conradt, the winningest Division I coach. ``She's always had
very, very good ballhandling skills, and her defensive skills are
excellent. I'm very impressed with how she's improved her shooting,
her range.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, becoming a better mother was a learned process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I don't think I identified with motherhood,'' she
said. ``I still wanted to play basketball after school. David just
stayed at the baby-sitter a little longer. Also, I had Janet and my
grandmother, so I was still able to be a 15-, 16-, 20-year-old
because of them and gradually assume the responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in that situation, I really believe the most
important thing is to have people around you who support you and
believe in your whole future.''
</P>
<P>
   But how many pregnant teenagers have someone to bank on such as
Davis?
</P>
<P>
   ``David could have stayed here the rest of his life, I didn't
care,'' said Davis, a White woman who has received a cultural
education in exchange for her generosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear African-Americans talking about being the only one in
a restaurant and why they feel out of place. There I'm sitting in
an all-Black neighborhood, and David would be getting a haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd not only be the only woman, but the only White woman.
People would come in and look at you. They always made you feel
welcome, but now I know the other side of the coin.'' &QL; 
Full-time mother &QL; 
With the advent of U.S. women's pro basketball after the 1996
Olympics, Campbell no longer had to play overseas and went from
being a holiday/off-season mom to a full-time mother. David,
already 12, was moving into middle school.
</P>
<P>
   The Catch-22 of supporting her son in a career that took her
away from him was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really afraid that my relationship with my son would be
affected by being overseas,'' Campbell said. ``You know the years
are passing and passing, and he's getting older and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want my child to have some animosity towards me
because I was never there. Now he's with me and, yeah, we travel
and we're on the road, but when I think about parents who work 9 to
5, how much time do they really spend with their children?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my time with my son is comparable to the average
parent. I wish I could spend more time with him, but you know the
off-season (eight months in the WNBA) is a long season. I'm pretty
content with our relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   When Campbell played for the Colorado Xplosion of the ABL, she
developed a platonic friendship with Jay Humphries, a former Suns
guard and now a restaurateur in Denver. Humphries is a big brother
to David.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an attempt to fill a void,'' Campbell said. ``I'm not
sure if it does or not. I just know David is at the point in his
life where he kind of seeks that bonding with the guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have to realize that's something I can't . . . '' she
breaks off in laughter ``I can't fulfill that need. Always on my
part, I'm trying to get him in an environment where he can interact
with men because I know he needs that.'' &QL; 
Sharing experiences &QL; 
Campbell, who maintains a home in Denver, is not shy about speaking
publicly of her circumstances and how she overcame them. She
created the Young Parents Foundation to provide support for teenage
parents, and she established a scholarship fund for female athletes
at her high school.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Hargrove, who coached the Xplosion last fall before the
ABL went bankrupt, saw Campbell's presentation at several schools,
including David's.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has positive energy for everyone,'' said Hargrove, a
mother of two who also was a sounding board for Campbell. ``She'd
say, `Linda, what did you do? He's wanting to date and talking
about girls.' I was just laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people take motherhood for granted, that it's an
easy, natural thing. It's not necessarily. I think Edna's done a
tremendous job. It's a very heartwarming relationship to see when
you're around them on a fairly consistent level.''
</P>
<P>
   David, shy yet articulate, has a gleaming smile and a
personality that Davis says mirrors his mother's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of hard because I'd go to my mom, then I'd go
back,'' he said. ``I missed my mom a lot when she kept traveling. I
understood it was her job, she had to support me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool because she opens a lot of doorways for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Already with an inch on his mother and on his way to 6 feet 2 or
taller, David wants to be a pro basketball player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to do it,'' he said, sounding like millions
of other boys and now girls his age. ``Jason Kidd, he's like my
role model because he's nice on and off the court.''
</P>
<P>
   But his true influence is the woman wearing Mercury jersey No.
12, a reverse of the No. 21 she has worn throughout her career.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said David lobbied for No. 7, which is worn by Timms, but
maybe the more he thinks about it, No. 15 would be the most fitting
tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's real amazing,'' David said of his mother's accepting
responsibility for him at that age. His age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I couldn't do it. She's been a real good mom. I love my
mom. I'm proud of my mom.'' &QL;

RED SOX, WASDIN BOMB OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-ORIOLES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ For those starting to think that John Wasdin might
have struck a deal like that of Joe Hardy, the character who sold
his soul to the devil so he could beat the damn Yankees, relax.
Wasdin apparently is still pure of heart.
</P>
<P>
   And imperfect in his pitches. Wasdin, whose unbeaten record
belies his penchant for serving meatballs at the most inopportune
time, grooved one to Albert Belle in the eighth inning Tuesday
night, and Baltimore's struggling strongman launched it for a
three-run home run that lifted the surging Orioles to a 5-3 win
over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   While the loss did not mar Wasdin's record, which remains 7-0,
it unquestionably left its mark, not only on him but on lefthanded
reliever Mark Guthrie, the man stuck with the loss, only the third
sustained by Boston in its last nine games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I didn't do my job,'' said Wasdin, who was aiming to
throw a two-strike fastball up and in to Belle but instead threw it
down and over the middle, resulting in the seventh home run he's
allowed in 31 1/3 innings. ``I gladly would have taken the loss. I
feel badly about giving up somebody else's runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie inherited a 3-1 lead and a runner on first in the eighth
when he gave up a bloop single to Brady Anderson, a ground single
to Mike Bordick, and a sacrifice fly by B.J. Surhoff that cut it to
3-2. Belle then unloaded his 14th home run into the left-center
field seats off Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what to tell you,'' said Guthrie, whose
earned run average climbed to a staff-high 6.84 after he was
charged with two runs. ``I'm getting sick of a situation where I'm
walking off the field with that feeling. It affects everything you
do. I don't want to sit here and give you a sob story. Just get
back and play tomorrow, and hope things turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 11th in 12 games for the Orioles, now five games
under .500 after once being 15 games under the break-even point,
while the Sox saw their three-game winning streak come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule says we play three games here,'' said Sox manager
Jimy Williams, knocking down a question about whether losing to a
club as hot as the Orioles would only stoke them more. ``We can't
leave. I don't know anything about hot or cold or whatever. We're
going to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss kept alive Pat Rapp's streak of guaranteed misfortune.
The Sox are 3-10 in games started by Rapp, who Tuesday night
averaged almost a walk an inning (6 in 6 1/3) and threw more balls
(58) than strikes (52), but still left with a 2-1 lead, having held
the Orioles to three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Home runs by Jason Varitek, his eighth of the season, and Troy
O'Leary, his 15th, accounted for the first two Sox runs off Sidney
Ponson. Back-to-back doubles in the eighth by Jose Offerman and Lou
Merloni (one of three hits by the Framingham Kid) made it 3-1 in
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp dodged one bullet when Will Clark left third base too soon
on a fly ball in the second, and another when Harold Baines, given
the green light on a 3-and-0 pitch, grounded into a double play in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't one inning in which he didn't have at least one
Oriole on base. But Rapp, a child of the Louisiana delta, knows
something about surviving in a swamp, even though this season the
muck almost always has been waist-high for him.
</P>
<P>
   He was still ahead when reliever Kirk Bullinger, a candidate to
be sent back to the minors Wednesday when Bret Saberhagen is
activated, converted Jeff Conine's bullet back to the mound into an
inning-ending double play, trapping Clark off second after spearing
the low liner.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Rapp was stuck with another no-decision, and has
just one win to show in nine starts since April 28. And with
Saberhagen back Wednesday night, he no doubt is headed back to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been very lucky this year,'' said Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox were in an ideal spot to squelch the thought that the
Orioles could climb back into this race. In their previous 15
games, Baltimore starters were 8-1 with a 3.17 ERA, while the
offense also had come to life, batting .320 for the month while
averaging over six runs a game.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be up to Saberhagen, who has as many wins this
season (2) as he has stints on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't done anything all year,'' said Saberhagen,
who hasn't pitched since stepping on a piece of broken glass at a
team party he hosted in New York a couple of weeks ago. ``Half the
year has gone by, and I haven't really contributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking not only to getting out there and staying out
there. I'll just go out and do what I can. This was a tough one
tonight. Hopefully, we'll bounce back and do it tomorrow.''

MARINERS WANT PUBLIC MONEY TO HELP PAY FOR STADIUM OVERRUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just weeks before the opening of Safeco Field, owners
of the Seattle Mariners on Tuesday launched an offensive aimed at
wresting another $60 million in public money to help cover the
ballpark's estimated $100 million cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing what they acknowledge is an unpopular move, team
officials set into motion what may become a marathon legal battle
over unanticipated tax money.
</P>
<P>
   The team says King County must use the tax revenue to issue more
bonds to pay for the $517 million ballpark, which is over budget
largely because of weather-related construction delays,
higher-than-expected concrete costs and upgrades in communication
systems and concession areas.
</P>
<P>
   The county, and the Public Facilities District that is building
Safeco Field, maintain the added revenue must be used to repay the
stadium debt years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side is shy in stating its case.
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims put it this way: ``No more. A
deal's a deal. Not one more dime.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mariners Chairman John Ellis on Tuesday maintained the
Mariners have a legal claim to the money, and said he's grown tired
of suggestions that the team owners are trying to raid the cookie
jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quit the cookie jar!'' Ellis told reporters Tuesday. ``We got
into this thing to save baseball. By God, we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis acknowledged that last year he said the team was committed
to paying for construction costs in excess of the $417 million
ballpark budget set in mid-1997. But that was before the county
discovered the hot local economy was fueling a tax surplus, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be here if we had a recession,'' said Nintendo of
America Inc. Chairman Howard Lincoln, a member of the Mariners
board of directors. He represents Nintendo owner Hiroshi Yamauchi,
the team's majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said there was never any ``cap'' on the public's share of
the project. He said the state Legislature's only cap is on the
team's $45 million contribution to the venue's construction. The
team has since paid another $10 million for equipment such as lawn
mowers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not talk about a (public) cap and there was never talk
about a cap,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a popular thing to do. But it is the right thing
to do,'' Lincoln said. ``We think the county is obligated to issue
the bonds. I realize there's a lot of people who don't agree with
us. But even baseball owners are entitled to their day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   That day will come. The Public Facilities District, which owns
the 45,000-seat ballpark, and King County, which floated bonds to
finance the public's share of the project, have dug in for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have told the Mariners on many occasions that we will not
seek more public funds,'' said Ken Johnsen, the stadium district
executive director. ``We believe our agreements with the Mariners
are clear: They are responsible for all costs above the approved
$417 million budget.''
</P>
<P>
   King County Councilman Larry Phillips added, ``They're going to
get into our knickers one way or the other. And it is absolutely
shameless. These are rich and powerful people who are ruthless when
it comes to protecting their pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners officials said three different law firms have
advised them that excess revenues from items such as car rental and
restaurant taxes must be used for stadium work.
</P>
<P>
   But the state lawmaker who authored the 1995 legislation that
enabled the ballpark to be financed said the bill was adopted
because the Mariners had agreed to pay all cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel the reason the bill passed in the first place ...
was because the Mariners agreed to cover the cost overruns. Some
voted for it based on that fact,'' said Rep. Steve Van Luven,
R-Bellevue.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in determining who gets the surplus tax revenue
unfolded Tuesday when the team invoked a clause in its agreement
with the stadium district and asked the PFD to help hire a third
party to mediate the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The PFD and the team will hire the mediator within 30 days. The
mediator then has three to six months to help both sides resolve
their differences through non-binding negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   If the team and the stadium district can't reach an agreement,
one of the two parties can ask for binding arbitration. If both
sides don't agree to arbitration, then they head to court.
</P>
<P>
   During mediation, the Mariners will cite a team-financed
analysis that shows $60 million in net proceeds would be available
for stadium bond financing if public money from the state lottery
and taxes for restaurants, admissions and rental cars kept at their
current pace of growth. The Mariners, who open Safeco Field on July
15, did not name the firm that did the analysis in February.
</P>
<P>
   The county initially planned to raise $651 million in tax
revenue through 2016 to pay off $336 million in the stadium bonds.
By the end of 1998, the county had collected $9 million of excess
stadium tax revenue and that amount was projected to grow to $15
million by the end of 1999. If the Mariners are correct and the
surplus grows to $60 million, the county could retire the debt as
early as 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials began privately lobbying the PFD in February, two
months before the stadium district announced cost overruns had
ballooned to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   By April, the stadium district had already run out of money to
pay contractors and began accepting money from the team. The
ballclub paid $15.4 million in March, $13.6 million in April and
$12.6 million in May.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said this money was ``advanced'' to the stadium district
and that the club's move Tuesday was the first step to recoup those
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said if the team loses its battle for more bonds,
neither the franchise will be sold nor stars such as Ken Griffey
Jr. will be allowed to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not poverty-stricken,'' Lincoln added.

During World War II, an explosion on a segregated naval base here

resume loading ammunition onto ships. Fifty of them refused, were
court-martialed by an all-white panel, found guilty of mutiny and
imprisoned. Now, in an extraordinary legal battle, lawyers for one
black veteran have filed for a presidential pardon arguing that the
black sailors failed to follow orders out of legitimate fear and
had no intent to mutiny. The petition pits the racial symbolism of
a celebrated case against the military's view that servicemen

STOTTLEMYRE BEGINS THROW ING AGAIN _ AND LOVES EV ERY MINUTE OF
IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There was no radar gun. No menacing opponent with
bulging biceps standing in the batter's box, waiting to take a big
cut. It was back to basics, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   And  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre loved every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever seen anybody so excited about playing
catch,'' Diamondbacks Manager &UR; Buck Showalter said of the
right-handed Stottlemyre, who threw for the first time on Tuesday
since suffering partial tears of his rotator cuff and labrum on May
17 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who was 4-1 with a 3.59 ERA in nine starts, threw
for about 10 minutes at a distance of 60 feet. He was a bit tight
early, but was fine in the later stages of the session and felt
little or no aftereffects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to feel great, but the fact of the matter is, five
weeks is a long time not to pick up a ball,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not want to put a time frame on his return to
the mound for the big club. He is expected to pitch in at least a
couple of rehabilitation assignments in the minor leagues before
that occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week from now, we'll know a lot more,'' he said. &QL; 
Carlson joins club &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The contract of right-hander  &UR; Dan Carlson, one of the final cuts
of the spring, was purchased from the Triple-A Tucson affiliate. To
make room for him on the roster, the club optioned infielder  &UR; Edwin
Diaz to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson, who pitched for the San Francisco Giants' Triple-A
affiliate in Phoenix for parts of five seasons, says he has been
told that he will not be gathering dust in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said their middle relievers have thrown a lot lately and
that I'll get some innings. I'm grateful for the opportunity,''
said Carlson, who was 2-5 in 16 games (11 starts) for Tucson. ``I'm
going to pitch as well as I can, and we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlson entered Tuesday's game to start the seventh inning and
retired the side in order. After retiring the first two batters in
the eighth inning, he gave up singles to Pokey Reese and Michael
Tucker before being relieved by left-hander Dan Plesac.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star update &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voting for the National League All-Star team was updated
Tuesday, and Diamondbacks third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams saw a
substantial increase in his lead over Atlanta's  &UR; Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a lead of about 8,000 last week. Now it is up to
almost 76,000 (357,035 to 281,265).

POINT WELL TAKEN AS NO. 1 IN DRAFT  
 FRANCIS' TALENT AMAZES SCOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of stories about Maryland guard Steve Francis.
One is worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   In a pickup game last summer, Francis leaped, took the
basketball and slammed it into the face of Chris Webber, the former
Washington Wizards forward now with the Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Francis continues to climb.
</P>
<P>
   At least, his stock in the 1999 NBA draft does.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is projected by some scouts to be the No. 1 pick, which
is owned by the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could very well go Number 1,'' Suns scout Dick Percudani
said. ``He has the energy level of an Allen Iverson. He's in the
attack mode on both ends of the court. He has such a court presence
that he's impossible not to like.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that nobody can identify his real pro position is both
intriguing and a hint at what might prove to be a weak draft class.
</P>
<P>
   Francis is projected as a playmaker, yet he was never at the
position at Maryland long enough for any scout to make a solid
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 3, 194 pounds, he was a shooting guard, but lacks the
size to succeed at that position in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is the guy?'' Percudani said of Francis, who last season
as a junior averaged 17.2 points, 4.2 rebounds, 4.5 assists, 2.8
steals and shot 52.8 percent from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The answer to Percudani's question is merely a projection,
always a hazardous undertaking with an underclassman. But the
scouts like what they see. In Francis, there are the sure signs of
toughness. He's paid some dues, and there are reasons to think his
potential remains untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Francis grew up in a poor Maryland neighborhood. His mom,
Brenda, died when he was in high school. Her name is tattooed on
his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   He played street ball long before he ever put on a prep uniform
in Silver Spring, Md. He was a late bloomer in high school. The
blossoming continued through college. He went to two junior
colleges _ San Jacinto, Texas, and Allegany, Md. _ before he moved
on to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can dunk the basketball in his socks,'' Percudani said of
Francis' 43-inch vertical leap. ``He's a firecracker.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Francis has emerged as the potential top pick because
of growing concern about Lamar Odom, who failed to show up for
tryouts with two teams and then began to second-guess his decision
to leave Rhode Island as an underclassman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odom might be the biggest tease in the draft,'' Percudani said
of the 6-10 player who scouts believe can play any position except
center.
</P>
<P>
   The only safe bet in the 1999 draft appears to be among the
playmakers. Including Francis, there are five who figure to be
lottery picks, Nos. 1-13.
</P>
<P>
   The other four:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Terry of Arizona. As a 6-2 senior last year, he averaged
22.1 points, 5.6 assists and 2.7 steals. He's a do-it-all kind of
backcourt player. ``He has a lot of confidence,'' Percudani said.
``At worst, he's a backup in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   Andre Miller of Utah. As a 6-2 senior last year, he averaged
15.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 2.5 steals. He's solid,
although there are questions about his shooting. He's been called
the poor-man's Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis of UCLA. As a 6-2 sophomore last year, he averaged
15.9 points, 5.2 assists and 2.5 steals. ``He has a power game and
a very dominating personality,'' Percudani said. ``That might be a
problem as a point. He needs to be the top banana. On some NBA
teams, he might get peeled.'' A surgically repaired knee is another
cause for concern.
</P>
<P>
   William Avery of Duke. As a 6-2 sophomore, he averaged 15.1
points and 5.3 assists last year. His relative inexperience is a
worry. ``But, in time, he might prove to be the best of the
bunch,'' Percudani said of the projected scoring playmaker. &QL;

EXPANSION TEAM GETS SHOT AT VERBEEK, JUNEAU, KING

   PHOENIX - They celebrated winning the Stanley Cup with a victory
parade on Monday, but several members of the Dallas Stars weren't
celebrating a day later when they learned they were left
unprotected for Friday's NHL expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Among those exposed to the Atlanta Thrashers were a handful of
core players from the two-time President's Trophy winners,
including forwards Pat Verbeek, Guy Carbonneau, Brian Skrudland and
Dave Reid, and defensemen Shawn Chambers, Craig Ludwig and Doug
Lidster.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley Cup runner-up Buffalo Sabres did not protect
forwards Joe Juneau, Rob Ray and Geoff Sanderson as well as Dominik
Hasek's backup, Dwayne Roloson.
</P>
<P>
   Other notables left unprotected around the NHL include Detroit
center Igor Larionov, a 63-point scorer for the Red Wings last
season; Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt, whose 1.79 goals-against average
led the league; San Jose right wing Joe Murphy, who scored a
team-leading 25 goals for the Sharks; and Toronto left wing Derek
King, who scored 24 goals for the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, as reported Tuesday, protected the majority of
their top players but chose to expose several other key
contributors from last season's team, which finished fourth overall
in the Western Conference and recorded its second-best point total
(90) in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties include forwards Bob Corkum, Jim Cummins, Mike
Stapleton, Mike Sullivan, Louie DeBrusk and Stephen Leach,
defensemen Gerald Diduck, Stan Neckar, J.J. Daigneault, Jamie
Huscroft and Brad Tiley, and goalies Mikhail Shtalenkov, Jimmy
Waite and Scott Langkow.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining Phoenix players left unprotected are forwards
Brian Noonan, Joe Dziedzic, Barry Nieckar, Jocelyn Lemieux, Rob
Murray, Andrei Vasilyev, Frederik Loven and Mike Alatalo;
defensemen Sean McCann and Michel Petit; and goalie Henrik Smangs.
</P>
<P>
   Every NHL club, with the exception of the Nashville Predators,
will lose at least one player to the Thrashers, who begin play next
season. Teams had to expose one goalie, one experienced defenseman
and two experienced forwards, all of whom either played 40 games
last season or 70 over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Three players on the Coyotes' current roster were picked by the
Pradators in last year's expansion draft: Sullivan, acquired from
Nashville for a seventh-round pick in this year's draft;
Shtalenkov, obtained later from Edmonton; and Daigneault who,
essentially, was the ``future considerations'' portion of the
controversial Cliff Ronning trade with Nashville on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Other NHL players left unprotected by their clubs include Wendel
Clark, Doug Brown, Ulf Samuelsson, Uwe Krupp and Norm Maracle of
Detroit; Dave Manson, Bob Probert, Eddie Olczyk of Chicago; Slyvain
Lefebvre, Dale Hunter and Craig Billington of Chicago; Andreas
Johansson of Ottawa; Geoff Courtnall, Terry Yake and Blair
Atcheynum of St. Louis; Tie Domi and Kris King of Toronto; Murray
Baron and Garth Snow of Vancouver; Steve Duchesne, Luke Richardson
and Ron Hextall of Philadelphia; as well as other veteran goalies
such as the Blues' Grant Fuhr and the Shark's Mike Vernon.

DRUGSTORE.COM SIGNS DEAL TO BE EXCLUSIVE ONLINE RETAILER FOR RITE
AID, GNC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN COOK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Peter Neupert, the chief executive of Bellevue-based
drugstore.com, has accomplished a lot in his 10 months on the job.
The former Microsoft executive, who took the reins of the Internet
pharmacy in August, has added more than 200 employees, joined with
Amazon.com, raised more than $50 million in venture capital and
filed for an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Still moving at Internet speed, Neupert on Tuesday announced
what could be the most important agreement in his young company's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Rite Aid, the country's third-largest brick-and-mortar pharmacy
chain, and General Nutrition Centers Inc., the largest specialty
retailer of vitamins and natural care products in the United
States, will scrap their previously announced e-commerce plans and
partner directly with drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year agreement _ a lifetime in the Internet age _ makes
drugstore.com the exclusive online retailer for both Rite Aid and
GNC, which together have more than 6,000 stores throughout the
country. While drugstore.com will help the traditional retailers
establish an online presence, some analysts say that Rite Aid and
GNC hold the keys to success for drugstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rite Aid will open a lot of doors that Drugstore has struggled
to get through,'' said Eric Bosshard, an analyst at Midwest
Research. ``This is a combination that creates a real powerful
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Seattle-based Soma.com was sold to CVS Corp.,
the leading pharmacy chain in the United States, for what some
analysts called a bargain basement price of $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Camp Hill, Penn.-based Rite Aid, which is making a $7.6 million
investment in drugstore.com for a 25 percent stake, also appears to
be getting a good deal, said David Restrepo, an analyst at Jupiter
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the price I would say that drugstore.com needed
Rite Aid more than Rite Aid needed drugstore.com,'' he said. ``Rite
Aid was the company with the greater leverage in the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason traditional pharmacies like Rite Aid, Walgreens
and CVS have the upper hand is because of their strong ties to
pharmacy benefit managers or PBMs, the third-party intermediaries
that handle the paperwork and drug pricing structure for insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Restrepo said that pharmacy benefit managers have been reluctant
to work with the online pharmacies, making it virtually impossible
for them to get customers. ``Access to the PBMs is something that
drugstore.com, Soma and PlanetRX have all been grappling with,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugstore.com had to give up one quarter of its company, which
tells you just how important (the issue) is for these online
drugstores.''
</P>
<P>
   Neupert said that the relationship with Rite Aid would
immediately give drugstore.com access to members of PCS Health
Systems Inc., one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers in the
country. PCS is owned by Rite Aid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Rite Aid investment, Pittsburgh-based GNC
will make a $2.4 million investment in drugstore.com for an 8
percent slice of the company. Its investment dilutes the holdings
of other owners. Amazon.com, which took a 46 percent stake in the
company in February, will own about 29 percent if the deal meets
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors in drugstore.com include Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen, Starbucks' Howard Schultz and Silicon Valley venture
capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the benefits of allying with a pharmacy benefit
manager, Neupert said the deal would give consumers more choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really helps us meet our future objective which is to be
the best pharmacy on the Web,'' Neupert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It expands our pharmacy by allowing choice of when the
customer wants to pick up their prescriptions whether ... delivered
to the door or for a more urgent need to go pick up a prescription
at one of Rite Aid's 3,800 stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Grass, chairman and chief executive of Rite Aid, said
that his company would receive revenues on all prescriptions picked
up at the physical stores while drugstore.com collected on mail
order deliveries. Grass, who considered several online drugstores,
said drugstore.com became the natural choice after completing his
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are partnering with the player that we believe will be the
leader in this Internet space because of its well-honed marketing
strategy and strong financial backing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com, which filed to go public last month, could
receive a boost from investors when it issues shares this summer
because of Rite Aid's involvement, said Jupiter Communications'
Restrepo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both drugstore and Rite Aid saw the value in taking
drugstore.com public as a pure Internet company with a real-world
partner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Drugstore.com's competitors greeted the news calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he viewed the new partnership as a threat, Joe
Rosson, chief executive of Austin, Texas-based RX.com, said ``not
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keeping to our knitting and staying focused on our
business model,'' Rosson said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Reed, spokesman for Soma.com in Seattle, sounded a more
competitive tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first online and they followed. We were the first
to make a relationship with a bricks and mortar retailer and they
followed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased that the good folks at drugstore.com
recognize our leadership and follow in our path.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ At another time, maybe in another place, this just might
be the day when America climbed aboard the Knicks' bandwagon and
hoped for one of those between-the-lines miracles that keep us
coming back to sports for a fix of emotional inspiration and life
lessons in perseverance and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   The images from Game 3 of the NBA Finals _ of Allan Houston
finding all the open spaces in the defense and hitting silky-smooth
shots to carry New York through the first three quarters, of
Latrell Sprewell slithering his way into cracks to score the big
buckets in the fourth quarter _ are the kind that usually draw the
admiration and rooting interest of the non-partisans who, aside
from wanting to be entertained, are seeking a cause to support.
</P>
<P>
   In the first summer of the post-Jordan playoffs, with NBC's
ratings hemorrhaging more than a season's worth of ER reruns, it
would almost seem a natural to gravitate toward the No. 8-seeded
Knicks over the No. 1-ranked Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there is the hook of Patrick Ewing, the gallant warrior
who has literally sweated buckets for so many coaches in a 14-year
career. Ewing has always been a solid citizen and a loyal, tireless
worker for the cause. Whatever nitpicking one might conjure up
regarding his individual game, his has most definitely been a
career to admire. And now the team captain is trapped inside
designer suits, forced to cheer on his teammates from the bench,
the result of a torn Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   It is also difficult not to admire Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy,
the tiny, disheveled character with dark circles under his eyes and
a comb-over hairdo who always looks as out of place in high-powered
Manhattan as an Amish farmer inside NASA's mission control. Van
Gundy succeeded big-time image-makers in Pat Riley and Don Nelson
and before this spring was remembered most for the way he hung on
to the ankle of Miami's Alonzo Mourning _ like a Chihuahua to a
mail carrier _ during one celebrated playoff melee last year.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Van Gundy has his critics in New York. They're mostly
people who can't seem to understand why a fellow who has risen to
his salary level hasn't traded in his house in the Jersey suburbs
for more palatial digs, brags about dining at the drive-in window
of fast-food establishments and still steers his own Honda through
traffic to Madison Square Garden. To wish him ill is like hoping
the Tooth Fairy develops an abscess.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are a batch of 7-footers and cool efficiency, a huge
machine rolling through the playoffs, while the Knicks are a
crackling brush fire, undermanned but unrelenting.
</P>
<P>
   Considering America's rebellious roots and penchant for
invariably backing the underdog, the Knicks would seem a batch of
mongrels to take into a nation's homes and hearts. Instead, this
series has been largely overlooked or tuned out by the masses.
Perhaps because the outcome appears a foregone conclusion. But
maybe also because the Knicks, in the role of cuddly strays, are
about as embraceable as a porcupine with a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Each time you want to bring them into the kitchen and feed them
a bowl of milk, up pops another TV commercial shouting out that
Sprewell is the embodiment of the American dream. This is a man who
wrapped his hands around the throat of his coach, was pulled off
him, walked away for several minutes and then came back to do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   For that Sprewell was punished, fined big bucks and eventually
given a new start a continent away. Is that right? Absolutely. We
are all capable of screwing up badly. I know. We all deserve
another chance. But there is Sprewell, not repentant and suing
everyone in sight, and now at the Finals often portraying himself
as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby is the embodiment of the pampered young phenom, his
hand out for every extra on the climb up the blue-chip ladder. He
signed with an agent, accepted money and gifts, and left his
school, UMass, mired in a scandal without ever looking back.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Larry Johnson, long known as a bad actor dating to
his college days at UNLV and for the notoriety he earned making
crude gestures to opponents and fans while representing the United
States at the World Championships in 1994. The other day, he
responded to a request that he fulfill his obligations to the media
by unleashing an obscene torrent at a female member of the NBA's
public-relations department. Now Johnson and his agent say they
will appeal his fine, claiming he is being picked on. Nice.
</P>
<P>
   And so continues the story of these Knicks, still trailing in
the series, still undermanned, still unloved.

OFFENSE LETS DOWN DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The starting pitching, at least for a turn through
the abbreviated rotation, performed the way it was supposed to when
the Dodgers brass was in front of the chalkboard this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the early returns are no different than when the
staff was inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers failed in their attempt to win three straight games
for the first time in nearly two months. They fell to the San Diego
Padres 4-1 in the first of a three-game series before 37,366
Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (32-36) still haven't won more than two straight
since a five-game winning streak April 27 through May 1. San Diego
(29-38) has won four straight.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a silver lining, it's that the Dodgers made it
through the starting rotation (albeit by skipping Carlos Perez)
with four consecutive solid outings for one of the few times this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park pitched seven innings, marking the first time this
season starters have thrown a pitch in the seventh for a fifth
straight start. The starters _ Park, Ismael Valdes, Darren Dreifort
and Kevin Brown _ have allowed eight runs in their last 341/3
innings over four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to put any kind of run together, which I feel
we're capable of doing, it's going to start right there (with the
starters),'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the offense also needs to kick in a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Sterling Hitchcock (5-6) allowed one run on six
hits in 62/3 innings before getting relief help. After Trenidad
Hubbard and Eric Young singled off Hitchcock with two outs in the
seventh, the big out was recorded by Padres reliever Will Cunnane.
He got Adrian Beltre to ground to second to end the inning and keep
the Padres in front 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 16th save,
giving him 376 in his Padre career, a team record.
</P>
<P>
   What San Diego's bullpen was able to accomplish, the Dodgers'
could not. Mike Maddux began the eight and allowed back-to-back
doubles to Quilvio Veras and Eric Owens as the Padres extended
their lead to 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-5) allowed three runs on five hits despite allowing the
Padres' leadoff batter to reach base in his last five innings. But
the only thing that hurt Park was a 3-2 pitch to Padres center
fielder Ruben Rivera in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera belted a two-run homer, his 11th of the season, over the
left-center field fence with two outs. It gave the Padres a 2-0
lead. It was also the 17th homer Park's allowed this season,
matching Valdes for most among Dodgers pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the lead in half in the bottom of the inning
thanks to an ill-advised defensive risk by Rivera on a ball hit by
Raul Mondesi. Rivera dived for Mondesi's line drive, not coming
close to catching it and allowing the ball to roll to the fence.
Mondesi wound up with a triple and scored on Devon White's
groundout to second to pull the Dodgers within 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Padres' leadoff success, it didn't translate into
scoring chances early on. It also cost San Diego its catcher, Jim
Leyritz, in the fifth inning. Leyritz was hit near the left wrist
with a pitch and left the game. He was taken to Centinela Hospital
Medical Center for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, the Padres made good use of their leadoff
hitter in the seventh inning when Dave Magadan singled to right and
Rivera ripped a double inside the third base bag.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Jackson made it 3-1 with a sacrifice fly to the warning
track in center.
</P>
<P>
   Park got out of it by allowing one run, which is marked
improvement of his last seventh-inning ordeal. After pitching six
wonderful innings in his last start, he allowed five runs in the
seventh in a loss to Pittsburgh.

HUSON STEPS IN TO LIFT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It would have been a cute little story if Gary
DiSarcina's return to the Angels lineup after missing the first 68
games of the season resulted in a dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, it was DiSarcina's replacement who started an
eighth-inning rally that lifted the Angels to a 4-2 victory over
the Seattle Mariners before 26,153 at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson pinch hit for DiSarcina with one out in the eighth
inning and the Angels trailing 1-0. Until then, the visitors had
just three hits off Mariners starter Freddy Garcia. Huson doubled
to right field, then scored on a single by Darin Erstad to tie the
game at 1. Randy Velarde followed with a triple into the
right-center field gap to score Erstad for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was replaced by Jeff Fassero, who induced Mo Vaughn to
ground out. But Garret Anderson was able to come up with a two-out
hit, a single to left to score Velarde and give the Angels a 3-1
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Angels have scored at least three in
an inning since the sixth inning on June 6 against the Dodgers _
when Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer. That's a span of 121
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' big rally wasn't the end of the Mariners, though. In
the bottom of the eighth, Alex Rodriguez doubled home Brian Hunter,
then went to third when Ken Griffey Jr. grounded to second for the
first out.
</P>
<P>
   Huson then made the first of two key defensive plays in the
inning. With the infield in, Edgar Martinez hit a sharp grounder
that Huson fielded, and after looking the Rodriguez back to third,
threw Martinez out at first. Butch Huskey followed with a soft
liner to right field, but Matt Luke made a diving catch to preserve
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the top of the ninth, Luke homered off ex-Angels
pitcher Allen Watson for a 4-2 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Angels' second in a row, the first time they've
won back-to-back games since June 1 and 2, when they beat the Twins
two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major-league game of the season since suffering a
broken bone in his left forearm Feb. 21, DiSarcina went 1 for 2
(infield single) and was errorless on all five grounders hit to
him.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina hit .287 with 56 RBI last season and was named the
team's MVP by his teammates. Obviously, what DiSarcina brings to a
team isn't directly reflected by statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm capable of doing and what I'm not capable of
doing,'' DiSarcina said. ``I'm not capable of doing what Tim Salmon
can do _ hit home runs and drive in runs. I'm not going to alter a
game with stats. If they're expecting me to hit grand slams and
three-run homers, they're mistaken. But attitude-wise, defensively,
I can be more of a leader out there. I'll try to run the bases
correctly, be aggressive _ that can be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He means everything, he's our leader,'' Angels
catcher/outfielder Todd Greene said. ``He doesn't have to hit .300
or hit 20 home runs. He brings a mentality to the team that we
need. He's aggressive, he's a great baserunner, he's our leader.
There's definitely been a lack of a strong team leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going out on a rehab assignment, DiSarcina had been
traveling with the team. He said the attitude doesn't necessarily
need to be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not adjusted, refocused,'' he said. ``Sometimes the focus gets
blurred. Situations with what the manager is doing, or what
(general manager) Billy Bavasi is doing blurs your focus from what
the team needs to focus on, which is winning each game.''

HUSON STEPS IN TO LIFT ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It would have been a cute little story if Gary
DiSarcina's return to the Angels lineup after missing the first 68
games of the season resulted in a dramatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, it was DiSarcina's replacement who started an
eighth-inning rally that lifted the Angels to a 4-2 victory over
the Seattle Mariners before 26,153 at the Kingdome on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson pinch-hit for DiSarcina with one out in the eighth
inning and the Angels trailing 1-0. Until then, the Angels had just
three hits off Mariners starter Freddy Garcia (8-4). Huson doubled
to right field, then scored on a single by Darin Erstad to tie the
game at 1. Randy Velarde followed with a triple into the
right-center-field gap to score Erstad for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was replaced by Jeff Fassero, who got Mo Vaughn to ground
out. But Garret Anderson was able to come up with a two-out hit, a
single to left to score Velarde and give the Angels a 3-1
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the Angels have scored at least three in
an inning since the sixth inning on June 6 against the Dodgers _
when Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer. That's a span of 121
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three runs in an inning felt like we scored 20,'' Huson said.
``That's how bad it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' ``big'' rally wasn't the end of the Mariners,
though. In the bottom of the eighth, Alex Rodriguez doubled home
Brian Hunter, then went to third when Ken Griffey Jr. grounded to
second for the first out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Huson then made the first of two key defensive plays in the
inning. With the infield in, Edgar Martinez hit a sharp grounder
that Huson fielded, and after looking Rodriguez back to third,
threw Martinez out at first. Butch Huskey followed with a soft
liner to right field, but Matt Luke made a diving catch to preserve
the lead. Leading off the top of the ninth, Luke homered off
ex-Angels pitcher Allen Watson for a 4-2 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 20th save. Mark
Petkovsek (6-2) went two innings to get the victory in relief of
starter Steve Sparks, who had to leave the game after three innings
after being hit on the right ring finger with a line drive. He was
diagnosed with a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the Angels' second in a row, the first time they've
won back-to-back games since June 1 and 2, when they beat the Twins
two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   In his first major-league game of the season since suffering a
broken bone in his left forearm Feb. 21, DiSarcina went 1 for 2
(infield single) and was errorless on all five grounders hit to
him.
</P>
<P>
   After his seven innings of action, DiSarcina said the game was
``tiring'' and that manager Terry Collins made the right call by
taking him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to ask to be taken out of the game,'' he said.
``He was pretty much being observant. I was gassed. It's like
spring training for me. Like I said before, it's going to be ugly
at times.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina hit .287 with 56 RBI last season and was named the
team's MVP by his teammates. Obviously, what DiSarcina brings to a
team isn't directly reflected by statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm capable of doing and what I'm not capable of
doing,'' DiSarcina said. ``I'm not capable of doing what Tim Salmon
can do _ hit home runs and drive in runs. I'm not going to alter a
game with stats. If they're expecting me to hit grand slams and
three-run homers, they're mistaken. But attitude-wise, defensively,
I can be more of a leader out there. I'll try to run the bases
correctly, be aggressive _ that can be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He means everything, he's our leader,'' Angels
catcher/outfielder Todd Greene said. ``He doesn't have to hit .300
or hit 20 home runs. He brings a mentality to the team that we
need. He's aggressive, he's a great baserunner, he's our leader.
There's definitely been a lack of a strong team leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going out on a rehab assignment, DiSarcina had been
traveling with the team. He said the attitude doesn't necessarily
need to be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not adjusted, refocused,'' he said. ``Sometimes the focus gets
blurred. Situations with what the manager is doing, or what
(general manager) Billy Bavasi is doing blurs your focus from what
the team needs to focus on, which is winning each game.''

SLUMPING MONDESI WILL GET A REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One thing Raul Mondesi doesn't like to do is sit.
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson understands that, but he won't change
his philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes to rests players. Therefore, for the first time
this season Mondesi won't be in the starting lineup for tonight's
game with the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who carried the Dodgers offense at times during the
first two months, has one homer in his last 77 at-bats. And after
hitting .305 during the aforementioned hot spell, Mondesi is in a
3-for-30 slump in which his average dipped to .267.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondesi never looks sluggish to me,'' Johnson said. ``He got
the hit to get us a run (Tuesday). I don't want him to get in a
rut.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting 18 homers and driving in 44 runs in the first two
months, Mondesi has one homer and six RBI in 18 games in June.
</P>
<P>
   In his place, Johnson said Todd Hollandsworth will start against
Padres righty Woody Williams. Johnson said he's also going to rest
leadoff hitter Eric Young in favor of Craig Counsell. Hollandsworth
and Counsell will give the Dodgers a left-handed presence in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Chase will wait: Padres right fielder Tony Gwynn said the worst
part of his pursuit of 3,000 hits is answering the same questions
day after day. The second worst part are the injuries, which have
cost Gwynn the better part of three weeks this season and also
knocked him out of Tuesday's series opener with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn left Saturday's game against Pittsburgh with tightness in
his left calf. He didn't play Sunday and was scratched against the
Dodgers after originally being in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   However, before Gwynn was declared a no-go, he sat down and
talked for nearly two hours about seemingly everything, including
his impending 3,000th hit. Gwynn entered the night 18 hits shy of
the milestone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of weeks I've tried to remind myself to have
fun,'' Gwynn said. ``That's what I'm trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After legging out an infield single against Pittsburgh in which
the ball hit off the pitcher first, Gwynn's mind flashed ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got to the base I thought, `God, I hope 3,000 is
clean,''' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the bases: Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Todd
Hundley would likely return to the lineup Saturday in San
Francisco, though it won't be for good. He'll catch lefty Carlos
Perez, who is fighting to keep a spot in the rotation.... For the
second straight game, Adrian Beltre batted second for the Dodgers,
and Jose Vizcaino batted seventh. Beltre is hitting .302, but the
last time Johnson tried to bat Beltre second (mixed in with one
leadoff appearance) he hit .185 (5 for 27) before the idea was
scrapped.... Angel Pena was batting .150 (3 for 20) since taking
over the Dodgers' catching duties from Hundley.... Tuesday's game
was the first of 16 straight the Dodgers play against division
teams; 10 of those are on the road.... The Padres were hoping first
baseman Wally Joyner (left shoulder injury) would return during the
series, but it appears he may not be ready until the weekend....
San Diego plans to activate pitcher Andy Ashby (strained lower
back), so he can start the series finale Thursday.

ANGELS GET TO GARCIA IN EIGHTH IN '70S-STYLE WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was '70s Night at the Kingdome and the Mariners and
Angels played like it. All of a sudden, the mound was higher, the
strike zone wider, hits scarcer.
</P>
<P>
   For 75 minutes Tuesday night, it was a total flashback, with
zeroes filling up half the scoreboard, and the teams limited to one
single per side, five base runners combined.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the bottom of the fifth inning, the Mariners' David
Bell did his best Buddy Bell impersonation, sending a clutch liner
off the left-field wall to drive in Dan Wilson, who had doubled,
with the game's first _ and some were thinking _ only run. Bell
matched dad in footspeed, too, getting thrown out going for a
double.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was snapped back to reality in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim scored four times over the final two innings and stole
away with a 4-2 decision before a shaggy haired, badly dressed
crowd of 26,153. It turned out to be a very '90s outcome, the
Mariners accepting their fourth consecutive defeat to drop to
35-35.
</P>
<P>
   Any generation will agree: it was fun while it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, Mariners rookie pitcher Freddy Garcia, born
in 1976, showed up with Tom Seaver's arm.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander flirted with the Mariners' first complete game
of the season, and seemingly first in two decades, blazing through
the Anaheim lineup three times with little effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling pretty good,'' he said. ``My fastball, curve and
changeup were all pretty good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (8-4) was so unhittable, he retired nine of his first 10
batters and had a one-hitter through five innings, a three-hitter
through seven.
</P>
<P>
   But it all came undone in the eighth after Garcia retired the
first batter. Former Mariner Jeff Huson, hitting for Gary
DiSarcina, doubled to right. Huson scored on Darrin Erstad's single
up the middle. Erstad came around on Randy Velarde's triple to
right-center. Jeff Fassero replaced Garcia and served up a
run-scoring single to Garret Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just held in there and stuck around long enough to get a
couple runs off Garcia,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said. ``I'll
tell you what, he's a tremendous pitcher. He had his changeup
working well all night. We hadn't swung our bats well the whole
game. He just got a couple balls in the middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired Mariners reliever Allen Watson got his first look
at Garcia. He predicted stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be a great one,'' Watson said. ``He throws
pitches for strikes, he throws the ball hard and he's got a great
curveball. ... You don't want to have a performance like that and
have an `L' next to it. He's going to win a lot of games pitching
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia finished with a six-hitter, walking two and striking out
five. He threw 115 pitches, 74 for strikes. He pitched into the
eighth inning for the third time in four outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting better,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella said.
``He pitched well. What can I tell you?''
</P>
<P>
   With the scoreboard revved up, the teams matched runs to finish
things. The Mariners' Alex Rodriguez doubled home Brian Hunter in
the bottom half of the eighth and Anaheim's Matt Luke homered in
the ninth on Watson's third pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The game might have been more suspenseful had Anaheim starter
Steve Sparks not stuck out his pitching hand to deflect Rodriguez's
hard-hit ball. Rodriguez was thrown out on the play by shortstop
DiSarcina to end the third inning. Sparks tried to warm up the next
inning but couldn't continue, leaving with a bruised right ring
finger. The digit was swollen later, but there was no fracture.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels knuckleballer was superb in his 11-batter outing. At
least Phil Niekro would have approved. Sparks had Mariners flailing
at his slow-speed stuff, permitting only a single by Rodriguez and
walk to Edgar Martinez, both in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Three Anaheim relievers finished up, with the second, Mark
Petkovsek (6-2), getting the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitchers kept us in the game tonight,'' the Angels'
Anderson said. ``When that happens, anything can happen. (Garcia's)
a pretty good pitcher. We just had to stay at it. Fortunately, a
couple pitches went our way.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was '70s or '90s, time was on their side Tuesday.

OFFENSE LETS DOWN DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Don't worry if you miss a Dodgers game. They will
replay it, and not the taped version on television the next
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' Every game seems the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won two straight, but an off day made that a distant
memory and brought back the realization that this team keeps losing
despite loads of talent.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park pitched well, but the Dodgers didn't hit. They lost
4-1 to San Diego in the opener of a three-game series Tuesday night
at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had seven hits, none of them remotely timely as they
failed in their attempt to win three straight games for the first
time in nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we couldn't get anything going,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``We seemed to be swinging at a lot of bad
pitches. We have to be pretty much perfect against a tough pitcher
because we're not scoring any runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-5) pitched seven innings, marking the first time this
season starters have thrown a pitch in the seventh inning in five
straight starts. In the last four games, Park, Ismael Valdes,
Darren Dreifort and Kevin Brown allowed eight runs in 341/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Dodgers are 2-2 in those games and in search of their
first three-game winning streak since winning five straight April
27 through May 1.
</P>
<P>
   In their last nine games, the Dodgers' lack of offense has
produced more than three runs only twice.
</P>
<P>
   Padres lefty Sterling Hitchcock (5-6) added to that misery with
62/3 innings of one-run ball. And, heck, if not for an ill-advised
dive by Padres center fielder Ruben Rivera, the Dodgers may not
have scored at all.
</P>
<P>
   After giving the Padres a 2-0 lead in the top of the second with
a two-run homer _ the 17th Park has allowed _ Rivera dived for Raul
Mondesi's liner. He didn't come close, the ball rolled to the wall
and Mondesi wound up with a triple. He scored on Devon White's
groundout.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Dodgers had five at-bats with runners in scoring
position and got the ball out of the infield once. Much of it has
to do with patience at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the pitcher work,'' said Dodgers left fielder
Gary Sheffield, who returned after missing three games with a sore
knee. ``If you don't, it's going to make them that much better. You
can't swing at the first pitch on the black (of the plate). When
you're over-aggressive and swing at the pitcher's pitch, that
doesn't help. That's what young hitters do and veteran pitchers eat
that up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's how Hitchcock breezed through the first six innings and how
Padres reliever Will Cunnane got out of Hitchcock's only jam.
Cunnane retired Adrian Beltre on a grounder to second to end the
seventh inning after Trenidad Hubbard and Eric Young had two-out
singles.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his 16th save,
giving him 376 in his Padres career, a club record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never got anything going against (Hitchcock),'' said
Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros, who went 2 for 4. ``I see hope.
We haven't done anything yet to warrant that, but I still have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-5) gave up three runs on five hits despite allowing the
Padres' leadoff batter to reach base in his last five innings.
However, the only thing that hurt Park was a 3-2 pitch to Rivera in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest blow the Dodgers struck was on the left hand of
Padres catcher Jim Leyritz. Park hit him with a pitch in the fifth
inning, and X-rays revealed a break that will keep Leyritz out four
to six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to throw a strike,'' Park said of Rivera's homer. ``I
was a little down, and he's a low fastball hitter. I'm not supposed
to go to 3-2.''

JUST DON'T LET A BUS CATCH YOU
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Are Muni's bumper-bus drivers accident-prone?
<P>
   A recent Chronicle report noted that one of every nine Muni
drivers/operators has been involved in two or more avoidable
accidents in a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Muni's reaction to the story was interesting: ``Wow, that's
amazing! Holy cow! Where did you get those statistics? From our
files? We have files on that? Where? Oh, those. Gee, we just never
have time to go through that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A Muni employee sends me a confidential report, with note
attached: Maybe this is one of our accident-prone employees?
</P>
<P>
   The report, dated June 15, from the driver of a 38-Geary bus:
Passenger coughed on operator, and operator claimed injury.
</P>
<P>
   THE SKY IS DRIPPING! At the height of Metreon's opening-weekend
frenzy last Friday evening, a pipe in the ceiling was dripping an
unknown liquid onto the winglike baffles and onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the building didn't pass the flush test, says Sam
Whiting.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, no off-duty Muni drivers were injured.
</P>
<P>
   MRE WHEEE! Lotta Dotz sends along a Brigade Quartermasters
survival-gear catalog. It features an MRE Cookbook, tips on making
the most of those Army surplus Meals Ready to Eat.
</P>
<P>
   Boasts the catalog: ``You can make meals that are not just ready
to eat, but are actually great grub!''
</P>
<P>
   They all sound great. I can't choose between the pheasant under
broken glass and the grub tartare.
</P>
<P>
   X GAMES it ain't. But it is hot international sports action, a
big showdown tournament this week between the Brits and the
Americans. In croquet, at Sonoma Cutrer.
</P>
<P>
   Real croquet _ not the namby-pamby picnic knockabout _ is a
ruthless sport, and the Brits traditionally kick our wickets, but
now we've got genuine stars like Jerry Stark, the head croquet pro
at Meadowood resort in St. Helena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Meadowood is such a hot hideaway that even the gophers on the
croquet lawn book holes months in advance. Guests are so pampered
that in the health spa, along with a stair-climber machine, they
have an elevator machine. You get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   X-OUT GAMES: Many local pedestrians aren't stupid, they're
merely clue challenged. While waiting for the light to change in
their favor, they step off the curb and into the active roadway,
where they are a threat to injure innocent cars.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroko Jones wonders, ``Do those extra few steps' advantage over
the other pedestrians earn them bonus points?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are just born with the soul of a matador.
</P>
<P>
   RUSHIN' ROULETTE: Muni's union protects its drivers, sometimes
to the point of hilarity. But what about passenger rights? If one
of every nine drivers is at least somewhat accident-prone, riders
should know what they're getting into.
</P>
<P>
   We need a simple system. On the front right window of every bus
should be decals showing the driver's accident record over the past
two years, indicated by stickers of pedestrians and/or crumpled
cars.
</P>
<P>
   And in the destination box above the driver window, a clue to
the driver's mood. ``Feelin' undertrained.'' ``Feelin' groovy.''
``Hung over.'' ``High on diesel fumes.'' ``NASCAR dropout.'' Just
give riders a clue. Or, to paraphrase Dr. Evil, ``Would someone
throw us a frikkin' bone here?' ''
</P>
<P>
   DR. EVIL? He's the villain in ``The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' If you
can overlook the bathroom humor, it's a great five-minute movie.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still worth seeing because of Dr. Evil, his disaffected
teenage son Scott and the Dr.'s tiny clone, Mini Me. Dr. Evil might
be the best comedy villain since Dr. Strangelove.
</P>
<P>
   NEXT-TO-LAST CALL: In Emeryville, Calif., the Chinese restaurant
called Bavarian Village has changed hands; now it's Sushi Village.
And Douglas Smith notices that the place advertises ``Vegetarian
Drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Grouses Smith, ``I guess I'll be going elsewhere for my
pork-chop smoothies.''
</P>
<P>
   LAST CALL: In the obits Monday, a notice for David F. Stockman
said in part, ``He will be sorely missed by his brother, his niece,
his many friends, as well as several vodka distillers.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Bill says David had a great sense of humor and ``I'm
sure his friends will get a kick out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   We need more honesty and humor in epitaphs, in the opinion of
Greg Casserly of the Chron classifieds. ``What nugget of truth
would you like in your obit when the time comes?'' asks Greg.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to keep it simple: ``In his spare time, he was
Batman.''

GOP INSIDERS EMBRACE BUSH AS POTENTIAL SAVIOR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican establishment opened its arms _ and
checkbooks _ Tuesday to welcome Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his
surging presidential campaign to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans are pinning their electoral hopes to Bush's
coattails, and they treated the son of the former president more
like a political savior than one of nearly a dozen candidates
seeking the party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In his first foray to Washington since announcing his candidacy,
Bush met with scores of senators and representatives on Capitol
Hill, where more than half of the Republican lawmakers have
endorsed his candidacy. Later, he attended a record-size
fund-raiser crowded with party power brokers who contributed more
than $2 million to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm through exploring,'' he told the enthusiastic crowd of
more than 2,000. ``I realize it is a huge step to go from being
governor of Texas to president of the United States. But I am
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The warm greeting from Washington insiders carries potential
benefits and risks for Bush. On the one hand, it solidifies his
hold on the Republican nomination and makes it harder for
challengers to attract funds or support.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it ties him to an institution that is quite
unpopular throughout much of the country. Even as Bush accepted
laurels from the beltway's GOP establishment, he exploited
anti-Washington sentiment as a way to distinguish himself from Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Washington, D.C., person,'' Bush said at campaign stop
in South Carolina. ``He thinks Washington has got all the answers.
I don't. I believe the answers are found in our communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he arrived in Washington, Bush took a more diplomatic
approach while still tapping into the disgust that many people have
with the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many across the land look at Washington, and they don't like
what they see,'' Bush said at the fund-raiser, where he was careful
not to criticize the lobbyists, lawmakers, former ambassadors and
other influence-peddlers standing before him.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush took aim at President Clinton _ without mentioning
him by name _ and his reputation for political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public
opinion,'' Bush said to sustained applause. ``The purpose of
politics is not to embarrass your opponents. It is to advance your
ideals, to make a difference, to make America a better nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been endorsed by 126 members of the House and 23
members of the Senate _ an unprecedented level of support for a
nonincumbent more than a year before the nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the closed-door meeting at the Capitol, Bush gave only
cursory remarks, devoting the bulk of his time to gladhanding the
lawmakers and saying how much he looks forward to teaming up with a
Republican majority, according to several participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I'd work with them,'' Bush said upon emerging from the
sessions, carefully assuring Republicans that he would not try to
bolster his status at their expense. ``I'm not going to bash the
Republican members of the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps reflecting the public's low opinion of the current
Congress, Bush's campaign staff made sure there were no
opportunities for photos of the governor with the mass of
lawmakers. The lawmakers nevertheless gave strong reviews of his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a unified campaign behind a strong candidate is very
important,'' said Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., who has endorsed
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the past two elections have featured presidential
candidates who were unable to help Republicans win seats in
Congress. He said the presidential candidates had ``written off
California since 1988,'' and he was optimistic that Bush will not
only compete in the West, but that he will be a great help in
electing California Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Cox was one of about 100 representatives, 14 senators and 50
former ambassadors who served on the host committee for the
fund-raiser, the biggest in Washington history. Held at the
Washington Hilton, about a mile from the White House, tables were
removed from the hall to make room for at least 2,000 guests, most
of whom had donated $1,000 _ the maximum allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The money raised last night adds to a campaign coffer far fatter
than that of any other GOP candidate. By month's end, the Bush
campaign expects to have raised between $15 million and $20
million, according to a senior campaign official. No other
Republican candidate is expected to have raised even half that.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, who reported $10 million in contributions
through last March, is aiming at a total of $65 million. Campaign
spokesman Roger Salazar said the campaign will divulge its balance
next month, as required by law.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dinner, the well-heeled crowd was treated to
tortilla chips, guacamole and brownies, as George Strait sang about
West Texas in music piped over the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen this (kind of) enthusiasm since 1980,'' said
veteran GOP strategist Rich Galen, who directs a party political
action committee known as GOPAC.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was accompanied by his wife, Laura, told those
attending he appreciated their support, particularly coming from
``a town that's not easily impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest applause came when he took an indirect swipe at
Clinton's ethical troubles, saying that if elected, ``I will swear
not only to uphold the law of the land, I will swear to uphold the
dignity of the office to which I have been elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Delivering his standard 25-minute stump speech, Bush called for
reduced taxes, fewer regulations, tort reform, improved schools and
a more powerful military.

 Thin servers help companies get around Internet congestion  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
One hurdle small businesses face in the e-commerce age is finding
quick-and-simple e-mail service and online access for all employees
through a single Internet connection.
<P>
   A growing number of companies are tackling the problem with
so-called thin server Internet appliances. The devices, about the
size of a toaster and as easy to use, sell for around $1,500 to
$3,000. They allow up to 100 employees working on computers in a
small office to do a variety of tasks such as:
</P>
<P>
   _Send and receive e-mail inside and outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   _Connect to and gather information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _Set up and maintain a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _Maintain privacy and security for individual and company files.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, these little boxes don't require a software
guru to set up or manage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading companies in this fast-growing e-commerce
niche are based in the Bay Area. They include Cobalt Networks of
Mountain View, Encanto Networks of Santa Clara and Whistle
Communications of Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   Ramp Networks, a Santa Clara maker of routing equipment that
lets employees in a small office share the same Internet
connection, yesterday raised $57.5 million in its initial stock
offering. Ramp shares rose 52.3 percent, from $11 to $16.75, giving
the company a market value of about $335 million.
</P>
<P>
   As another sign of the importance of this market, International
Business Machines Corp. bought Whistle Communications two weeks ago
as a key part of its campaign to expand its presence in the
small-business  &LR;   &LR; market. No price was announced, but informed
sources say it topped $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whistle CEO John Hamm compares his company's ``InterJet''
product to the Swiss Army knife. ``It's an all-in-one device for
small business,'' he said. ``Everything you need is right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The company started 31/2 years ago to simplify the complex task
of establishing Internet communications in small businesses and to
remove the barriers preventing nontechnical organizations from
fully participating in the online revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Weiser, executive producer and partner at Compass Rose
Media in Santa Cruz, is sold on the product. ``It's the coolest box
on the planet,'' he said. ``You plug it in and don't know it's
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produce films and commercial videos and rely on the Web and
electronic communication to an incredible degree. We couldn't do
business where we do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiser's company learned about the product a couple of years ago
while doing a video for Whistle Communications and quickly dumped
its dedicated server and special software for the easy-to-use
Internet appliance. All nine employees are hooked up for e-mail,
and the company can quickly contact its 100 temp employees as well
as customers in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Magic of Walnut Creek is another fan. The company,
which stamps logos and custom-printed messages on thousands of
promotional items from mugs and T-shirts to pens and paper clip
holders, had a network computer and half-dozen workstations two
years ago. But it suffered a serious bottleneck getting electronic
information to and from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Clients such as BART, Safeway and radio station K101 e-mailed
their logos and other data to a single computer with Internet
access. And all the final designs similarly had to be funneled to
hundreds of contract manufacturers through the lone Internet access
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees started coming to me one, then two, then 10
times a day to ask if their art work had come in or been sent
out,'' recalled Vice President Hari Boukis, 33, who runs the small
business with his CEO wife, Rosalind. ``It got to the point I
wasn't getting any other work done. I was an e-mail downloader.''
</P>
<P>
   Boukis began looking for technology solutions to this
information stranglehold and discovered an ad for Whistle's
InterJet in a trade magazine. He was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically sign up with a small business ISP  &LR; (Internet
Service Provider), plug one end of the box into the computer hub
and the other into a phone, enter a code number and press go,''
said Boukis. ``A child could set this up.''
</P>
<P>
   The little tan box that Advertising Magic bought from Whistle
for $2,600 in 1997 now costs about $1,500. But Boukis is happy he
didn't wait to buy the system. All eight employees are
e-mail-enabled and together send and receive up to 9,000 messages a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also send queries and order products at the
company's Web site ( &LR; www.advertisingmagic.com &LR; ). Boukis said the
company picks ups as many as 15 new clients a day off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to its leap to e-commerce, Advertising
Magic anticipates reaching $1.9 million in revenues this year,
compared to $1.3 million last year and about $1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet appliance convert is Anderson Brule Architects
in San Jose. Two years ago, the firm had e-mail coming in to just
one computer. ``It wasn't working too well,'' said project
architect Krista Falkenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients expected us all to have e-mail, but it was only
checked occasionally, and someone here might not know for two days
that there were drawings or other messages waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all 40 employees get e-mail in a flash, and Falkenberg
notes that access to Internet research also has made the firm more
efficient.

   1. DISNEY'S 'TARZAN' SWINGS INTO SUMMER Tarzan is one of the
most indelible images on film and it seems he has graced the screen
forever. Since 1918, just six years after Edgar Rice Burroughs sold
his first version of the story, there have been more than 40 movies
based on the character. But ``Tarzan'' marks the first time the
tale has been brought to feature-length animated life. It was
something Burroughs always wanted; he expressed his desires in a
1936 letter to his son. Any animated film of his most famous
creation, Burroughs wrote, would have to ``approximate Disney
excellence.'' By Renee Graham. From The Boston Globe. 1,300 words +

   ALFRED HITCHCOCK There aren't a lot of people still around who
worked with legendary director Alfred Hitchcock in his prime. But
Martin Landau is one of them. This year, which marks Hitchcock's
centennial, is also the 40th anniversary of Landau's film debut, in
Hitchcock's classic ``North By Northwest'' (1959.) ``Hitchcock
basically had enormous respect for actors, `` Landau says. 'He was
a provocateur. Some of the things they said about him, that he
treated actors like cattle, that wasn't so.'' By Lawrence Wells.

dialogue was a bigger challenge,'' she says, ``Wilde's language is
inherently theatrical, which is part of the beauty of it, but you
can't do too much of that in a film, because it just doesn't work.
The goal was to make it somewhat naturalistic and more
accessible.'' By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.

RACHEL GRIFFITHS : OUT FROM DOWN UNDER AND HEADED
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE TOP The secret to success for today's Australian actors
seems fairly obvious : Pack a bag, leave home and expect to be away
for years. ``It's good to work overseas,'' says Australian actress
Rachel Griffiths. ``Our industry is very small and it makes sense
to do only one picture a year in Australia, otherwise you get
overexposed.'' Earlier this year she was a Best Supporting Actress
contender for her role as Hilary du Pre, older sister of the late
British cellist Jacqueline du Pre in the film ``Hilary and
Jackie.'' In her new film ``My Son the Fanatic'' she plays a
refreshing variation on the classic hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold.
``I was touched by it and the way in which it juxtaposes love and
compassion against hatred and intolerance,'' she says. By Ivor
Davis. 1,300 words + photos. (N/A Great Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
``WEST-WARD HO!'' KEVIN KLINE GOES WILD WILD Kevin Kline thinks of
himself as a character actor, but he has the dashing good looks of
a leading man. He's a workaholic, but he spends a long time waiting
for good roles to come along and his passion for acting remains
undimmed. When his latest film, the megabudget summer blockbuster
``Wild Wild West'' opens, Kline will be co-starring with Will Smith
as two heroes in post-Civil War America, trying to thwart the evil
plans of mad scientist Arliss Loveless (played by Kenneth Branagh.)
Klein had no hesitation in accepting this comedy role. By Cindy
Pearlman. 1,300 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 6.
SAMMY KERSHAW BUILDS TO LAST There's nothing typical about country
singer Sammy Kershaw. Unlike many of his peers, some of whom spent
thousands on ``image consultants'' to make sure they appear as
wholesome and politically correct as possible, with Kershaw, what
you see is what you get. And the 40-year-old singer, who grew up in
the heart of rural Louisiana's Cajun country, likes to keep it that
way. By Michael A. Capozzoli Jr. BPI. 800 words + photo.
_____________________________________________________________ 7.
CYNDI LAUPER : THE WOMAN BENEATH THE BLUE HAIR More than 15 years
since Cyndi Lauper burst onto the music scene with wild orange
hair, punk/retro outfits and the revolutionary idea that ``Girls
Just Want To Have Fun,'' her style is still uncompromising (though
her hair is now blue.) After many years of ups and downs in the
business, she is coming out on top as an entertainer. Lauper speaks
about her life with blunt honesty and cutting humour. By Tamara
Conniff. BPI. 1,100 words + photo.

REVOLUTION TRADE GORTER FOR GORI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The rejuvenation of the Revolution continues.
</P>
<P>
   After slogging through the early part of the season, the
Revolution have demonstrated the potential to be a solid playoff
contender after earning 9 points in the last five games and, more
significant, avoiding regulation-time defeat. And Tuesday they
added Argentine defender Mario Gori in a trade with Miami for Edwin
Gorter, a move that should bolster the defense and change the
team's attacking dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Gori, 26, won two MLS Cup titles with D.C. United after joining
the league from Rosario Central in 1996. He is a dynamic left-sided
player and his presence should not only provide depth but also
allow Ted Chronopoulos to move into midfield as the Revolution
prepare to visit Dallas without suspended left-sided midfielder
Ivan McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter, 35, joined the Revolution as a midfield choreographer
last season and played 28 games, but was forced into a sweeper role
as the team suffered through a nine-game losing streak. He was
suspended for the first two games this season after a practice
incident involving former teammate David Nakhid but was expected to
regain a leadership role on the team.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gorter was substituted in the 55th minute of his first
start, against Columbus April 17, and argued with assistant coach
Giuseppe Galderisi on the sideline. Since then, Gorter has played
the entire game in midfield only once, during a 2-0 loss at
Columbus May 15.
</P>
<P>
   He was moved to sweeper for a 2-0 win over Chicago three weeks
later, then provided the last-minute tying goal against Miami, and
was again benched.
</P>
<P>
   Player-coach Walter Zenga apparently made it clear that Gorter
was not in the team's plans, a decision that likely should have
been made earlier.Though Gorter is among the most experienced and
skillful performers ever to have played for the Revolution, his
style apparently clashed with the expectations of Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second Miami-Revolution deal in two weeks, as
defensive midfielder Carlos Parra joined New England last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gori will rejoin two former D.C. United teammates: John Harkes
and Kris Kelderman.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, major trade speculation regarding Miami has centered
around Revolution striker Joe-Max Moore, who has expressed interest
in playing for the Fusion. A Moore-for-Eric Wynalda trade could
happen after the season. But Moore appears to be finding success
with the Revolution, as he scored his fourth and fifth goals of the
season in a 3-2 victory over Tampa Bay Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally focused on my team and getting to the championship
game at Foxboro Stadium,'' Moore said Tuesday. ``There are always
other possibilities, and any player at age 28 needs to take a look
at all of them. But if I can re-sign with the league at comparable
money to what I am making now, I will probably do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore has been encouraged by the Revolution's recent success.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were losing nine games in a row, it was no fun for
us,'' Moore said. ``The guys are enjoying training more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan and Carlos are out for this game but I don't think it
will set us back too much. Everyone is feeling good and
confident.''

 &HT;    Treasured memories of a mom
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When her mother sewed her First Communion dress
35 years ago, Renee Lammers was none too happy _ and she made sure
Mom knew about it. Why did she have to wear a simple, homemade
dress? Her heart was set on one of those confections of tulle and
lace, the kind all the other girls were wearing, with ``so much
crinoline it could stick out sideways.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not to be. Lammers had one of those frugal mothers,
one of those mothers who makes all your clothing. You know the
type, the bane of daughters everywhere: One of those mothers who
saves things.
</P>
<P>
   So when Lammers took her youngest daughter, Tricia, shopping
recently, she braced herself when they passed the rack of First
Communion dresses. She waited for the inevitable plea: ``Mom, why
can't I have one of those dresses?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Tricia noted, ``These dresses have lots of
decorations on them, and mine doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ``But my dress has lots of love in it, and these
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 7, Lammers marveled, Tricia had discovered what it
had taken her mother more than 30 years to realize.
</P>
<P>
   Lammers immediately got her mother on the phone in Wausau, Wisc.
Shirley Niederhofer nearly wept with pride. It had taken 35 years,
but here at last was somebody who appreciated her handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   Lammers hadn't given her First Communion dress much thought
until she took it out of blue tissue paper three years ago for
oldest daughter Katie, 10. ``Mom saved it all those years,''
Lammers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, the once-scorned finery was beautiful _ simple
and elegant, with a linen top, white-eyelet skirt and matching
jacket. Lammers may have grown out of the dress, but her taste had
grown into it.
</P>
<P>
   The family had moved to Ohio two years ago from Minneapolis.
Although Renee and husband Ted love their new neighborhood, it was
wrenching to leave behind their longtime church, St. Hedwig, a
close-knit Polish parish of about 350 families.
</P>
<P>
   For First Communion, you need more than the white dress and the
well-drilled catechism. You need family, tradition, cousin Marcia
St. Hilaire at the organ and Father Ted Guminga on the altar.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of joining more than 100 communicants last month at
her new parish, Incarnation Church, Tricia formed a Communion class
of one last week at St. Hedwig.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Father Ted all my life,'' Lammers said. ``He
baptized me, gave me my First Communion, and performed our marriage
ceremony. Now he has baptized and given First Communion to all
three of my kids. He has been trying to retire, but no one will let
him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the big day, Tricia donned the First Communion dress,
discovering, like her mother before her, that she could twirl its
wide A-line skirt like a square dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Like her mother before her, Tricia renewed her Baptismal vows,
and received a scapular blessed by Father Ted. Her parents couldn't
keep from choking up as they watched their shy daughter perform so
gracefully in the spotlight, wearing her dress not like a
hand-me-down but like the most priceless of family heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, it was _ a legacy of family history and family
love, the gift of mothers who save things.

 &HT;    `Sarge' defends life, dignity of area's homeless
 &HT;    By Emily Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A friend on my street just had a baby so
I cooked them up a casserole _ shepherd's pie, my specialty _ and I
went down there, bubbling dinner in hand. ``Aren't you sweet!'' she
cooed at me, after we got done cooing at her beautiful boy. And I
went home wearing a smile, a big one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was nice,'' I thought. ``I'm a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I met Sarge.
</P>
<P>
   You and I, we might do a little something nice every once in a
while, when time or spirit moves us. But Sarge Huffman? He does
something nice every day of his life. Every day!
</P>
<P>
   He puts me to shame, that Sarge.
</P>
<P>
   About three years ago Sarge, a 50-year-old veteran, decided he
was going to take care of the homeless in Palm Beach County. He
knew he couldn't reach them all. He also knew he could very well
try. So he started working with Pastor Tim Bumgardner over at the
Palm Beach Worship Center. Sarge and Pastor Tim opened the City of
Refuge network, and what they do is both simple and enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Every day they take food and supplies to the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The first homeless man Sarge ever met was an old guy named
Popps. Popps was about 85 and he'd lived under the bridge at the
Lake Worth Canal for about 14 years. Like most of Sarge's street
friends, Popps had nothing, nothing at all. Then Popps met Sarge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few weeks, I didn't just see a person,'' says
Sarge. ``I saw my grandfather.'' Today, Popps lives in a nice
trailer and has himself a bank account. Sarge loves to tell that
story.
</P>
<P>
   Sarge says this is his calling, and when you talk to him _
believer in God or not _ you have to at least believe in a person's
calling. At first all the people with regular paychecks and
air-conditioned cubicles gave him a hard time because Sarge and
Pastor Tim are what the establishment calls a ``faith group.'' And
those Bible thumpers, they're awful hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to beat down doors to get any attention,'' says Sarge.
</P>
<P>
   But now when you call the establishment, the folks there give
you Sarge's number. ``He'll know whatever you need to know,'' they
say. And he does.
</P>
<P>
   He knows where they sleep, how they smell. Sarge knows the
demons of their pasts. By conservative estimates, there are about
3,000 homeless people in Palm Beach County. Some say the number is
surely 2 1/2 times that, since it's hard to count the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go home and cry,'' Sarge says. ``I still cry
sometimes, like after what they did with Ronald.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald F. Neuendank, 57, was a homeless man who was sleeping in
his camp over by Summit Boulevard one night back in May when some
teenagers, supposedly mad because Neuendank had mooned them, poured
black tar all over him. Sarge took him to the new veteran's
hospital _ the one that used to ask for all these homeless guys'
discharge papers, their DD214s, until Sarge knocked some sense into
their heads _ and the medical folks there cleaned Neuendank up.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sarge and Pastor Tim tracked down Neuendank's brother.
``They thought he was dead,'' Sarge says. But he wasn't. Sarge sent
Ronald home to Wassau, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, someone will stop Sarge and ask him why
he does what he does. Someone like me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get a phone call at 10 o'clock at night from someone
who says they've been straight now for a year, that's like hitting
the lottery,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That Sarge. Someone should take him a casserole.

 &HT;    At 82, magician is still up to his old tricks
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's all an illusion, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The old man doesn't really turn a one-dollar bill into a fifty.
If he could do that, he wouldn't be sitting in his small kitchen in
West Palm Beach, surrounded by dusty clutter and faded photos
affixed to the walls with cracked and yellowed tape.
</P>
<P>
   He can't really foretell the future, but when he puts a deck of
cards face down on the table and says, ``Go ahead, pick the jack of
clubs,'' and you pull a card at random from the pile and flip it
over and it's the jack of clubs, you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Peter Gross. He's 82. Illusion has been his life
since he dropped out of high school in 1931 after seeing a guy
named The Great Cardini perform sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   He has made a living at prestidigitation, a meager living he
says. He was never a star, never played the big Vegas hotels or
Catskill resorts. Weddings, wakes and wingdings might better
describe his venues. Birthday parties. Fund raisers. Jerry Lewis
telethons.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite possesion is an old manila folder stuffed with
thank-you notes from hospitals and charities. The letters date from
1962 _ typed on a manual typewriter _ to 1998. They are brief
notes. But they speak to Gross. And say something about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 40 years, I did parties at big houses all over Palm Beach,
Miami, Boca. I knew Burt Reynolds before he was on Gunsmoke.
Ricardo Montalban. Governor Claude Kirk was my friend, used to eat
breakfast with him in Palm Beach, almost 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew them all.''
</P>
<P>
   But those old friends stopped calling and the magic jobs went
begging after Peter Gross was convicted of selling knock-off
watches and suitcases out of his house. That was 1995. And again in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   He's 82 and on probation for five years. The judge wanted to
send him to jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it. I'm a convicted felon. It was a mistake,'' he says.
``Social Security and playing birthday parties didn't pay the
bills. I sold fake Gucci, fake Rolex watches, fake Louis Vuitton
luggage. My customers were cops, a New Hampshire judge, ladies at
beauty parlors, everybody. And rich people too cheap to buy the
real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted the illusion, didn't they? And I gave it to them.
But could I sell the stuff if nobody wanted to buy it?''
</P>
<P>
   He recounts his past _ three years in a Civilian Conservation
Corps camp, four years in the Army, two marriages _ while attired
in a Kelley green sports jacket, a print shirt and plaid pants.
There is no illusion of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made $10 a month in the CCC. Not much more in the Army. Made
a little on the side playing cards. But I never dealt from the
bottom, no funny business. One, I didn't have to. I was a good card
player. Two, they'd break your arms. Anyway, everyone knew what I
could do with a deck.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 a head-on crash at milepost 18 on Florida's Turnpike
killed Gross' brother and left Gross with a dozen smashed bones.
His hands were spared. He went on disability _ Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing 60 and in the hospital for four months, he finally faced
the fact that he'd never be headlining on the Vegas Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, you'll find Gross working his magic on Clematis
Street, being tossed the odd dollar from bar patrons wandering from
one revitalized urban watering hole to the next. You'll also find
him at local nursing homes, where he puts a little magic back into
the lives of old people, some of whom were dealt bad hands.
</P>
<P>
   We all have to play the cards we're dealt in life. It looks like
Peter Gross deals his own. But even when it appears you deal
yourself the hand, you still have to play it. When it comes to
life, Gross, like many old men, plays a great deal of solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   His dog, a big black fluffy mutt, sits at his feet. The dog's
name is Whitey. Gross likes blatant irony, the sort you don't have
to think about.
</P>
<P>
   He rolls out one-liners as if Henny Youngman were his coach:
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't see the card disappear? And you drive a car?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I only play cards when I need money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanna play cards? I'll return half your losses. Such a
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   He asks a visitor to write something, anything, on a playing
card. He stands in the next room, his back to the visitor. Now put
the card back in the deck, he says. He returns to the room,
shuffles the deck. Then he reaches into his breast pocket, pulls
out a sealed envelope. Tears it open. The card tumbles out.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive, but you need an audience for this. Otherwise, you're
just fooling yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two grown daughters,'' he says, as he shuffles a deck.
``They grew up with their grandmother, in Canada. But I visit them,
and the grandchildren come here. See, on the wall? That's a family
portrait, done by Mort Kaye.''
</P>
<P>
   He drops more names. Actors, singers, politicians, Shep and
Curley of the Three Stooges. They're all dead.
</P>
<P>
   A Life magazine is on the table, along with the morning's
dishes, tea cups, old photo albums, newspapers, pens, pencils and
decks of cards. The Life magazine is from 1939. ``I gotta catch up
with my reading,'' says Gross.
</P>
<P>
   His remaining knock-off inventory is stacked in a corner _ a few
plastic brief cases, thick with dust. ``I think I need help
cleaning up the place, but my cleaning lady just quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Always the joker.
</P>
<P>
   You sit with Gross for an hour and you realize he can do
something so many old people who live in old houses with old
memories can't. He can conjure an illusion, at will, in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle said a convincing impossibility was preferable to an
unconvincing possibility. That's what puts the magic in magic.
That's what packs the audience into the theater, fills the house.
</P>
<P>
   That's what keeps an old man laughing in an empty house.
</P>

<P>

 &HT;    (EDS: In two takes _ take 1)
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: A TV announcer discussing the wedding of Prince Edward and
Sophie Rhys-Jones said Britain's new poet laureate had composed a
poem calling for their privacy. Who is the poet, and can you print
the poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poet is Andrew Motion, 47. He succeeded Ted Hughes,
Britain's former poet laureate, who died of cancer in October. This
is Motion's first official poem, titled ``Epithalamium St. George's
Chapel, Windsor'':
</P>
<P>
   One day, the tissue-light through stained glass falls/ on vacant
stone, on gaping pews, on air/ made up of nothing more than atom
storms/ which whiten silently, then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The next, all this is charged with brimming life./ A
people-river floods those empty pews,/ and music-torrents break _
but then stop dead/ to let two human voices make their vows:/
</P>
<P>
   to work _ so what is true today remains the truth;/ to hope _
for privacy and what its secrets show;/ to trust _ that all the
world can offer it will give;/ to love _ and what it has to
understand to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that movie actress Susan Hayward is buried in
Georgia. Do you know where?
</P>
<P>
   A: Her final resting place is Our Lady of Perpetual Help
Catholic Church outside Carrollton. The actress (``I Want to
Live,'' ``With a Song in My Heart'' and dozens of other films) died
March 14, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A church spokeswoman said many people continue to visit the
actress' burial site. The church is at 210 Old Center Point Road,
about 5 miles off I-20 at exit 4. At Hayward's request, the
tombstone bears the name Mrs. F.E. Chalkley (Her second husband,
after actor Jess Barker, was Carrollton businessman Floyd Eaton
Chalkley). Because of the number of visitors, the church has added
a small marble stone with the name Susan Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Christian Coalition is in trouble and I'd like to help.
What is the address to send a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Christian Coalition, 1801-L Sara Drive, Chesapeake, VA 23320.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Newspapers reported recently on a UCLA award to blacklisted
writers. What was the blacklist all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It dealt with a move in the spring of 1947 by the House
Committee on Un-American Activities to undertake what its chairman,
Rep. J. Parnell Thomas (R-N.J.), called ``Communism in motion
pictures.'' While the accusation that films of the period contained
Communist propaganda was generally discredited, there was at least
one factual substance to the charge. A number of famous Hollywood
directors, screenwriters and actors either joined the Communist
Party or contributed funds to its cause during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people had dropped their affiliations before the
House committee convened, but in September 1947 some 20 witnesses
named people who, they claimed, were leftists. On the strength of
that cooperative testimony, about 40 filmmakers suspected of
leftist sympathies were subpoenaed to appear before the committee.
The committee said it had evidence that 10 of the filmmakers were
members of the Communist Party. The 10 refused to testify, and were
given prison sentences of six months to a year for contempt of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the infamous practice of
``blacklisting,'' meaning that many people _ eventually more than
320 _ were fired and no longer permitted to work in the American
movie industry. The practice continued into the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the recent UCLA award to the 10 screenwriters was
sparked by a controversial award presented to director Elia Kazan
at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Kazan had testified before
the House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that President Clinton enjoyed some of
France's ``famed cuisine'' at a dinner in Paris recently with
French President Jacques Chirac. The restaurant wasn't identified.
Was it Maxim's?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The two presidents, and their wives, dined at Chez L'Ami,
a bistro on a narrow street in a working-class neighborhood on the
Right Bank. The next day, Clinton told reporters that they had a
``wonderful dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Elysee Palace described the meal as cured ham and fois gras from
the Landes region in southwest France, followed by roasted milk-fed
lamb with bearnaise potatoes and girolles mushrooms. The wine was a
1990 Saint-Julien. Fruit finished off the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The WNBA's All-Star game will be played in New York next
month. Do you have ticket information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tickets for the inaugural All-Star Game on July 14 are
available at all Ticketmaster outlets, as well as Ticketmaster
Charge-By-Phone (212-307-7171); through the Ticketmaster Web site
(www.ticketmaster.com); at the game site, Madison Square Garden;
and in New York at the NBA Store, Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street.
Tickets are $10, $30, $40 and $75 (plus surcharges if purchased
from Ticketmaster). The game will be televised nationally on ESPN,
starting at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   More ticket information is available from Madison Square Garden
at 212-465-6741.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the status of DNA testing in the case of
former Green Beret Jeffrey MacDonald? He was convicted of killing
his wife and two children at Fort Bragg, N.C., in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. District Court Judge James Fox in Wilmington, N.C.,
ruled in March that a new kind of DNA test could be performed on
evidence from the murder scene. Andrew Good, one of MacDonald's
attorneys, described the testing as the same type that was used to
try to connect President Thomas Jefferson with Sally Heming, a
slave.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CBS' ``This Morning'' on March 29, Good said it
would be ``a matter of months'' before his team could identify the
laboratories that would do the testing on hairs found at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates to Feb. 17, 1970, when MacDonald's pregnant wife,
Colette, and their two young children, Kimberly and Kristy, were
murdered in their beds. MacDonald, a physician stationed at Fort
Bragg, claimed intruders beat and stabbed him and then killed his
family. Charges against MacDonald were dropped after a military
hearing, but in 1979 he was tried and convicted in a civilian
court. He was sentenced to three life terms, but released in 1980
after an appeal. Two years later the Supreme Court reinstated his
conviction and sent him back to prison, where he has remained.
MacDonald's case inspired the best-selling book and TV miniseries
``Fatal Vision.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald has a Web site _ www.TheMacDonaldDefense.Org/ _ with a
message on the subject of DNA testing posted by him on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Episodes of the '60s TV show ``The Prisoner'' were shown the
other night on TVLand. What was the actual location of the village?
</P>
<P>
   A: For those who don't know, let's rehash the essentials of the
plot. Intriguing, highly imaginative and at times complex, ``The
Prisoner'' concerned a secret agent, presumably named John Drake
(we say presumably because his name wasn't revealed, but this
series was a continuation from the last episode of another program,
``Secret Agent,'' which featured Patrick McGoohan as Drake).
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to locate a missing scientist, Drake allowed him to
defect to Russia when he discovered the nature of the scientist's
work: the completion of a deadly mind-transference device. Drake
was gassed, and upon waking found himself the prisoner of a
self-contained community known as The Village, a fantasylike area
bounded by mountains and an ocean, a place from which there was no
escape. He discovered that he was no longer a man, but a number:
No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which had 17 episodes, was filmed almost entirely
at Portmeirion, North Wales. ``The Prisoner'' initially was
broadcast by CBS from June 1, 1968, to Sept. 21, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that MGM recently bought back its film library from
Turner Broadcasting. What effect will this have on Turner Classic
Movies, which shows these films?
</P>
<P>
   A: The film library has not been sold back to MGM, said TBS
spokeswoman Kara Franey, so there will be no effect on Turner
Classic Movies. MGM has taken back only the distribution of home
videos, which may account for the confusion, Franey said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tom Hanks, appearing on the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards
June 16, gave a toll-free number for people to call to contribute
to the World War II Memorial in Washington. I want to make a
donation in honor of my late father, a World War II veteran, but I
didn't get the number. Do you have it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-639-4992. The first voice you'll hear is that of
Hanks, star of the World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in a
recorded greeting. Donations to the memorial can be made by calling
that number, or can be mailed to World War II Memorial, P.O. Box
96766, Washington, DC 20090-6766. If you're online, try this
address _ www.wwIImemorial.com _ for more information and to make
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although I'm a staunch Democrat, I had been seriously
considering Sen. John McCain, if he gets the Republican
presidential nomination. However, I heard that he made a derogatory
remark about Chelsea Clinton. Do you have any details, so I can
decide if he is worthy of my consideration?
</P>
<P>
   A: The remark by McCain (R-Ariz.), which was said to be a slur
against the looks of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and
Janet Reno, was made more than a year ago. News of his offending
quip first appeared in The Washington Post's Reliable Sources
political column June 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, which did not report the content of the remark, quoted
McCain as saying this afterward: ``Yes. I made a very unfortunate
and insensitive remark. It was the wrong thing to do, and I have no
excuse for it.'' His spokeswoman, Nancy Ives, said at the time that
a letter of apology had been delivered to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, then Clinton's press secretary, said Clinton
considered McCain's apology letter to be heartfelt. ``The president
certainly understands how you get caught saying things you
ordinarily wouldn't have said,'' McCurry added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a recall or class-action
suit of some type concerning Louisiana-Pacific siding?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved compensation for the cost to homeowners of
repairing damage to exterior Louisiana-Pacific Inner-Seal siding
installed between the mid-1980s and Jan. 1, 1996. Eligible
claimants must file a claim before Jan. 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To hear recorded information from the claims administrator for
the settlement program, call 1-800-245-2722. Or write: L-P
Inner-Seal Siding Litigation, P.O. Box 3240, Portland, OR 97208.
Online information _ available at www.lpsidingclaims.com _ includes
complete details about the litigation and settlement forms.

   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently about a lottery drawing of sorts for
two free tickets to the Masters golf tournament each year. You gave
an address, but I lost the clipping. Can you print the information
again?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a bit of a misstatement. There is no lottery drawing
for two free tickets to the Masters. What we have printed in the
past is information about a random drawing for tickets to the
Masters practice rounds. To enter, send a letter with your name,
address, daytime telephone number and Social Security number to:

subcontractor, was arrested April 1 at his brother's house in New
Jersey. He was released on $100,000 bail. At last report,
arraignment had not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey authorities charged Smith with five crimes, including
interruption of public communication. They allege that he wrote the
Melissa software bug _ apparently named by him after a topless
dancer in Florida _ with malicious intent, knowing the chaos it
would cause. For a time, the virus clogged e-mail accounts and shut
down computer networks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorney, Steve Altman, contends that his client never
intended to do harm. Smith faces as much as 40 years in prison and
a $480,000 fine, according to New Jersey authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that the Chelsea Flower Show in England will be
the subject of a TV program in the United States this summer. Do
you have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Chelsea Flower Show,'' featuring coverage of the 1998
event, will be rebroadcast at 5 p.m. Aug. 29 on HGTV (Home &AMP; Garden
Television), according to Lisa DeMille, spokeswoman for the cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When the Census Bureau gets information from everyone, does
it share that with anyone else, or sell it to commercial interests?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The agency says it ``never shares'' the answers given on
census forms and keeps them ``strictly confidential.'' The
information collected provides only local area data needed for
communities to receive federal program funds and for private sector
and community planning, the bureau adds.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Henry Aaron hit 715 home runs, a phenomenal feat. Can you
list which teams he was playing for when he amassed this total, and
the years?
</P>
<P>
   A: Aaron's career total was 755 home runs, in 12,364 at-bats,
while he was playing for the Milwaukee/Atlanta Braves (National
League) and the Milwaukee Brewers (American League). These are the
year-by-year statistics:
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Braves: 1954 (13 home runs); '55 (27); '56 (26); '57
(44); '58 (30); '59 (39); '60 (40); '61 (34); '62 (45); '63 (44);
'64 (24); '65 (32).
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Braves: 1966 (44); '67 (39); '68 (29); '69 (44); '70
('38); '71 (47); '72 (34); '73 (40); '74 (20).
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Brewers: 1975 (12); '76 (10).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently published a breakdown of Henry Aaron's home runs
by team and year. Can you do the same for Babe Ruth? Also, can you
compare their number of Major League career games and at-bats?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ruth's teams, with years followed by the number of home runs:
</P>
<P>
   Boston Red Sox: 1914 (0); '15 (4); '16 (3); '17 (2); '18 (11);
'19 (29).
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees: 1920 (54); '21 (59); '22 (35); '23 (41); '24
(46); '25 (25); '26 (47); '27 (60); '28 (54); '29 (46); '30 (49);
'31 (46); '32 (41; '33 (34); '34 (22);
</P>
<P>
   Boston Braves: 1935 (6).
</P>
<P>
   In 23 years, Aaron played in 3,298 games , with 12,364 at-bats.
In 22 years, Ruth played in 2,503 games, with 8,399 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just returned from Ireland, where food products from
Belgium have been banned indefinitely because of possible dioxin
contamination. Is there any such ban on those foods in the United
States?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Two government agencies, the Food and Drug
Administration and the Department of Agriculture, are involved. The
United States, like most nations, banned beef, poultry, pork, eggs,
milk, game meat and byproducts from Belgium after it was discovered
that large quantities may have been contaminated by cancer-causing
dioxin. As The Associated Press put it, ``Belgium's gastronomic
reputation has taken a nosedive from Malaysia to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Dioxin is suspected of having spread from tainted animal feed
into all the animals that ate it, as well as all the products made
with those animals.
</P>
<P>
   In a notice dated June 11, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection
Service reported that it continues, as a precautionary measure, to
hold all poultry and pork products from the European Union shipped
since January. No beef slaughtered in the European Union is
imported into the United States either, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
   Information is available online at www.fda.gov and www.usda.gov
explaining the two federal agencies' actions in response to the
scare.
</P>
<P>
   Q: U.S. Rep. Bob Barr is always in the news, but I've never seen
what congressional committees he is assigned to. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barr (R-Ga.) serves on three committees: Banking and
Financial Services; Government Reform and Oversight; and Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a World War II veteran. How can I get my medals replaced?
I've lost them over the years.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Department of Veterans Affairs says medals awarded while
in active service are issued by the appropriate service if
requested by veterans (or by next of kin, if the veteran is
deceased).
</P>
<P>
   Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard: Requests should be sent to the
U.S. Navy Liaison Office, National Personnel Records Center, Room
3475, 9700 Page Ave., St. Louis, MO 63132-5100.
</P>
<P>
   Army: U.S. Army Reserve Personnel Center, Attn: ARPC-VSE, (same
street address, city and ZIP code as above).
</P>
<P>
   Air Force: Military Personnel Records, National Personnel
Records Center, (same address).
</P>
<P>
   The veteran's full name should be printed or typed. The request
must contain the signature of the veteran or, if deceased, the
signature of the next of kin. Include the veteran's branch of
service, service number or Social Security number, and exact or
approximate date of service. If available, include a copy of the
discharge or separation document (WDAGO Form 53-55 or DD Form 214).
</P>
<P>
   If possible, send the request on Standard Form 180, Request
Pertaining To Military Records. These forms are available from VA
offices or veterans organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In a recent full-page newspaper ad, the National Association
of Letter Carriers stated that the Postal Service refuses to offer
letter carriers a satisfactory contract. My question: How many
people still deliver mail on foot, compared to those using
vehicles?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service calculates by routes, not people, because
in a typical work week more than one person likely would be
involved on the same route. Nationwide, the number of ``motor
routes'' is 150,871, said Mark Saunders at USPS headquarters in
Washington. The number of ``walk routes'' is 15,840.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a recipe calling for apple cider vinegar. What's the
difference between that and apple cider?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the United States, the term ``apple cider'' usually refers
to freshly prepared apple juice that is bottled without
pasteurization. (Products labeled ``apple juice'' usually have been
pasteurized during bottling). Vinegar is a fermented product. If
your recipe calls for the vinegar product, don't substitute cider
or juice and expect the same results.
</P>
<P>
   The Foods &AMP; Nutrition Encyclopedia explains how apple cider
vinegar is produced: Apples basically are mechanically crushed and
pressed and adjusted to contain not less than 8 percent, and not
more than 20 percent, fermentable sugar. After fermentation by
yeast, the sugar content preferably should be below 0.3 percent.
Next, this alcohol-containing substrate is subjected to the action
of acetobacter organisms until the alcohol is converted to acetic
acid, following which the vinegar is clarified, possibly
pasteurized and then bottled.

<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently about a lottery drawing of sorts for
two free tickets to the Masters golf tournament each year. You gave
an address, but I lost the clipping. Can you print the information
again?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a bit of a misstatement. There is no lottery drawing
for two free tickets to the Masters. What we have printed in the
past is information about a random drawing for tickets to the
Masters practice rounds. To enter, send a letter with your name,
address, daytime telephone number and Social Security number to:
Masters Tournament, Practice Rounds, P.O. Box 2047, Augusta, GA
30903-2047. To hear recorded information, call 706-667-6700.
</P>
<P>
   Q: With all the news about the computer virus problems, can you
offer any update on David L. Smith, the author of Melissa? I
recently read that damage estimates from Melissa were more than
$400 million.
</P>
<P>
   A: Smith, a 30-year-old network programmer for an AT&AMP;T
subcontractor, was arrested April 1 at his brother's house in New
Jersey. He was released on $100,000 bail. At last report,
arraignment had not been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey authorities charged Smith with five crimes, including
interruption of public communication. They allege that he wrote the
Melissa software bug _ apparently named by him after a topless
dancer in Florida _ with malicious intent, knowing the chaos it
would cause. For a time, the virus clogged e-mail accounts and shut
down computer networks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's attorney, Steve Altman, contends that his client never
intended to do harm. Smith faces as much as 40 years in prison and
a $480,000 fine, according to New Jersey authorities.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Overdone on divas
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A true story: Just a few weeks into my
chosen career as a music critic, I reviewed a performance by
Leontyne Price, the legendary soprano whose best years were well
behind her. The piece was balanced, but it did make the point of
noting Price's high opinion of herself: I stopped counting the
number of bows she milked from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The morning the review ran, I got a call. In a dignified voice,
a woman greeted me with a simple, ``This is Leontyne Price.'' I
sputtered something about her feeling free to complain to my
editor, then proceeded to hang up the phone frozen with fear.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a friend's wicked idea of a joke, but it
taught me an invaluable lesson: Don't mess with a diva.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these days you don't have to look very far to find
this paragon of feminine showmanship. Thanks largely to two VH1
concert specials _ Divas Live and Divas Live '99 _ women singers of
a larger-than-life variety are in the news: Aretha, Celine,
Whitney, Mariah... the list goes on and on. And let's not forget
Cher, the self-proclaimed ``Lazarus of pop music,'' who comes to
the National Car Rental Center this weekend after her surprise
return to the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't stop there. Everywhere you turn, there's another
new diva on the scene _ or an established singer who's suddenly
been anointed with the title. Looking for a country diva? Shania
Twain's got your number. How about a couple of divas-in-training?
Consider Brandy and Monica, who teamed up recently on The Boy Is
Mine, a catfight of a single that played into the pair's rumored
rivalry. And then there's Jewel, the sweet-singing folk diva who's
been on the cover of Time.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a sec: A ``folk diva''? Isn't that a contradiction in
terms? An oxymoron of the most moronic sort?
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: We're sick of divas. Not the real divas, but the
pretenders. And we're not too happy about what this tired trend has
to say about the role of women in the musical world, if not society
in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's silliness,'' says Rolling Stone contributing editor
Anthony DeCurtis of this diva deluge. ``It's just a way of putting
a name on something.''
</P>
<P>
   That something doesn't have to be singing. A story in
Entertainment Weekly last October looked at the phenomenon and
found divas everywhere, from ``daytime divas'' (Kathie Lee Gifford,
Susan Lucci) to ``indie divas'' (Parker Posey, Christina Ricci) to
``divas on ice'' (``Everyone named Oksana'').
</P>
<P>
   Even some feminists have gotten in the act: Holly Morris, a book
publisher-turned-TV producer, runs a Seattle-based company called
Adventure Divas, which is creating a travel series for cable TV on
divas worldwide. She's written about the trend in the upcoming
issue of Ms. Magazine and finds nothing wrong with all the diva
labeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think it means a prima donna. (But) it's a word
that has emerged in popular culture in the last five years to have
a much more positive meaning. To me, it's a lot about potential,''
Morris says. The list of divas she's uncovered in her travels
includes a filmmaker and a Santeria priestess. ``They sing their
own song even if they're not musicians,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Gretchen Barbatsis, a Michigan State University
professor of telecommunications and leading feminist scholar, says
the problem is that women are still being categorized. ``What I
think is significant is that the apparently empowered woman is
labeled in a singular kind of way, which tends to deny her
three-dimensional richness,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   If you look up ``diva'' in the dictionary, the first definition
refers to the word's Italian origin as ``goddess.'' Still, it's the
operatic world that can take true credit for turning diva into a
title. Scholars trace the term's use in music to 1831, the year
Bellini wrote the aria Casta diva for the opera Norma. By the mid
20th-century, a diva meant only one thing: a female singer,
preferably a soprano, whose expansive voice was matched by her
personality. If she threw an occasional hissy fit, it went along
with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than being a great singer, it's being a great
artist,'' says Valerie Stoelzel, Palm Beach Opera's music
administrator and a soprano herself (she insists, however, she's
not a diva).
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Arnold, a South Florida baritone who has worked
alongside his share of divas _ ask him about the Carmen who refused
to enter from stage right _ puts it this way: ``There are
performers and there are divas.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one opera star who fit the diva mold, it was Maria
Callas, the tempestuous soprano whose battles with opera-house
execs garnered as much attention as her voice. Other operatic names
frequently cited include Marilyn Horne, Joan Sutherland and, more
recently, Kathleen Battle, whose temper tantrums caused her to be
permanently banished from the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a long way from these women to the likes of LeAnn Rimes
and Chaka Khan, to name two of the featured artists on VH1's Divas
Live `99. How to explain the leap?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, VH1 president Wayne Isaak, the man behind both Divas
specials, makes no bones about the fact that the shows were
basically a marketing gimmick. The cable network had produced a
series of concerts it called Legends, honoring great artists and
their work for charity, but the idea didn't catch fire. Then, Isaak
noticed the number of female artists in the spotlight _ ``Celine
was as popular as a female singer could be, Aretha was probably in
the best voice she's been in her life, Mariah was continuing on a
hot streak'' _ and a new concept emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let's get the girls together and see if by theming
it, we have a bigger rating,''' he recalls of the first special in
1998, which also featured Gloria Estefan and Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Isaak got far more than just a bigger rating. The show proved to
be the most-watched moment in VH1's history and a recording
released soon after sold three million copies. Thus was born a new
diva consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   As ratings-driven as VH1 was, the show touched a nerve _ perhaps
the same nerve that was behind the success of Sarah McLachlan's
all-female Lilith Fair when it bowed in 1997. Women were enjoying
an unprecedented level of acceptance in the music world. It was
time to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reviving the diva term is a way of allowing these women a kind
of power that had only rarely been accorded them,'' says Rolling
Stone's DeCurtis. As for any negative stereotype associated with
the word _ the female artist as cry-baby or bitch _ DeCurtis says
it has long been erased. For better or worse, it's becomes a point
of pride.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there seems no denying that diva has lost some
of its luster. ``Add `diva' to the list of words _ along with
`classic,' `frankly' and `original' _ that are well on their way to
devaluation,'' wrote Jon Pareles in his New York Times review of
the VH1 Divas Live `99. He was noting the parade of would-be divas
on stage, but producer Isaak says such criticism misses the mark:
Now that diva has gone mainstream, why not have fun with the
concept, he argues?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our society today to bend and stretch labels
because it's entertaining,'' Isaak says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, scholar Barbatsis isn't amused. As far as she's
concerned, all this diva labeling isn't advancing the cause of
women in a male-dominated music world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be seductive to think (the labeling) is providing a
point of resistance,'' she says, but at best it's offering a few
carefully chosen women a greater degree of prominence. She likens
the situation to that of black athletes: All their individual
success notwithstanding, how has that affected the white power base
of owners and executives in professional sports? ``It doesn't look
to me like it's done a whole lot,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   For all this talk of difficult and demanding female singers,
there are just as many ``divos'' out there. Consider the rockers
who trash their hotel rooms _ or smash their instruments on stage.
Little wonder VH1's Isaak is thinking of expanding the concept next
year to include two specials _ one on men, the other women.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not also forget the classical world: When it comes to
choice dressing-room assignments, the Palm Beach Opera's Stoelzel
says she's apt to get as many complaints from tenors as sopranos.
And then there's a certain rotund Italian singer who definitely
qualifies as larger-than-life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't call Pavarotti a divo,'' says local baritone Malcolm
Arnold, ``but in every sense of the word, he is one.''

 &HT;    Goodwill hunting (for bargain jeans)
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Would you climb out of your Calvins to
wear a pair of bluejeans made in Miami by Goodwill workers?
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill's G.I. Pride jeans, selling for the patriotic price of
$17.76, go on sale July 4 at 17 Miami-Dade County Goodwill stores.
</P>
<P>
   If G.I. Pride sells well in Miami-Dade, the jeans will be rolled
out to 1,600 Goodwill stores nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as qualified to make a good pair of jeans as anyone
else,'' says Dennis Pastrana, South Florida Goodwill Industries
president.
</P>
<P>
   At the Goodwill Industries factory, a converted Postal Service
warehouse near Miami's Orange Bowl, workers have been turning out
1,400 pairs of Marine and Army fatigues daily for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 72 steps to make a pair of fatigue pants,'' says
Pastrana, ``and it takes 29 steps to make a pair of jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miami Goodwill can't sell too many jeans, say industry
watchers, or they'll get slaughtered on the toughest turf in the
fashion biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've chosen to dive into the shark tank, and what they have
to hope is they stay small enough that the sharks won't come take a
bite out of them,'' says Erik Gordon, director of the University of
Florida's Retail Center, where trends are tracked and taught.
</P>
<P>
   Being Goodwill, insiders say, doesn't foster industry-wide
goodwill when big bucks are at stake. An estimated 600 million
jeans were sold in the U.S. last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a really, really rotten war,'' says Gordon. ``They shoot at
anybody, missionary priests, vehicles with Red Cross on the side.
When it's brutal, there's nobody who's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodwill plans to ``fly under (industry) radar,'' Pastrana says,
making only 400,000 pairs in a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana says he just wants to sell enough jeans to create 500
jobs for disabled workers. The transitional jobs would allow
workers to learn, establish a work history, and, it's hoped, merge
into the mainstream work force. The Goodwill garment workers can
make $5.50 to $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who came to Miami from Cuba as a 23-year-old
accountant in 1961, is a feisty underdog who isn't wandering into a
war he doesn't understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let anyone in the fashion industry tell you it takes
rocket scientists to make these,'' he says, patting a stack of G.I.
Pride. ``We already make the toughest pants in the world for the
toughest outfit in the world,'' he adds, referring to the Army and
Marine fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   G.I. Pride jeans were designed by Sylvia Dardon, who ran a Liz
Claiborne plant in Guatemala for 25 years. Workers have been
turning out 100 pairs of jeans daily since January to prepare for
the July launch.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana says his jeans are as good as any competitor's, but he
knows there's no way he can compete with huge jeans marketing
budgets. Tommy Hilfiger, Gitano and Levis, for instance, have all
sponsored recent concert tours.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, though, is set to approach marquee Miami natives in
the sports and music businesses for help.
</P>
<P>
   And there's always the marketing wild card, says George
Rosenbaum, CEO of Leo Shapiro &AMP; Associates, a Chicago consumer
research firm. If an unsolicited, hot, hip-hop star just happens to
wear the jeans, G.I. Pride could soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this became a cultish, underground product,'' says
Rosenbaum, ``they could capture 5 percent of the market.''

   Q: A TV announcer discussing the wedding of Prince Edward and
Sophie Rhys-Jones said Britain's new poet laureate had composed a
poem calling for their privacy. Who is the poet, and can you print
the poem?
</P>
<P>
   A: The poet is Andrew Motion, 47. He succeeded Ted Hughes,
Britain's former poet laureate, who died of cancer in October. This
is Motion's first official poem, titled ``Epithalamium St. George's
Chapel, Windsor'':
</P>
<P>
   One day, the tissue-light through stained glass falls/ on vacant
stone, on gaping pews, on air/ made up of nothing more than atom
storms/ which whiten silently, then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The next, all this is charged with brimming life./ A
people-river floods those empty pews,/ and music-torrents break _
but then stop dead/ to let two human voices make their vows:/
</P>
<P>
   to work _ so what is true today remains the truth;/ to hope _
for privacy and what its secrets show;/ to trust _ that all the
world can offer it will give;/ to love _ and what it has to
understand to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand that movie actress Susan Hayward is buried in
Georgia. Do you know where?
</P>
<P>
   A: Her final resting place is Our Lady of Perpetual Help
Catholic Church outside Carrollton. The actress (``I Want to
Live,'' ``With a Song in My Heart'' and dozens of other films) died
March 14, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   A church spokeswoman said many people continue to visit the
actress' burial site. The church is at 210 Old Center Point Road,
about 5 miles off I-20 at exit 4. At Hayward's request, the
tombstone bears the name Mrs. F.E. Chalkley (Her second husband,
after actor Jess Barker, was Carrollton businessman Floyd Eaton
Chalkley). Because of the number of visitors, the church has added
a small marble stone with the name Susan Hayward.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Christian Coalition is in trouble and I'd like to help.
What is the address to send a donation?
</P>
<P>
   A: Christian Coalition, 1801-L Sara Drive, Chesapeake, VA 23320.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Newspapers reported recently on a UCLA award to blacklisted
writers. What was the blacklist all about?
</P>
<P>
   A: It dealt with a move in the spring of 1947 by the House
Committee on Un-American Activities to undertake what its chairman,
Rep. J. Parnell Thomas (R-N.J.), called ``Communism in motion
pictures.'' While the accusation that films of the period contained
Communist propaganda was generally discredited, there was at least
one factual substance to the charge. A number of famous Hollywood
directors, screenwriters and actors either joined the Communist
Party or contributed funds to its cause during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people had dropped their affiliations before the
House committee convened, but in September 1947 some 20 witnesses
named people who, they claimed, were leftists. On the strength of
that cooperative testimony, about 40 filmmakers suspected of
leftist sympathies were subpoenaed to appear before the committee.
The committee said it had evidence that 10 of the filmmakers were
members of the Communist Party. The 10 refused to testify, and were
given prison sentences of six months to a year for contempt of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of the infamous practice of
``blacklisting,'' meaning that many people _ eventually more than
320 _ were fired and no longer permitted to work in the American
movie industry. The practice continued into the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the recent UCLA award to the 10 screenwriters was
sparked by a controversial award presented to director Elia Kazan
at this year's Academy Awards ceremony. Kazan had testified before
the House committee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that President Clinton enjoyed some of
France's ``famed cuisine'' at a dinner in Paris recently with
French President Jacques Chirac. The restaurant wasn't identified.
Was it Maxim's?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The two presidents, and their wives, dined at Chez L'Ami,
a bistro on a narrow street in a working-class neighborhood on the
Right Bank. The next day, Clinton told reporters that they had a
``wonderful dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Elysee Palace described the meal as cured ham and fois gras from
the Landes region in southwest France, followed by roasted milk-fed
lamb with bearnaise potatoes and girolles mushrooms. The wine was a
1990 Saint-Julien. Fruit finished off the meal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The WNBA's All-Star game will be played in New York next
month. Do you have ticket information?
</P>
<P>
   A: Tickets for the inaugural All-Star Game on July 14 are
available at all Ticketmaster outlets, as well as Ticketmaster
Charge-By-Phone (212-307-7171); through the Ticketmaster Web site
(www.ticketmaster.com); at the game site, Madison Square Garden;
and in New York at the NBA Store, Fifth Avenue at 52nd Street.
Tickets are $10, $30, $40 and $75 (plus surcharges if purchased
from Ticketmaster). The game will be televised nationally on ESPN,
starting at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   More ticket information is available from Madison Square Garden
at 212-465-6741.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you update us on the status of DNA testing in the case of
former Green Beret Jeffrey MacDonald? He was convicted of killing
his wife and two children at Fort Bragg, N.C., in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   A: U.S. District Court Judge James Fox in Wilmington, N.C.,
ruled in March that a new kind of DNA test could be performed on
evidence from the murder scene. Andrew Good, one of MacDonald's
attorneys, described the testing as the same type that was used to
try to connect President Thomas Jefferson with Sally Heming, a
slave.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on CBS' ``This Morning'' on March 29, Good said it
would be ``a matter of months'' before his team could identify the
laboratories that would do the testing on hairs found at the site.
</P>
<P>
   The case dates to Feb. 17, 1970, when MacDonald's pregnant wife,
Colette, and their two young children, Kimberly and Kristy, were
murdered in their beds. MacDonald, a physician stationed at Fort
Bragg, claimed intruders beat and stabbed him and then killed his
family. Charges against MacDonald were dropped after a military
hearing, but in 1979 he was tried and convicted in a civilian
court. He was sentenced to three life terms, but released in 1980
after an appeal. Two years later the Supreme Court reinstated his
conviction and sent him back to prison, where he has remained.
MacDonald's case inspired the best-selling book and TV miniseries
``Fatal Vision.''
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald has a Web site _ www.TheMacDonaldDefense.Org/ _ with a
message on the subject of DNA testing posted by him on March 22.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Episodes of the '60s TV show ``The Prisoner'' were shown the
other night on TVLand. What was the actual location of the village?
</P>
<P>
   A: For those who don't know, let's rehash the essentials of the
plot. Intriguing, highly imaginative and at times complex, ``The
Prisoner'' concerned a secret agent, presumably named John Drake
(we say presumably because his name wasn't revealed, but this
series was a continuation from the last episode of another program,
``Secret Agent,'' which featured Patrick McGoohan as Drake).
</P>
<P>
   Assigned to locate a missing scientist, Drake allowed him to
defect to Russia when he discovered the nature of the scientist's
work: the completion of a deadly mind-transference device. Drake
was gassed, and upon waking found himself the prisoner of a
self-contained community known as The Village, a fantasylike area
bounded by mountains and an ocean, a place from which there was no
escape. He discovered that he was no longer a man, but a number:
No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which had 17 episodes, was filmed almost entirely
at Portmeirion, North Wales. ``The Prisoner'' initially was
broadcast by CBS from June 1, 1968, to Sept. 21, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that MGM recently bought back its film library from
Turner Broadcasting. What effect will this have on Turner Classic
Movies, which shows these films?
</P>
<P>
   A: The film library has not been sold back to MGM, said TBS
spokeswoman Kara Franey, so there will be no effect on Turner
Classic Movies. MGM has taken back only the distribution of home
videos, which may account for the confusion, Franey said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Tom Hanks, appearing on the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards
June 16, gave a toll-free number for people to call to contribute
to the World War II Memorial in Washington. I want to make a
donation in honor of my late father, a World War II veteran, but I
didn't get the number. Do you have it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Call 1-800-639-4992. The first voice you'll hear is that of
Hanks, star of the World War II epic ``Saving Private Ryan,'' in a
recorded greeting. Donations to the memorial can be made by calling
that number, or can be mailed to World War II Memorial, P.O. Box
96766, Washington, DC 20090-6766. If you're online, try this
address _ www.wwIImemorial.com _ for more information and to make
donations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Although I'm a staunch Democrat, I had been seriously
considering Sen. John McCain, if he gets the Republican
presidential nomination. However, I heard that he made a derogatory
remark about Chelsea Clinton. Do you have any details, so I can
decide if he is worthy of my consideration?
</P>
<P>
   A: The remark by McCain (R-Ariz.), which was said to be a slur
against the looks of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Chelsea Clinton and
Janet Reno, was made more than a year ago. News of his offending
quip first appeared in The Washington Post's Reliable Sources
political column June 12, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Post, which did not report the content of the remark, quoted
McCain as saying this afterward: ``Yes. I made a very unfortunate
and insensitive remark. It was the wrong thing to do, and I have no
excuse for it.'' His spokeswoman, Nancy Ives, said at the time that
a letter of apology had been delivered to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, then Clinton's press secretary, said Clinton
considered McCain's apology letter to be heartfelt. ``The president
certainly understands how you get caught saying things you
ordinarily wouldn't have said,'' McCurry added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any information about a recall or class-action
suit of some type concerning Louisiana-Pacific siding?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved compensation for the cost to homeowners of
repairing damage to exterior Louisiana-Pacific Inner-Seal siding
installed between the mid-1980s and Jan. 1, 1996. Eligible
claimants must file a claim before Jan. 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   To hear recorded information from the claims administrator for
the settlement program, call 1-800-245-2722. Or write: L-P
Inner-Seal Siding Litigation, P.O. Box 3240, Portland, OR 97208.
Online information _ available at www.lpsidingclaims.com _ includes
complete details about the litigation and settlement forms.

 &HT;    The Pill remains a reliable option
 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS A SIDEBAR TO RUN WITH HYSTERECTOMY-ALTERNATIVE
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of how much new technology has arrived in gynecology,
the first treatment for many causes of uterine bleeding is still
the birth-control pill.
</P>
<P>
   Contraception is only one of several reasons physicians
prescribe the pill, says Dr. Luis Morales of Miami Valley Hospital.
It also regulates the hormonal imbalances that often lead to
excessive menstrual bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think it causes cancer,'' Morales says. ``In
fact, it protects against cancer of the ovary and cancer of the
endometrium (which lines the uterus).''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years of research have proven many fears about the
pill from the 1970s and early '80s to be unfounded, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But smokers over 35 should not take it,'' Morales says. They
run a risk of blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   For healthy women who don't smoke, the risk of blood clots
increases less with the pill than it does during pregnancy. Those
women have no higher incidences of heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has associated the pill with reductions in benign
breast lumps, functional ovarian cysts and pelvic inflammatory
disease, but not sexually transmitted diseases.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ For First Communion, you need
more than the white dress and the well-drilled catechism. You need
family, tradition, cousin Marcia St. Hilaire at the organ and
Father Ted Guminga on the altar. Her parents couldn't keep from
choking up as they watched their shy daughter perform so gracefully
in the spotlight, wearing her dress not like a hand-me-down but
like the most priceless of family heirlooms. Which, of course, it
was _ a legacy of family history and family love, the gift of
mothers who save things. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A friend on my street
just had a baby so I cooked them up a casserole _ shepherd's pie,
my specialty _ and I went down there, bubbling dinner in hand.
``Aren't you sweet!'' she cooed at me, after we got done cooing at
her beautiful boy. And I went home wearing a smile, a big one.
``That was nice,'' I thought. ``I'm a good person.'' Then I met
Sarge. Sarge says tending to the needs of the homeless is his
calling, and when you talk to him _ believer in God or not _ you
have to at least believe in a person's calling. (Minor, Palm Beach

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Larry L. King (the one who wrote
``Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,'' not the little guy on TV)
doesn't fight anymore, except maybe with book publishers and that's
mostly on the phone. But he tells a good story about fighting,
involving a particular fellow Southern author. (Murray, Cox News
Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ In suggesting that public policy must
submit to particularized faith, the gun lobby has placed us on an
amazingly smooth slope, debating all the while how many angels can
dance on the pointy end of a bullet. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ For First Communion, you need
more than the white dress and the well-drilled catechism. You need
family, tradition, cousin Marcia St. Hilaire at the organ and
Father Ted Guminga on the altar. Her parents couldn't keep from
choking up as they watched their shy daughter perform so gracefully
in the spotlight, wearing her dress not like a hand-me-down but
like the most priceless of family heirlooms. Which, of course, it
was _ a legacy of family history and family love, the gift of
mothers who save things. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A friend on my street
just had a baby so I cooked them up a casserole _ shepherd's pie,
my specialty _ and I went down there, bubbling dinner in hand.
``Aren't you sweet!'' she cooed at me, after we got done cooing at
her beautiful boy. And I went home wearing a smile, a big one.
``That was nice,'' I thought. ``I'm a good person.'' Then I met
Sarge. Sarge says tending to the needs of the homeless is his
calling, and when you talk to him _ believer in God or not _ you
have to at least believe in a person's calling. (Minor, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.

   OLD-TRICKS _ He's been a magician nearly all his life. He has
made a living at prestidigitation, a meager living he says. He was
never a star, never played the big Vegas hotels or Catskill
resorts. Weddings, wakes and wingdings might better describe his
venues. Birthday parties. Fund raisers. Jerry Lewis telethons. His
favorite possesion is an old manila folder stuffed with thank-you
notes from hospitals and charities. They are brief notes. But they
say something about him. ``For 40 years, I did parties at big
houses all over. I knew Burt Reynolds before he was on Gunsmoke.
Ricardo Montalban. Governor Claude Kirk was my friend, used to eat
breakfast with him.'' But those old friends stopped calling and the
magic jobs went begging after Peter Gross was convicted of selling
knock-off watches and suitcases out of his house. That was 1995.
And again in 1997. He's 82 and on probation for five years. The
judge wanted to send him to jail. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FOOD-TESTKITCHEN _ Before Betty Crocker or Pillsbury product or

in a home kitchen -- and then make sure their recipes will stand

Entertains series. This one reflects entertaining on a tight budget
and features Angelica and Omar , who are typical of the 12,000 grad
students at UT. They have no money for anything, let alone parties.
But that does not stop them from having their friends over for
chicken mole, arepas or other ethnic dishes from their native
countries of Mexico and Venezuela. They are not the only ones who
have learned to party frugally. Jay Nazz, a drummer with the
Reckless Kelly band, calls on his Italian heritage and stuffs pasta
shells to entertain his friends and fellow band members. Recipes.
Sidebars: How 3 entertaining pros would spend $25 to jumpstart a

   DIVA-OVERKILL _ Everywhere you turn, there's another new diva on
the scene _ or an established singer who's suddenly been anointed
with the title. Looking for a country diva? Shania Twain's got your
number. How about a couple of divas-in-training? Consider Brandy
and Monica, who teamed up recently on The Boy Is Mine, a catfight
of a single that played into the pair's rumored rivalry. And then
there's Jewel, the sweet-singing folk diva who's been on the cover
of Time. Wait a sec: A ``folk diva''? Isn't that a contradiction in
terms? An oxymoron of the most moronic sort? Let's face it: We're
sick of divas. (Passy, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Austin has record and Olympic repeat in mind
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ When he broke the American outdoor record in
the high jump, Charles Austin readily acknowledges, ``I didn't know
what I was doing. I was just goofing around.''
</P>
<P>
   The surprise, though, isn't necessarily that Austin did what no
American has ever done by clearing a bar 7 feet, 10 1/2 inches off
the ground at an outdoor meet. Perhaps the surprise is that he
hasn't done it since that magical meet in Zurich, Switzerland, on
Aug. 7, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true since the former Southwest Texas State
Bobcat, now 31, definitely knows what he is doing and assuredly
isn't goofing off.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's quest for the two major goals he has remaining in an
illustrious but low-profile career takes another step this week
when he tries for his fourth straight victory at the USA Track and
Field Outdoor national championships in Eugene, Ore. Austin is one
of numerous Central Texas athletes who will participate in the
meet, which also serves as the trials to make the team for the
World Championships in Seville, Spain, in August.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, coached by former University of Texas assistant Sue
Humphrey, is in a four-way tie for second in the world early in
this outdoor season with a leap of 7-7 1/4 at a meet in the Bahamas
in late May. Russian Sergey Klyugin and University of Texas star
Mark Boswell, a Canadian, are tied for the world lead at 7-7 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's ultimate goals are to replace longtime rival/friend
Javier Sotomayor of Cuba as the world record holder, which would
mean joining Sotomayor as the only men to clear the 8-foot barrier
since ``Soto'' set the record of 8-0 1/2 in 1993. Austin also wants
to become the first high jumper in history to win in two Olympics.
He captured the 1996 gold medal in Atlanta with a dramatic 7-10
clearance on his last attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight feet is very doable,'' he said earlier this week before
a workout at SWT's Bobcat Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever cleared it in practice?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope. Never tried,'' he said. ``It would really tick me off if
I did it in practice, wasting a jump like that with no one around
to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Austin has placed the bar at 8 feet and made
several run-throughs just to get the feel for what he hopes someday
will be a world record-breaking clearance. And the jumper who
declares ``a high bar doesn't scare me'' says there's nothing about
the 8-foot barrier he finds intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look much different than 7-9,'' he said. ``The mind
is crazy. I can easily jump 7-9 and clear it by 4 inches. But put
the bar up to 8 (feet) and I feel I have to try harder _ run
faster, jump stronger. If I just stick to my basic techniques, I'll
get it. It's all a mental thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been strictly mental with Austin, though, which
is another reason his assault on 8 feet has been delayed. Even when
he cleared 7-10 1/2 in Zurich, he was jumping on a bad left
(takeoff) leg. He had damaged his patellar tendon at an indoor meet
his senior season at SWT in 1990 when he set a personal best of 7-6
1/2. But he didn't have surgery until 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``July 7, to be exact,'' he said. ``I'll never forget that
date.''
</P>
<P>
   It took until nearly the end of the 1995 season for Austin to
begin feeling comfortable and confident again. He regained his old
touch and big-meet flair at the Atlanta Olympics when, after
missing twice at 7-9 1/4, he had the bar moved to 7-10 and cleared
it on the one and only jump he had left to edge Poland's Artur
Partyka for the gold.
</P>
<P>
   While Austin's immediate goal is winning this week in Eugene _
``At the major meets, I don't want anything less than first place''
_ he would love a crack at 8 feet if the opportunity presents
itself. He estimates that he has taken ``10 to 12'' stabs at the
height after winning competitions rather than simply trying to
improve his own American record.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to 7-8 or 7-9, I just go for the world record,'' he
said. ``Why move the bar to 7-10 3/4? That's just an American
record and I already have that. I want to go for it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I set the record in '91, I knew if I could get my knee in
shape that there would be no limitations. I knew I could do
something amazing. I'm still waiting to do it.''

 &HT;    The Pill remains a reliable option
 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS A SIDEBAR TO RUN WITH HYSTERECTOMY-ALTERNATIVE
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of how much new technology has arrived in gynecology,
the first treatment for many causes of uterine bleeding is still
the birth-control pill.
</P>
<P>
   Contraception is only one of several reasons physicians
prescribe the pill, says Dr. Luis Morales of Miami Valley Hospital.
It also regulates the hormonal imbalances that often lead to
excessive menstrual bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think it causes cancer,'' Morales says. ``In
fact, it protects against cancer of the ovary and cancer of the
endometrium (which lines the uterus).''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years of research have proven many fears about the
pill from the 1970s and early '80s to be unfounded, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But smokers over 35 should not take it,'' Morales says. They
run a risk of blood clotting.
</P>
<P>
   For healthy women who don't smoke, the risk of blood clots
increases less with the pill than it does during pregnancy. Those
women have no higher incidences of heart attack or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has associated the pill with reductions in benign
breast lumps, functional ovarian cysts and pelvic inflammatory
disease, but not sexually transmitted diseases.

<P>
   Jesse Jackson's driver pulls up in front of a U.S. Airways sign
at Washington National Airport when Amy Dupree of Addison, Texas,
recognizes him. Jackson, sitting in the front seat, continues a
conversation on his cellular telephone as Dupree and her husband,
Kyle, wait patiently to take a photograph with him.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson emerges from the sedan several moments later, Amy
Dupree says, ``We're very proud of what you did.'' She tells
Jackson of her work getting women out of the ``adult
entertainment'' business _ she is a former topless dancer _ and how
God has changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson says, ``God bless you,'' poses for a photo, and with
Yirgalem ``Yuri'' Tadesse, national director of international
affairs for Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, and this journalist
in tow, he heads for U.S. Airways Flight 6480, the 3 p.m. shuttle
bound for New York's La Guardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   After appearing on ``The Late Show with David Letterman'' the
previous night, Jackson is returning for a second-straight
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Louis Jackson, fresh from securing the release of three
U.S. soldiers imprisoned for little more than a month in
Yugoslavia, is being heralded as an American hero. This was not the
first time Jackson had gone on a successful mercy mission.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, he obtained the freedom of Navy flier Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Lebanon. Later in the
year, he got Fidel Castro to release 22 Americans (most of them
held on drug charges) and 26 Cubans from prisons. Jackson also
persuaded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign
nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a
priest of the Orthodox Church in America; a Greek bishop; a Serbian
Orthodox bishop; a Baptist minister; an Islamic leader; and a
Methodist bishop. Also with them was Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich
(D-Ill.), the only Serbian-American member of Congress, and other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation received a formal invitation to visit
their religious counterparts in Yugoslavia. However, just before
departing, they were urged by National Security Council adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to call off the trip, reminding them that
their safety could not be assured and that the bombing would not
halt just because they were in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that if we were to get killed going in a
bombing zone, it would represent the ultimate PR coup for
Milosevic,'' Jackson says. ``That was their fear. But they could
have ended that fear just by stopping the bombing while we were
there.'' But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the delegation arrived at the Belgrade Hyatt hotel,
the NATO bombing was among the heaviest of the war up to that time,
with some bombs landing just blocks away. ``They never stopped
bombing,'' Jackson says, clearly angry. ``They never stopped
bombing next to us. I think it aroused in us the fires of
determination. I was mentally prepared, spiritually fortified,
psyched, pumped, ready. War was so wrong, and our cause was so
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials promised Jackson protection once he was in
the country. They took him and Western reporters on a tour of a
residential area that they said had been hit by NATO's bombs.
During his trip, Jackson told the Yugoslavs that until there was a
peace agreement, the bombs would continue falling. He also repeated
NATO's requirements before there could be a cessation of bombing.
When it was time to meet the young men, only Jackson and
Blagojevich were allowed to visit, even then under the watchful
eyes of a military judge.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were brought in separately and left separately.
Stone, who had bruises healing on the left side of his forehead,
spoke with the visitors first and for the longest amount of time.
The U.S. delegation had brought the soldiers Bibles, small
religious icons, candy, a tape recorder and separate tape-recorded
messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge denied Jackson's request to give the gifts
directly to the captive men, saying they had to be inspected. Each
soldier reported that he had been treated well and was feeling
good, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, air-raid sirens sounded and the military judge
called for an end to the visit. But Jackson pressed on, asking that
the three soldiers be brought in together. His request was granted
and the men were reunited for the first time since they were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Together, they prayed. ``Help is on the way and hope is in the
air,'' Jackson said. ``Soon, very soon, you will know peace and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the delegates were allowed to meet with President
Slobodan Milosevic for three hours. In that meeting, they urged
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Bishop Dimitrios of Xanthos of the
Greek Orthodox Church says, ``(Jackson) was persuasive and just
would not let up. He kept saying, 'It's in your power. You can do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Milosevic portrayed NATO as the
aggressor in the conflict, just as the White House had feared. In
Milosevic's view, he was the victim. But when he asked who was
responsible for the bombings, Dr. Nazir Uddin Khaja, a California
physician and president of the American Muslim Council, replied,
``You are responsible.'' According to Khaja, Milosevic seemed
surprised. ``The whole group said that in one way or another. Maybe
I was more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met privately with Milosevic for about 20 minutes.
Milosevic promised to think about the request for freedom. Jackson
had been back at the hotel for 15 minutes when the delegation
received a call to meet with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic at
his private residence. When they arrived, he told them, ``I am
pleased to tell you that President Milosevic has issued a decree
today releasing the three soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a formal signing ceremony, which was broadcast
on U.S. television. With cameras rolling, Jackson had the soldiers
sounding more like civil rights workers than military men. They
chanted, ``'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're
free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation left with the freed prisoners in a
Yugoslav bus. Under police escort, they were driven to the Croatian
border. From there, the soldiers were transferred to a Croatian
tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and were driven to the Pleso
airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were flown to Ramstein Air Base in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the soldiers were whisked away to the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center for a couple of days of testing before
their families arrived. So the Jackson group proceeded to
Washington, without the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Jackson had obtained the release of Goodman,
the pilot was not delayed by military authorities in Europe;
instead, the group was flown home aboard Air Force One and treated
to a ceremony in the Rose Garden. That was under Ronald Reagan, a
Republican president viewed as hostile to civil rights. Under
Clinton, who prides himself as a friend of African-Americans,
Jackson did not receive the red-carpet treatment, causing Jackson
to view the administration as ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very pleased'' that the soldiers were
coming home, Clinton said that nearly 1.5 million Kosovars could
not enjoy similar freedom. The president said conditions for ending
the bombing were simple: ``The Kosovars must be able to go home
with security and self-government, Serbian security forces must
leave Kosovo. An international security force must deploy with the
power not just to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo,
Albanians and Serbs alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was carrying a private letter to Clinton from
Milosevic, strongly urged the president to release two Serb
soldiers held by U.S. military as a reciprocal peace gesture.
Several weeks later, the administration did just that, denying the
release represented a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by David Letterman how he could be civil to such an
international outlaw, Jackson's answer was simple: ``He had the
power to keep our guys or let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from Yugoslavia, ``Jetstream Jesse,''
as he is sometimes called, was off to Africa, successfully
brokering a cease-fire in the Sierra Leone civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no budgetary commitment to rebuilding this
war-torn nation as we heard in Europe,'' Jackson said, after taking
credit for securing the release of 2,000 prisoners of war, most of
them children and soldiers from bordering countries. ``When the
Yugoslavia war is over, there will be billions spent on rebuilding
the cities. The same kind of security and stability and democracy
in Kosovo and Yugoslavia must apply to Sierra Leone and to Africa
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's exploits aren't likely to stop with Yugoslavia and
Sierra Leone. After all, this is the same person who crashed the
1985 Geneva Summit that was supposed to feature only Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Jackson confronted
Gorbachev in a crowded lobby, asking about the treatment of Soviet
Jews. Where he shows up next is anybody's guess.

   In 1984, he obtained the freedom of Navy flier Lt. Robert O.
Goodman Jr., who had been shot down over Lebanon. Later in the
year, he got Fidel Castro to release 22 Americans (most of them
held on drug charges) and 26 Cubans from prisons. Jackson also
persuaded Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to release 500 foreign
nationals being held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The trip to Yugoslavia, however, provided Jackson with the
brightest spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for bringing our boys back home,'' says a middle-age
man with a middle-age middle. ``You're a real American hero.'' At
Legal Sea Foods, a restaurant in the airport, a group of women
pound on a window, wave and smile broadly as Jackson waves back. An
airline employee wants an autograph for his mother _ at least
that's what he says _ and two giddy teen-agers want to pose with
the world's best-known human rights leader.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane, it's more of the same. ``America thanks you ...
Good going, Jesse ... I just want to shake your hand.'' As he
settles in an aisle seat 20 rows back for an overdue interview, an
exhausted Jackson speaks for a few minutes and then suspends the
conversation to take a nap.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane lands in New York, he is refreshed and picks up
the conversation exactly where he left off. ``I always thought that
if we got close enough to touch them, we would leave with them,''
he recalls, referring to the soldiers. ``But it was strictly a
faith mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what Jackson says, these are not strictly faith
missions, though faith plays an intricate role. Nor are they merely
publicity stunts in which Jackson is used by unpopular foreign
leaders to manipulate U.S. public opinion. And despite the howls
from the State Department, he goes on these missions with their
tacit approval. After all, they made no effort to lift his
passport. How does he do it?
</P>
<P>
   First, Jackson is brash enough to think that he and only he can
pull off these feats. And so far, he has been right. Generally, he
has obtained the release of prisoners after the State Department
has failed, after back-channel negotiations through third parties
have failed and, in some cases, after U.S. or international
military intervention has failed, as was the case in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In each case Jackson knew when to make his move. Whether it's
securing the release of Goodman or the three Army soldiers _ Staff
Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, 24, of Los Angeles; Staff Sgt. Christopher
J. Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich.; and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales,
22, of Huntsville, Texas _ Jackson picks the right moment.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. M. William Howard Jr., president of the New York
Theological Seminary and a former president of the National Council
of Churches, remembers when Jackson decided to seek Goodman's
release. A group of ministers were huddling with tax attorneys in
Memphis to see how they could assist Jackson's 1984 presidential
bid without jeopardizing their federal tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse was bored out of his mind,'' Howard recalls. ``We broke
for lunch and went up to his suite. Wherever he is, he sends out
for this greasy fried chicken. He had sent somebody out to a
Popeye's, I believe it was. They brought in these buckets of
chicken. We were sitting around watching TV at lunchtime. I kid you
not, there was a news flash about how Donald H. Rumsfeld (NATO
ambassador under President Richard M. Nixon) had gone to Syria and
they were talking about the war in Lebanon and tensions with
Israel. They said nothing about Goodman.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point, Howard says, that Jackson sat up and
resolved to get a delegation of religious leaders together to go
and get Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   On his recent trip to Yugoslavia, Jackson followed that same
pattern of assembling a list of high-level religious leaders to
accompany him, including Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, general
secretary of the National Council of Churches; an American rabbi; a
priest of the Orthodox Church in America; a Greek bishop; a Serbian
Orthodox bishop; a Baptist minister; an Islamic leader; and a
Methodist bishop. Also with them was Rep. Rod R. Blagojevich
(D-Ill.), the only Serbian-American member of Congress, and other
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation received a formal invitation to visit
their religious counterparts in Yugoslavia. However, just before
departing, they were urged by National Security Council adviser
Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger to call off the trip, reminding them that
their safety could not be assured and that the bombing would not
halt just because they were in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it clear that if we were to get killed going in a
bombing zone, it would represent the ultimate PR coup for
Milosevic,'' Jackson says. ``That was their fear. But they could
have ended that fear just by stopping the bombing while we were
there.'' But they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the delegation arrived at the Belgrade Hyatt hotel,
the NATO bombing was among the heaviest of the war up to that time,
with some bombs landing just blocks away. ``They never stopped
bombing,'' Jackson says, clearly angry. ``They never stopped
bombing next to us. I think it aroused in us the fires of
determination. I was mentally prepared, spiritually fortified,
psyched, pumped, ready. War was so wrong, and our cause was so
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian officials promised Jackson protection once he was in
the country. They took him and Western reporters on a tour of a
residential area that they said had been hit by NATO's bombs.
During his trip, Jackson told the Yugoslavs that until there was a
peace agreement, the bombs would continue falling. He also repeated
NATO's requirements before there could be a cessation of bombing.
When it was time to meet the young men, only Jackson and
Blagojevich were allowed to visit, even then under the watchful
eyes of a military judge.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were brought in separately and left separately.
Stone, who had bruises healing on the left side of his forehead,
spoke with the visitors first and for the longest amount of time.
The U.S. delegation had brought the soldiers Bibles, small
religious icons, candy, a tape recorder and separate tape-recorded
messages from their families.
</P>
<P>
   The military judge denied Jackson's request to give the gifts
directly to the captive men, saying they had to be inspected. Each
soldier reported that he had been treated well and was feeling
good, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, air-raid sirens sounded and the military judge
called for an end to the visit. But Jackson pressed on, asking that
the three soldiers be brought in together. His request was granted
and the men were reunited for the first time since they were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Together, they prayed. ``Help is on the way and hope is in the
air,'' Jackson said. ``Soon, very soon, you will know peace and
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the delegates were allowed to meet with President
Slobodan Milosevic for three hours. In that meeting, they urged
Milosevic to free the soldiers. Bishop Dimitrios of Xanthos of the
Greek Orthodox Church says, ``(Jackson) was persuasive and just
would not let up. He kept saying, 'It's in your power. You can do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the meeting, Milosevic portrayed NATO as the
aggressor in the conflict, just as the White House had feared. In
Milosevic's view, he was the victim. But when he asked who was
responsible for the bombings, Dr. Nazir Uddin Khaja, a California
physician and president of the American Muslim Council, replied,
``You are responsible.'' According to Khaja, Milosevic seemed
surprised. ``The whole group said that in one way or another. Maybe
I was more direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson met privately with Milosevic for about 20 minutes.
Milosevic promised to think about the request for freedom. Jackson
had been back at the hotel for 15 minutes when the delegation
received a call to meet with Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic at
his private residence. When they arrived, he told them, ``I am
pleased to tell you that President Milosevic has issued a decree
today releasing the three soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a formal signing ceremony, which was broadcast
on U.S. television. With cameras rolling, Jackson had the soldiers
sounding more like civil rights workers than military men. They
chanted, ``'Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we're
free at last!''
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson delegation left with the freed prisoners in a
Yugoslav bus. Under police escort, they were driven to the Croatian
border. From there, the soldiers were transferred to a Croatian
tourist bus rented by the U.S. Embassy and were driven to the Pleso
airstrip in Zagreb. Then they were flown to Ramstein Air Base in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, the soldiers were whisked away to the Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center for a couple of days of testing before
their families arrived. So the Jackson group proceeded to
Washington, without the fruits of their labor.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, when Jackson had obtained the release of Goodman,
the pilot was not delayed by military authorities in Europe;
instead, the group was flown home aboard Air Force One and treated
to a ceremony in the Rose Garden. That was under Ronald Reagan, a
Republican president viewed as hostile to civil rights. Under
Clinton, who prides himself as a friend of African-Americans,
Jackson did not receive the red-carpet treatment, causing Jackson
to view the administration as ingrates.
</P>
<P>
   While saying he was ``very pleased'' that the soldiers were
coming home, Clinton said that nearly 1.5 million Kosovars could
not enjoy similar freedom. The president said conditions for ending
the bombing were simple: ``The Kosovars must be able to go home
with security and self-government, Serbian security forces must
leave Kosovo. An international security force must deploy with the
power not just to monitor but to protect all the people of Kosovo,
Albanians and Serbs alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was carrying a private letter to Clinton from
Milosevic, strongly urged the president to release two Serb
soldiers held by U.S. military as a reciprocal peace gesture.
Several weeks later, the administration did just that, denying the
release represented a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by David Letterman how he could be civil to such an
international outlaw, Jackson's answer was simple: ``He had the
power to keep our guys or let them go.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after he returned from Yugoslavia, ``Jetstream Jesse,''
as he is sometimes called, was off to Africa, successfully
brokering a cease-fire in the Sierra Leone civil war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no budgetary commitment to rebuilding this
war-torn nation as we heard in Europe,'' Jackson said, after taking
credit for securing the release of 2,000 prisoners of war, most of
them children and soldiers from bordering countries. ``When the
Yugoslavia war is over, there will be billions spent on rebuilding
the cities. The same kind of security and stability and democracy
in Kosovo and Yugoslavia must apply to Sierra Leone and to Africa
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's exploits aren't likely to stop with Yugoslavia and
Sierra Leone. After all, this is the same person who crashed the
1985 Geneva Summit that was supposed to feature only Ronald Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Jackson confronted
Gorbachev in a crowded lobby, asking about the treatment of Soviet
Jews. Where he shows up next is anybody's guess.

<P>
   During the 27 years that Nelson Mandela was serving time in
apartheid jails, his successor, Thabo Mbeki, was also serving time.
Not in apartheid jails, but, as he once wrote to a friend, ``like a
cosmic wanderer, driven by the winds to land where they wil.''
Mbeki was living in forced exile. His ``struggle politics'' made it
impossible to return to the land where he was born on June 18,
1942. Like Mandela, the decision to become a freedom fighter would
be as much destiny as it was choice.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's parents were part of the social, intellectual and
political elite of the Transkei, the southeastern region of the
country that gave birth to many major activists, including Mandela
and the late African National Congress president, Oliver Tambo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962 Mbeki's father, Govan, went underground, and to prison,
with Mandela; Thabo, then a student activist, was sent out of the
country. He spent six months in a Rhodesian jail but eventually
made it to England, where he earned a master's degree in economics
from Sussex University and later married another South African
exile, Zanele Dlamini, a social worker and women's rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   While in exile, Mbeki helped build the ANC's youth sections and
received military training as part of the cadre of guerillas known
as ``Umkonto we Sizwe.'' Starting in the late '60s, Mbeki held ANC
postings in England, Botswana, Swaziland and Nigeria, with
intermittent spells in Lusaka, home of the ANC in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Mandela was released in 1990, Mbeki was finally free
to come home, playing a key role in the transition to democratic
rule. He cast his first vote as a South African citizen on April
27, 1994, after which Mandela, the new president, chose him as
deputy president. Highly and warmly regarded by Mandela, Mbeki was
for quite some time at the controls of the government's daily
operations, as well as its long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, pipe-smoking, private man given to quoting
William Butler Yeats, the Bible and of late, Zulu and Xhosa
proverbs, Mbeki seems an enigma to some. That is bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   When asked one too many times how he felt about stepping into
Mandela's shoes, Mbeki once responded with rarely seen but
characteristic playful humor: ``I don't want to step into Mandela's
shoes because he wears ugly shoes.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: During those 27 years in exile, did you
ever dream that you would be president of South Africa?
</P>
<P>
   THABO MBEKI: No, it was never even a thought. You see, I think
it must have been impossible for all of us to conceptualize what
freedom would bring. So we sort of thought, ``Well, freedom will
come and then we will get jobs somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once said to me that you were trying to run a country
that you didn't know. What were some of the things you found out
that just blew your mind?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the personnel budget is extremely bloated and ... I
think the other problem here, which I don't think we quite
understood, was the level of corruption in society. I don't merely
mean a civil servant taking some money or being bribed; I mean
generally the collapse of social morality in society _ very
pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   We knew there were some police officers who you certainly didn't
want, and indeed they retired and were encouraged to retire, given
severance packages. But you discover in time that the root is much
deeper, its origins being in an illegitimate system, an
illegitimate government, and hence everybody ended up making their
own rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you understand that, can you ``move forward
faster,'' as your campaign slogan promised?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think so. We are better educated about what South Africa
is; that is half the answer, to know the reality. I think that what
we should be talking about is an ongoing revolution. Many people
naturally look at what happened in 1994 as an election took place:
One party was defeated and another party won, what normally happens
in democratic systems. But I am saying it was not just a mere
change of system. What we have been about in the past five years is
to change the system. We have a continuing revolution in the
country, but the fact of our experience in the last five years
gives us the possibility to move forward faster. We can and must
move forward faster in every respect. And this thing without
precedent that we've established in the last five years, the
creation of something which is totally new in South Africa _ it
throws out its own lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the problems are not insoluble.
</P>
<P>
   A: They are not insoluble. You need to discover what the
problems are, as truthfully, correctly and factually as possible,
and indeed that is half of the battle. It is true that the economy
is not growing at a rate which is absorbing unemployment to the
extent that we need. But a whole variety of things will be done.
... Housing construction will necessarily employ a lot of people.
Quite clearly, the rate of construction has to pick up in the next
five years. And the infrastructure problem _ roads in the rural
areas and so forth _ that too will absorb a lot of (unemployed)
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's talk about crime. International investors have seen the
horrendous reports about crime. They don't say they are not coming,
but take ``wait and see'' attitudes because they don't know what
you're going to do. What do you say to them about the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you see, it depends whom you are talking to. General
Electric has decided that it is going to make major investments in
South Africa. I said to them, ``But what I am told is that
investors are being driven away from South Africa by crime.'' And
they say to me: ``Deputy President (because I was deputy president
then), we also work in Poland. We as a corporation are active in
Poland on a smaller scale than in South Africa and we've had 300 of
our cars hijacked. We have not had a single car hijacked in South
Africa. ... There is crime all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about those who aren't here, who read the headlines
and see stories of crime in the newspaper? Do you say, ``Come,
there is no crime''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, we don't. They know there is crime. You need to
explain a lot of it. This understanding about the nature of crime
in South Africa comes from the experience of white South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But black South Africans too. I mean, people in the
townships. My caregiver for my mother, if I asked her to work an
extra half-hour, it would be pitch black by the time she got to
Alexandra township, and she is scared to go there after dark.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, sure. But the point about all of this is that crime has
been a real problem in South Africa for a long time. A person from
Alexandra township will tell you that the crime problem in
Alexandra township is not new. What has happened is that crime has
begun to affect white areas in ways that it did not affect white
areas before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, but then the bottom line is, there is crime. What do you
say to international investors who are waiting to see what is going
to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: I say to international investors, I don't believe there are
levels of crime here which would make you take a decision not to
come, as though there is not crime elsewhere in the world. You see,
President (Fernando Henrique) Cardoso of Brazil tells me that
people in Sao Paulo take their children to and from school by
helicopter. Now are investors saying, ``We are not going to put
money in Brazil because of the level of crime?'' Of course not.
There is a presentation of the level of crime as though South
Africa is unique in the world, which it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It isn't unique in the world, but crime is here. You need
international investment for jobs and so forth. So what is the
bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have to fight crime as all countries must fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've talked about two separate societies in South Africa,
one white and prospering, one black and declining. Do you see that
changing significantly in the next five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: It takes time; I mean it will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure we do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is no ticking time bomb out there among these young
people who have no jobs, who, as far as they are concerned, have no
hope?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, I don't think so. I think that the critical matter is
first of all to tell people the truth, that these things are going
to take time, and secondly, to do something, as has been done, that
is being done and will be done.
</P>
<P>
   If indeed there was nothing happening, then indeed we would get
an explosion. (A recent newspaper survey showed that) despair and
loss of hope is among your richer people, the white community,
followed by the Indians, who despair about the future because they
are fearful of losing what they have. Whereas the poor take
precisely the opposite position. They are very hopeful about the
future because they can see the changes that have been made (and
believe), ``Even if they have not reached me today, they will reach
me tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you resolve those sorts of conflicting perceptions?
And what are you going to do about white people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many of the whites are victims of their own propaganda. The
fear of the future is a fear which they impose on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you reassure them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's important to communicate the message to them
continuously that the fears they entertain are unfounded, but I
think that also (we must examine) the practical, the actual things
that happen. They feared, after the elections in 1994, that
terrible things were going to happen to them, that they would be
slaughtered and this and that, and nothing like that happened. And
next they feared that they would lose their jobs because of
affirmative action and end up as the unemployed, and the black
people as the employed. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently told a crowd of black South Africans that they
needed to get angry. Can you explain that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You see, part of the problem is that we are too comfortable
with an ugly past. The consequence is that the impulse to change
the ugly reality that comes from that ugly past gets dulled. So I
say, you see, we have got to be angry about the fact of slavery. It
is not just a matter of saying, ``Oh, it happened.'' We have to be
angry about the history of colonialism. We have to be angry about
this history of neocolonialism, when African leaders robbed the
masses of our people and produced conflicts on the continent. We
have got to be angry about apartheid. Then we put ourselves in a
position to say, ``Let's do something about it to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   If I said to you what is happening in South Africa _ even the
memory of what apartheid meant is receding. There are people here
who, when you talk to them about the pass laws (which required
blacks to carry identification books), they say, ``What? What is
that?'' If you lose that anger and you lose that anger because you
are sitting in a comfortable position, you lose the drive to change
the things which have to be changed. And then perhaps there is too
much such forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify that? Are you quarreling with the notion of
reconciliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. You know we must forgive the people who committed the
crime of apartheid, but I think a mistake is made when people then
think that also means forgiving apartheid. Nobody in the world asks
the jury for forgiveness for slavery. Why must we forgive slavery
and apartheid? We have done the forgiving thing. No, I think there
is too much forgiveness here. We never agreed to forgive the system
of apartheid.

postings in England, Botswana, Swaziland and Nigeria, with
intermittent spells in Lusaka, home of the ANC in exile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Mandela was released in 1990, Mbeki was finally free
to come home, playing a key role in the transition to democratic
rule. He cast his first vote as a South African citizen on April
27, 1994, after which Mandela, the new president, chose him as
deputy president. Highly and warmly regarded by Mandela, Mbeki was
for quite some time at the controls of the government's daily
operations, as well as its long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken, pipe-smoking, private man given to quoting
William Butler Yeats, the Bible and of late, Zulu and Xhosa
proverbs, Mbeki seems an enigma to some. That is bound to change.
</P>
<P>
   When asked one too many times how he felt about stepping into
Mandela's shoes, Mbeki once responded with rarely seen but
characteristic playful humor: ``I don't want to step into Mandela's
shoes because he wears ugly shoes.''
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: During those 27 years in exile, did you
ever dream that you would be president of South Africa?
</P>
<P>
   THABO MBEKI: No, it was never even a thought. You see, I think
it must have been impossible for all of us to conceptualize what
freedom would bring. So we sort of thought, ``Well, freedom will
come and then we will get jobs somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You once said to me that you were trying to run a country
that you didn't know. What were some of the things you found out
that just blew your mind?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, the personnel budget is extremely bloated and ... I
think the other problem here, which I don't think we quite
understood, was the level of corruption in society. I don't merely
mean a civil servant taking some money or being bribed; I mean
generally the collapse of social morality in society _ very
pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   We knew there were some police officers who you certainly didn't
want, and indeed they retired and were encouraged to retire, given
severance packages. But you discover in time that the root is much
deeper, its origins being in an illegitimate system, an
illegitimate government, and hence everybody ended up making their
own rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that you understand that, can you ``move forward
faster,'' as your campaign slogan promised?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think so. We are better educated about what South Africa
is; that is half the answer, to know the reality. I think that what
we should be talking about is an ongoing revolution. Many people
naturally look at what happened in 1994 as an election took place:
One party was defeated and another party won, what normally happens
in democratic systems. But I am saying it was not just a mere
change of system. What we have been about in the past five years is
to change the system. We have a continuing revolution in the
country, but the fact of our experience in the last five years
gives us the possibility to move forward faster. We can and must
move forward faster in every respect. And this thing without
precedent that we've established in the last five years, the
creation of something which is totally new in South Africa _ it
throws out its own lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So the problems are not insoluble.
</P>
<P>
   A: They are not insoluble. You need to discover what the
problems are, as truthfully, correctly and factually as possible,
and indeed that is half of the battle. It is true that the economy
is not growing at a rate which is absorbing unemployment to the
extent that we need. But a whole variety of things will be done.
... Housing construction will necessarily employ a lot of people.
Quite clearly, the rate of construction has to pick up in the next
five years. And the infrastructure problem _ roads in the rural
areas and so forth _ that too will absorb a lot of (unemployed)
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Let's talk about crime. International investors have seen the
horrendous reports about crime. They don't say they are not coming,
but take ``wait and see'' attitudes because they don't know what
you're going to do. What do you say to them about the future?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, you see, it depends whom you are talking to. General
Electric has decided that it is going to make major investments in
South Africa. I said to them, ``But what I am told is that
investors are being driven away from South Africa by crime.'' And
they say to me: ``Deputy President (because I was deputy president
then), we also work in Poland. We as a corporation are active in
Poland on a smaller scale than in South Africa and we've had 300 of
our cars hijacked. We have not had a single car hijacked in South
Africa. ... There is crime all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about those who aren't here, who read the headlines
and see stories of crime in the newspaper? Do you say, ``Come,
there is no crime''?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, we don't. They know there is crime. You need to
explain a lot of it. This understanding about the nature of crime
in South Africa comes from the experience of white South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But black South Africans too. I mean, people in the
townships. My caregiver for my mother, if I asked her to work an
extra half-hour, it would be pitch black by the time she got to
Alexandra township, and she is scared to go there after dark.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, sure. But the point about all of this is that crime has
been a real problem in South Africa for a long time. A person from
Alexandra township will tell you that the crime problem in
Alexandra township is not new. What has happened is that crime has
begun to affect white areas in ways that it did not affect white
areas before.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK, but then the bottom line is, there is crime. What do you
say to international investors who are waiting to see what is going
to happen?
</P>
<P>
   A: I say to international investors, I don't believe there are
levels of crime here which would make you take a decision not to
come, as though there is not crime elsewhere in the world. You see,
President (Fernando Henrique) Cardoso of Brazil tells me that
people in Sao Paulo take their children to and from school by
helicopter. Now are investors saying, ``We are not going to put
money in Brazil because of the level of crime?'' Of course not.
There is a presentation of the level of crime as though South
Africa is unique in the world, which it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It isn't unique in the world, but crime is here. You need
international investment for jobs and so forth. So what is the
bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   A: We have to fight crime as all countries must fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've talked about two separate societies in South Africa,
one white and prospering, one black and declining. Do you see that
changing significantly in the next five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: It takes time; I mean it will take time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure we do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There is no ticking time bomb out there among these young
people who have no jobs, who, as far as they are concerned, have no
hope?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, no, I don't think so. I think that the critical matter is
first of all to tell people the truth, that these things are going
to take time, and secondly, to do something, as has been done, that
is being done and will be done.
</P>
<P>
   If indeed there was nothing happening, then indeed we would get
an explosion. (A recent newspaper survey showed that) despair and
loss of hope is among your richer people, the white community,
followed by the Indians, who despair about the future because they
are fearful of losing what they have. Whereas the poor take
precisely the opposite position. They are very hopeful about the
future because they can see the changes that have been made (and
believe), ``Even if they have not reached me today, they will reach
me tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how do you resolve those sorts of conflicting perceptions?
And what are you going to do about white people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many of the whites are victims of their own propaganda. The
fear of the future is a fear which they impose on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you reassure them?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it's important to communicate the message to them
continuously that the fears they entertain are unfounded, but I
think that also (we must examine) the practical, the actual things
that happen. They feared, after the elections in 1994, that
terrible things were going to happen to them, that they would be
slaughtered and this and that, and nothing like that happened. And
next they feared that they would lose their jobs because of
affirmative action and end up as the unemployed, and the black
people as the employed. It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You recently told a crowd of black South Africans that they
needed to get angry. Can you explain that?
</P>
<P>
   A: You see, part of the problem is that we are too comfortable
with an ugly past. The consequence is that the impulse to change
the ugly reality that comes from that ugly past gets dulled. So I
say, you see, we have got to be angry about the fact of slavery. It
is not just a matter of saying, ``Oh, it happened.'' We have to be
angry about the history of colonialism. We have to be angry about
this history of neocolonialism, when African leaders robbed the
masses of our people and produced conflicts on the continent. We
have got to be angry about apartheid. Then we put ourselves in a
position to say, ``Let's do something about it to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   If I said to you what is happening in South Africa _ even the
memory of what apartheid meant is receding. There are people here
who, when you talk to them about the pass laws (which required
blacks to carry identification books), they say, ``What? What is
that?'' If you lose that anger and you lose that anger because you
are sitting in a comfortable position, you lose the drive to change
the things which have to be changed. And then perhaps there is too
much such forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you clarify that? Are you quarreling with the notion of
reconciliation?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. You know we must forgive the people who committed the
crime of apartheid, but I think a mistake is made when people then
think that also means forgiving apartheid. Nobody in the world asks
the jury for forgiveness for slavery. Why must we forgive slavery
and apartheid? We have done the forgiving thing. No, I think there
is too much forgiveness here. We never agreed to forgive the system
of apartheid.

<P>
   To restore strategic balance to South Asia, Pakistan was obliged
to respond to India's May 1998 nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   India already held an advantage in conventional weaponry, and
was following its underground tests with statements threatening
nuclear blackmail. Pakistan's nuclear tests were undertaken in
self-defense. By establishing mutual deterrence, they have served
the interests of peace and stability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is acutely aware of the risks and responsibilities
accompanying nuclear weapons. In 1974 Pakistan responded to India's
nuclear test with redoubled efforts to keep the region
nuclear-free, realizing that a nuclear race in South Asia would
have far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Pakistan proposed a nuclear weapons-free zone in
South Asia; a joint renunciation of acquisition or manufacture of
nuclear weapons; mutual inspection of nuclear facilities; adherence
to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and International Atomic
Energy Agency safeguards on nuclear facilities; a bilateral nuclear
test ban; and a missile-free zone in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1991 Pakistan proposed a five-nation conference, which
was later expanded to include all permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, to discuss conventional arms control and
confidence-building measures as well as the promotion of nuclear
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, before the U.N. General Assembly, the prime minister of
Pakistan again proposed mutual and equal restraint by Pakistan and
India on the development of nuclear and ballistic missiles. These
initiatives not only remained unanswered by India but elicited
little support from the international community.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 tests of the Prithvi design and four of the Agni _ both
of them nuclear-capable and targeted at Pakistan's cities _ India
accelerated the pace of its missile programs. Prithvi missiles were
inducted into India's armed forces and deployed against Pakistan,
forcing Pakistan to develop an indigenous missile capability, since
its zero-missile-zone proposal had been rendered redundant.
</P>
<P>
   What finally compelled Pakistan to orient its nuclear program
for defense was the absence of security; the country needed an
indigenous defense capability. Past sanctions degraded Pakistan's
conventional capabilities to the point that it was inconceivable
they would counter an Indian nuclear threat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains in both sides' fundamental interest to avert a
nuclear arms race. It is imperative to move swiftly toward a
strategic-restraint regime, with nuclear and conventional
stabilization measures. With this perspective, Pakistan has resumed
its dialogue with India, focusing on peace, security,
confidence-building and the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir
issue. The framework for discussions, which Pakistan has formally
proposed, includes measures to prevent a nuclear and
ballistic-missile race, risk-reduction mechanisms, the
non-induction of anti-ballistic missile and sea-launched ballistic
missile systems and the maintenance of nuclear deterrence at the
minimum level. Pakistan has also proposed a mutual and balanced
reduction of conventional forces.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, at Prime Minister Mohammad Nawaz Sharif's
invitation, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee visited
Lahore. They issued a joint declaration committing both sides to a
peaceful resolution of outstanding issues including Kashmir and
decided to work for conclusive measures in nuclear and conventional
arms control, build mutual confidence and avoid the risks of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Lahore declaration signifies Pakistan's and India's desire
to manage the nuclear standoff in South Asia in a responsible and
mature manner. Indeed the costs of seeking unilateral advantage
have become prohibitive. Pakistan and India must conduct their
relations on the basis of sovereign equality, endeavor to settle
the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and build a more secure and
prosperous future for their peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has declared a unilateral moratorium on nuclear testing
and offered a regional test-ban treaty to India. It has agreed in
good faith to join the negotiations in the Conference on
Disarmament on a fissile material treaty, solemnly reiterated its
promise not to transfer sensitive equipment or technology, and
declared its commitment to build a mutually acceptable and
verifiable strategic-restraint regime with India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also indicated its readiness to adhere to the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in conditions free of coercion or
pressure. The CTBT's entry into force requires the adherence of all
the 44 designated states, including all nuclear weapons states,
whether or not they are recognized as such.
</P>
<P>
   This is a cardinal element in establishing a norm against
explosive testing. The CTBT would, unfortunately, not be a nuclear
disarmament measure. Technologically advanced states would continue
to develop and improve weapons designs through subcritical or
nondetectable tests.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear conflict can have no victor. In South Asia, nuclear
deterrence may, however, usher in an era of durable peace between
Pakistan and India and provide the requisite incentives to resolve
all outstanding issues, especially Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   The international community should encourage a process of peace
and rapprochement, help promote the peaceful resolution of disputes
and support nuclear stabilization and restraint in South Asia. The
world must also pay attention to the root causes of insecurity and
instability in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute is indispensable for
the region's peace and prosperity. The principles for a just
settlement of this dispute have been enunciated in U.N. Security
Council resolutions, which must be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Pakistani dialogue on security and nuclear issues has
also progressed. The United States has adopted a pragmatic
approach, recognizing the steps that Pakistan has taken for peace
and global nonproliferation. The United States must continue to
play an important role in transforming South Asia's security
environment from confrontation to cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Economic sanctions and coercive measures against Pakistan will
serve neither peace nor nonproliferation. These sanctions and
pressures are unjust and unwarranted. Pakistan has not violated any
legal obligations or international norms. Sanctions must be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclearization of South Asia is a reality. But all South
Asian states remain committed to the goals of global nuclear
disarmament and nonproliferation. As members of the Nonaligned
Movement, Pakistan and India have always stood for a principled and
nondiscriminatory attainment of these goals. Both should cooperate
with the international community to promote peace, security,
disarmament and nonproliferation.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.

<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Brewster, president and ceo of American Express Publishing
Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fully integrated media and marketing programs. Companies will
put together packages that include a magazine element, TV element,
trade element, in-store events and a data base.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Peter Arnell, chairman of The Arnell Group: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM
broadcasting. The big usage will be on billboards, so when you're
passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail
environment, you walk into a Macy's and you have something in your
ear, and then you can hear a broadcast from Macy's radio station
about sales and what's going on in the store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rebecca Shafer, creative director of Tse: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing will be the Internet, without a doubt, along
with interactive media like live billboards. Also, more niche
marketing to the young, like young luxury. The connection will have
to be immediate from the brand to the consumer. You can't take five
years to develop and hit your target. Also, there will be more
magazines like Talk that can be targeted to the young as well as
older.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Steven LaGuardia, creative director of Louis Boston: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magazines are moving to be more lifestyle and attitude-based,
rather than gender-based. Look at Wallpaper, Surface and I-D. It's
not so much segregating men from women. We're seeing that kind of
media becoming much more important.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Stefani Greenfield, co-owner of Scoop: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I definitely think that in the millennium, communication is
going to be driven by the Internet. From a fashion standpoint,
shopping online is the way of the future. It's not enough to have a
store now. You have to have a Web site. Now you have an opportunity
to reach the public at large, and it's a lot more cost-effective
than opening up a store. You're going to see the Internet as the
new focus group. We're going to take what's happening in fashion
globally and see it at our fingertips and communicate on that
level.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Irma Zandl, president of The Zandl Group, market researcher: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think it's going to be totally about customized media and
magazines will deliver these things via the Internet. People who
feel like they've been inundated will want to filter things out. I
see this as being more of a guy thing because guys are more
focused, whereas girls have more of a gathering mentality. This has
a lot of applications. For example, a Playboy kind of person who is
into blondes only. He'll say, ``Don't send me any of those
redheads.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Marc Balet, principal of Balet &AMP; Albert Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I believe that the next big thing in media will be back to
basics: storytelling to groups of six or 12. Someone brings the
marshmallows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Madonna Badger, president and creative director of Badger Worldwide
Advertising: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It will definitely be the Internet. Right now, it's estimated
the Internet will capture 50 million users in just five years. It
took TV 13 years and radio 38 years. The Internet demographic is
really a marketer's dream. They're young, they're smart, they're
educated and they have a decent household income. This is quite
simply a great way to increase brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles DeCaro, partner at Laspata/DeCaro: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mini fashion magazines on the Web. They will offer a lot of
snippets. They will be the Cliff Notes of magazines. People have so
little time to read lengthy articles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the next thing will be HDTV (high-definition
television). People really want to see runway shows as vividly as
they would by being there. Once they see high-resolution TV, it
will be like it was between 1951-54, where everyone had to go out
and buy a TV set.

   I believe that the next big thing in media will be back to
basics: storytelling to groups of six or 12. Someone brings the
marshmallows.

<P>
   It will definitely be the Internet. Right now, it's estimated
the Internet will capture 50 million users in just five years. It
took TV 13 years and radio 38 years. The Internet demographic is
really a marketer's dream. They're young, they're smart, they're
educated and they have a decent household income. This is quite
simply a great way to increase brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles DeCaro, partner at Laspata/DeCaro: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mini fashion magazines on the Web. They will offer a lot of
snippets. They will be the Cliff Notes of magazines. People have so
little time to read lengthy articles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the next thing will be HDTV (high-definition
television). People really want to see runway shows as vividly as
they would by being there. Once they see high-resolution TV, it
will be like it was between 1951-54, where everyone had to go out
and buy a TV set.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I don't think people are that interested in models
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   So proclaimed Calvin Klein _ the man who virtually invented the
supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   Klein unveiled his fall CK Jeans and CK Calvin Klein ad
campaigns, and sure enough, there's not a Christy or Kate in sight.
Instead, the new ads feature individual portraits of musicians and
young actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, if I had a feeling about a particular model, I
showed them to Kelly (Klein), Marcy (his daughter) and Fran
(Leibowitz). Now, when I touch base with my daughter, just a pretty
face isn't enough. It's an indication of how lots of people are
thinking,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a great moment for the modeling industry,'' the
designer continued, although he noted that agencies are now
representing all kinds of celebrities. ``It says a lot about our
society, and I think it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's no secret that famous celebrities have usurped models
as cover girls on many fashion magazines, Klein isn't even that
interested in showing famous faces _ although a few musicians in
his campaign are practically household names _ depending on one's
household, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And while everyone's all hyped up about the Internet, Klein's
heading in a different direction. He's looking to do a big radio
buy for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people are listening to music, whether they're driving
their own cars or are passengers,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wall Street estimates, the CK Jeans business, owned
by Warnaco, is expected to generate in excess of $600 million in
wholesale volume this year throughout its junior, women's, men's
and kids' divisions. That's up from $400 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Warnaco generally spends in excess of 5 percent of sales on
advertising _ which would amount to more than $30 million in
advertising for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wachner, chairman of Warnaco, declined to specify the fall
budget, but said, ``We're spending 50 percent more than last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run in 45 magazines and outdoors, in addition
to radio.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion's connection to musicians and actors obviously is
nothing new _ remember Marky Mark in his Calvins? But for the past
few years, Tommy Hilfiger has been at the vanguard of featuring
up-and-coming rock stars and famous progeny in both his ad
campaigns and store appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Klein acknowledges that other jeans companies have featured rock
stars and up-and-coming artists in their ad campaigns, and now he's
ready to give it his own interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (companies) are involved with featuring musicians,''
Klein said. ``And we had to figure out, how does it apply to us? I
like to take a risk early on, like what we did with Marky Mark _
what he represented, his music and his ability to write his own
music. It goes back to that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted musicians and young actors who are not necessarily
that well known, and they all have their own look,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a bit more on the edge, not ones who are played on the
radio all around America. They're not so mass. They're all
acclaimed by critics and other musicians and most of them are the
cool ones,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein's lineup includes musicians Foxy Brown, Liz Phair, Shirley
Manson of Garbage, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Melissa Auf Der Maur
of Hole, Moa (a 25-year-old singer from Iceland), Jon Spencer,
Butch of Marvelous 3 and Ryan Shuck of Orgy.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also includes Julia Stiles, a young actress who
stars in ``Ten Things I Hate About You,'' as well as actors Vincent
Kartheiser, who appeared in ``The Other Side of Paradise,'' and
Justin Chambers, who's featured in the Contradiction ads and has a
new film coming out, ``Liberty Heights,'' with Carolyn Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are some famous progeny such as actor Ben
Taylor, son of James Taylor and Carly Simon; actor Scott Caan, son
of James Caan, as well as musician Leona Naess, the stepdaughter of
Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Where did Klein come up with this list?
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter,'' the designer revealed, referring to Marcy
Klein, who's a producer at ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the spreads shows a horizontal shot of Foxy Brown in her
CK Jeans, while another shows a heavily tattooed Butch of Marvelous
3 wearing CK jeans. Vincent Kartheiser is photographed in his CK
Jeans licking a spoonful of peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The print ads carry the musician or actor's name and what
they're wearing, such as ``Deconstruction Denim,'' ``Pewter Denim''
or ``The Original Calvin.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads were photographed by Steven Klein at Silvercup Studios
in Long Island City, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who attended the three-day shoot, said he worked
with Steven Klein to determine who the artists would be and that
they'd do portraits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also spent a great deal of time with my daughter discussing
who the talent would be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his criteria, Klein said, ``A few of the artists have
albums coming out this summer. Some of them are all over MTV and
are hot now, and this is their moment. Others are cool and edgy and
not so new, but something's happening at this moment or is going to
happen real soon,'' said Klein, who's created more than a few stars
in his day.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he asked the musicians and actors to choose their own
CK clothes to wear in the shoot, and Jon Spencer, who ``only wears
black,'' had no problem finding an outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were incredible,'' said the designer, about the assembled
group. A few were big fans of some of the others, he added. ``They
were so happy to do this. I was shocked. Ben Taylor was singing
while we were doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The fall campaign encompasses the junior, women's, kids' and
men's CK Jeans lines (owned by Warnaco), as well as CK Calvin Klein
women's and men's collections (owned by Calvin Klein Inc.).
</P>
<P>
   And while Klein might feel right at home in the studio, he
acknowledged that media planning has become a lot more difficult
these days, with so many choices of magazines, cable and network TV
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Klein recalled how he was the first to run multiple-page
portfolios in magazines in the late '70s, but doesn't want to go
that route anymore. Instead, he said, he prefers to run spreads in
a greater number of publications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is multiple pages in a magazine. The
magazines may not be thrilled to hear this. But the spreads say
what I want to say. I'd rather say it through different photographs
of different people in unexpected places. I don't think the story
is multiples pages in a book. When I look at those, it's not
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the core fashion and lifestyle magazines, Klein
has also selected some ``edgier'' publications such as Nylon,
Raygun, Contents, Notorious, Alternative Press and Trace. The ads
will run in the United States, Asia, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many new magazines. I have a stack of them. I
chose many of the new ones. They're small audiences and you can
target them. I like the idea of supporting them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as the media business becomes increasingly complex
and there's so much discussion about the Internet, Klein's excited
about placing his ads on an old format, radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll try radio in a strong way. I want to hear what they (the
musicians and young actors) have to say. It's more about saying
something,'' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm clearly going after a young audience, and music is a
primary thing in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who's no stranger to controversial ad campaigns, said he
doesn't think he'll run into any trouble this time, even though
some of the artists' lyrics may be questionable. And now that he's
associating his name with many artists, he's hopeful none of them
will do anything to embarrass the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the risk. We were careful, with the way everyone tends
to scrutinize what we do. Some of the lyrics are edgy. I'm not sure
everything they sing is going to be agreeable, but there's nothing
offensive. They're not killing people or advocating murder,'' Klein
said. ``In the end you have to take certain risks. Not everyone
will love what you're doing. In all the work, there's nothing
anyone would find offensive. Some people won't even get it, and
others will say, `Who are these people?''' &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingrid Sischy, editor in chief of Interview: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the idea of psychographics will be more important than
demographics.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Brewster, president and ceo of American Express Publishing

   One thing that will be really big is specific-frequency AM

passing a billboard and see the station, you turn on that
particular radio station and it'll talk to you. In a retail

about sales and what's going on in the store.

   NEW YORK _ Leave all the predictions about computer
consciousness, interplanetary colonization and 200-year-old people
to Kreskin and his cronies. The following is a spot-check of those
operating in the here and now _ advertising, marketing and industry
executives _ on what's the next big thing in media.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Pecker, president and chief executive officer of American
Media: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing is convergence, where the Web, cable and the
PC all converge in one set box in your office or home. The most
important part of it will be content. Here's where magazine
publishers will be able to go into the millennium as big content
providers for all the new media. Major publishers with megabrand
titles will be the biggest producers of the content. The other
element will be e-commerce, and there are big opportunities for
smart publishers. Magazines will sell products from the pages, and
smart publishers will take a portion of the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Janine Lopiano-Misdom, partner in Sputnik Inc., a trend
forecaster: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next big thing in media is already happening today:
interactive Web sites. What we mean by interactive is online,
real-time, soon-to-be-video-streamlined ``gatherings'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will marketers be competing with the hundreds of TV
stations already on cable, but with the millions of Web sites and
interactive sites that will exist. The winners will those who
deliver the engaging, entertaining, interactive and informative
experience that immerses consumers. Web sites will no longer be
digital catalogs or e-commerce vehicles; they will become the next
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sam Shahid, owner of Shahid &AMP; Co. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Someone will surprise us, but it might not be a magazine; people
are reading less and less. It'll be the Internet. Instead of
carrying pocketbook novels, it'll be a new Walkman that's
battery-operated, where you can see and read everything you want in
the world.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   An unpleasant truth often overlooked is that although war is a
great evil, it does have a great virtue: It can resolve political
conflicts and lead to peace.
</P>
<P>
   This can happen when all belligerents become exhausted or when
one wins decisively. Either way the key is that the fighting must
continue until a resolution is reached.
</P>
<P>
   War brings peace only after passing a culminating phase of
violence. Hopes of military success must fade for accommodation to
become more attractive than further combat.
</P>
<P>
   But since the establishment of the United Nations and the
enshrinement of great-power politics in its Security Council, wars
among lesser powers have rarely been allowed to run their natural
course. Instead, they have typically been interrupted early on,
before they could burn themselves out and establish the
preconditions for a lasting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational commands find it difficult to control the quality
and conduct of member states' troops, which can reduce the
performance of all forces involved to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by
external observers, although its consequences are abundantly
visible in the litter of dead, mutilated, raped and tortured
victims that attends such interventions. The true state of affairs
is illuminated by the rare exception, such as the vigorous Danish
tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to any attack on it by firing
back in full force, quickly stopping the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   What of NATO's intervention against Serbia for the sake of
Kosovo? The alliance relied on airpower alone to minimize the risk
of NATO casualties, bombing targets in Serbia, Montenegro and
Kosovo for weeks without losing a single pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the ground far beneath the high-flying planes,
small groups of Serb soldiers and police in armored vehicles were
terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But no
country offered to send them into Kosovo when the ethnic cleansing
began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Apache helicopters based in Germany were finally
ordered to Albania, in spite of the vast expenditure devoted to
their instantaneous ``readiness'' over the years, they required
more than three weeks of ``predeployment preparations'' to make the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into the war, the Apaches had yet to fly their first
mission, although two had already crashed during training. More
than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging was responsible for this
inordinate delay. The U.S. Army insisted that the Apaches could not
operate on their own, but would need the support of heavy rocket
barrages to suppress Serb anti-aircraft weapons. This created a
much larger logistical load than the Apaches alone, and an
additional, evidently welcome delay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had aircraft deployed on Italian bases already
which could have done the job just as well: U.S. A-10 ``Warthogs''
built around their powerful 30mm antitank guns and British Royal
Air Force Harriers ideal for low-altitude bombing at close range.
Neither was employed, again because it could not be done in perfect
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the calculus of the NATO democracies, the immediate
possibility of saving thousands of Albanians from massacre and
hundreds of thousands from deportation was obviously not worth the
lives of a few pilots. That may reflect unavoidable political
reality, but it demonstrates how even a large-scale disinterested
intervention can fail to achieve its ostensibly humanitarian aim.
</P>
<P>
   The most disinterested of all interventions in war _ and the
most destructive _ are humanitarian relief activities. The largest
and most protracted is the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It
was built on the model of its predecessor, the U.N. Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), which operated displaced-persons'
camps in Europe immediately after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Relief and Works Agency was established right after the
1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate and provide
health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli zones in the
former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip provided, on the whole, a higher
standard of living than most Arab villagers had previously enjoyed,
with a more varied diet, organized schooling, superior medical care
and no backbreaking labor in stony fields.
</P>
<P>
   They had, therefore, the effect of becoming desirable homes
rather than eagerly abandoned transit camps. With the encouragement
of several Arab countries, the agency turned escaping civilians
into lifelong refugees who gave birth to refugee children, who have
in turn had refugee children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of Palestinians in the camps, moreover, has
facilitated the voluntary or forced enlistment of refugee youths by
armed organizations that fight both Israel and each other. The
agency has contributed to a half-century of Arab-Israeli violence
and still retards the advent of peace.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The UNRWA has counterparts elsewhere, such as the Cambodian
camps along the Thai border, which incidentally provided safe
havens for the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. But because the United
Nations is limited by stingy national contributions, these camps'
sabotage of peace is at least localized.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true of the proliferating, feverishly competitive
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that now aid war refugees.
Like any other institution, these NGOs are interested in
perpetuating themselves, which means that their first priority is
to attract charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. War refugees, by contrast,
can win sustained press coverage if kept concentrated in reasonably
accessible camps.
</P>
<P>
   Regular warfare among well-developed countries is rare and
offers few opportunities for such NGOs, so they focus their efforts
on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This ensures
that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although abysmal
by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms. Those NGOs are therefore helping prolong the warfare whose
consequences they ostensibly seek to mitigate.

   If the United Nations helped the strong defeat the weak faster
and more decisively, it would actually enhance the peacemaking
potential of war. But the first priority of U.N. peacekeeping
contingents is to avoid casualties among their own personnel. Unit
commanders therefore habitually appease the locally stronger force,
accepting its dictates and tolerating its abuses.
</P>
<P>
   This appeasement is not strategically purposeful, as siding with
the stronger power overall would be; rather, it merely reflects the
determination of each U.N. unit to avoid confrontation. The final
result is to prevent the emergence of a coherent outcome, which
requires an imbalance of strength sufficient to end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers chary of violence are also unable to effectively
protect civilians who are caught up in the fighting or deliberately
attacked. At best, U.N. peacekeeping forces have been passive
spectators to outrages and massacres, as in Bosnia and Rwanda. At
worst, they collaborate with it, as Dutch U.N. troops did in the
fall of Srebenica by helping the Bosnian Serbs separate the men of
military age from the rest of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The very presence of U.N. forces, meanwhile, inhibits the normal
remedy of endangered civilians, which is to escape from the combat
zone. Deluded into thinking that they will be protected, civilians
in danger remain in place until it is too late to flee.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions such as the European Union, the Western European
Union and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
lack even the U.N.'s rudimentary command structure and personnel,
yet they too now seek to intervene in warlike situations, with
predictable consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Bereft of forces even theoretically capable of combat, they
satisfy the interventionist urges of member states (or their own
institutional ambitions) by sending unarmed or lightly armed
``observer'' missions, which have the same problems as U.N.
peacekeeping missions, only more so.
</P>
<P>
   Military organizations such as NATO or the West African
Peacekeeping Force (ECOMOG, recently at work in Sierra Leone) at
least are capable of stopping warfare. Their interventions have the
destructive consequence of prolonging the state of war, but they
can at least protect civilians from its consequences. Yet even that
often fails to happen because multinational military commands
engaged in disinterested interventions tend to avoid any risk of
combat, thereby limiting their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational commands find it difficult to control the quality
and conduct of member states' troops, which can reduce the
performance of all forces involved to the lowest common
denominator.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of troop degradation can rarely be detected by
external observers, although its consequences are abundantly
visible in the litter of dead, mutilated, raped and tortured
victims that attends such interventions. The true state of affairs
is illuminated by the rare exception, such as the vigorous Danish
tank battalion in Bosnia that replied to any attack on it by firing
back in full force, quickly stopping the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   What of NATO's intervention against Serbia for the sake of
Kosovo? The alliance relied on airpower alone to minimize the risk
of NATO casualties, bombing targets in Serbia, Montenegro and
Kosovo for weeks without losing a single pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the ground far beneath the high-flying planes,
small groups of Serb soldiers and police in armored vehicles were
terrorizing hundreds of thousands of Albanian Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has a panoply of aircraft designed for finding and
destroying such vehicles. All its major powers have anti-tank
helicopters, some equipped to operate without base support. But no
country offered to send them into Kosovo when the ethnic cleansing
began _ after all, they might have been shot down.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Apache helicopters based in Germany were finally
ordered to Albania, in spite of the vast expenditure devoted to
their instantaneous ``readiness'' over the years, they required
more than three weeks of ``predeployment preparations'' to make the
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks into the war, the Apaches had yet to fly their first
mission, although two had already crashed during training. More
than mere bureaucratic foot-dragging was responsible for this
inordinate delay. The U.S. Army insisted that the Apaches could not
operate on their own, but would need the support of heavy rocket
barrages to suppress Serb anti-aircraft weapons. This created a
much larger logistical load than the Apaches alone, and an
additional, evidently welcome delay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, NATO had aircraft deployed on Italian bases already
which could have done the job just as well: U.S. A-10 ``Warthogs''
built around their powerful 30mm antitank guns and British Royal
Air Force Harriers ideal for low-altitude bombing at close range.
Neither was employed, again because it could not be done in perfect
safety.
</P>
<P>
   In the calculus of the NATO democracies, the immediate
possibility of saving thousands of Albanians from massacre and
hundreds of thousands from deportation was obviously not worth the
lives of a few pilots. That may reflect unavoidable political
reality, but it demonstrates how even a large-scale disinterested
intervention can fail to achieve its ostensibly humanitarian aim.
</P>
<P>
   The most disinterested of all interventions in war _ and the
most destructive _ are humanitarian relief activities. The largest
and most protracted is the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). It
was built on the model of its predecessor, the U.N. Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA), which operated displaced-persons'
camps in Europe immediately after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Relief and Works Agency was established right after the
1948-49 Arab-Israeli war to feed, shelter, educate and provide
health services for Arab refugees who had fled Israeli zones in the
former territory of Palestine. Its camps in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan,
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip provided, on the whole, a higher
standard of living than most Arab villagers had previously enjoyed,
with a more varied diet, organized schooling, superior medical care
and no backbreaking labor in stony fields.
</P>
<P>
   They had, therefore, the effect of becoming desirable homes
rather than eagerly abandoned transit camps. With the encouragement
of several Arab countries, the agency turned escaping civilians
into lifelong refugees who gave birth to refugee children, who have
in turn had refugee children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   During its half-century of operation, this U.N. agency has thus
perpetuated a Palestinian refugee nation, preserving its
resentments in as fresh a condition as they were in 1948. By its
very existence, the UNRWA dissuades integration into local society
and inhibits emigration.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration of Palestinians in the camps, moreover, has
facilitated the voluntary or forced enlistment of refugee youths by
armed organizations that fight both Israel and each other. The
agency has contributed to a half-century of Arab-Israeli violence
and still retards the advent of peace.
</P>
<P>
   If each European war had been attended by its own postwar UNRWA,
today's Europe would have remained a mosaic of warring tribes,
undigested and unreconciled in their separate feeding camps. It
might have assuaged consciences to help each one at each remove,
but it would have led to permanent instability and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The UNRWA has counterparts elsewhere, such as the Cambodian
camps along the Thai border, which incidentally provided safe
havens for the mass-murdering Khmer Rouge. But because the United
Nations is limited by stingy national contributions, these camps'
sabotage of peace is at least localized.
</P>
<P>
   That is not true of the proliferating, feverishly competitive
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that now aid war refugees.
Like any other institution, these NGOs are interested in
perpetuating themselves, which means that their first priority is
to attract charitable contributions by being seen to be active in
high-visibility situations.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most dramatic natural disasters attract any significant
mass-media attention, and then only briefly; soon after an
earthquake or flood, the cameras depart. War refugees, by contrast,
can win sustained press coverage if kept concentrated in reasonably
accessible camps.
</P>
<P>
   Regular warfare among well-developed countries is rare and
offers few opportunities for such NGOs, so they focus their efforts
on aiding refugees in the poorest parts of the world. This ensures
that the food, shelter and health care offered _ although abysmal
by Western standards _ exceeds what is locally available to
non-refugees. The consequences are entirely predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Among many examples, the huge refugee camps along the Democratic
Republic of Congo's border with Rwanda stand out. They sustain a
Hutu nation that would otherwise have been dispersed, making the
consolidation of Rwanda impossible and providing a base for
radicals to launch more Tutsi-killing raids across the border.
Humanitarian intervention has worsened the chances of a stable,
long-term resolution of the tensions in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   To keep refugee nations intact and preserve their resentments
forever is bad enough, but inserting material aid into ongoing
conflicts is even worse. Many NGOs that operate in an odor of
sanctity routinely supply active combatants. Defenseless, they
cannot exclude armed warriors from their feeding stations, clinics
and shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since refugees are presumptively on the losing side, the
warriors among them are usually in retreat. By intervening to help,
NGOs systematically impede the progress of their enemies toward a
decisive victory that could end the war. Sometimes NGOs, impartial
to a fault, even help both sides, thus preventing mutual exhaustion
and a resulting settlement.
</P>
<P>
   And in some extreme cases, such as Somalia, NGOs even pay
protection money to local war bands, which use those funds to buy
arms. Those NGOs are therefore helping prolong the warfare whose
consequences they ostensibly seek to mitigate.

   HEMINGWAY-KC: In one of the short stories that Ernest Hemingway
set in Kansas City, he writes that the city was ``very like
Constantinople.'' Some never-before-published manuscript fragments
of ``God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen,'' showing early drafts of the
opening passages of that story, reveal Hemingway's struggle to put
down on paper just what he thought of Kansas City. And what did he
really mean by the Constantinople comparison? At a time when a
previously unpublished book by Hemingway is making literary waves,
The Kansas City Star adds insult to injury by publishing these
``new'' Hemingway paragraphs about Kansas City. Steve Paul. 71
inches. TO BE MOVED SEPARATELY.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-ERROR:A curious footnote to the Hemingway record in
Kansas City. That 15th Street police station that was part of his
beat was really on 19th Street. Monroe Dodd catches EH and all who
followed him in the error. Steve Paul. 13 inches.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-DEFINE: He was born on July 21, 1899, and died by his
own hand on another July day 62 years later. In the intervening
years, his life not only paralleled the rise of the ``American
century,'' he helped define it.
</P>
<P>
   He was an American abroad. He was all brawn and swagger. And in
one of the surest ways to extend one's life beyond its natural
boundaries he wrote it all down, and much of what he wrote down was
very good.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the centennial of Ernest Hemingway's birth, and
unlike the 100th anniversary of, say, James Gould Cozzens or Robert
McAlmon, two of his contemporaries, the event is drawing
considerable attention. Steve Paul. 38 inches.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-BIOGRAPHY: That Ernest Hemingway could be exasperating
has been established.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, that's not the entire agenda of Michael Reynolds, the
Hemingway scholar who now has completed his cycle of Hemingway
biographies with Hemingway: The Final Years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth and final volume of the series Reynolds began
back in 1986 with the appearance of The Young Hemingway. Through
these books Reynolds has established himself a scholar who, while
possessing a vast store of sympathy for the Hemingway the artist,
has never hesitated to identify troglodyte conduct when he
encounters it.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, there's plenty to describe in the period of Hemingway's
life this last volume spans, from 1940 through to his 1961 suicide.
Brian Burnes. 24 inches.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-BIRTHS:. During a poignant period in 1928, Hemingway
and his pregnant wife Pauline spent a few weeks in Kansas City,
where after a difficult pregnancy, their son Patrick was born. This
is during the same period when Hemingway is writing A Farewell to
Arms, whose wrenching end involves a difficult pregancy and fatal
childbirth. Brian Burnes. 52 inches.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-TYLER: We can thank Tyler Hemingway for his nephew's
appearance in Kansas City. Just who was he? Brian Burnes. 22
inches.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-HANNEMAN:Audre Hanneman toiled in modest obscurity for
many years to produce one of the most important resources ever
created for Hemingway students, researchers and collectors: A
two-volume descriptive bibliography of works by and about him,
which scholars still today find indispensible. And they also lament
that she or no one else has filled in the blanks since her last
volume appeared in 1975. Not bad for the onetime Kansas Citian who,
after some 30 years in New York, returned to the Kansas City of her
youth to live in semi-retirement. PHOTO. Steve Paul. 57 inches.

HAWKE MOVES OFF THE SET, ONTO THE STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Refiling for those needing.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ Ethan Hawke is in a contemplative mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a very a good movie star, you know?'' the
actor muses.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour earlier he'd certainly been acting like a movie
star. A Mercedes with Hawke as passenger had double-parked on
Williamstown's busy, main commercial strip while the actor trotted
into a store for a beverage. Because a delivery truck on the
opposite side of the street also had double-parked, traffic in both
directions stopped dead for more than five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That was an accident, Hawke says. Could have happened to
anybody. That he, a movie star, shut down the town while searching
to quench his thirst was just, well, bad timing. You know?
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bench on the lawn of the Williamstown Theatre
Festival (WTF), squinting into the afternoon sun as if it's the
glare from television cameras, Hawke says: ``For some reason, I
don't seem to play that whole `fame' angle well. Not the acting
part, all the rest. ... It's very difficult to be a male movie
actor when you have to worry about to what extent your career will
go if you don't take your shirt off for magazine covers or carry a
gun in movies. I've never done that, you know? It's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering Ethan Hawke's life is ``difficult''? Hawke, now 28,
has almost two dozen movies behind him.
</P>
<P>
   He's married to an actress of heavenly allure (Uma Thurman),
with whom he has an infant daughter who will be a year old early
next month.
</P>
<P>
   And Hawke can choose his pick of projects, from Westerns (``The
Newton Boys'') to a contemporary retelling of a classic (this
fall's ``Hamlet'') to an adaptation of a literary best-seller
(``Snow Falling On Cedars,'' also due out in the fall).
</P>
<P>
   What's he complaining about? He's not. He's considering,
figuring things out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hawke recalls upon reflection, he has fired weapons
onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I did shoot a gun in `The Newton Boys,''' he concedes.
``But that's the only _ no, I did in `A Midnight Clear,' and I do
in `Hamlet.' But you know what I mean, you know? It's not like
...''
</P>
<P>
   He trails off. Words having failed, he demonstrate physically:
jerks his head and shoulders forward and looks mean,
action-heroish.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't done that kind of gunning in movies.
</P>
<P>
   The point clarified, Hawke moves on to talk about ``Camino
Real,'' the Tennessee Williams play in which he's starring at the
WTF. The high-powered cast boasts such name actors as Blair Brown,
Hope Davis and Jeffrey Jones, who despite their fame and acclaim
are among the lesser-knowns in a WTF summer that includes Hawke,
David Schwimmer of ``Friends,'' Bebe Neuwirth (Lilith on
``Cheers'') and, of course, recent Oscar honoree Gwyneth Paltrow in
Shakespare's ``As You Like It.''
</P>
<P>
   The Williams play (pronounced Cam-I-no Ree-AL) runs through July
4. Rarely produced, and always an audience-baffler when it is,
``Camino Real'' finds Williams at his most dreamlike: mannered and
obscure and poetic. Before the play opened, in 1953, with Elia
Kazan as director and Eli Wallach in the part Hawke plays, Williams
acknowledged its difficult style, themes and weighty symbolism:
``This play will exasperate and confuse a certain number of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the playwright added hopefully, ``Not (as many) as it is
likely to please.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the town square of an unnamed Latin American country, the
plot brings together an American boxer, Kilroy (Hawke), with such
historical figures as Casanova, Lord Byron and Don Quixote to
create a dreamscape of beauty and horror in a mythic neverland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is hard for people when they read it (because)
Williams is trying to tell you a story in a different way than
you're used to,'' says Hawke, who was invited to act in the
production by its director, Nicholas Martin. When he initially read
the play, Hawke says, ``I thought, `This is insane.' But Nicky
begged me to read it again, and the second time I read it I was
deeply moved by it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he promises, ``I think (audiences) will be shocked by how
much fun it is to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the script, Kilroy is forced by townspeople into wearing a
``Patsy'' clown costume featuring a bright red rubber nose that at
times lights up. One character misinterprets the blinks as Kilroy's
attempt at Morse code.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird thing to read, `His nose lights up,' but when you
see it, man, it's funny, you know? Just funny,'' says Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   He sums up the play's cumulative effect of chaotic onstage
action, image-laden speech and frequent symbolism: ``It's a poem,
you know? A Vaudeville poem. It's T.S. Eliot going to the circus
and dropping acid.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he remains young onscreen and in public perception _
the tag ``eternal slacker'' often is applied to him _ Hawke is
learning to grow up. Part of being an adult, a dad, is making sure
you're understood.
</P>
<P>
   In conversation, he starts and restarts, corrects and shades and
amplifies. He draws his interlocutor into complicity with his you
knows, seeks reassurance with frequent questions of his own, asked
literally or with a rising vocal inflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to figure out _ you know, my whole life has
changed, with the baby and everything? It's not the same. I can't
just go flying off to this place and to that place. So I'm trying
to figure all that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, he says, is in Paris, shooting a movie. He says/asks,
``With Gerard Depardieu?'' not because he doubts that the immense
Frenchman is Thurman's co-star but to ensure he's understood.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman and their daughter, Maya, will join him in Williamstown
this week, and together they will consider future movies.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing definite yet, he says. He's most excited about
``Hamlet,'' set in corporate America, with Kyle MacLachlan as
Claudius, Sam Shepard as the ghost, Julia Stiles as Ophelia and
Bill Murray as Polonius.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke, who plays Hamlet as a young filmmaker, gets to say the
``To be or not to be'' speech. Four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play with it,'' he says excitedly. ``It's like the whole
movie _ you haven't seen this version before. It's like ...''
</P>
<P>
   He stops. He gestures. He frowns. He talks through a long
digression that disses Kenneth Branagh's four-hour ``Hamlet'' as
``a snooze'' and enthuses about director Baz Luhrmann's ``Romeo and
Juliet'' for its speediness and sex appeal: ``It's about two really
gorgeous people kissing, and then they kill themselves. It's
fantastic,'' he says, his voice surging falsetto with glee on the
second syllable of his final word.
</P>
<P>
   And his ``Hamlet''? ``It's about fame and the media controlling
everything,'' he says. Pause. ``You know?''

EVEN IF YOU LIKE YOUR JOB, TAKE A LEAVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you have a miserable job, you know what to
do: Make plans to quit. But if your job is somewhere in that vast
wilderness between mediocre and halfway decent, don't plan to quit
_ plan to leave.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a society where the typical employee works like mad
for 30 or 40 or 50 years and then leaps into the land of I Can Go
Golfing Forever (or its evil twin, How Am I Supposed To Live on
That?). There's a more civilized way: At least once or twice in
your career, find a way to take a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about something purely selfish, not taking time off
for an ailing family member or an unborn child. Personal leaves
usually fit into one of three broad categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Use these when you have a generally good job that's starting to
overwhelm you, or an opportunity in your personal life that you
don't want to miss. You might want to spend some serious quality
time with your 3-year-old son or 75-year-old mother before they
move on to different stages of life, or you might just want a
healthy break from the 9-to-5 grind.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes work gets so overwhelming that you miss out on the
good things in life. If you dash past a bed of roses, all you may
notice is the smell of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plateaus.
</P>
<P>
   I've come across two good examples in the last month, one at the
office and one at home.
</P>
<P>
   Marcheta Catlett, an editorial assistant at the San Francisco
Examiner for seven years, just started a seven-month leave. Like
many 30-year-olds, Marcheta is at a point when the job isn't as
challenging as it used to be; she needs time to figure out what to
do next, whether it's trying for a promotion or changing jobs or
going back to school.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, Cathy, became a teacher when she was around Marcheta's
age. Twenty years later, she's taking a leave to study the piano,
travel with her husband a little and decide whether she wants to
keep working full time, cut back or leave the working world
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves give Cathy and Marcheta time to make a crucial life
decision without the day-to-day stress to cloud their thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who reach a plateau hop mindlessly from one job to
another without taking the time to figure out what's really wrong _
and end up never solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Passion.
</P>
<P>
   Try something just for fun or because it might lead you to a
different career. I took a leave in 1990 to do something I always
wanted to do: write a novel. I crashed and burned, but enjoyed
every minute of it. Our paths will cross again.
</P>
<P>
   If a pile of resumes has a dozen engineers with 20 years of
experience and one who spent a year writing a novel or trekking in
the Himalayas, will it really bother you that he has worked only 19
years instead or 20? Or are you more likely to be intrigued?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, having a good reason for a leave is only the first
step. Even if your family and friends support your decision, there
are still two major hurdles: getting your employer's permission and
finding a way to survive for several months without a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming you have no union contract or company policy allowing
for leaves, you'll have to negotiate for one. Just as you would
when asking for a raise or anything else, make it clear how the
company will benefit _ not just how you will.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a slow time of year when the boss might not mind
slicing the payroll? Would enrolling in an academic program
accomplish what you want and make it more appealing to the company?
Would you be more energized and creative when you returned? The
best argument you can have in any negotiation is that you're
already a good worker and that this leave, raise or trip to Tahiti
will make you even better. That's why you should ask for a leave as
soon as you hit a plateau, not sputter for three years.
</P>
<P>
   By that point, you might be closer to expendable than
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of your company's best workers and there is no way
you can get four months or six months off without pay, you're
working for an idiot. Keep that in mind as you consider future
career alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   As for money, start saving at least a couple of years before the
leave. If you go into debt to take a leave, the financial stress
might outweigh the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The finances may be difficult, but the payoff is worth it.
Consider it as an investment in your career and your life, either
in learning about yourself or chasing a dream. It could pay
dividends for decades.

<P>
   Now that the air strikes against Yugoslavia have been stopped,
the world community will have to assess the damage and draw lessons
from the events of these past months. We should not allow the
misguided and unwarranted bombing operation to be followed by
hollow proclamations of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the plight of the Kosovars, the destruction of much
of the essential infrastructure in the rest of Yugoslavia and the
tremendous damage to international relations, any triumphalist
statements are jarring. Claims of victory are being made by those,
on either side, who must be troubled by the thought of being held
accountable for what has happened to Yugoslavia. Make no mistake
about it: The outcome is a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   As president of Green Cross International, a non-government
environmental organization that was among the first to sound the
alarm about environmental consequences of NATO's military action, I
feel duty bound to continue the discussion of this vitally
important subject. Some might now be tempted to ask: Was the threat
perhaps exaggerated? Could nature be much more resilient to the
impact of war than we thought? But this is a dangerous complacency
that could serve all of us badly.
</P>
<P>
   Let us recall the effects of the hostilities that followed
Saddam Hussein's aggression against Kuwait. The data cited at an
International Conference on the Environmental Consequences of War
held in Washington in June 1998 indicate that these consequences
are of a long-term nature. Scientists and environmental experts
estimate that 40 percent of Kuwait's strategic water resources have
been irreversibly polluted with oil. Quite alarming are the reports
of health problems among U.S. and British soldiers who fought in
that war problems that now also affect their children.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that the environmental and medical consequences of
the war in Iraq itself are, for reasons that are well known, not
widely covered by the media or studied by scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Military action against Yugoslavia included extensive use of
weapons containing depleted uranium. Such weapons burn at high
temperatures, producing poisonous clouds of uranium oxide that
dissolve in the pulmonary and bronchial fluids. Anyone within the
radius of 300 meters from the epicenter of the explosion inhales
large amounts of such particles.
</P>
<P>
   Although radiation levels produced by the external source are
quite low, the internal radiation source damages various types of
cells in the human body, destroys chromosomes and affects the
reproductive system.
</P>
<P>
   We are told by officials that depleted uranium components are
harmless and that DU weapons are therefore a legitimate means of
warfare. Let us recall, however, that many military and political
leaders initially believed and some seem to believe even now that
nuclear weapons too are quite ``conventional,'' albeit a more
powerful kind of weaponry. Do we need another, ``slow Hiroshima''
to understand this new mistake?
</P>
<P>
   We must now call for a comprehensive expert analysis of the
environmental situation in Yugoslavia and other countries in the
region and in the Danube basin. This should be a priority task. But
we must do more than just that.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that military conflicts in our time can cause both a
human and an environmental catastrophe makes the task of preventing
them even more urgent and important. Prevention must be foremost in
our thinking and our actions. But, if hostilities break out despite
all our efforts, they must be constrained by certain legal limits.
Such constraints have been laid down by the Geneva conventions and
their protocols. It is now clear that they should be supplemented
by provisions to limit the environmental damage caused by warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, I believe that strikes against certain industries
and infrastructure, such as nuclear power stations and some
chemical and petrochemical plants, must be prohibited. Similarly,
we should prohibit weapons whose use may have particularly
dangerous, long-term and massive environmental and medical
consequences. In my view, weapons containing depleted uranium
should be among the first considered for such a ban.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to convene a second conference on the
environmental consequences of war in order to discuss thoroughly
and in depth issues of this kind. It could adopt some urgently
needed amendments to international law and create a mechanism to
continue this work. It should also address the need for an
emergency fund to finance measures to deal with the aftermath of
environmental catastrophes. Recent events only underscore the
urgency of this initiative, which I put forward at the Washington
conference in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, political leaders and public opinion should
now demonstrate that we can learn the right lessons from the
tragedies of the 20th century. The human drama and the drama of
nature should be of equal concern to us. They should sound a call
to responsible action.

 By CYNTHIA GORNEY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Here is a very small story _ which we will refer to as the
Milk-Bag Incident _ set in mid-February in a public middle-school
cafeteria in Duluth, Minn.
 &HT;    Numerous schoolchildren are crowded together at tables with
their food and their milk, which in Duluth is doled out not in
cartons but in single-serving plastic bags with straws.
 &HT;    At one cafeteria table, set together in close quarters amid the
commotion: several boys, two girls, a milk bag. One of the boys
picks up the milk bag. He shapes it into a recognizable replica of
manly genitalia, including scrotum.
 &HT;    The boy announces his achievement to everyone within earshot,
which includes the girls at his table, and points out that the
genitalia he has sculptured is fully tumescent. (The boy's exact
choice of words will not be printed here, but fits into what would
probably qualify as ``age appropriate'' disgusting language for a
modern American sixth grader, which is to say: REALLY disgusting
language.)
 &HT;    The boy and his friends, brandishing the tumescent milk bag,
fall about in general hilarity. The bell rings; lunch period comes
to a close.
 &HT;    Sometime in the course of the next few days, the girls _ like
the boys, these are sixth graders, 12 years old _ appear at the
school vice principal's office to make a complaint. Do the girls
use the term ``sexual harassment''?
 &HT;    Possibly, for they have encountered these words in a
middle-school assembly and one or two contemporary novels assigned
at their grade level, but probably not. Maybe they use the word
``harassment,'' or maybe ``gross.''
 &HT;    In any case they understand that there is a Procedure, and the
vice principal, having paid close attention to the training she has
received, now sets the Procedure into motion: She pulls out a
harassment complaint form.
 &HT;     (Sexual harassment, sexual advances or other forms of
religious, racial or sexual harassment by any pupil, teacher,
administrator or other school personnel, which create an
intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, will not be
tolerated under any circumstances.) 
 &HT;    Do the girls want to fill out the form and sign it? They do. She
calls up the Duluth school system harassment specialist _ a job
title that a decade ago did not exist in the Duluth public schools
_ or, for that matter, in any other U.S. school system.
 &HT;    The specialist is a small, cheerful, 58-year-old former
special-education teacher named Judy Gillen. She works out of the
Duluth school administration headquarters, in a 6-by-10-foot
office-enclosure wedged into half a small room and decorated with
teddy bears, puppets, framed photographs of her grandchildren, a
Women's History Month poster and a big bright sign, affixed to the
front of a file cabinet, that reads: SEXUAL HARASSMENT _ IT'S
ILLEGAL.
 &HT;    There also are books, pamphlets, videotape guides and visual
aids for overhead projection. ``Sexual Harassment in Our School:
What Parents and Teachers Need to Know to Spot It and Stop It.''
``Girls and Boys Getting Along: Teaching Sexual Harassment
Prevention in the Elementary Classroom.'' ``The Hostile School
Bus.'' ``Sexual Harassment: Pay Attention!''
 &HT;    There are copies of a districtwide newsletter Gillen composes,
formerly Harassment News Notes until she changed the title, in a
flush of optimism, to Prevention News Notes. And there's an active
complaints folder, where the Milk-Bag Incident harassment form will
be parked while the middle-school vice principal, with Gillen
monitoring the situation from the downtown office, considers what
to do.
 &HT;    Until late April, when the words ``student-on-student sexual
harassment'' suddenly appeared on newspaper front pages, the
Milk-Bag Incident would have provoked pretty predictable responses
in most outsiders.
 &HT;    It would have made them say: Come ON; 12-year-old girls running
straight for the office because somebody OFFENDED them, vice
principal nodding soberly and handing over FORMS to fill out _ have
these people completely lost their bearings? Or, These are
children. They're SUPPOSED to conduct themselves from time to time
like hormonally overstimulated jerks.
 &HT;    Then, on May 24, in a case called Aurelia Davis vs. Monroe
County Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that any
school receiving federal money can face a sex-discrimination suit
for failing to intervene energetically enough when a student
complains of sexual harassment by another student.
 &HT;    The Davis case started as a lawsuit brought by the mother of a
Georgia schoolgirl who was in fifth grade when she began
experiencing what her family describes as prolonged sexual
harassment _ that was the label from the outset, sexual harassment,
even though the two children involved were 10 and 11 years old _ by
the boy who sat beside her in class.
 &HT;    At the center of the typically lengthy and complicated Supreme
Court opinions was a rather remarkable and contentious
back-and-forth between Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the
majority, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the minority.
 &HT;    O'Connor said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' could be a
deeply serious matter, affecting a child's ability to learn;
Kennedy said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' was in essence a
phrase that made no sense. O'Connor said school officials who
ignored protracted and serious harassment could be sued under Title
IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational
institutions; Kennedy said the U.S. Supreme Court had no business
poking around in matters of local school discipline.
 &HT;    ``After today,'' Kennedy wrote, ``Johnny will find that the
routine problems of adolescence are to be resolved by invoking a
federal right to demand assignment to a desk two rows away.''
 &HT;    Kennedy said ``sex harassment'' is a term that properly applies
to the behavior of adults, not to children ``who are just learning
to interact with their peers.'' He said one published harassment
manual advises that one student's saying ``You look nice'' to
another could be construed as sex harassment, depending on the tone
of voice and other variables.
 &HT;    Kennedy did not say, but suggested by the indignation in some of
his memorable prose, that he believes the banner of
``student-on-student sex harassment'' is being carried at the
present time in our legal and social history by meddling,
litigation-happy, overreaching hysterics placing impossible demands
upon schools that have their hands full teaching children how to
read and write.
 &HT;    Gillen is familiar with the manual Kennedy quoted so
disapprovingly. It's called ``Flirting or Hurting?'' and has sold
about 20,000 copies to U.S. schools since it was first published in
1994. Gillen uses elements of it when she conducts sex-harassment
workshops for middle- and high-school students. The line Kennedy
lifted is part of a chart used to inspire student argument about
possible differences between flirting and harassment.
 &HT;    Flirting, suggests the chart: ''You look nice.'' ``Like your
hair.'' ``Wink.'' ``Wave.'' Harassment, suggests the chart:
``'Ho.'' ``Grab own crotch.'' ''Pinch.'' ``Lip licking.'' And
maybe, depending on the tone of voice, the facial expression and
who else is around: ``You look nice.''
 &HT;    Kennedy may have a real problem with this. So may a great many
other thoughtful people, already working hard to understand the
boundary lines defining sexual harassment among adults. But Gillen
has no problem with it.
 &HT;    ``I mean, get real,'' says Gillen, who read every word of Davis
vs. Monroe County, including the long dissent, the afternoon the
decision was handed down. ``We need to teach responsibility, we who
work directly with kids, and shaping kids' behavior and kids'
lives. Because behavior is learned. We can't accept that kind of
behavior.''
 &HT;    Quite a few public schools are consulting harassment specialists
these days. They're supposed to, or somebody will have a problem
and nobody will know what to do about it and there'll be a
complaint and state or federal investigators and a lawsuit against
the school district and maybe an expensive settlement.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen reported lower court lawsuits even
before the Davis ruling, with its announcement that
student-to-student Title IX suits may proceed if it can be shown
that school officials exhibited ``deliberate indifference'' to sex
harassment that took place on their watch. Now there will be many
more, as school officials scramble to figure out what ``deliberate
indifference'' means.
 &HT;    Often the specialist is an outside professional who comes in
with manuals and case studies in student harassment. It's unusual
for a school district to invent a wordy systemwide job title that
includes ``Harassment Curriculum,'' but Minnesota is particularly
aggressive in what is referred to by its adherents as ``gender
equity,'' and besides, as far as is publicly known, Duluth Public
Schools was the first district in the country to pay out a monetary
settlement in a student-to-student sex harassment case.
 &HT;    Gillen knows the pertinent narratives that float up from the
central pages of many harassment lawsuits. For example, the case of
a young Wisconsin man who was recently awarded a $962,000
settlement from school officials. They were found by a jury to have
violated student's constitutional rights by failing to stop what
happened to him in junior high and high school after he
acknowledged being gay. The boy was taunted, shoved, sworn at,
laughed at, beaten up, subjected to mock rape and cornered in the
bathroom while other boys urinated on him. School administrators
were described as advising the boy's parents that trouble of this
nature is to be ``expected'' when a student is openly gay.
 &HT;    Gillens has intensely studied many other cases too: the
large-breasted California girl who was regularly greeted at the
school doorway and followed through the hall by boys making mooing
noises at her; the eighth-grade Texas girl who was repeatedly
groped on the school bus by a boy who kept demanding to know what
size bra and underpants she was wearing; the seventh-grade
California girl who became the subject of a rollicking schoolwide
rumor, spread by both boys and girls, about sexual acts performed
with hot dogs; the school bus in Minnesota _ in a district down
near Minneapolis _ in which 8-year-old girls were being urged to go
home and perform fellatio on their fathers.
 &HT;    That famous North Carolina story about the 6-year-old who was
suspended from school three years ago for kissing a classmate on
the cheek? Sure. She knows that one too.
 &HT;    Gillen rolls her eyes. ``For a while I got asked that question
just about every place I went,'' she says. ``'And what do you think
about that? How stupid can they be?' And frankly, I agreed with
them. It was stupid.''
 &HT;    For the record: The school subsequently recanted the suspension,
and the Lexington, N.C., school district revised its sex-harassment
policy to take into account the age and maturity of the accused
harasser.
 &HT;    But there's a reason people latched on with such enthusiasm to
the image of school officials banishing a 6-year-old for bussing
his classmate on the cheek: It was simple. Norman Rockwell, felled
by the overreaching hysterics. Much simpler to think about than
packs of junior-high-school boys mooing at a schoolgirl's breasts.
 &HT;    In the Davis case, what the boy accused of harassment did _ what
the Georgia school officials are accused of ignoring, despite
repeated pleas for help from the girl and her family _ was to spend
five months directly and explicitly pressuring his classmate to
have sex with him.
 &HT;    From the Davis plaintiff's brief to the Court: ``... repeatedly
attempted to touch LaShonda's breasts and vaginal area, ... told
her in vulgar terms that he want(ed), ... to get in bed with her,
... placed a doorstop in his pants and behaved in a sexually
harassing manner.''
 &HT;    All of these allegations have yet to be proved in a court of
law; the two sides in Davis were fighting about whether harassment
charges could be brought under Title IX.
 &HT;    But the suggestion that an 11-year-old boy might make advances
as crude and aggressive as a grown man's comes as no surprise to
Gillen, nor to anybody else who has read the details of those
lawsuits. Something truly has changed, she tells gatherings of the
perplexed, and it starts far younger than you think, and it's not
confined to rough inner-city schools.
 &HT;    ``The kids today are not the same kids we dealt with 15 years
ago,'' Gillen says. ``One of our assignments has been just to send
kids home to watch television for an evening, and put down hatch
marks for every swear word, every put-down, every direct sexual
reference, everything that is derogatory against another person.
And the fallout the next day is: 'Can you believe it?'''
 &HT;    Under the schoolhouse code of conduct implicit in the new
vocabulary, the girls don't get to humiliate a boy on the school
bus by speculating loudly as to the modest size of his penis
(that's from a drivers' instructional video), and boys don't get to
pass around annotated lists of the school's 25 Most (expletive)
Females (that's from an actual case brought before the Minnesota
Department of Human Rights _ the financial settlement, paid by the
school district to the senior class girl who brought the complaint,
was $40,000).
 &HT;    The expression ``boys will be boys'' frequently comes up at this
point in the discussion, even though in Gillen's experience the
perps, especially in the vicious-mouth department, are as likely as
not to be girls.
 &HT;    And Gillen's job is to answer: Not that way. Not anymore. ``It's
a whole new set of game rules,'' Gillen says. ``The fun between all
of us has sort of taken on a new dimension. You have to be so
careful. You feel like you're walking on eggs: 'If I wanted to
flirt with you, how would I go about it without offending you?' 'My
God, maybe I just better not do anything anymore.' That's been a
lot of the typical responses I've had.''
 &HT;    It's an enormously difficult thing to teach children and adults
alike a vocabulary that somehow separates benign vulgarity and
flirting from behavior that escalates into humiliation or fear. But
at its core the message Gillen _ and others like her _ has to
deliver is simpler and less elusive than many critics give it
credit for. The message is: There is a certain kind of lousy
feeling that ought not be inescapable, at least not in school, not
when adults are supposed to be watching out for you.
 &HT;    And the law has so far laid out what even the National School
Boards Association agrees is a fairly reasonable base line for
school administrators trying to avoid getting sued: Don't ignore a
complaint.
 &HT;    You must take it seriously, when they come to you with the thing
that's troubling them, and if it is bad, then you must intervene at
least actively enough to avoid being accused of ``deliberate
indifference.'' You must, at risk of a federal lawsuit charging
your school with sex harassment under Title IX, ``respond to peer
harassment in a manner that is not clearly unreasonable.''
 &HT;    So how was the Milk-Bag Incident settled? The boys at the center
of the action were summoned to the principal's office for a mild
chewing-out, told that behavior of this nature was offensive and
unacceptable in school and sentenced to an in-school suspension,
which required taking one day's classes and lunch in a detention
room.
 &HT;    The girls were told that their complaint had been attended to,
were reminded in passing to keep their language out of the gutter
too, and were given to understand what in an ideal world all
schoolchildren ought to know _ that some grown-up at school is
ready to listen, seriously, without shooing them away amid
dismissive reassurances about the inescapable parts of adolescence.
 &HT;    Repercussions? None, so far. Event over.
 &HT;    ``I think we've done an excellent job of educating kids, that
they're willing to report that,'' Gillen says. ``I don't think
we'll see those boys involved in anything again.''
 &HT;    If she's right, then maybe this is how the system, clumsy and
heavy-footed as it is, is supposed to work.

 By CYNTHIA GORNEY  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Here is a very small story _ which we will refer to as the
Milk-Bag Incident _ set in mid-February in a public middle-school
cafeteria in Duluth, Minn.
 &HT;    Numerous schoolchildren are crowded together at tables with
their food and their milk, which in Duluth is doled out not in
cartons but in single-serving plastic bags with straws.
 &HT;    At one cafeteria table, set together in close quarters amid the
commotion: several boys, two girls, a milk bag. One of the boys
picks up the milk bag. He shapes it into a recognizable replica of
manly genitalia, including scrotum.
 &HT;    The boy announces his achievement to everyone within earshot,
which includes the girls at his table, and points out that the
genitalia he has sculptured is fully tumescent. (The boy's exact
choice of words will not be printed here, but fits into what would
probably qualify as ``age appropriate'' disgusting language for a
modern American sixth grader, which is to say: REALLY disgusting
language.)
 &HT;    The boy and his friends, brandishing the tumescent milk bag,
fall about in general hilarity. The bell rings; lunch period comes
to a close.
 &HT;    Sometime in the course of the next few days, the girls _ like
the boys, these are sixth graders, 12 years old _ appear at the
school vice principal's office to make a complaint. Do the girls
use the term ``sexual harassment''?
 &HT;    Possibly, for they have encountered these words in a
middle-school assembly and one or two contemporary novels assigned
at their grade level, but probably not. Maybe they use the word
``harassment,'' or maybe ``gross.''
 &HT;    In any case they understand that there is a Procedure, and the
vice principal, having paid close attention to the training she has
received, now sets the Procedure into motion: She pulls out a
harassment complaint form.
 &HT;     (Sexual harassment, sexual advances or other forms of
religious, racial or sexual harassment by any pupil, teacher,
administrator or other school personnel, which create an
intimidating, hostile or offensive environment, will not be
tolerated under any circumstances.) 
 &HT;    Do the girls want to fill out the form and sign it? They do. She
calls up the Duluth school system harassment specialist _ a job
title that a decade ago did not exist in the Duluth public schools
_ or, for that matter, in any other U.S. school system.
 &HT;    The specialist is a small, cheerful, 58-year-old former
special-education teacher named Judy Gillen. She works out of the
Duluth school administration headquarters, in a 6-by-10-foot
office-enclosure wedged into half a small room and decorated with
teddy bears, puppets, framed photographs of her grandchildren, a
Women's History Month poster and a big bright sign, affixed to the
front of a file cabinet, that reads: SEXUAL HARASSMENT _ IT'S
ILLEGAL.
 &HT;    There also are books, pamphlets, videotape guides and visual
aids for overhead projection. ``Sexual Harassment in Our School:
What Parents and Teachers Need to Know to Spot It and Stop It.''
``Girls and Boys Getting Along: Teaching Sexual Harassment
Prevention in the Elementary Classroom.'' ``The Hostile School
Bus.'' ``Sexual Harassment: Pay Attention!''
 &HT;    There are copies of a districtwide newsletter Gillen composes,
formerly Harassment News Notes until she changed the title, in a
flush of optimism, to Prevention News Notes. And there's an active
complaints folder, where the Milk-Bag Incident harassment form will
be parked while the middle-school vice principal, with Gillen
monitoring the situation from the downtown office, considers what
to do.
 &HT;    Until late April, when the words ``student-on-student sexual
harassment'' suddenly appeared on newspaper front pages, the
Milk-Bag Incident would have provoked pretty predictable responses
in most outsiders.
 &HT;    It would have made them say: Come ON; 12-year-old girls running
straight for the office because somebody OFFENDED them, vice
principal nodding soberly and handing over FORMS to fill out _ have
these people completely lost their bearings? Or, These are
children. They're SUPPOSED to conduct themselves from time to time
like hormonally overstimulated jerks.
 &HT;    Then, on May 24, in a case called Aurelia Davis vs. Monroe
County Board of Education, the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that any
school receiving federal money can face a sex-discrimination suit
for failing to intervene energetically enough when a student
complains of sexual harassment by another student.
 &HT;    The Davis case started as a lawsuit brought by the mother of a
Georgia schoolgirl who was in fifth grade when she began
experiencing what her family describes as prolonged sexual
harassment _ that was the label from the outset, sexual harassment,
even though the two children involved were 10 and 11 years old _ by
the boy who sat beside her in class.
 &HT;    At the center of the typically lengthy and complicated Supreme
Court opinions was a rather remarkable and contentious
back-and-forth between Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the
majority, and Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the minority.
 &HT;    O'Connor said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' could be a
deeply serious matter, affecting a child's ability to learn;
Kennedy said ``student-on-student sex harassment'' was in essence a
phrase that made no sense. O'Connor said school officials who
ignored protracted and serious harassment could be sued under Title
IX, the federal law prohibiting sex discrimination in educational
institutions; Kennedy said the U.S. Supreme Court had no business
poking around in matters of local school discipline.
 &HT;    ``After today,'' Kennedy wrote, ``Johnny will find that the
routine problems of adolescence are to be resolved by invoking a
federal right to demand assignment to a desk two rows away.''
 &HT;    Kennedy said ``sex harassment'' is a term that properly applies
to the behavior of adults, not to children ``who are just learning
to interact with their peers.'' He said one published harassment
manual advises that one student's saying ``You look nice'' to
another could be construed as sex harassment, depending on the tone
of voice and other variables.
 &HT;    Kennedy did not say, but suggested by the indignation in some of
his memorable prose, that he believes the banner of
``student-on-student sex harassment'' is being carried at the
present time in our legal and social history by meddling,
litigation-happy, overreaching hysterics placing impossible demands
upon schools that have their hands full teaching children how to
read and write.
 &HT;    Gillen is familiar with the manual Kennedy quoted so
disapprovingly. It's called ``Flirting or Hurting?'' and has sold
about 20,000 copies to U.S. schools since it was first published in
1994. Gillen uses elements of it when she conducts sex-harassment
workshops for middle- and high-school students. The line Kennedy
lifted is part of a chart used to inspire student argument about
possible differences between flirting and harassment.
 &HT;    Flirting, suggests the chart: ''You look nice.'' ``Like your
hair.'' ``Wink.'' ``Wave.'' Harassment, suggests the chart:
``'Ho.'' ``Grab own crotch.'' ''Pinch.'' ``Lip licking.'' And
maybe, depending on the tone of voice, the facial expression and
who else is around: ``You look nice.''
 &HT;    Kennedy may have a real problem with this. So may a great many
other thoughtful people, already working hard to understand the
boundary lines defining sexual harassment among adults. But Gillen
has no problem with it.
 &HT;    ``I mean, get real,'' says Gillen, who read every word of Davis
vs. Monroe County, including the long dissent, the afternoon the
decision was handed down. ``We need to teach responsibility, we who
work directly with kids, and shaping kids' behavior and kids'
lives. Because behavior is learned. We can't accept that kind of
behavior.''
 &HT;    Quite a few public schools are consulting harassment specialists
these days. They're supposed to, or somebody will have a problem
and nobody will know what to do about it and there'll be a
complaint and state or federal investigators and a lawsuit against
the school district and maybe an expensive settlement.
 &HT;    There were at least a dozen reported lower court lawsuits even
before the Davis ruling, with its announcement that
student-to-student Title IX suits may proceed if it can be shown
that school officials exhibited ``deliberate indifference'' to sex
harassment that took place on their watch. Now there will be many
more, as school officials scramble to figure out what ``deliberate
indifference'' means.
 &HT;    Often the specialist is an outside professional who comes in
with manuals and case studies in student harassment. It's unusual
for a school district to invent a wordy systemwide job title that
includes ``Harassment Curriculum,'' but Minnesota is particularly
aggressive in what is referred to by its adherents as ``gender
equity,'' and besides, as far as is publicly known, Duluth Public
Schools was the first district in the country to pay out a monetary
settlement in a student-to-student sex harassment case.
 &HT;    Gillen knows the pertinent narratives that float up from the

a young Wisconsin man who was recently awarded a $962,000
settlement from school officials. They were found by a jury to have
violated student's constitutional rights by failing to stop what

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The architecture of Dan Hinkley's garden on the Kitsap Peninsula
in Washington State is native, shaped by old Douglas firs and a
seeping bog.
 &HT;    But in the cultivated understory, he has convened plants from
all around the globe, reuniting the tribes of the botanical
diaspora. More than 50 kinds of arisaemas _ called
jack-in-the-pulpit in North America _ rocket from the soil, and
one, Arisaema nepenthoides, stands fully erect, a single cobralike
spathe beside a rotting stump crowned with ferns.
 &HT;    Thirty-five varieties of Solomon's seals, or polygonatums, from
China, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal and Sikkim unspiral from their early
growth, and dozens of types of hellebore have just passed their
prime.
 &HT;    Throughout the garden, hydrangeas and viburnums are beginning to
dispense their leaves; Stachyurus and Edgeworthia, winter-flowering
shrubs from Asia, are leafing out. On some loops of the garden
trail, where a Cardiocrinum giganteum thrusts its antediluvian
seedpod six feet into the air, you almost expect to see a dinosaur
wander past. Bud-break has stirred among an orderly chaos of
growth-forms.
 &HT;    The man behind this collection of plants is Daniel Hinkley, a
45-year-old native of northern Michigan who has come to be regarded
as one of the pre-eminent plant explorers in the world. Hinkley is
the co-owner and chief plantsman of Heronswood Nursery, started in
1987, which lies within the visual domain of the Olympic Mountains
across Puget Sound from Seattle.
 &HT;    Heronswood is Hinkley's personal garden, his trial garden and a
two-and-a-half-acre commercial nursery rolled in one. It's also
Hinkley's home, which he shares with his partner, Robert Jones, an
architect who is to the mailing list, the account books and the
commercial operations at Heronswood what Hinkley is to the plants.
 &HT;    Here are more than 9,500 plants sprung from seed gathered all
over the world. Most are numbered and listed in a loose-leaf binder
that Hinkley calls the Big Bang, a compilation of plants already
for sale and those that someday will be. The binder listing current
inventory is called the Grand Mal. To most gardeners, the plants on
these lists would be unfamiliar.
 &HT;    Instead of the classic Hosta ``Frances Williams,'' for instance,
there is Hosta kiyosumiensis, which Hinkley collected from Mount
Kiyosume in Japan's Chiba Prefecture in 1995. Instead of hybridized
Asiatic and Oriental lilies, there is Lilium nanum, collected by
Hinkley during a joint expedition to the Himalayas in 1995.
 &HT;    Instead of a Norway maple or a David Austin rose, there is Acer
rufinerve, a striped-bark maple he gathered in central Japan in
1997, and a rose of as yet undetermined species collected from an
altitude of 10,800 feet in China's Yunnan province in 1996.
 &HT;    From this garden each year also comes the Heronswood catalogue,
a major literary artifact in the world of gardening ephemera.
Printed solidly in small type, it begins with Hinkley's wry musings
on the imperfect art of running a mail-order nursery and ends 300
pages and some 2,500 plants later.
 &HT;    The catalogue is a saga of botanical excitement and a chronicle
of adjectival fatigue, the fate of a man driven to travel the world
searching for remarkable plants and then doomed to write a terse,
descriptive paragraph about one $6 or $8 clone after another,
beginning with Abies balsamea ``Nana'' in the ``Conifers'' section
and ending with the New Zealand sedge Uncinia unciniata, the final
plant in the section on grasses.
 &HT;    Though it advertises nowhere and admits visitors only by
appointment, Heronswood Nursery mailed 35,000 copies of the 1999
catalogue, and subscription requests are currently arriving at the
rate of 100 a week. At $8 for a two-year subscription, the
catalogue just pays for itself, unless you count the cost of
Hinkley's writing time, in which case it is grossly underpriced.
 &HT;    Subscribers pleasantly lost among Hinkley's paragraphs can be
forgiven for wondering whether the nursery exists to justify the
catalogue, or vice versa. Still, appealing to a newly adventurous
generation of gardeners, Heronswood was an almost instant success.
In 1993, the year after it incorporated, it had a gross income of
$220,000. In 1998, it was five times larger, $1,100,000.
 &HT;    These days, as Robert Jones says, he and Hinkley are trying to
choose their limits, trying to let Hinkley's interests, rather than
mere economic growth, continue to shape their offerings.
 &HT;    At Heronswood, mid-April is the peak of the spring
plant-shipping season. Overworked staff members try to meet the
florid expectations of gardeners by selling them plants that are
not only garden-worthy but that also carry, for many customers, an
echo of the exotic places where Hinkley has collected _ Nepal,
Sikkim, China, Japan, Korea, Tasmania, Mexico and Chile.
 &HT;    The nursery office, an attractive prairie farmhouse of sorts, is
surrounded by open shade-canopies sheltering tables crowded with
flats, each marked with a customer's name and shipping date.
 &HT;    Hinkley's Michigan drawl crackles over a walkie-talkie clipped
to a plant-packer's belt. Concealed somewhere in the woodland
garden, he is the ghost in this botanic machine, enjoying a 10-day
respite from a busy spring speaking schedule and preparing for a
collecting trip to Japan.
 &HT;    A path leads into the benign enveloping shade characteristic of
the Northwest woods. The light falling on the mounded garden beds
seems detached from its source, and what it illuminates has a
freshness that is an attribute of the early season and of the
vegetation itself. A hundred yards down the path, Hinkley works in
mottled shade helping a new crew member shovel steer manure from a
garden cart onto a planting site.
 &HT;    Hinkley speaks quietly, slowly, but there is a sense of haste
about him, the result of living in what he calls ``a perfect
madness of plants,'' a garden that needs to be brought into peak
condition within the next few weeks. ``At this point it feels like
it's moving day,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``But as long as I keep bringing new plants into trial, it's
always going to be like this. I get tired of one plant, or it's
just not doing for me, so I get rid of it and start over again. But
every time you do that you want to rejuvenate the soil, and to do
that you've got to move another plant.''
 &HT;    Hinkley kneels on the ground, chopping at the soil with a border
spade and looking up from time to time as he talks. He is direct
and delicate at the same time, handling plants with none of the
hesitation of the amateur gardener. He overflows with affection for
the garden he has made, and yet his criticism of each individual
plant-form _ a kind of veiled self-criticism in fact _ is
unsparing.
 &HT;    Hinkley is bearded and balding, and he wears wide suspenders
over a T-shirt from the J.C. Raulston Arboretum at North Carolina
State University. Raulston, who died at 56 in a car accident three
years ago, was one of Hinkley's mentors and a widely respected
emblem of intellectual and horticultural generosity.
 &HT;    Hinkley has dedicated his next book, ``The Explorer's Garden,''
which Timber Press will publish in the fall, to Raulston and to
Gerald Straley of the University of British Columbia, another
gardening mentor who died in his 50s.
 &HT;    ``J.C.'s everywhere in this garden,'' Hinkley said. ``Every day,
I could take out a plant that he gave me, and I would never run out
of plants. He knew, he sensed what a good plant was.''
 &HT;    To sense what a good plant is _ to recognize it in the wild and
then confirm it in his own garden _ is the essence of Hinkley's
work.
 &HT;    ``We have all this Lutheran guilt,'' he says. ``We all moved
west from the Midwest where we couldn't have winter gardens, and so
our gardens in Seattle and Portland and Vancouver are amazingly
timid as far as what our climate can actually do.'' But there is no
timidity in this garden.
 &HT;    What takes it beyond timidity isn't massed plantings or vibrant
color or expansive scale or even mere exoticism. It is Hinkley's
subtle reliance on the globally diverse forms of individual plants.
Each plant, grown well, reveals itself and reveals something too
about its neighbor.
 &HT;    What creeps grows next to what climbs. The fastigiate and the
pendulous conspire. Bark peels, thorns protrude, vines finger their
way across an arbor, and what unites it all, what makes these
plants garden-worthy, is the interest they bestow upon each other.
 &HT;    There are few explicit canons for deciding what makes a plant
garden-worthy, but one of them _ a base line below the realm of the
esthetic _ is lack of ecological invasiveness. Most gardeners are
familiar with species that tend to be invasive in the garden, such
as Ajuga reptans, sometimes called carpet bugle.
 &HT;    But what haunts Hinkley is the thought of plants that can break
loose from cultivation and run rampant across the landscape _
purple loosestrife, kudzu, tamarisk, honeysuckle. ``My greatest
concern,'' he says, ``is the introduction of a bad plant.''
 &HT;    Invasiveness is a hot issue, and it inspires a botanical
xenophobia, a fear that just because a plant is exotic _ i.e.,
non-native _ it's inevitably invasive or otherwise harmful to the
suite of native plants, changing the balance of nitrogen in the
soil, for instance, or causing the water table to dip below the
roots of native plants.
 &HT;    But in horticulture, as in agriculture, the distinction between
exotic and native has been blurred by the ancient, extensive
exchange of plants for their economic or ornamental value. Because
plant material _ seeds, cuttings, fruits _ moves as readily as
humans do, human plant collecting, like the invention of
agriculture, predates history itself.
 &HT;    Hinkley points out some of the plants he admires _ such as
Podophyllum delavayi, a May apple from Sichuan, which, he says,
``deserves to be worshiped'' _ and some of the plants he thinks
will become important to American gardeners in the years ahead, not
only among ``plant nerds,'' as he puts it, but also among gardeners
generally. He points out a group called the woodland lilies _
Smilacinas, Polygonatums, Uvularias, Disporums and Disporopsis.
 &HT;    But above all he points out Hepatica _ Hepatica acutiloba, an
American native and Hepatica maxima, which grows only on one island
in the Japan Sea, Hepatica in a single clone, in many clones, in
enough clones one day to sell.
 &HT;    To a casual visitor, these are perplexing plants, modest,
growing in low mounds with rather formal, old-fashioned leaves and
small flowers, not half as striking as the arisaemas and trilliums
that are rioting in the woodland.
 &HT;    But besides being a ``simply good'' plant, Hepatica maxima, for
one, is also very rare in cultivation, which makes its goodness no
longer simple. It goes about its business in a quiet corner of the
garden, reaffirming a strange premise of life itself, for being
there at all is part of its beauty.

 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The architecture of Dan Hinkley's garden on the Kitsap Peninsula
in Washington State is native, shaped by old Douglas firs and a
seeping bog.
 &HT;    But in the cultivated understory, he has convened plants from
all around the globe, reuniting the tribes of the botanical
diaspora. More than 50 kinds of arisaemas _ called
jack-in-the-pulpit in North America _ rocket from the soil, and
one, Arisaema nepenthoides, stands fully erect, a single cobralike
spathe beside a rotting stump crowned with ferns.
 &HT;    Thirty-five varieties of Solomon's seals, or polygonatums, from
China, Japan, Taiwan, Nepal and Sikkim unspiral from their early
growth, and dozens of types of hellebore have just passed their
prime.
 &HT;    Throughout the garden, hydrangeas and viburnums are beginning to
dispense their leaves; Stachyurus and Edgeworthia, winter-flowering
shrubs from Asia, are leafing out. On some loops of the garden
trail, where a Cardiocrinum giganteum thrusts its antediluvian
seedpod six feet into the air, you almost expect to see a dinosaur
wander past. Bud-break has stirred among an orderly chaos of
growth-forms.
 &HT;    The man behind this collection of plants is Daniel Hinkley, a
45-year-old native of northern Michigan who has come to be regarded
as one of the pre-eminent plant explorers in the world. Hinkley is
the co-owner and chief plantsman of Heronswood Nursery, started in
1987, which lies within the visual domain of the Olympic Mountains
across Puget Sound from Seattle.
 &HT;    Heronswood is Hinkley's personal garden, his trial garden and a
two-and-a-half-acre commercial nursery rolled in one. It's also
Hinkley's home, which he shares with his partner, Robert Jones, an
architect who is to the mailing list, the account books and the
commercial operations at Heronswood what Hinkley is to the plants.
 &HT;    Here are more than 9,500 plants sprung from seed gathered all
over the world. Most are numbered and listed in a loose-leaf binder
that Hinkley calls the Big Bang, a compilation of plants already
for sale and those that someday will be. The binder listing current
inventory is called the Grand Mal. To most gardeners, the plants on
these lists would be unfamiliar.
 &HT;    Instead of the classic Hosta ``Frances Williams,'' for instance,
there is Hosta kiyosumiensis, which Hinkley collected from Mount
Kiyosume in Japan's Chiba Prefecture in 1995. Instead of hybridized
Asiatic and Oriental lilies, there is Lilium nanum, collected by
Hinkley during a joint expedition to the Himalayas in 1995.
 &HT;    Instead of a Norway maple or aDavid Austin rose, there is Acer
rufinerve, a striped-bark maple he gathered in central Japan in
1997, and a rose of as yet undetermined species collected from an
altitude of 10,800 feet in China's Yunnan province in 1996.
 &HT;    From this garden each year also comes the Heronswood catalogue,
a major literary artifact in the world of gardening ephemera.
Printed solidly in small type, it begins with Hinkley's wry musings
on the imperfect art of running a mail-order nursery and ends 300

 &HT;    The catalogue is a saga of botanical excitement and a chronicle

<P>
   Q: I have a small concrete patio outside the sliding glass door
leading to my backyard. The slab is about 4 inches lower than the
door and indoor floor, and I would like to cover the concrete slab
with wood decking that will also raise the level of this patio so
that it is even with the bottom of the door opening. What is the
best way to do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buy pressure-treated 2x4s and fasten these to the concrete
patio with the wide (4 inch) side against the masonry as shown
here. You can fasten these sleepers down with a powder-actuated
nail gun that is made for fastening to masonry, or you can screw
the 2x4s to the concrete by first inserting lead anchors in the
masonry (after drilling holes first with a carbide masonry bit).
The sleepers should be spaced 16 inches apart. After they are down,
cover them with 2x6 decking, also made of pressure-treated lumber.
Fasten these to the sleepers with rust-resistant nails or screws.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every time we get a heavy rain we have a problem with water
seeping in where the sloping roof comes down against the back of
our brick chimney. A new roof was put on a few years ago and metal
flashing was installed in this joint, but the leak persists. We
tried caulking and applying roof cement, but this only helped for a
little while. We called in a new roofer, and he said that the job
was not done right because the original roofer did not build a
``chimney cricket'' behind the chimney. I don't know what a
``cricket'' is, but do you think this could be the problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: A brick chimney that comes up against a sloping or peaked
roof should have a cricket or saddle (both terms are used) built up
on top of the roof and in the space where the back of the chimney
meets the sloping roof. Shaped something like a miniature hip roof
that slopes to match the existing roof, it serves to shed snow and
water quickly and keeps dirt and debris from accumulating and
piling up behind the chimney. There should be flashing installed in
the joints where the cricket meets the roof and the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our apartment has old metal cabinets in the kitchen and these
cabinets are greasy and dirty looking. How can I clean the grease
and dirt off without harming the enameled finish?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can wash the dirt and grease off with any strong
household detergent or an all-purpose spray cleaner without fear of
damaging the enameled finish. Scrub with a soft brush or fine
kitchen abrasive pad, then rinse off with plenty of water.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a paneled front door made of wood and the panels have
developed several cracks, some of which go all the way through. We
tried filling the cracks with wood filler and paint, but these
repairs don't seem to last long. What can you recommend to repair
this door without replacing it entirely?
</P>
<P>
   A: It is almost impossible to effectively fill in or patch such
cracks in a thin wood panel. Your best bet is to cover the entire
panel with either reinforced fiberglass cloth (fiberglass and
resin), or by gluing a new panel of thin plywood right over the old
panel. In each case it will be necessary to remove all paint or
varnish first in order to get the glue or resin to bond properly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, is still smarting over President
Clinton's
</P>
<P>
   use of the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create the Grand
</P>
<P>
   Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southeastern Utah in
1996. So
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who is a member of the House Resources Committee and
chairs the
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands, has introduced
a bill
</P>
<P>
   to limit the president's power under the Antiquities Act.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's bill is called the `National Monument NEPA Compliance
Act`
</P>
<P>
   (H.R. 1487). NEPA stands for the National Environmental Policy
Act,
</P>
<P>
   which became law in 1969. On the surface, the bill simply
requires that
</P>
<P>
   any designation of a national monument must first comply with
NEPA. But
</P>
<P>
   it does much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also requires that any designated monument skip over
the
</P>
<P>
   environmental assessment required by NEPA and jump to the more
rigorous
</P>
<P>
   environmental impact statement (EIS). An environmental
assessment is an
</P>
<P>
   analysis to see if an EIS is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   H.R. 1487 demands more than NEPA. It requires formal hearings
during all
</P>
<P>
   phases of the development of the EIS, requires an additional six
months
</P>
<P>
   of public review on the draft EIS, then four more months of
public
</P>
<P>
   hearings on the final EIS.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Hansen's subcommittee on June 17, John
Leshy,
</P>
<P>
   solicitor of the Department of Interior, stated: `None of these
steps is
</P>
<P>
   currently required under NEPA or the NEPA regulations. Mandating
all
</P>
<P>
   these procedural barriers for every national monument
designation, no
</P>
<P>
   matter how small or how urgent, would be contrary to both
protective
</P>
<P>
   purposes of the Antiquities Act and the flexible approach of the
NEPA
</P>
<P>
   regulations. In addition, the bill would delay Antiquities Act
</P>
<P>
   protection still further by preventing the president from
designating a
</P>
<P>
   national monument for at least 30 days after the record of
decision [for
</P>
<P>
   the EIS) is approved.`
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Hansen wants to stall the designation of any new
national
</P>
<P>
   monuments. It's a misguided jab at Clinton -- and a colossal
waste of
</P>
<P>
   time and taxpayer dollars. If the bill were to pass in the House
and the
</P>
<P>
   Senate, it is likely that Clinton would veto it. Leshy told the
</P>
<P>
   subcommittee that if the bill is `presented to the president,
the
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior will recommend that he veto the bill.`
</P>
<P>
   Hansen introduced a bill (H.R. 1127) attacking the Antiquities
Act in
</P>
<P>
   the last session of Congress. It passed in the House, but never
got out
</P>
<P>
   of committee in the Senate. Hansen has an ax to grind -- against
the
</P>
<P>
   crown jewels of this nation's heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Antiquities Act, as Leshy pointed out, is one of this
nation's most
</P>
<P>
   successful environmental laws. Fourteen of the 17 presidents
since the
</P>
<P>
   act was passed have set aside over 100 national monuments, most
of which
</P>
<P>
   were subsequently endorsed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, started the move to preserve
historic,
</P>
<P>
   scientific and precious wilderness by naming Devils Tower (Wyo.)
the
</P>
<P>
   first national monument on Sept. 24, 1906. By the conclusion of
his
</P>
<P>
   presidential tenure, Roosevelt had designated 18 national
monuments,
</P>
<P>
   ending with the designation of Mount Olympus (Wash.) in 1909, a
few
</P>
<P>
   hours before he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those monuments, like Mount Olympus, later became
national
</P>
<P>
   parks. Some monuments became national historic sites (Ft.
Laramie,
</P>
<P>
   Wyo.), national historic parks (Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Md.)
or
</P>
<P>
   national battlefields (Big Hole Battlefield, Mont.).
</P>
<P>
   Utah is a shining example of the success of the Antiquities Act:
Zion
</P>
<P>
   National Park, Bryce Canyon National Park, Timpanogos Cave
National
</P>
<P>
   Monument, Capitol Reef National Park, Arches National Park,
Natural
</P>
<P>
   Bridges National Monument, and Cedar Breaks National Monument.
The
</P>
<P>
   communities surrounding these preserves understand their
commercial
</P>
<P>
   value, as well as their significance to the Americans and the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists come to Utah from every continent to spend time in
these
</P>
<P>
   special landscapes. Hansen would do well to remember his own
state's
</P>
<P>
   precious natural heritage that has been saved by presidential
</P>
<P>
   designation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has the power to cancel the designation of any
monument, and
</P>
<P>
   has done so. Congress can also withhold funding for the
management of a
</P>
<P>
   monument. Although Hansen may smart at Clinton's designation of
Grand
</P>
<P>
   Staircase-Escalante National Monument; truth is, Congress
expanded the
</P>
<P>
   boundaries of the monument, ratified the president's designation
and
</P>
<P>
   funded its management.
</P>
<P>
   Fran Hunt of the Wilderness Society points out that the Hansen
bill
</P>
<P>
   would interfere with the emergency powers of a president to act
swiftly
</P>
<P>
   to address an imminent threat to important historic or
wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the bill, Hunt commented, `It's an attack on what is
a very
</P>
<P>
   important tool in the conservation tool box.`
</P>
<P>
   Hunt noted that it's only recently that the environment has
become a
</P>
<P>
   partisan issue. Of the 14 presidents who set aside national
monuments,
</P>
<P>
   half were Republican. The three presidents who did not use the
</P>
<P>
   Antiquities Act were Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George
Bush -- all
</P>
<P>
   Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fair to say that it was during Reagan's
administration, with
</P>
<P>
   the appointment of James Watt as Secretary of the Interior, that
</P>
<P>
   environmental issues began to split Republicans from Democrats.
Sadly,
</P>
<P>
   the partisanship continues.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen's bill is an example of that partisanship. It seems
strange that
</P>
<P>
   a congressman from a state where so much beauty has been
protected by
</P>
<P>
   the Antiquities Act would blindly attack that act in the service
of
</P>
<P>
   manipulative and selfish politics.
</P>
<P>
   The American people won't buy it. This kind of
anti-environmental
</P>
<P>
   politics will be the downfall of the Republican goal to keep
control of
</P>
<P>
   Congress.

STUDY FINDS CONTINUED DECLINE IN NUMBER OF SEA OTTERS

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a disturbing trend, the population of
California sea otters continues to fall, raising fears that the
state's popular marine mammal will one day disappear from the rocky
coastline.
</P>
<P>
   The spring survey conducted by teams of scientists found 2,090
sea otters, indicating an overall decline of 1.14 percent from a
survey a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers had edged up to 2,377 in 1995, the highest since
reddish-brown furry marine mammal was designated an endangered
species in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists don't understand why the California sea otter is
declining in its home range from Point Conception in Santa Barbara
County to Half Moon Bay in San Mateo County. They suspect
infectious disease, water contaminants, entanglement or entrapment
in fishing gear, and starvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This continuing pattern of decline is of grave concern,
especially given our lack of understanding of the cause,'' said Jim
Estes, a marine biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey's
Biological Resources Division at the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted by the USGS, the California Department
of Fish and Game, the Monterey Bay Aquarium and experienced
volunteers. It focused on 375 miles of California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Infectious diseases, including parasitic worms and encephalitis,
have caused about 40 percent of deaths over time, a high rate when
compared to diseases in other wild species, Estes said. But
scientists don't believe that can be blamed completely for the
decline in otter population because the death rate from disease has
been constant since 1995, the year the numbers began falling.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does reproductive failure appear to be a factor in the
decline because the otter birth rate remains unchanged, Estes said.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest year for otters was in 1998, when animal rescue
teams found 213 otters dead or ill on beaches. Scientists cautioned
that the number of dead otters was probably higher because many
animals that die sink at sea and their carcasses are never found.
</P>
<P>
   The USGS National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wis., has
been examining the bodies with the help of the California
Department of Fish and Game and the University of California at
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, an informal survey by the same team of scientists
that conducted the spring survey found only 1,937 surviving otters.
</P>
<P>
   After that survey, Carl Benz, head of the Fish and Wildlife
Service's recovery team for the otter, said, ``More otters are
dying each year than are being born. If this trend continues, it's
entirely possible that this species may go extinct.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 100,000 sea otters left in the world with about
98,000 living in Alaskan and British Columbian waters and the
balance along the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By law, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is required to update
a recovery plan for the species. As yet, there is no new plan.
</P>
<P>
   In April, members of Fish and Wildlife's recovery team
recommended a list of studies that would cost $1.7 million per year
for five years to explore the causes of death.
</P>
<P>
   One study would investigate the ways in which otters are exposed
to acanthocephalan worms, which infest them and carry deadly
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Another would investigate possible otter drownings caused by
entanglement in the large-mesh gillnets used by fishermen.
Regulations require nets to be set in water deeper than 180 feet,
as a way to protect otters. But otters go into the deeper water,
too, and gillnet fishing is increasing in southern Monterey Bay,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the commercial fishing industries that catch live
fish for market are beginning to use more of the pots that have
funnel shaped interiors. The pots can trap curious otters that
venture inside.

 &HT;     AT THE SOURCE: Hot Mix: Braising greens emerge as the new 
 darlings of the field   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Five days a week, at several Bay Area farmers'
markets, Les Lamdeck dispenses opinion along with his greens.
Dressed in a tee shirt and unbuttoned work shirt, his long blond
hair poking out from his hat, the Sebastopol farmer stands behind
handsome wicker baskets filled with an extraordinary harvest.
Shoppers who pause to chat as they load up on his impeccable salad
mix or stir-fry greens soon find themselves listening to a gentle
pitch for organic farming or a diatribe against irradiated food.
Read my newsletter, urges the farmer, stuffing it into their bags.
<P>
   Lamdeck may not turn shoppers into activists, but &UR;  &LR; his stir-fry
greens, or ``braising greens,'' generate passionate testimonials.
``I feel so healthy after I eat these,'' gushed one Napa shopper,
loading the sturdy mixed greens into a plastic bag. Lamdeck says
another customer told him that eating his greens was a religious
experience.
</P>
<P>
   This Sonoma County organic farmer is by no means alone in mixing
and marketing braising greens. Many growers of delicate salad mixes
are &UR;  &LR; also making heartier blends suitable for cooking, which
typically include young leaves of chard, baby bok choy, mustards,
kale, spinach and arugula. Building on the success of their washed,
ready-to-eat salad greens, growers are nurturing an audience for
washed, ready-to-cook braising greens.
</P>
<P>
   Lamdeck's stir-fry mix departs from the ordinary in its
incredible variety. He and his partners try to grow 50 different
items at a time on their three plantable acres, and to include at
least half of them in each day's mix. Tender lettuces are reserved
for the salad mix, but the stir-fry blend may include anything else
on the farm: Russian red kale, frisee, lacinato kale, orach,
amaranth, lamb's quarters, chickweed, fennel tops, salad burnet,
cilantro flowers, mustard greens and flowers, chard, mizuna, bok
choy, tat-soi, beet greens, wild radish and more. Small wonder that
the cooked mix has a remarkably complex flavor, at once earthy,
nutty, sweet, bitter and peppery.
</P>
<P>
   Lamdeck's growing and harvesting methods differ from his
competitors', too. On an abandoned organic apple orchard on the
outskirts of Sebastopol, he and partners Efran and Roberto Guzman
have carved out several four-foot-wide beds. Neat rows of red and
green lettuces march across some beds, but other beds are a thick
jumble of greens and herbs.
</P>
<P>
   At harvest time, the Guzman cousins use paring knives and
half-bushel baskets and make a true ``field blend'' of stir-fry
greens, cutting whatever leaves are the appropriate size, with an
eye to variety. ``They blend as they go,'' Lamdeck says. ``There's
no formula.''
</P>
<P>
   As they gather the greens, they toss out any unedible weeds that
would easily pass by an eye. The mix &UR;  &LR; is then washed and spun dry
on the property, then packed in plastic-lined boxes for the next
day's trip to market. ``We don't cut it unless we know it's got a
home,'' Lamdeck says. Because the farm has no refrigeration, greens
that don't sell at one day's market go to homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   At larger farms, the braising mixes are more predictable, more
uniform. At Gourmet Veg-paq in Gilroy, where Susanna Pena sells the
salad and braising greens that her uncle farms on 600 acres, the
braising mix includes the same six greens year-round, nature
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Lamdeck likes to talk about ``wildcrafting'' mixes
_ foraging, by another name. To encourage a wilder environment on
the farm, he lets greens reseed in the stir-fry beds and looks
kindly on plant promiscuity. When the marjoram crossed with the
orange mint, he saw new possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something useful going on here,'' he says, leading a
visitor through a patch of bolting greens. He points to a leafy
newcomer, the chance offspring, he believes, of cross-pollinating
Chinese cabbage and Red Russian kale. The grayish leaves have a
mild cabbage flavor and are crisp and delicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making new plants,'' Lamdeck says, ``new things for the
salad. We're sending hybrids back to where they came from.'' (Seeds
collected from a hybrid don't reproduce the hybrid; instead, they
revert to an unpredictable relative.)
</P>
<P>
   Lamdeck's stir-fry mix, like others, packs many more nutrients
than a typical leaf-lettuce salad. Plants such as kale, mustard,
beet greens, chard and spinach are high in vitamins A and C,
calcium, iron, folacin and beta carotene.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens,'' Paula Wolfert
tells a Turkish folk tale about the king whose skinny kids don't
look nearly as healthy as the villagers' children. When one peasant
woman tells the king she feeds her children only greens and herbs,
he arranges a 40-day food exchange. Her children get sick on the
rich palace fare; his children become healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition aside, a stir-fry or braising mix _ which many Bay
Area markets now carry _ has the appeal of ease and convenience.
``It tends to be something you can pretty quickly build a meal
around,'' says Craig McKown, produce manager for the San Francisco
Whole Foods market. ``You get your rice going,'' he says, ``then
you saute some chicken or tofu, throw in some seasonings and
stir-fry greens, and you have a complete meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Given how easy the greens are to prepare _ they need no trimming
and take less than 5 minutes to cook _ it's perhaps suprising that
sales aren't stronger. Suppliers, distributors and produce managers
say they sell 100 pounds of bulk salad greens for each pound of
braising greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who know about it, it's quite popular,'' says McKown
of the Stone Free Farm organic braising mix his store carries.
``The problem is, people either mistake it for another kind of
salad mix, or they don't know about it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What a loss. Stir-fried with garlic and pine nuts, tossed with
pasta, added to a bean soup or a frittata, or wilted in the heat of
spicy seared beef, these flavor-packed mixed greens are a produce
innovation worth applauding. The accompanying recipes put them
center stage.

   &QL; 
 &UR; Differences Among Braising Mixes &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
No two packers' braising mixes are alike and nomenclature has yet
to be standardized, but in general a braising mix includes sturdy
greens such as kale that are fairly mature. They require blanching
in boiling water or moist-heat cooking to tenderize them.
</P>
<P>
   Stir-fry mixes such as Les Lamdeck's tend to include more
delicate or younger greens that are too pungent to eat raw but will
wilt quickly in a hot, oiled skillet or wok.
</P>
<P>
   Some markets also carry something called ``Asian mix'' that
includes tender but spicy greens such as baby mustard and tat-soi;
the mix is a great choice for warm salads.
</P>
<P>
   By sight, touch and taste, you can decide whether the mix you
have bought needs to be boiled or whether it is tender enough for
quick steaming, stir-frying or merely wilting from the retained
heat of grilled meats or fish.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Other Ideas for Braising Greens &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At Stone Free Farm in Watsonville, Stuart Dickson grows greens
for a braising mix sold at Whole Foods Markets and local farmers'
markets. His year-round mix includes lacinato kale; Russian red
kale; baby bok choy; red, green and rainbow chard; tops from three
or four kinds of beets; and sometimes tat-soi.
</P>
<P>
   Among his favorite uses:
</P>
<P>
   Cut greens into narrow ribbons, then saute in olive oil with
garlic and toss with pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Cut greens into narrow ribbons. Soften sliced red onion in olive
oil. Add greens and wilt slightly, then add lemon juice and feta
cheese and serve as a warm salad.
</P>
<P>
   Rough-chop greens and stir into miso soup or vegetable bean
soup. Cook until greens are tender.
</P>
<P>
   Top a pizza dough with tomato sauce, sliced roasted potatoes,
cooked greens and cheese, then bake.

   ORECCHIETTE WITH GREENS AND RICOTTA SALATA
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds mixed braising greens
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 pound orecchiette pasta
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces ricotta salata cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add
the greens and boil until they are tender. Drain and cool under
cold running water, then drain again. Squeeze the greens dry
between your hands, then them chop medium-fine.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the pot with salted water again and bring to a boil over
high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the 1/3 cup olive oil in a large skillet over
moderate heat. Add the garlic and the hot pepper flakes and saute
until the garlic is fragrant and lightly colored. Add the greens,
season with salt and stir to coat with seasonings. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Add the pasta to the boiling water and boil until slightly
underdone. Drain the pasta, reserving about 1 cup of the cooking
water. Return the pasta to the warm pot. Add the greens and a
little of the cooking water to moisten the pasta. Cook over
moderate heat, stirring constantly, until the pasta is al dente,
about 2 minutes, adding more water if needed to keep the dish
moist.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the remaining 1
tablespoon olive oil. Grate the cheese over the pasta, toss again,
then taste and adjust seasoning. Serve immediately in warm bowls.

 &LR; SPICY SEARED BEEF ON STIR-FRY GREENS
</P>
<P>
   Note: Choose tender, young Asian stir-fry greens that will wilt
slightly when tossed with the hot beef. Avoid the sturdier braising
greens mixes that require cooking. If you can't find Asian stir-fry
greens, use a mixture of baby spinach and watercress.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound well-trimmed sirloin or London broil
</P>
<P>
   For the Marinade:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Thai or Vietnamese fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Chinese or Japanese sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Several grinds of black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely minced lemongrass
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Vietnamese or Chinese chile paste
</P>
<P>
   For the Dressing:
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons lime juice
</P>
<P>
   1 large shallot, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 serrano chile, halved, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   For the finished dish:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound mixed Asian greens (such as baby mustard and tat-soi)
or young stir-fry greens
</P>
<P>
   2 dozen fresh mint leaves, torn in half
</P>
<P>
   1/2 red onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Freeze the meat for about 30 minutes to make it easier to slice.
Slice the meat very thinly into strips about 2 inches long and 1
inch wide. In a large bowl, combine the meat with the marinade
ingredients and toss to coat evenly. Let stand 30 minutes at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, whisk together the dressing ingredients. Let
stand 30 minutes to allow shallot flavor to mellow.
</P>
<P>
   Just before you are ready to cook the meat, put the stir-fry
greens, the mint and the onion in a large serving bowl. Add the
dressing and toss.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a 12-inch frying pan over high heat. When the pan is very
hot, add the 1 tablespoon peanut oil and swirl to coat the pan.
When the oil is very hot, add the meat. Stir-fry until the meat has
lost most of its red color, 30 to 45 seconds; the meat should still
be quite rare.
</P>
<P>
   Add the meat to the bowl with the greens and toss. Season to
taste with salt and pepper.

 Panel Prefers the Pucker Of Mrs. Fanning's Pickles 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Bread-and-butter pickles are a popular summertime
phenomenon. The sweet slices work well on burgers, and are just as
great for straight nibbling or relish trays. Those with gardens and
plenty of time put up their own pickles. The rest of us rely on
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six different bread-and-butter pickles, two
from the refrigerator section and four off the shelf. Prices
differed dramatically, from $1.99 to $4.49.
</P>
<P>
   While the panel picked an overwhelming favorite, they also
agreed that pickles are personal. Some liked brands with more acid;
others liked more spice.
</P>
<P>
   But far and away, the panel chose Mrs. Fanning's (12 ounces,
$1.99 at Andronico's) as the best. Three of the panelists
particularly liked the spice level. One panelist described it as a
``full-flavored pickle.'' All would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to Cascadian Farms (22 ounces, $3.99 at
Andronico's). Two panelists thought it was so acidic that it would
overpower many foods, but another described the flavor as clean.
Two panelists liked the crunchy texture. Three would buy it; two
might.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbies (33 ounces, $3.19-$4.49 at many supermarkets in the
refrigerator section) came in third. Four panelists thought it
tasted watery and lacked the intense flavor of other brands.
Another panelist liked the flavor but found the texture too soft.
Two might buy it, three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to Safeway (22 ounces, $2.79). Two panelists
described it as ``not very exciting'' and two others thought it was
harsh and acidic. But one dissenter liked the bold flavors and
described it as classic. One would buy it, four would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two brands scored too low to rate: Vlasic and Claussen. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna
Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland
Passot chef-owner, La Folie in San Francisco and Left Bank in
Larkspur and Menlo Park, and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.

EDITORS NOTE: Here is a recipe to make on the weekend, with enough
leftovers to use throughout the week in two other recipes plus
suggested ideas for other dishes. Recipes follow, plus suggestions
in optional trim.    THE WEEKEND COOK: Globe-Trotting Meatballs Put Variety in Your 
 Life 
 &HT;    
 &HT;     By Maria Cianci 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; They may call pork ``the other white meat,'' but I
think of it as the versatile meat. From flavoring agent to
center-of-the plate entree, fresh and in all its cured forms, pork
gives the cook more culinary options than any other meat in the
larder.
<P>
   Underutilized _ but not to be underestimated _ is ground pork,
which imparts deep flavor to sauces, meat loaves, dumplings and
more. Take that ground pork and form it into meatballs large and
small and you have the foundation for a passel of week-long dishes.
</P>

   MASTER RECIPE: 3 PORK MEATBALLS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 pounds ground pork
</P>
<P>
   2 large onions, finely minced
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs, well beaten
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups fresh breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon crumbled dried sage
</P>
<P>
   Pinch nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon dark brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon ketchup
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cider vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 ounce fresh ginger, peeled and minced to a puree
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced to a puree
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Asian sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Combine the pork, onions, eggs, salt and pepper in a large bowl.
Mix well. Add the breadcrumbs. Mix well. Divide the pork mixture
evenly among 3 bowls.
</P>
<P>
   To one bowl, add the lemon zest, sage and nutmeg; mix well. This
mixture is for the Swedish-style meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   To the second bowl, add the sugar, ketchup, vinegar,
Worcestershire and cayenne; mix well. This is for the
barbecue-style meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   To the third bowl, add the ginger, garlic, soy sauce and sesame
oil; mix well. This is for the Asian-style meatballs.
</P>
<P>
   Cover all three bowls and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up
to 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Shaping the Meatballs.  &LR; Swedish-style mixture: form into about
24 11/2-ounce rounds about the size of a golf ball. Barbecue-style:
form into about 42 1/2-ounce balls. Asian-style: form into about 30
1-ounce balls.
</P>
<P>
   The meatballs may be refrigerated for a day or frozen for up to
3 weeks. To freeze the meatballs, place them on a baking tray in
the freezer until they are hard, then transfer to freezer
containers. Defrost before using.
</P>
<P>
   Yields about 96 meatballs.

 &UR; More Ideas for Meatballs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Pork meatballs may be frozen or refrigerated for many uses,
including:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barley Pork Ball Soup. &LR;  Saute onions, carrots and celery in a
little oil until wilted. Add quick-cooking barley and chicken
broth; simmer until the barley is tender. Add Swedish-style or
barbecue-style meatballs and simmer until they are cooked through.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cole Slaw Meatball Sandwich. &LR;  Grill or saute barbecue-style
pork balls; brush with barbecue sauce. Brush a soft roll with
mustard, pile the meatballs inside and top with cole slaw.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pork Balls with Lemon-Caper Sauce. &LR;  Saute Swedish-style pork
balls, then add a little chicken broth, cover and simmer until they
are just cooked through. Add lemon juice, capers and pepper to
taste. Pour the very thin sauce over the meatballs. Serve with rice
or noodles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pork Ball Hors d'Oeuvre. &LR;  Saute or grill Asian-style pork
balls. Serve with a dip of wasabi and soy sauce, teriyaki sauce and
scallions or sweet-sour Thai fish sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bean Balls. &LR;  Saute Swedish-style meatballs until they are
browned; set aside. Saute thinly sliced onions and garlic until the
onions are caramelized. Deglaze the pan with chicken broth, season
with cumin. Add the meatballs, cover and simmer until they are just
cooked through. Add canned, drained chickpeas and simmer briefly.
Stir in chopped parsley. The mixture should be slightly soupy.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; I love the interaction between sweet and salty
that's inherent in Mexican wedding cookies, regardless of the
recipe. However Elizabeth Falkner, owner of Citizen Cake, produces
the best.
<P>
   It's amazing that with only seven ingredients she can create a
recipe that's superior to the rest. But then again, Falkner has a
way of one-upping other pastry chefs.
</P>
<P>
   An artist by nature, Falkner gained fame for her creations at
Rubicon before going out on her own at Citizen Cake, a charming
cafe/ bakery located South of Market.
</P>
<P>
   She uses chocolate shards and geometric shapes to make her cakes
distinctive, and just about all her desserts have twist, such a
creme brulee flavored with rose petals. The Mexican wedding cookies
are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Citizen Cake, 82 14th St. (between Folsom and Harrison), San &LR; 
 &LR; Francisco; (415) 861-2228. Open 8 a.m.-6 p.m. Tuesday-Saturday, &LR;

   &UR; Two kinds of sugar. &LR;  The walnut-sized balls are first rolled in
granulated sugar before being coated in powdered sugar. This helps
to prevent the outside from getting gooey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Short baking time. &LR;  The cookies bake for just 10 to 12 minutes,
producing a moist although still dense interior.

 &LR; CITIZEN CAKE'S MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you don't want to bake these all at once, you can
refrigerate a portion of the dough, well-wrapped, for up to 2 weeks
or freeze for up to 2 months. Microwave the refrigerated or frozen
dough for 20 seconds to make it easier to shape.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup unsalted butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   2 cups powdered sugar, sifted, + extra for rolling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   11/2 teaspoons water
</P>
<P>
   3 cups flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pecans, toasted and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Cream together the butter and the powdered sugar in the bowl of
an electric mixer. Add the vanilla and the water and continue to
mix on low speed until well combined.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour, the salt and the toasted pecans in a separate
bowl. Add this to the butter-sugar mixture and continue to mix on
low speed until dry and crumbly.
</P>
<P>
   Shape the dough into walnut-sized balls. Roll the balls first in
the 1/2 cup granulated sugar, then in the extra powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Bake the cookies for 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer them to a wire
rack and once cool, roll them once again in some powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 5 dozen cookies.

   SACRAMENTO-PAVILION (Sacramento, Calif.) _ What could be more

WILL THIS COMMITTEE SCORE ANY POINTS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Wise Men have convened and now they have all gone
home. They gathered at 9 and broke up at 3. They talked about their
game and what could be done to brighten it up. In order to maximize
their time, they had your basic working lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was the state of the NBA, which is beset with low
scores, sagging TV ratings, and unspeakably ugly games that bear
scant resemblance to the Boston-Los Angeles confrontations of the
not-too-distant past, let alone anything Wilt and Russ ever knew.
</P>
<P>
   The very existence of a 16-man Special Committee comprising
owners, general managers, coaches, players, broadcast personnel,
and a college coach (Mike Krzyzewski) speaks to nothing less than a
crisis, right?
</P>
<P>
   `` `Crisis' is too strong a word,'' maintained deputy
commissioner Russ Granik. ``There was simply a mandate from the
Board of Governors to make some improvements. We all recognize
there are problems we need to address.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a `concern,' not a crisis,'' echoed senior vice president
of basketball operations Rod Thorn. ``Scoring is down. Shooting
percentages are down, and they've been going down for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   So all right, already. What did they come up with?
</P>
<P>
   ``There were four main areas of agreement,'' said Thorn, who
went on to explain what those areas were:
</P>
<P>
   1. ``How the game is officiated, particularly from the
standpoint of contact. There is too much grabbing, holding, and
impeding of progress. We're taking a close look at that.''
</P>
<P>
   2. ``The illegal-defense guidelines. We need to make them more
understandable to both our players and our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   3. The need for some kind of five-second rule inside the foul
lane to prevent people from backing down and backing down. (Hearing
this, someone said, ``Has Charles Barkley announced his retirement
yet?'')
</P>
<P>
   4. ``A 14-second rule. The idea is that when a violation (such
as kicking the basketball) or a common foul occurs, the clock will
either remain at face value, if there are more than 14 seconds left
on the 24, or reset to 14 if there is less than 14.''
</P>
<P>
   Trapezoid lane? Nope. Get rid of the 3-point shot? Nope. Allow
any old defense? Nope. Changing the 24-second clock, be it up or
down? Nope. All were discussed and all were pretty thoroughly
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken was just what specific changes would be made to
the current illegal-defense rule, which was written prior to the
1982-83 season and has been tinkered with three times. What
everyone did agree on was that the rule is part of the problem,
because, as written, it invites offenses to play two-man basketball
with three men standing around chatting with Spike Lee or Jack
Nicholson. In addition, with three men already halfway back on
defense, fast-break basketball is discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hope is if we come up with the right combination
of things that allow more movement away from the ball and changing
the defensive guidelines,'' said Granik, ``teams won't have quite
the same incentive on every play to throw it into the post.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals will be put on paper and then sent to the
committee members over the next three weeks. The Board of Governors
will then act. The new proposals will be tried out for the first
time at a summer league scheduled to take place in Atlanta next
month. They also will be looked at in other summer leagues,
including one in Boston. If any adjustments are deemed necessary,
they will take place during the exhibition season. With these dress
rehearsals taking care of business, the 1999-2000 season will begin
and we will see the return of the 125-117 game.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. We'll still need someone to put the ball in the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   No one can make a judgment until we see just what they do with
the illegal-defense rule. But we do know from past experience that
referees will do what they're told. If the league wants a closely
called game, we will get one. If the league wants a let-'em-play
game, that's what we'll have. Some referees will always be better
than others, but the referees can adapt to anything, more so,
usually, than the players.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that a very persuasive tool employed by Thorn was a
video he had made demonstrating the game's slow evolution from the
smoother-flowing game of years gone by to the current mud-wrestling
affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video started in the '70s,'' Thorn explained. ``You could
see through each five- or six-year period some slight changes.
There were a lot of savvy people in the room. They knew what was
going on. They weren't shocked. But the video sort of defined the
situation. You could see, for example, that cutters cannot run
freely today, nor can guys come off picks without circling. That's
what we need to clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering what the fuss is all about should understand
that, with the exception of the team the nutty professor Paul
Westhead put on the floor nine years ago, the last teams to take
100 shots a game were the '72-73 Celtics, 76ers, and Rockets.
Further understand that the first team in the post-24 second era to
take fewer than 80 shots a game was the 1990-91 Jazz. Now everyone
attempts fewer than 80 shots a game. We are deep into an ice age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about scoring 100 points,'' Thorn declared.
``That's not the only issue. It's how the game looks. If more
points are what you want, increase the size of the basket and go
with 15-minute periods.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a whole lot of inside basketball and, however
well-intentioned, it can't get at such core problems as the
deteriorating skills of the players and the viselike grip of the
coaches, one of whom, Pat Riley, has been very influential in
changing the game from a thing of beauty to a Tough Man
competition. And he's on the committee!
</P>
<P>
   Here is the problem. No matter what they legislate, the coaches
will do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to expect that a coach will do whatever he thinks
gives him the best chance to win,'' said Granik. ``Nobody felt
we're going to get anywhere by saying to the coaches, `We'd like
you to coach this way or we'd like you to do this.' You have to
change the rules or the officiating in a way that changes the
incentives for coaches to do certain things.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a league-backed $100,000 bonus to the first coach
whose team scores 130 next year? That's got as much chance of
working as anything I heard Tuesday.

HISTORY IS ON ALLAN HOUSTON'S SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Spurs probably don't want to know the details of
this story. At least not now. This is not the time for them to
learn about the dazzling and dangerous tale of Allan Houston. If
they learn too much about this man, whose history is equal parts
basketball and magic, the Spurs might start believing that Houston
was put here specifically to yank the NBA title from them. They
just might be right, too.
</P>
<P>
   What they don't know about the 6-foot-6-inch Knicks guard is
good enough. If they were to find out, for example, when and where
he took his first steps, they might be so spooked that they would
forget they actually lead the best-of-seven championship series,
two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, this is a warning to Gregg Popovich, Tim Duncan, David
Robinson, and the rest of the basketball band from Texas. They
should be satisfied in knowing that Houston is capable of scoring
34 points, as he did in Game 2 Monday night. They should remember
to keep a hand in his face when he shoots. And when his jump shot,
one of the prettiest you've ever seen, is incapable of being
stopped, the Spurs should simply hope that the rest of the Knicks
are not blessed with Houston's secret. If they go any deeper into
the story than that, they could find trouble where Wade Houston
first experienced joy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1972, Wade was inside the gym of Ahrens Vocational
Technical High in Louisville. He was a coach there. In that gym, he
watched his young son walk for the first time. Think about that.
The first time Houston could walk anywhere, he walked on a
basketball court. And it wasn't just any court. It was located at
the intersection of First Street and a street named after a man
nicknamed ``The Greatest,'' Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Steve Kerr probably didn't know how deep his words were
when he spoke of Houston at Madison Square Garden. The Spurs guard
said he loved watching Houston shoot in Game 6 of the semifinals
against the Pacers. Kerr went on to say that Houston used to be a
more limited shooter with fewer dimensions to his game. Now, Kerr
said, there are no weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he is doing,'' Kerr said, ``is a natural evolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr traces the beginning of Houston's evolution to 1993, when
the guard was a rookie with the Pistons. But the timeline goes
further back than that. It begins with the upbringing of Wade
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it basically started with him not pressuring me to go
outside and say, ``Go shoot' and ``Do it this way; do it that way,'
'' Houston said of his father. ``He let me enjoy the game and
really didn't . . . I don't think he expected me to be a good
player until I got into my last couple years of high school. That
was when he just let me continue to play the game. He guided me.
That's the type of person he is. He gave me a lot of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston's father was born in a place called Alcoa, which is
about 15 miles south of Knoxville, Tenn. The locals know Alcoa
because it is the home of Alcoa Aluminum, where many people in Wade
Houston's family worked. But many NFL fans from the 1980s will
remember that Alcoa also used to sponsor a highlight-play segment
called ``Fantastic Finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, brings us back to Houston. Since taking those
steps on that court in Louisville, he has been around or a part of
fantastic finishes his entire life. His father was an assistant at
the University of Louisville when the team won the NCAA title in
1980. Houston considers many of those players big brothers. In his
sophomore year at the University of Tennessee, playing for his
father, Houston hit a shot that defeated Auburn at the buzzer.
After some rough moments, moments that led to the loss of some
friendships, he would do the same thing in the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between good and great in this league is two
things,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy was saying Tuesday.
``Consistency and who can do it late. That's what it comes down to.
Allan is doing it more consistently and he's doing it late in the
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Come now. Let's take a look at his portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Game 5, the final second of a first-round series against the
Heat: Houston makes a shot at the buzzer to win it. The ball rolls
tentatively on the rim, a deep breath away from falling in or out.
If it had fallen off, Van Gundy would have lost his job. It went in
and the coach is here, preparing for Game 4 of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Game 6, a third-round game the Knicks must win to avoid a return
trip to Indiana: Houston scores 32 points.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3, a game that puts the Spurs another step closer to a
sweep: Houston scores 34 points. One of his shots was a pull-up
3-pointer on a fast break.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of this is that people didn't think Houston could play
well in New York. He left the Pistons for the Knicks in July 1996.
Grant Hill immediately stopped speaking to him. Houston was married
in August and invited all of his former teammates to the wedding.
Only two _ Don Reid and Lindsey Hunter _ bothered to show up. He is
what many would call the anti-Knick. He's a nice man. He lives in a
mansion, on 4 acres of land in Connecticut, because he says it is
peaceful. He makes a point of looking interviewers in the eye,
something his father taught him and the rest of his teammates at
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had dinner with him when he first got to Detroit,'' said
Knicks assistant Brendan Malone, a former assistant with the
Pistons. ``He told me he internalizes everything. He once had a
problem with his stomach and didn't tell anybody.'' Malone said
Houston has a ``passive-aggressive'' personality, the kind of man
who would go to a party and ``head for the nearest wall and stand
around until he felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   He is more than comfortable now. He's hungry. As he said, ``The
first part of my position says `shooting.' '' He has learned to
demand the ball, early and late. None of this is good for the
Spurs. But really, shouldn't they have been suspicious long before
Game 3? Here they are, Texans in New York, being asked to stop a
New Yorker named Houston.

POLITICAL FALLOUT IS UNCERTAIN FROM GUN-CONTROL MISFIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost immediately after the House killed a
gun-control bill last week, Democrats proclaimed the vote would
help them retake the House in 2000. Some even chanted ``Six
Seats!'' on the House floor, refering to the net gain needed for
Democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few days' reflection, Representative Patrick
Kennedy, who led the ``Six Seats'' cry and is chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, cannot name a single
Republican who could be defeated because of his or her vote on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, no,'' Kennedy said in an interview. ``If they
vote the interest of their district, they won't'' lose because of
gun control. Instead, Kennedy believes Republicans could be
defeated because of a pattern of ``extreme'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   If last week's House votes demonstrated anything, however, it
was the volatility of the gun-control debate and the riskiness in
trying to predict how events will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still an open question of whether the gun issue will
help Democrats regain the House, the National Rifle Association
similarly might be overestimating its influence on many
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   And by next year, the gun debate could have its biggest impact
on the presidential election and on an issue that so far hasn't
even come before Congress: gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republican candidates are expected to oppose gun
registration. On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley
of New Jersey has called for registering handguns, while Vice
President Al Gore's spokesman couldn't say if Gore has addressed
the matter. President Clinton favors registration, but hasn't
introduced legislation because it has little chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the NRA strategy is to warn its members that the
Clinton administration and Democrats want to go much further than
last week's House proposals for background checks at gun shows. NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, according to the
organization's Web site, said Clinton wants to register every
firearm and ``put the name and address of every firearm owner into
government computers.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials are publicizing the threat of gun registration in
hopes of bringing in new members and millions of dollars of
contributions, which would pay for the organization's political
effort in the 2000 races.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can confidently predict elections that are more than
a year away. Just a month ago, many analysts said the school
shooting in Littleton, Colo., had created the political climate for
gun-control legislation. Then came Friday's House vote against a
bill that had been weakened from a Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a list on my desk of journalists who over the last
month have written the obituary of the National Rifle
Association,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ``One of the
enjoyable aspects of my job this week is to call all of those
reporters back and offer them a story that the NRA is alive and
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be a stretch for the NRA to say it can
significantly influence congressional elections. Most House members
voted in line with their constituencies last week to help ensure
that the issue doesn't hurt their reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 31 Democrats who accepted NRA contributions, 30 voted
with the organization by opposing an amendment offered by
Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the New York Democrat, that would
require three days for background checks of all purchasers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception was Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan,
an NRA member and former state trooper. A Stupak spokesman said the
congressman voted for the three-day period to allow equal time for
background checks for purchases at gun shows and guns stores.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the Democrats who voted against the main
gun-control measures come from conservative districts where hunting
is popular. As for Democrats who voted for stricter controls, many
come from urban areas or states where gun control is popular,
making them less vulnerable to NRA attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Handgun Control Inc. officials plan to
publicize the votes of those who oppose gun-control measures. ``I
don't think anybody who voted with us fears this will haunt them in
2000,'' Handgun Control spokeswoman Nancy Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Hwa called the NRA's campaign against gun registration a public
relations ploy. While acknowledging that gun registration is a top
goal for Handgun Control, she said ``registration is a long way
off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance that a House-Senate conference committee
could back the Senate version of the juvenile justice bill that
includes several gun-control provisions. But that is unlikely,
given that the committee will be controlled by Republicans who
mostly oppose such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next for gun control? That answer probably will be
determined in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Gore and Bradley, have both
spoken in favor of certain gun-control measures. Bradley has taken
the strongest position of any presidential candidate on gun
control, proposing a ``registration system for handguns,''
according to a June 17 press release.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Elizabeth Dole has gained publicity for supporting
some gun-control measures, such as child safety locks. But Dole has
not said whether she would back the three-day background checks.
Spokesman Ari Fleischer said Dole has not addressed gun
registration, but such an idea ``was going too far for Elizabeth
Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, meanwhile, has usually sided with
the NRA, although he is not a member. Bush has backed legislation
allowing Texans to carry concealed weapons. And on Friday he signed
a bill into law that prevents cities and other local governments in
Texas from suing gun manufacturers for the public costs from
gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's positions are unlikely to hurt him in the primaries, but
could become an issue in the general election.

THE WINNING IS IN THE PLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people retailing poker advice. Country
singer Kenny Rogers yawps about knowing when to hold/when to fold,
etc. etc. Ernest Hemingway stupidly advised: ``Never call; either
raise or throw down.'' But the most famous poker advice of this
century was put forward in 1957 by Herbert Yardley, a washed-up
cryptologist, one year before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Yardley's book, ``The Education of a Poker Player,'' proved to
be an unexpected sensation for its publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster,
which eventually called up 12 printings of the tome that Poker
magazine recently hailed as ``a true classic.'' Out of print for
several decades, ``Education'' has been just been reissued by
Orloff Press of Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The book is renowned not so much for the poker advice _ of which
more later _ but for the colorful stories Yardley spins about his
gaming education. Orphaned as a teenager and raised in the farm
town of Worthington, Ind., Yardley enjoyed what biographers call a
``checkered'' career.
</P>
<P>
   Gifted at mathematics and blessed with a photographic memory, he
became one of America's first code breakers, operating the State
Department's legendary ``Black Chamber,'' which broke Japan's
diplomatic code in 1921. Yardley won the Distinguished Service
Medal for his efforts, and a few years later, got fired. The
priggish secretary of state who disbanded the cryptography office,
Henry Stimson, later proclaimed: ``Gentlemen do not read each
other's mail.''
</P>
<P>
   A vengeful Yardley promptly published a tell-all memoir, ``The
American Black Chamber Secret Service,'' which sold well, was made
into a movie, and infuriated his former employers. Shortly
thereafter, he hied himself off to China, where he worked as a
freelance code breaker for Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang. While in
China, Yardley crossed paths with Boston Latin's own Theodore H.
White, and with New Yorker writer Emily Hahn. Yardley tucked many
tales of derring-do into his slender, 160-page book about poker.
</P>
<P>
   So what about the advice? Everything Yardley knows, he claims to
have learned at Monty's Place, a small-time Indiana saloon swept
out by Dummy, the village idiot, and guarded by Runt, the gigantic
bouncer. Yardley's mentor James Montgomery divides the poker world
into players and ``simpletons,'' the latter existing to enrich the
former. Under Monty's tutelage, Yardley quickly becomes a
successful player.
</P>
<P>
   Monty is smart, and has taken possession of much of the county's
``real goods,'' i.e., a wagon with two fresh horses, a farm, and
even a traveling circus show, from simpletons who show up at his
poker table. Monty doesn't drink when he plays. He makes sure that
the suckers sit to his right; they'll do the betting for him. Monty
doesn't stay in a five-card game with a low pair, meaning anything
below jacks.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Monty nor Yardley would ever be caught drawing to an
inside straight. In a nutshell, here is Yardley's poker philosophy:
Bet on the cards you have, not on the cards you hope to get. (Not a
bad life philosophy, come to think of it.) In poker parlance this
translates to: Never bet on the come. Yardley's Chinese translator
violates this cardinal rule in a dramatic showdown hand with a Nazi
spy in Chungking. To find out what happens, you'll have to buy the
book.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to apply Yardley's winning formula the other night in a
six-handed game. Where Yardley sparred with Nazi spies, or
hinterland sharpies like Salty the horse trader and Hairlip Slocum,
the banker's son, I played with Michael, two Davids, a Richard, and
a Joe. I quickly learned that Yardley's dicta, which I had
half-committed to memory, might indeed help me win. But they would
never help me have fun.
</P>
<P>
   In some games, for instance, Yardley would have you play only
one in five hands while you wait for key pairs or matchups. If
you're playing for the family farm, it makes sense to be patient.
But we were playing dollar limit, with three raises. I played
almost every hand, lost some money, and had a grand time. In
Yardley's book, I will always be: A perfect (but happy) simpleton.

legislation that it plans the biggest effort in its history to sway

NO MORE FREE LUNCH FOR ZOO'S SEA GULLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco Zoo officials think they've
finally found a way to stop the swarms of divebombing sea gulls
that have turned lunchtime into the plot of an Alfred Hitchcock
horror film.
</P>
<P>
   Put the humans in a cage.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the $14,000 enclosure that has covered the Plaza Cafe
since Saturday is more like an aviary _ a woven plastic barrier
that allows zoo guests to engage their own feeding habits without
having to share with another species.
</P>
<P>
   The gulls have been a problem at the zoo for years because
visitors have consistently ignored the small forest of ``Do Not
Feed the Birds'' signs that surround the basketball court-sized
dining area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids, once they've settled in with their French fries, will
start tossing them food,'' said John Aikin, the zoo's curator of
planning and design. ``When they turn their back, the gull will
grab everything on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In the flurry of confusion, visitors have from time to time been
nipped by a gull. And while the birds can bite hard, zoo officials
are not allowed to bite back.
</P>
<P>
   Protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, the nine species
of gulls that populate the area cannot be injured or harassed, only
deterred.
</P>
<P>
   Putting paying customers under a net was not the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, zoo officials tried to strike fear into the birds
by swinging a stuffed dead gull in effigy around the area, an
unappetizing proposition that didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   They also tried to frighten them off with rubber snakes, wooden
alligators with twirling arms and a gull ``alarm'' call over a zoo
loudspeaker. They led owls and other predators into the area to
scare away the birds. They set up concrete barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the gulls came back, leaving zoo spokesman Nancy Chan
impressed at the species' ability to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gulls know all of the feeding patterns in this place,''
Chan said. ``They know when the penguins eat, they know when the
sea lions eat and they know when the people eat.''
</P>
<P>
   With the changes, the Plaza Cafe resembles the fenced-in home
for the leaf monkeys who live a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   The black mesh netting is 12 feet high and covers the plaza's
food outlets and dining area. Visitors enter and exit through a
plastic curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, zoo officials concede that the only way to
permanently keep the birds away from the Plaza Cafe is for visitors
to stop feeding the birds.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Rockwood, the zoo's food service manager, said the gulls
are not always at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the guests here see the gulls as an annoyance. The other
half see it as an interactive exhibit, just another part of the
zoo,'' said Rockwood, who has witnessed frequent attacks.

DICICCO MAY STICK WITH WHAT GOT HIS TEAM WHERE IT IS

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Though he's talked about the need for more speed in
the lineup against the fleet Nigerians in Thursday's second World
Cup match, US women's soccer coach Tony DiCicco may end up fielding
the same 11 who blanked Denmark in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want your best athletes on the field against a team like
this,'' he said Tuesday. ``But we'll put Nigeria up on the board
tonight and look at the matchups and go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that DiCicco will go with the starters who've lost only
eight matches in the five years he's coached them, but won't
hesitate to move them around and go to the bench if he senses a
mismatch. That could mean the Cup debut of Natick-born Sara Whalen,
who is the fastest reserve and can attack from both the back line
and midfield.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a crowd
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who drew a record 78,972 at Giants Stadium (for a
$4 million gate), will be playing in another full stadium here. All
65,000 seats have been sold for the doubleheader (which also
includes Brazil-Italy) at Soldier Field, which also hosted the 1994
men's Cup opener.
</P>
<P>
   That means that US games alone will have already surpassed the
total attendance (112,000) for the 1995 tournament in Sweden with
as many as four matches still to play.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ticket sales have already passed 500,000 and will
easily eclipse the tournament record of 510,000 set in 1991 in
China, where most of the spectators were factory workers with free
tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have exceeded our greatest expectations,'' said organizing
committee president Marla Messing. ``There is no mistaking that a
World Cup is going on and America is coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   America is even coming out to watch the Nigerias play the North
Koreas. The six non-US doubleheaders for the rest of the first
round are averaging nearly 22,000, with more than 32,000 tickets
already sold for the June 26 matches in Chicago that have no local
ethnic draw (i.e. Ghana-Sweden/Norway-Japan).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No speedy conclusions
</P>
<P>
   Though roughly half the US team watched Nigeria beat North Korea
on TV at their suburban hotel Sunday night, they're reluctant to
draw any firm conclusions about the Super Falcons, whom they've
never played. ``It's tough to tell anything from television,
especially about speed,'' says Brandi Chastain. ``You may get on
the field and say, hey, this isn't at all what I expected. What you
see can be an illusion, because TV plays tricks.'' . . . After
switching Tuesday's scheduled practice at Benedictine University in
suburban Lisle from early evening to mid-afternoon, DiCicco ended
up scrubbing it entirely when thunderstorms swept through the area.
In the morning, the reserves visited disadvantaged children living
at the SOS Children's Village in Lockport.

PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Just kidding about the naked bungee jumping, she says.
The last time Briana Scurry half-jokingly told the world about her
celebration plans, she ended up streaking naked down a Georgia side
street with her Olympic gold medal around her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Illustrated called me at, like, eight in the morning
one day when I was half-asleep and asked me what I would do if we
won,'' the US women's soccer goalkeeper remembers. ``And I didn't
want to be like everybody else, so I said that.''
</P>
<P>
   So this time, Scurry is saying nothing. Anyway, it's not as if
the planet will stop spinning in shock if the Americans win the
World Cup next month. They're the best team in the tournament,
they're playing at home inside full stadia, and they have the
world's most dominant keeper in the 27-year-old University of
Massachusetts grad, who has posted 50 shutouts in 86 career
matches, most recently a 3-0 blanking of Denmark in last Saturday's
Cup opener at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the US is to reclaim the title it lost to Norway four
years ago, Scurry is going to have to loom large on her line. ``We
need a big World Cup from Briana Scurry,'' coach Tony DiCicco says
flatly. ``We're not going anywhere without her.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry has started three times as many matches as any other
American keeper, and since she took over the job in 1994, her
teammates have lost only eight times. Not that Scurry is
overworked, not on a squad that wins most of its matches by three
goals or more. ``Sometimes I'm like, OK, do something,'' she
concedes. ``Come at me with a ball _ anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the medals are in view, Scurry will be scrambling, and
she knows it. ``If I don't have a lot to do when we're playing
Norway and China, I'm surprised,'' says Scurry, who can ensure her
mates of a return ticket to Olympus if she shuts out the Nigerians
Thursday night at Soldier Field. ``I know it's going to be a
big-time game; I know I'm going to be battling.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it was at UMass, where Scurry allowed an average
of just half a goal a game and backstopped the Minutewomen to the
1993 NCAA Final Four. Even before she was voted the nation's best
keeper, her coach told Scurry she should look into the national
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Is there one?' '' she recalls. ``Isn't that horrible?
I did not know. I'm playing college soccer and I had no clue.
Totally oblivious. He said, `Well, they won the World Cup.' I'm
like, `Cool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry, who played her high school soccer in Minnesota, had been
oblivious about UMass before she was recruited. ``I thought it was
in Boston,'' she confesses. ``Everyone I told I said, `I'm going to
Boston.' Amherst is nowhere near Boston, of course, but it was
awesome. Whenever I see the basketball team on TV and see the
Mullins Center I'm like, `Awww.' I miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the national team alongside women such as Mia Hamm,
Michelle Akers, and Kristine Lilly, all of whom had been piling up
caps when Scurry was still playing for Anoka High, was nothing like
playing for UMass. It was harder _ and easier. ``I'd seen a lot of
shots at UMass, and now I would hardly see any,'' she says. ``I'd
think, I'm not earning my keep. I'm just standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the World Cup and the Olympics, where Scurry suddenly gets
all the action she can handle and one goal allowed can be too many.
The Norwegians put one past her in the 1995 semifinals, and it was
enough to send the Americans home. So nobody was taking anything
for granted in the Summer Games, which is why Scurry offered to run
to daylight if her teammates came up golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we beat the Chinese in the final, everyone asked me,
what are you going to do? When? Where?'' Scurry remembers. ``It was
one in the morning, mind you. I told them, `I said I was going to
run, but I didn't say you could watch.' They said, how will we
know? I said, `Don't worry, I've got it covered.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Scurry found a secluded spot in Athens, Ga., where the
stadium was, took her clothes off, put the medal on, and did a
point-to-point dash with her roommate rolling a video camera. ``We
brought the tape back to the team party, showed it to a couple of
people for verification, and that was it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What could Scurry do to top that? ``The Olympics were the be-all
and end-all for me,'' she says. ``As a youngster, I'd always wanted
to be in them. Now, I'd won a gold medal. So it was kind of an
anticlimactic depression thing for a few months. I was like, `OK,
now what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The next World Cup was still three years off. But Scurry
remained on her line, piling up the caps and shutouts, and as the
months went by she could feel her competitive fires getting stoked
anew. The tournament was here, after all, most of her teammates
were sticking around, and the Norwegians still had the trophy. ``We
have to win,'' Scurry told herself, ``because we didn't win in
1995.''
</P>
<P>
   So what can Scurry do for an encore, after the run to daylight?
Maybe a little black dress, stiletto heels, and bottle of champagne
in a quiet Pasadena restaurant. Or maybe not.

POLITICAL FALLOUT IS UNCERTAIN FROM GUN-CONTROL MISFIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Almost immediately after the House killed a
gun-control bill last week, Democrats proclaimed the vote would
help them retake the House in 2000. Some even chanted ``Six
Seats!'' on the House floor, refering to the net gain needed for
Democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   But after a few days' reflection, Representative Patrick
Kennedy, who led the ``Six Seats'' cry and is chairman of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, cannot name a single
Republican who could be defeated because of his or her vote on gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, no,'' Kennedy said in an interview. ``If they
vote the interest of their district, they won't'' lose because of
gun control. Instead, Kennedy believes Republicans could be
defeated because of a pattern of ``extreme'' votes.
</P>
<P>
   If last week's House votes demonstrated anything, however, it
was the volatility of the gun-control debate and the riskiness in
trying to predict how events will turn out.
</P>
<P>
   While it's still an open question of whether the gun issue will
help Democrats regain the House, the National Rifle Association
similarly might be overestimating its influence on many
congressional races.
</P>
<P>
   And by next year, the gun debate could have its biggest impact
on the presidential election and on an issue that so far hasn't
even come before Congress: gun registration.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republican candidates are expected to oppose gun
registration. On the Democratic side, former Senator Bill Bradley
of New Jersey has called for registering handguns, while Vice
President Al Gore's spokesman couldn't say if Gore has addressed
the matter. President Clinton favors registration, but hasn't
introduced legislation because it has little chance of passage.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the NRA strategy is to warn its members that the
Clinton administration and Democrats want to go much further than
last week's House proposals for background checks at gun shows. NRA
Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre, according to the
organization's Web site, said Clinton wants to register every
firearm and ``put the name and address of every firearm owner into
government computers.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA officials are publicizing the threat of gun registration in
hopes of bringing in new members and millions of dollars of
contributions, which would pay for the organization's political
effort in the 2000 races.
</P>
<P>
   But no one can confidently predict elections that are more than
a year away. Just a month ago, many analysts said the school
shooting in Littleton, Colo., had created the political climate for
gun-control legislation. Then came Friday's House vote against a
bill that had been weakened from a Senate measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a list on my desk of journalists who over the last
month have written the obituary of the National Rifle
Association,'' said NRA spokesman Bill Powers. ``One of the
enjoyable aspects of my job this week is to call all of those
reporters back and offer them a story that the NRA is alive and
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it may be a stretch for the NRA to say it can
significantly influence congressional elections. Most House members
voted in line with their constituencies last week to help ensure
that the issue doesn't hurt their reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 31 Democrats who accepted NRA contributions, 30 voted
with the organization by opposing an amendment offered by
Representative Carolyn McCarthy, the New York Democrat, that would
require three days for background checks of all purchasers at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception was Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan,
an NRA member and former state trooper. A Stupak spokesman said the
congressman voted for the three-day period to allow equal time for
background checks for purchases at gun shows and guns stores.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, most of the Democrats who voted against the main
gun-control measures come from conservative districts where hunting
is popular. As for Democrats who voted for stricter controls, many
come from urban areas or states where gun control is popular,
making them less vulnerable to NRA attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Handgun Control Inc. officials plan to
publicize the votes of those who oppose gun-control measures. ``I
don't think anybody who voted with us fears this will haunt them in
2000,'' Handgun Control spokeswoman Nancy Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Hwa called the NRA's campaign against gun registration a public
relations ploy. While acknowledging that gun registration is a top
goal for Handgun Control, she said ``registration is a long way
off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance that a House-Senate conference committee
could back the Senate version of the juvenile justice bill that
includes several gun-control provisions. But that is unlikely,
given that the committee will be controlled by Republicans who
mostly oppose such legislation.
</P>
<P>
   So what's next for gun control? That answer probably will be
determined in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democratic candidates, Gore and Bradley, have both
spoken in favor of certain gun-control measures. Bradley has taken
the strongest position of any presidential candidate on gun
control, proposing a ``registration system for handguns,''
according to a June 17 press release.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Elizabeth Dole has gained publicity for supporting
some gun-control measures, such as child safety locks. But Dole has
not said whether she would back the three-day background checks.
Spokesman Ari Fleischer said Dole has not addressed gun
registration, but such an idea ``was going too far for Elizabeth
Dole.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Governor George W. Bush, meanwhile, has usually sided with
the NRA, although he is not a member. Bush has backed legislation
allowing Texans to carry concealed weapons. And on Friday he signed
a bill into law that prevents cities and other local governments in
Texas from suing gun manufacturers for the public costs from
gun-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's positions are unlikely to hurt him in the primaries, but
could become an issue in the general election.

PAK IN MAJOR FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Se Ri Pak exploded on the women's golf scene
a year ago at the McDonald's LPGA Championship at DuPont CC here in
the Brandywine Valley. She was just 20 years old, fresh out of her
hometown of Daejeon midway between Seoul and Pusan on Korea's east
coast. She led wire-to-wire in her first major as a pro, becoming
the first since Liselotte Neumann to make a major her first
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   This was huge news in her homeland, where there are just about
150 golf courses and the game is considered elitist. So what did
Pak do for an encore? She went to the US Women's Open at Blackwolf
Run GC in Kohler, Wis., and defeated Jenny Chuasiriporn on the 20th
hole of a playoff to become the youngest to win that title.
</P>
<P>
   She competed in 27 tournaments in 1998, ran away with Player of
the Year honors, and signed a lucrative contract with the Samsung
Group. She also was awarded the Order of Merit by the South Korean
government, the highest honor for an athlete. She joined Meg Mallon
and Mickey Wright as the only players to win the LPGA Championship
and the US Women's Open in the same year _ and it was just six
years after her father taught her the game.
</P>
<P>
   Pak is back to defend in the LPGA Championship, which begins
Thursday, and she played her first 18 holes here since walking away
with the title after an intense final-round duel with England's
Lisa Hackney last year. Hackney, who actually seized a brief lead
before she bogeyed the 13th and Pak birdied the 15th and 16th,
finished three shots astern, tied with Donna Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Pak severed her relationship with swing guru David Ledbetter at
the start of the year and is still searching for the right
instructor. She had been struggling somewhat, but a win last Sunday
on Father's Day in Atlantic City, capping another wire-to-wire run,
was sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give the trophy to my father,'' she said. ``It
makes a good feeling to this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory elevated her to eighth on the LPGA money list and
put her in a proper frame of mind for this $1.4 million tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week my putting was good, and I hit driver and irons
well,'' said Pak. ``Everything felt perfect. Everything's getting
better and better each week. That win makes me have more
confidence. Good timing, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak said she is still learning the game, the same thing Tiger
Woods said at the US Open last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though this is my second year, I still feel like a
rookie,'' she said. ``It takes time. Many people say, `Why?' and
`What happened to her?' and `How long do we have to wait?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure comes partly from her native land, where she won 30
times as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, even right after I win, they want another win,
another trophy,'' she said. ``It's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the defending champ here doesn't put more pressure on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same,'' said Pak. ``It doesn't change anything. I don't need
to hurry. I am just 21. I have 10 or 15 more years to play. Maybe
more. No need to push myself. I don't want to be tired in two or
three years and not want to play golf anymore.''

NO SURE THINGS AWAIT BRUINS AT PICK NO. 21 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The predraft parade of prospects into the Bruins' interview area
at the club's hotel in Pittsburgh two summers ago proceeded along
pretty much as planned. The teenagers, one at a time, would meet
with the scouting staff, they'd answer question upon question about
hockey, their lifestyle, their personality, their hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   The scouts would size them up, rate them, then debate taking
them when Boston's turn came to choose. The Bruins, owners of that
No. 1 overall selection, had long declared their intentions to take
Joe Thornton. It was their No. 8 pick they were trolling for.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at them and they're all 6-3, 190 pounds,'' said
assistant general manager Mike O'Connell. ``They all look like Joe.
They all say, `I'm really going to be working out hard this
summer.' Then you look at the kid. He's chewing gum, he's got his
sandals on. They're fidgeting, they have pimply faces, they were
everything you expect in a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost all of them. When Sergei Samsonov walked into the
room, the scouts were speechless. They saw his broad shoulders and
stocky legs and in a split-second all of their fears about his
purported lack of size evaporated. They were sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was how he felt about his size,'' said Jeff Gorton,
O'Connell's top aide, on the reason they were swayed. ``The things
he would say. We'd say, `What do you think about everyone saying
you're too small to play in the league?' He said, `I will go
somewhere and play in the NHL. Don't worry about my size. If you're
worried about it, the next person who takes me won't be.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He just had an aura about himself. You knew he was going to
play in the league and size wasn't going to stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bruins didn't have a first-round pick because
they traded it to Colorado. Their first selection came late in the
second round, at No. 48. Again, size became an issue when they
interviewed defenseman Jonathan Girard, who is 5 feet 11 inches and
192 pounds. Once again, the Bruins challenged the player to see how
he felt about his prospects of facing bigger, stronger foes in the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm not too small to play,' '' said Gorton. ``He was
very confident. He knew he was going to play since he was a young
kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drafted him, he came down to the table and said, `I
didn't think you guys were going to take me. You said I was too
small.' But we really wanted to push him in the interview and say
it to him and see how he would react. We didn't want to hear,
`You're right, I am small, maybe I won't play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to push these guys on things you might think would
hold him back. When he left the interview, I bet he was agitated.
`Those Bruins aren't going to take me, they're worried about my
size. Well, I'll show them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Girard, who started the season in Boston before being returned
to his junior team in the Quebec League, is developing into one of
the Bruins' top prospects.
</P>
<P>
   So, what to make of this year, the first time the Bruins have
ever hosted the NHL draft? They are selecting at No. 21 and the
scouting staff believes they will definitely get a player at that
spot. But it has proven to be a crapshoot in the past. The last
time the Bruins picked at 21 was in 1995 when they took defenseman
Sean Brown, who was later dealt to Edmonton in the Bill Ranford
deal in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Bruins took goalie Evgeny Ryabchikov with the No.
21 pick and that certainly didn't pan out. In 1990, Boston picked
Bryan Smolinski at 21 and then dealt him to Pittsburgh in the
ill-fated Kevin Stevens multiplayer deal. The best pick at No. 21
most recently was in 1993 when Montreal got talented forward Saku
Koivu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard when you're picking 21st, you don't know who's
going to be there,'' said O'Connell. ``Picking 21st was the third
round like 20 years ago. We expect a player who's going to play for
us in the NHL. How effective he'll be, whether he's going to be a
goal scorer or a checker, or a stay at home defenseman or an
offensive defenseman or a goaltender, who knows? We're just
drafting potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these offensive defensemen in junior hockey all of a
sudden become great defensive defensemen because they can't put up
the numbers. Likewise with the forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say by the 15th pick, we'll have it narrowed down. The
draft will narrow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell and the scouting staff use the Central Scouting
rankings as a guideline, but the player it has at No. 21 might be
far down on the Bruins' list. O'Connell said the key to evaluating
talent is to go to the games. Director of scouting Scott Bradley
estimated he saw upwards of 140 games last year and said Quebec
scout Daniel Dore saw upwards of 160.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of seeing two games, you go to a third or fourth one
and stick it out,'' said O'Connell, who does a fair amount of
scouting during the season. ``That's where you get the emotion at
the (draft) table. Guys have seen him four times and maybe other
teams have only seen him twice. If you've seen him four times, then
you know. Sometimes you get the emotion at the table, a guy
fighting for him or saying you can't take him.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent pick who sparked all kinds of debate at the table was
goalie John Grahame, who was taken No. 229 overall with Boston's
seventh pick in 1994 and just led the Providence Bruins to the
Calder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said those who wanted Grahame have a bet with those in
the organization who didn't, and once Grahame makes it to the NHL,
they're going to have to ante up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a choice between two players, one a nongoalie,'' said
O'Connell. ``It got kind of humorous actually. I forget who the
other player was.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' said Bradley, ``we remember who the goalie was.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalie, forward, defenseman. The Bruins are hopeful they will be
able to grab a diamond in the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think right now the consensus around the league is that
there are definitely 12 players who will make it,'' said Bruins
president/general manager Harry Sinden. ``I would say that's deep.
If there are 12 who can play, then you've got yourself a decent
draft. We're 21st and my scouts tell me there are 20 good players
in the draft.''

SCHOOL BOARD REVERSES BAN ON POLICE FIREARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Board of Education voted late
Tuesday to rescind a policy to prohibit the police from carrying
guns onto school campuses, halting a measure that had pitted
officers and the mayor against education officials and community
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Following three hours of public testimony punctuated by
stomping, jeers and cheers, the board voted unanimously to drop the
ban, which would have required the police to disarm before stepping
onto school grounds during nonemergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The ban was an amendment to a broader resolution on safe
schools.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution, approved June 8, was upheld by a 4-3 vote. It
requires teachers to contact school administrators before calling
the police when problems erupt with students, unless the child
poses an immediate threat or has broken the law.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the gun ban amendment, introduced spontaneously by
board member Dan Kelly on June 8, that created the stir.
</P>
<P>
   As Kelly said Tuesday night, ``This issue has evoked a huge
amount of emotionality _ not just in San Francisco or in
California, but across the country and, I hear, as far away as
Great Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau and Mayor Willie Brown The policy
vehemently opposed the ban. Lau said he would not disarm his
officers and that the school board was not empowered to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only I can decide whether to arm or disarm my police
officers,'' Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was just before midnight Tuesday when board members
voted on the amendment and the resolution, more than 100 people
remained. About 600 people _ including city Supervisor Amos Brown
and at least a dozen police officers _ had showed up for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Board President Juanita Owens said she was out of town when the
vote was taken June 8 on the resolution and gun amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my name off this resolution. Frankly, I was embarrassed
that this board would suggest police take off their guns,'' Owens
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Brown told the board, ``I feel we have to get rid of
this climate that suggests all police personnel (are) bad. These
are not safe times and there are reports every day of our schools
becoming less safe. We ought to have police present to keep our
schools safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But one of a handful of parents who supported the resolution to
restrict police access to campuses was Anna Schul, who said her
daughter, a student at McAteer High, was taken into custody in
March and charged with felony weapons possession for carrying nail
clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school staff found nail clippers and called police for
something that should've been handled without having police come in
to arrest my daughter,'' Schul said.
</P>
<P>
   Such incidents are impossible to confirm. Until now, the school
district has not been required to keep track of when and why the
police are called to schools.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution that remains in effect will require the district
to publish quarterly campus police intervention statistics and
establish a review committee of parents, police officers, students
and school staff members to issue a status report to the board by
next spring.

INTERNET INVESTMENTS ENRICH N.J. PENSION FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brian Arena isn't a household name in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He should be. In fact, the Garden State ought to think about
naming one of the service areas on the New Jersey Turnpike for him,
putting him in the company of such luminaries as Vince Lombardi and
Grover Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, without any fanfare, Arena has made
nearly $900 million for New Jersey's state pension fund by shrewdly
investing in two Internet stocks _ CMGI and America Online. From
where we sit, that beats winning two Super Bowls or two
presidential elections any day of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, Arena performed this service on a state employee's
salary. He follows technology and small cap stocks for the New
Jersey Division of Investment. He didn't tell us how much he makes,
but you can bet it's a lot less than they pay on Wall Street. ``We
are all underpaid,'' joked his boss Steven Kornrumpf, the
division's director.
</P>
<P>
   Arena, who is 38, has a technical background. He was a systems
analyst for the state before he became a money manager. Well ahead
of the rest of us, he got interested in the Internet. ``I saw the
potential in that area,'' said Arena, in a nice bit of
understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1994, he put some of New Jersey's pension money
into AOL, then a small, relatively unknown company. Kornrumpf
estimates the investment division eventually bought about $30
million worth of the stock. As of this week, the pension fund held
4.7 million AOL shares worth about $540 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arena also got interested in CMGI early on. The Andover, Mass.
company today is considered one of the top Internet players, thanks
to its investments in dozens of startups. When Arena invested in
the company in 1996, however, ``it was a collection of assets that
were not very well developed.'' Arena knew that CMGI had created an
early version of an Internet browser that was sold to AOL. He also
had a sense that Wall Street didn't fully appreciate the value of
CMGI's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in ``Wayne's World,'' ``Good call.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's original $18 million investment in CMGI is now
worth about $350 million. That doesn't count the $48 million in
profits the pension fund has booked by selling CMGI shares. ``If
the stock went to zero tomorrow, we would already have a recorded a
big gain,'' said Kornrumpf. CMGI is a long way from zero. It closed
Tuesday at 94 15/16, down 8 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's success does not come as a shock to those in the
investment community. ``Their pension fund is probably the best
performing large pension fund in the world,'' said Richard
Charlton, president of New England Pension Consultants, a Boston
firm that has done work for the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back up Charlton's assertions. In the three years
ended last June, New Jersey had annual returns of 16.1 percent,
22.1 percent, and 22.7 percent. The typical public pension fund
over that same period returned 15.2 percent, 19.1 percent, and 16.9
percent, according to statistics gathered by the Independent
Consultants Cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Arena's small cap fund is no slouch either. Year to date
it has returned over 20 percent, miles ahead of the Russell 2000
Index, which is up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The investment division manages $74 billion in pension assets.
Arena's small cap fund has just over $2 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's excellent performance has been achieved without any
outside help. State law forbids the pension fund from hiring
professional money management firms. According to Charlton, New
Jersey is one of the few states in the country that still operate
under such restrictions. Investment decisions are made by 25
people, all on the state payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Kornrumpf is understandably proud of his staff's Internet
investing. That hasn't stopped him from worrying as the stocks have
soared and more recently, plunged in value. ``The issue has been on
everyone's mind,'' said Kornrumpf. ``We have discussed it with our
board and people were comfortable where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The pension fund owns about 35 Internet stocks worth roughly
$1.2 billion. That sounds like a lot of money, but, in fact, it
only represents 3 percent of the state's equity holdings. By owning
so many different names, the fund is also buying some protection
through diversification.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the view of a venture capitalist,'' said Kornrumpf.
``We own a basket of these and we hope to have one or two hits.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview, Arena didn't have a lot to say. He
expressed no opinion about the price of Internet stocks. ``We treat
them like any other stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how much did Grover Cleveland have to say? Get the guy his
service area.

WHO'S SAVING A BUNDLE ON ENERGY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In Massachusetts, big businesses, some municipalities,
and nonprofits have all seen how competition has lowered their
electric rates in the past 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the mix are State residents.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every household has realized a 10 percent savings on
monthly electric bills (with another 5 percent coming in
September). Those cuts were mandated by the 1997 Electric
Restructuring Act, in which the state required Bay State electric
utilities to divest their electric generating assets.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses and municipalities have begun saving money on
electricity by buying through trade and business groups, whose
collective power requirements allow them to bid competitively for
power.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no telemarketers calling John Q. Public at dinner
time to offer comparable discounts. The current cost of electric
power in Massachusetts is considered too low for competitors to
enter the residential market, and reaching consumers with direct
mail, television, and newspaper advertising is too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   That could all be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Essential.com, a small Burlington start-up, began using the
Internet this month to offer consumers a 10 percent discount on a
portion of their electric bills, provided they also switch their
local and long-distance telephone service. A major ad campaign
promoting this bundle of services is planned for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, who sign up on the Essential.com Web site will
eventually receive a single, detailed bill for all their utilities,
which they can pay by credit or debit card. During an introductory
period, the company is also handling billing by mail, but the goal
is to handle invoicing and collection over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using the Internet, we cut the marketing costs of reaching
individual customers for power providers and others and also
provide the consumer with the convenience of a single bill plus a
discount,'' said Akhil Garland, founder, president, and chief
executive of Essential.com.
</P>
<P>
   Essential.com is the first in an expected wave of Internet-based
companies to offer consumers discounted electric rates as part of a
package of utility services, including telephone, gas, heating oil,
propane, cable television, and even on-line grocery shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to provide customers the convenience of a single
bill, along with discounts that would make their total monthly
utility cost less than if each service were ordered separately.
</P>
<P>
   Garland said Essential.com will resell lower-priced electricity
under a contract with AllEnergy, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New
England Electric System. Essential.com will also resell Bell
Atlantic local phone service at a 5 percent discount, so customers
don't have to change phone numbers or switch services.
Long-distance charges are a flat 9.9 cents a minute, seven days a
week, with no minimum purchase, under contracts Essential.com has
with AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom, Cable and Wireless, and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   To receive the 10 percent electricity discount, customers must
sign up with Essential.com for two years. There are no plans to
sell electricity alone. Essential.com makes its money from the
various utilities for reselling their services.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal of a single bill is not yet a reality. Currently,
only one portion of a consumer's electric bill _ power generation _
is listed on the Essential.com monthly invoice. Electricity
generation, the deregulated portion of consumer electric bills, is
a measure of the basic kilowatt-per-hour rate known as the standard
offer. The bulk of the electric bill _ electric transmission,
distribution, and transition costs _ will still come directly from
Boston Edison or Massachusetts Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potential customer confusion is a big concern,'' said Robert
Potter, Essential.com's vice president of business development for
energy markets. He added that state regulators are working with
electric utility companies to solve the separate billing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Not far behind Essential.com is TelEnergy Inc., which has been
marketing local and long-distance telephone services to Bay State
consumers since January. The Newton firm currently provides
electricity billing services as a convenience to its telephone
service customers, but without discounts.
</P>
<P>
   With about 2,000 customers, TelEnergy expects to match the
Essential.com bundle of services shortly, according to Chris
McKeown, TelEnergy founder and president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers are generally upscale, computer-savvy families,
many of whom have businesses and want a single bill for their
utility services, such as phones, electricity, natural gas, and
heating oil, rather than separate invoices,'' said McKeown.
</P>
<P>
   Like Garland, McKeown is raising additional financing to
advertise his company and raise brand awareness.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one is offering Massachusetts residential customers
discounts on electricity without the other services. Critics say
this is a shortcoming of deregulation, because the current electric
generation rates are simply too low to attract competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of deregulation say those low standard offer
rates _ climbing from 2.8 cents per kilowatt hour in 1998 to 5.2
cents in 2004 _ are benefiting consumers now and that competitors
will enter the market next year when the rate rises to nearly 4
cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning to introduce a residential program in the
not-too-distant future,'' said Steven Rothstein, managing director
of National Energy Choice LLC, a competitive power supplier to
medium-sized businesses, municipalities, nursing homes, and other
groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is expensive to sign up residential customers, he said,
adding that creating a separate electric bill and mailing it can
cost $1.50 to $2. Since a typical $60 per month residential
electric bill includes about $20 in electric-generation costs,
offering a 10 percent savings _ $2 per month _ is wiped out by the
cost of billing and postage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to offer real savings unless the marketing and
billing is done very efficiently, such as through the Internet, so
that is why businesses and nonprofits with $20,000-a-year electric
bills have been served ahead of residential customers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only nonbusiness group trying to obtain electricity
discounts for both business users and consumers is the Cape Light
Compact. This nonprofit, grassroots organization is negotiating a
long-term contract with an unnamed energy provider on behalf of
186,000 people living in 20 communities on Cape Cod and Martha's
Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the area has the nation's sixth highest electricity
costs, the compact is seeking a five-year contract for guaranteed
electric generation rates below the standard offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think combining electricity costs with other services
is a way to benefit the residents of the Cape,'' said Robert
Mahoney, chairman of the compact.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, MassPIRG sees cause for concern in the idea of
relying on companies such as Essential.com to bring residential
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save money on anything, you have to buy other products.
That's troubling for the average consumer in Massachusetts,'' said
Rob Sargent, MassPIRG energy program director. ``Eventually it will
be hard for anyone to make an apples-to-apples comparison of what a
utility service costs if everything is bundled.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say that selling electricity as part of a bundle
of services will have limited appeal to consumers because the
month-to-month savings are relatively small.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some industry analysts maintain that the bundling of
energy and other services is the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of getting just very low prices for a single service,
whether it's electricity or long-distance telephone, are
numbered,'' said Donald Bradshaw, an energy analyst at the Yankee
Group.
</P>
<P>
   But others say that a company like Essential.com faces a series
of challenges. Just as 50 percent of the nation's residential
long-distance telephone customers never switched from AT&AMP;T to
another carrier, there is even greater apathy about changing
electric power providers to save a few bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling services on the Internet is still very difficult,
compared to peddling hard goods, like books, records, and toys,
because the challenge in services is to explain who will take care
of everything if something goes wrong,'' said David Cooperstein,
senior analyst with the consumer e-commerce group of Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are worth it, Garland said. ``We think we are at the
early stages of a huge market for customers who want convenience in
billing basic services.''

   If you've been dismayed lately to encounter a series of T-shirts
with slogans proclaiming ``Your game's as ugly as your girl'' and
``You can't hold me, that's your girl's job,'' apparently you're
not the only one.

   On Friday, J.C. Penney Co. ordered its stores to remove
trash-talking T-shirts manufactured by And 1, a Rosemont, Pa.,
basketball-apparel company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listen to customers, and there were customers who didn't
feel it was appropriate for us to carry the merchandise,''
spokesman Duncan Muir said Tuesday. ``On further review, we agree.
It was something we shouldn't have done.''
</P>
<P>
   And 1, which takes its name from basketball terminology, has
also come under fire for signing New York Knicks guard Latrell
Sprewell to his first endorsement deal since being suspended for
choking his coach during practice while a member of the Golden
State Warriors. The bulletin-board section of its website,
www.and1.com, is filled with heated commentary on both Sprewell and
the shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for the firm were not available for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how many complaints J.C. Penney had received, Muir
said he could not provide an exact number but replied: ``Enough to
get our attention, that's for sure.''

   Jeannie Longo-Ciprelli, who has dominated women's cycling since
winning her first world championship in 1979, decisively won the
12-day HP LaserJet stage race in Idaho Sunday. The French cyclist,
who has won 12 world titles, took the lead during the second stage
of the 693-mile race throughout Idaho, and never relinquished it.
</P>
<P>
   Her winning time of 27 hours 21 minutes 12 seconds was 3 minutes
41 seconds better than that of her nearest competitor, Mari Holden,
of Colorado Springs.

   The international field of 107 included Tracy Timms of Brookline

thus becoming the first female nonpitcher to play on a professional
men's team, has retired. After playing in several early-season
games, Holmes returned home to California, citing personal reasons

first-team All-America in college lacrosse this spring. Emily
Mechem, who grew up in Gloucester and now lives in New Jersey, had
33 goals and 14 assists for Penn State, while Dartmouth juniors
Melissa Frazier, a defender from Berwyn, Pa., and Jacque Weitzel, a
midfielder from Annapolis, Md., represented the Ivy League champion
Big Green. In addition, Frazier was the only unanimous selection to
the All-Ivy team on defense, while Weitzel is playing this summer
on the US Women's Lacrosse Association Developmental team for the
second straight summer. Just last week, she scored two goals in a
US victory over England.

BUSH'S LINE ABOUT PAST UNLIKELY TO SPARE HIM MEDIA GLARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his race to succeed the most scandal-scarred president in
history, the question dogs the front-running candidacy of George W.
Bush. Will his terse, preemptive confession of youthful
indiscretions head off a media invasion of his past? Or is he _ and
the nation _ headed for a campaign marked by salacious scandal
mongering?
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the mainstream media _ stung by the public rebuke
of their Monica Lewinsky obsession _ appear to have little appetite
for a frenzied Bush character hunt. (Last month, The Wall Street
Journal took the extraordinary step of publishing a story that
raised _ and then refuted _ drug allegations against Bush.) But in
an era in which Internet gossip Matt Drudge, the Star tabloid, and
porn king Larry Flynt shovel the dirt all the way up the media food
chain, many observers believe Bush will inevitably face a crucible
of tabloid headlines and kiss-and-tell accusers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of three reporters from the tabloids (investigating
Bush) in Texas and they're not looking for oil,'' said Drudge, who
first publicized the Lewinsky episode on his Web site. ``I wouldn't
bet the ranch'' on a scandal-ridden presidential campaign in 2000,
he added. ``I'd bet the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post's Bob Woodward makes the same basic point,
albeit more diplomatically. ``The question is `What is that line
between a mistake and normal behavior and something that requires
further illumination or explanation?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Woodward noted, Bush's glancing reference to his
indiscretions is ``the equivalent of Gary Hart'' telling reporters
to ``follow me'' in his infidelity-shortened 1988 presidential
campaign. Lest anyone wonder, the usual suspects are already
following Bush around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's a pretty hot story for us and if we come up with
something, we'd go with it,'' said Star editor Phil Bunton. ``We're
certainly working on one (story) at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't assigned a special task force to uncover skeletons
in his closet. But yes, we have gotten tips,'' said Steve Plamann,
assistant executive editor at the National Enquirer. ``We have some
very interesting areas we're going to explore. There are some very
interesting things going on and you'll see them in print.''
</P>
<P>
   In this media environment, one ignores that kind of promise at
one's peril. For it is the tabloid culture _ using nontraditional
and widely disdained journalistic methods _ that has exploded most
of the political bombshells of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Gennifer Flowers was paid more than $100,000 by the Star to kiss
and tell of her affair with President Clinton; that's the same
supermarket tab that forced the 1996 resignation of Clinton guru
Dick Morris after paying a prostitute to detail her liaison with
him. The Drudge Report, often a repository of unverified gossip,
not only stole Newsweek's Lewinsky scoop, it helped goad NBC and
the mainstream media into airing Juanita Broaddrick's allegations
that Clinton sexually assaulted her in 1978. The brief but
bothersome story of an extramarital affair that hounded President
George Bush in 1992 originated with the brazen Big Apple tabloid,
the New York Post. And the charges of infidelity that brought down
House Speaker-elect Robert Livingston last December came courtesy
of Hustler publisher Flynt, reaping the fruits of the $1 million
reward he offered for evidence of such philandering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their shaky and even disreputable origins, each of these
stories quickly jumped onto the pages and the airwaves of the
mainstream media to become part of the water cooler conversation.
With Bush's so-called indiscretions functioning as what Bunton
calls a ``red flag,'' what's to spare him from the same fate?
</P>
<P>
   ``If a presidential candidate thinks his skeletons are going to
remain in his closet in this day and age, he's dreaming,'' declared
Plamann.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, author of ``Feeding Frenzy: How Attack Journalism
Has Transformed American Politics,'' doesn't believe Bush provides
the media's character cops with the same target-rich environment
that Clinton did. But he is quite certain the Texas governor will
have to run his own gantlet of scandal stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amusing to me when I read and see and hear that we've
turned the corner on this,'' he said. ``That people aren't
interested anymore. The press won't report it. Of course, it's
going to happen. If the Bush campaign is calculating it's not going
to happen, they've calculated very badly.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the calculation hasn't changed since Clinton
proved that a politician could survive what were previously
considered fatal foibles. Some observers argue that in a nation
benumbed by Monica-gate, the electorate and press are now less
interested in the private follies of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder whether the American public is shockable anymore,''
said New York Post editor Ken Chandler, whose paper reveled in the
Clinton shockers. ``I wonder how much they care about alleged
scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN senior political analyst William Schneider thinks the
mainstream media is reluctant to energetically pursue Bush's past
``because of the Clinton experience. . . . The voters essentially
controlled the agenda and said, `Don't get into this,' '' he said.
``The Republicans paid a price and the press paid a price. . . .
The press knows that the voters' appetite for this is limited and
they're going to exercise some discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that ``you and I don't know what's there. .
. It all depends upon the what the charge is.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabato says political scandal stories might have a shorter shelf
life now, ``but that doesn't mean people won't absorb them. . . .
It's a permanent part of American society.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Bush campaign is functioning under this strange
sword of Damocles, listening to reporters clamor for a fuller
explanation of those youthful indiscretions, watching while The
Wall Street Journal publishes the damning rumor that Bush snorted
cocaine at his father's inauguration, and waiting while the
tabloids sniff around his old haunts with checkbook in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could really get wild,'' offered Woodward, the author of
the new book ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of
Watergate.'' ``I don't think there should be a media war on any of
these candidates.'' But they ``need to realize it's a new world.''

DEEP IN THE HEART OF HEXES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all of my hexes live in Texas. But enough of them do so that
I reflexively keep my left hand high when anything associated with
the Lone Star State veers into my lane of life.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas looms extra-large this season. Lord Stanley's hockey
cup just went to Dallas, where humidity is more of a problem than
high-sticking.
</P>
<P>
   The estimable San Antonio basketball club looks on the verge of
becoming world roundball champeens, in a state known more for
broncs than buckets. And if Governor George Dubayah Bush was any
further ahead in the presidential sweepstakes, they'd call off not
only the 2000 election but 2004 to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Texmania generally leaves me, if not totally cold, at least well
below room temperature. Texas and me got off on the wrong foot the
first day I ever set boot, as they'd put it, on Sam Houston's
sacred soil. Hauled down to San Antonio for basic training by a
military organization affiliated with the federal
(itals)gummint,(unitals) as they'd put it, I snuck into the john
for a forbidden smoke and emerged to find my fellow enlistees
marched off somewhere into the darkness, with me not having a clue
where they'd gone.
</P>
<P>
   That was the wrong way to embark on a military career, which may
be why I am still typing for a living, not drawing a military
pension, living in the Lone Star State, waiting for Saturday's gun
show, and sucking Lone Star beer.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't like Texas then, and we never got over it, despite
dozens of forays over the years. What don't I like about Texas?
Waking at 5, waiting on a noncom whose IQ hovered about 10 degrees
over the temperature in an early December dawn. Loudmouth
right-wingers. Bidness men, as they call 'em, who think anyone
objecting to the rape of the landscape or the oil depletion
allowance is a commie symp. Brothers who try to collar commodities,
like the Hunt Bros. did silver. TV series that feature mouthy,
pouty, or otherwise obnoxious Texans. Roger Clemens. Rhinestone
cowboys. The Dallas Cowboys when they're out on bail, or unless
they're playing Green Bay, when I'm for 'em. Is there anything I
like about Texas? Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jeff Walker. Ann Richards. Molly Ivins. Jim Hightower.
Austin, the Cambridge of the Southwest, best stop between Boston
and anywhere else out thataway. ``Austin City Limits.'' My pal Roy
Bode from East Texas. The term ``goat roper,'' which Bode taught me
meant someone from the East pretending to be someone from Texas.
Rodeo riders. Rodeo animals. Rodeo, period. The term ``panhandle,''
just a great word.
</P>
<P>
   Texas humor, like the phrase for a poseur: ``all hat and no
cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought a lot more of Texans when they elected Ann Richards
governor. Her putdown of Bush Sr. _ ``he was born on third base and
thought he hit a triple'' _ is an all-timer in my book. When Bush
Jr. took her out in '94, when the Democrats crashed on gun control,
incumbency fatigue, and the Clinton health plan, my esteem for the
Alamo State went back to earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a Boston-Austin axis, in which speakers of the
House from Massachusetts (Joe Martin, John McCormack, Tip O'Neill)
alternated with the likes of Sam Rayburn and Jim Wright. Mike
Dukakis made Lloyd Bentsen his running mate in '88, but even that
couldn't carry Texas against Bush Sr., who was born in Milton,
Mass., and moved to Texas as a grownup.
</P>
<P>
   Most Texas officeholders range from regular conservatives on the
left, to the right-wingers in the middle, and the high-octane
five-alarm-chili red-hots on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Till George Bush Sr. won his one term in '88, Texans have been
treated chillily by us non-Texans in presidential years. John
Connally and Senator Phil Gramm found that big money was not the
only friend you needed in national politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Tornado that makes this Bush campaign a political
phenomenon is uncharacteristic. Bush's views on abortion (no,
dammit) and guns (yes, dammit) are considered moderate by Texas
standards. My own suspicion is that ``compassionate
conservativism'' means ``the kinda stuff I have to say on TV in
order not to scare them Easterners.''
</P>
<P>
   When you run down the Texas congressional lineup, you run low on
the compassion tank PDQ. Senators Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison
are a matched pair, and when you throw in the No. 2 and 3 leaders
of the House _ majority leader Dick Armey and whip Tom DeLay _
you've got yourself a regular boxed set of right-wingers. DeLay's
job is aptly named, but his attitude suggests he'd like to have
handy the thumbscrews and the rack to go with the whip.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay's hate-filled invective against the Clintons in particular
and Democrats in general mark him as a next Gingrich, a divisive
politician to whom rhetorical extremism on cable television is no
vice. With Armey twisting one arm and DeLay yanking the other out
of the shoulder socket, hapless Denny Hastert of Illinois is a
neutered corpse of an interim speaker, prisoner of the foremen in
his own bunk house.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush betrays any more sign of caving to the right wing like
the GOP leadership has, he can forget about leaving Austin.

WE ELECT PEOPLE, NOT PEDIGREES

<P>
   Since the first ``log cabin'' election in 1840, presidential
candidates have tried to insulate themselves from an American
suspicion of aristocrats by claiming kinship with the common folk.
In 1999, partisan propagandists trying to drag class warfare into
the 2000 election might pause to ask: How can class count if Ivy
Leaguers flood the field?
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Al Gore, a Harvard graduate, faces Bill
Bradley of Princeton. Among Republicans, George W. Bush of Yale and
Harvard Business School is pursued by Elizabeth Dole, with a
Harvard master's degree and one from Harvard Law School; Steve
Forbes, another Princetonian; and Patrick J. Buchanan, who holds a
master's from the Columbia School of Journalism, where, classmates
recall, he majored in polemics and minored in diatribes.
</P>
<P>
   This season's log cabin is crawling with ivy, which does not
stop the party chairmen from nattering on about inheritance and
breeding, once considered hallmarks of an Ivy League education.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does this person get to be the top runner? It's his
name,'' Roy Romer, chairman of the National Democratic Committee,
said in an interview with David Yepsen of the Des Moines Register.
``If he didn't have the name `Bush,' he would not be in this race.
He just wouldn't be in this race. When you are choosing the leader
of the free world, you've got to look at it and say name is not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer may have forgotten how Al Gore became a congressman, then
a senator from Tennessee: because his father had been a
congressman, then a senator from Tennessee. If she ``didn't have
the name,'' would Hillary Clinton be considered a potential US
senator? And how about getting elected governor of Texas, twice?
Doesn't that count more than getting elected governor of Arkansas a
dozen times?
</P>
<P>
   Romer is the governor of Colorado. His fellow Coloradan, Jim
Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
counterattacks on class and privilege in a way that suggests how
much American politics would improve if Romer and Nicholson took
the summer off, cracked open a Coors or two, and conducted their
feckless debate beside a Rocky Mountain stream.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson brands Gore, whose childhood was spent more in a
Washington hotel than on a Tennessee farm, ``the barefoot boy from
Embassy Row.'' The chairman has swiped a line from Harold L. Ickes,
secretary of the interior in 1940, who called Wendell L. Willkie of
Indiana, the Republican presidential nominee, ``the barefoot boy
from Wall Street,'' where Willkie made his fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Willkie lost to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the most popular and
most patrician president in history. In ``Freedom From Fear,'' his
marvelous and magisterial history of the United States between 1929
and 1945, David M. Kennedy documents how FDR dominated not with his
pedigree or his Harvard education but with ``good-natured,
head-tossing brio.'' Kennedy cites the famous observation of
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who said of the new president in
March of 1933, ``A second-class intellect, but a first-rate
temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Ivy League is largely a meritocracy, and first-rate
educations are available elsewhere, as attested by Lamar Alexander
of Vanderbilt University; Gary Bauer of Georgetown College (of
Kentucky); John Kasich of Ohio State; Dan Quayle of DePauw
University; and Bob Smith of Lafayette College.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain aims to be the second graduate of the US Naval
Academy elected president. Jimmy Carter was the first, elected as a
brainy and folksy outsider. Carter won a bout of intellect over
Gerald R. Ford in 1976 but lost the test of temperament to Ronald
Reagan in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In a struggle for the presidency of a middle-class nation,
poor-mouthing is as obsolete as populist resentment of privilege.
For most voters today, SAT scores, IQ tests, and diplomas don't
count; character does.

OZAWA'S CAREER CROSSOVER LEADS TO PATH OF HIS MENTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The news Tuesday that Seiji Ozawa would leave the
music directorship of the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the close of
the season in 2002 came as a surprise to nearly everyone, but major
career moves between symphonic and operatic work occur often in the
lives of conductors. Every conductor wants both kinds of
activities, but few have managed to hold them in balance.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional route to the orchestral podium has been from the
pit of the opera house _ this was the journey traced by Arturo
Toscanini in the past, and by the Cleveland Orchestra's Christoph
von Dohnanyi more recently. But the crossover has gone the other
way. The BSO principal guest conductor Bernard Haitink, for
example, began to concentrate on opera only after decades in the
concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable why Ozawa might want the Vienna post,
despite the fact that some of its most notable music directors from
Gustav Mahler up through Claudio Abbado have run into controversy
and serious problems there. Vienna is notorious for waxing
sentimental about its music directors only after they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the post remains one of the most prestigious in
the musical world. It was once held by one of Ozawa's principal
mentors, Herbert von Karajan, and it was at the Vienna State Opera
that another of Ozawa's mentors, Leonard Bernstein, became an
international music icon after years of controversy and
condescension in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Conductors are too easily typecast, and there is a wide swath of
the major operatic repertory that Ozawa has never been asked to
conduct because he hasn't conducted it before and, besides, he's
famous for other things. Opera was not one of his strong points
early in his career, and few who heard him conduct Mozart's ``Cosi
fan tutte'' at Tanglewood 30 years ago could have predicted what a
masterly operatic conductor he would develop into.
</P>
<P>
   In the opera houses of the world, and with the Boston Symphony,
Ozawa has conducted exotic repertory from Mozart's ``Idomeneo''
through Messiaen's ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' but he hasn't found
the opportunity to conduct many of the major operas of Mozart,
Verdi, and Wagner. As music director of one of the world's great
opera houses, he will be able to. Over and over again, Ozawa has
excelled with repertory that no one would have associated with him;
perhaps the brightest example came in the wonderful performances of
Britten's ``Peter Grimes'' that he led at Tanglewood a few summers
ago.
</P>
<P>
   (It is best to take Ozawa at his word when he says he's leaving
Boston because he wants to conduct more opera. He has never shunned
controversy and, in fact, seems to thrive on it. He stands by his
controversial decisions with regard to the Tanglewood Music Center
and a few bad reviews have never scared him.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the problem of finding a successor to Ozawa will loom
large in Symphony Hall. Finding a new music director is always
difficult, made more so by a current shortage of suitable
candidates _ there are many good conductors in the world, but few
great ones. It is nevertheless true that many good conductors have
risen to the challenge of greatness when called to lead an
irrefutably great orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the leading conductors of the senior generation, Haitink
and Andre Previn, are significantly involved with the BSO. Both are
past 70, and probably neither covets the post. Both, however, are
likely to play an increased role during the time of transition. BSO
management will probably be soliciting the advice of both.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the leading conductors of Ozawa's generation, Abbado and
Riccardo Muti, are probably not contenders. Muti has had no conn

RABBI'S BOOK TAPS INTO NEED FOR INTIMACY IN RELATIONSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It feels slightly uncomfortable to be sitting at a cafe talking
about sex with an Orthodox rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   But Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has no qualms whatsoever. ``Too many
married couples are not having a satisfying sex life and it
shouldn't be like that,'' said Boteach, the rabbi at Oxford
University in England _ not the expected setting for a cleric
offering himself as an expert on intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   But Boteach's book, with the eyebrow-raising title of ``Kosher
Sex,'' has been a smash hit ever since it was first published in
England a year ago. It's made several bestseller lists in the
United States and has, so far, been translated into nine languages.
</P>
<P>
   While most scholars would be accustomed to having their work
published in sober academic journals, Boteach's book was excerpted
in the January issue of Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't quite sure what to expect when it was published, but
I didn't think it would do so well so quickly,'' said Boteach,
dressed in a conservative dark suit and wearing a skullcap during a
visit to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But as he travels across the United States, speaking in
synagogues and giving interviews to dozens of journalists,
including the ``Today'' show's Matt Lauer, Boteach better
understands why his book has drawn so much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are really craving intimacy in relationships,''
said the 32-year-old Boteach, who has six children. ``People feel
very atomized, alienated and alone and that's why you enter into a
relationship. But relationships don't necessarily assuage feelings
of isolation so when a book comes along claiming how to find
intimacy, people want to know what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   With chapter titles such as ``Is Oral Sex Wrong?'' ``Does Size
Matter?'' and ``What about Pornography?'' Boteach's book offers a
frank discussion on how to inject fire into a married couple's sex
life.
</P>
<P>
   In writing ``Kosher Sex,'' Boteach leaned on his knowledge of
Jewish teaching and his 11 years of counseling students and others
at Oxford. ``It wasn't field research,'' quips Boteach. ``I've
heard every story under the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The book also stems from his own experiences as a child of
parents who divorced when Boteach was eight. ``I didn't just want
to come to terms with being the child of a broken home, but I
wanted to turn the pain into something positive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boteach's counsel to married couples on bringing passion into
the bedroom is distilled into an acronym he calls ``saner'' sex.
</P>
<P>
   First, Boteach recommends, sensuality, or using all five senses
when making love. ``People today make love mostly with their eyes,
but kosher sex is sex in the dark,'' he argues. ``The eyes are
meant to draw you to your partner, but after that sex should be a
celebration of the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A'' stands for attraction. Boteach believes that the popular
media have reduced attraction to an objective measure, based on an
idealized notion of what we should look like. ``But the beauty of
attraction is that it is a very personal experience,'' he says.
``I've seen surveys where 70 percent of married women undress in
the bathroom rather than in front of their husbands. That's
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``N'' is for nakedness, or, as Boteach puts it, ``losing all
inhibition and giving in to total submission to the instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E'' is for eroticism. Boteach believes that the easy
accessiblity spouses have to each other has taken the fun and
mystery out of sex. One possible solution _ adhering to a biblical
stricture by abstaining from sex for 12 days a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have husbands lusting after their wives instead of
people at work,'' Boteach says.
</P>
<P>
   And ``R'' is for romance. ``Giving total sexual focus to your
spouse by offering romantic gestures for no other reason than to
tell him or her that they are special and cherished,'' Boteach
explains.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he adds, ``buying my wife a dishwasher is not a
romantic gesture because it says, `Honey, I love you. Now do the
dishes.' But buying flowers, on the other hand, is a great romantic
gesture because the flowers are going to die, but the gesture
remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Boteach says, greater intimacy is the consequence of
being willing to be more open to expressing our feelings to our
spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we expose our soft underbelly in a relationship
because so many of us have been let down or have seen others let
down,'' he says. ``But sex isn't only about being physically naked,
but also emotionally naked.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House last week prescribed two tablets of extra-strength
Exodus to surly adolescents for fast, safe, and very temporary
political relief from schoolyard massacres. Alabama's Robert
Aderholt, sponsor of the bill that would let states post the Ten
Commandments in public schools, said, ``it is important step to
promote morality, and an end of children killing children.''
</P>
<P>
   We all know God works in mysterious ways, but how Aderholt knows
this is truly a revelation, since the Ten Commandments he wants in
the schools are not the same ones tacked to his own door on Capitol
Hill. It is odd for Aderholt to cure trigger tremors and trenchcoat
seizures with Exodus when his own commandments come from the Book
of Exotoxin, where political poison is released into the mainstream
by the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   These are the commandments of Aderholt and the House:
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the National Rifle Association spoke all these words,
saying,
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the NRA your God, who brought you into your congressional
seat and into my House of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall have no other gods before Me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not envision an America with gun control for
yourself nor the likeness of anything for your constituents in your
district.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not worship such a vision or serve constituents who
want gun control; for I, the NRA your God, am a jealous God. I have
punished three and four generations of politicians since 1871; I
punished the Democrats in 1994; I will continue to punish those who
hate Me,
</P>
<P>
   ``But I will continue to show loving kindness to thousands and
give thousands of dollars of campaign contributions to those who
love Me and keep My commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not take the name of the NRA, your God in vain, for
the LORD will not leave unpunished the man who takes His name in
vain by wanting three-day waiting periods for gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember Election Day and keep it holy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six days you shall tell constituents that the children are our
future and hug and kiss babies for photo-ops,
</P>
<P>
   ``But Election Day is a sabbath of the NRA your God; you shall
weaken existing gun laws and ignore unliscened gun dealers and
shoddy gun shows. You shall not do any work on behalf of gun
control, even if sons are using legally-purchased guns to spray
down other sons, daughters, teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``For in six days the NRA frantically and fanatically made the
heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is in them safe for
Smith and Wesson, Glock, Ruger and Lorcin. The NRA rested on
Election Day, knowing politicians will keep it holy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honor Charlton Heston, that your days in office may be
prolonged in the land which the NRA your God gives you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not murder, but you also shall not care if more
children murder children in the United States than the rest of the
developed world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not let the fact that the Revolution was over two
centuries ago adulterate the Second Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not let the government steal our guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not bear false witness against your constituents
except for pseudoscientific claims that guns make us safer and
studies in medical journals which show that gun ownership actually
doubles and triples the chance of being shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shall not let thoughtful critics covet the high ground
when Heston and Jesse Ventura belch that pistol-packing teachers
would have stopped the bloodshed at Littleton. You shall not be
swayed by wailing mothers on the six-o'clock news. You shall not
covet gun laws in Japan, England, Germany or New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   When Americans saw how it thundered and the lightning flashed,
how they heard the trumpet sound and saw the mountain smoking and
the hot lava of NRA PAC money flowing down, they trembled and stood
at a distance. Most Americans want new gun restrictions, according
to polls. But they said to the House,
</P>
<P>
   ``Speak to us yourself, and we will listen. But if the NRA
speaks to us, we shall die.''
</P>
<P>
   The House answered, ``Do not be afraid. The NRA has only come to
test you, so that the fear of it may remain with you and keep you
from gun control.
</P>
<P>
   So the people stood at a distance, while the House approached
the dark cloud where the NRA was.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA said to the House, ``Ye have seen that I have bribed
you, indentured you and enslaved you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ye shall not make laws of gun control; neither shall ye make
any gun restrictions whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``An altar of guns thou shalt make unto me, and shalt sacrifice
thereon thy bullet-riddled children. There are no peace offerings,
only thy groaning emergency rooms and moaning funeral homes; in all
places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I will
bless thee.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if thou wilt make me an altar of guns, thou shalt not
build it with BB guns; for if thou bring anything less than the
most lethal, easy-to-load, armor piercing, expanding-bullet,
10-to-15-shot semiautomatic handguns, thou hast polluted it.''

Rev. John D. Bavaro, director of the Franciscan Center in Andover,
Mass. Hidden away in woods that run along the Merrimack River, the
sprawling former seminary building with 55 bedrooms is starting to
sell out many weekend reservations for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible wave of people we're getting,'' Bavaro
added.
</P>
<P>
   What people typically get on weekend or weeklong retreats would
never be mistaken for the Four Seasons. Many monasteries and
retreat centers offer small rooms with hard mattresses and
furniture that would not make the grade at Motel 6. Private
bathrooms also are a rare amenity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clean and comfortable, but this is not a resort,'' said
Sister Eleanor Weigand of the St. Joseph Villa Retreat Center,
where retreatants can be lulled to sleep by the sound of lapping
waves. ``But people aren't necessarily coming here for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people attending religious and spiritual retreats are not
looking for terry cloth bathrobes, a heated pool, or a nightly
happy hour. Simplicity and serenity are why people are flocking to
these centers in such significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Places such as the Miramar Retreat Center in Duxbury, Mass. and
St. Benedict Abbey in Harvard, Mass. have become a magnet for
people seeking to escape frenetic lives filled with faxes, beepers,
and cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I turn into the driveway at Miramar I can literally
feel all the problems, all the stresses just melt away,'' said Lois
Mastrangelo, who lives near Boston and has gone on a half-dozen
retreats to the Duxbury center in the past two years. ``It's just
such a welcome feeling of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   While organized retreats _ often directed at couples, men, or
high schoolers _ are not new, retreat directors say the boom in
individual retreats has been startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a God-shaped hole that cannot be filled with anything
else,'' said Sister Adelle Marie Ryan, the superior at St.
Margaret's Convent in Boston, which offers 16 private rooms.
``People have tried to fill it with a lot of other things and many
of them still feel dissatisfied. Plus, we have the best view of
downtown Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics, Protestants, and even non-Christians say weekend
escapes to monasteries and retreat centers that offer time for
prayer, meditation, and spiritual advice in stunning settings all
for less than $50 a night are the best vacations going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the same thing _ people just need to get away from the
wild, wild world of blaring horns, television, the telephone,
computers,'' said Joseph Ledoux, assistant to the guest master at
St. Joseph's Abbey, a Trappist Monastery where reservations for one
of the 11 guest rooms must be made at least six months in advance.
``We get people from New York City and it takes them a full day to
get used to the silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulette Normandin, an office manager at a medical office, has
been a repeat customer at the Franciscan Center for the past 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a date with God,'' said Normandin. ``It's an
opportunity to get off the treadmill that we live on and make time
for God, to make God a priority. I always leave feeling renewed and
refreshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rego, an administrator for a health-care organization who
spends much of her time on the road, said her yearly retreats at
the Franciscan Center provide a much-needed balance to her life.
``Trying to maintain a spiritual focus in our lives is not easy,''
said Rego, who lives in Tiverton, R.I. ``Going to the Franciscan
Center gives me a time to be still and listen to the voice of God,
which can sometimes be overpowered by the noise of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At some Catholic monasteries such as St. Benedict Abbey, which
sits high over a valley looking across to Mt. Wachusett, and St.
Scholastica, in a remote slice of central Massachuetts' Pioneer
Valley, there is the added attraction of Gregorian chanting,
popular in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a powerfully meditative form of worship, which people,
even if they don't know Latin, can enter into,'' said the Rev.
Father Andrew Koch, the guest master at St. Benedict. ``It's a very
transcendent style of worship. Retreatants are really drawn to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Retreats, however, are not necessarily solely about praying.
Monasteries and retreat centers do not require that people spend a
certain amount of time in the chapel. At Miramar, for example, many
people are attracted to the labyrinth _ a maze in the woods where
retreatants can literally become lost in their thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The center, set in a breathtaking location overlooking the ocean
with sprawling gardens filled with flowers, also has a professional
masseuse on staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of thing that would have been unheard of 30
years ago, but people are looking for a holistic approach to
sprituality,'' said the Rev. Robert M. Jones, director of Miramar
Retreat Center. ``They are looking for ways to integrate
spirituality with their work life and their family life.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Martin, a psychiatric nurse, recalls her first retreat on
a cold winter weekend in February 1996 at Gonzaga Eastern Point in
Gloucester, Mass. ``It was transforming; it felt sacred to me,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   One morning, Martin rose at 5 a.m. and, cradling a cup of coffee
to fend off the chilly wind, stood on the rocks watching the sun
rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you get in touch with God there,'' she said. ``I came
to the retreat not knowing what to expect. And I left a more
peaceful person.''

BRITISH DUO'S SONGS KEEPS POPPING UP ON TV, SOUNDTRACKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Propellerheads' ``Decksandrumsandrockandroll'' may
be the most familiar album you don't own and have never, or rarely,
heard on radio. That's because its songs keep popping up on TV
(``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,'' ``Nash Bridges''), in movies
(``The Matrix,'' ``There's Something About Mary'') and in
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The place you're most likely to hear the work of the English duo
_ whose name is slang for computer nerds _ is in a current
television commercial for the new Jaguar. That's the Props playing,
as guest vocalist Shirley Bassey, she of the big ``Goldfinger''
voice, intones: ``They say the next big thing is here/That the
revolution's near/But to me it seems quite clear/That it's all just
a little bit of history repeating.'' Cool, catchy and sexy, the
song is likely to stay with you even when the program you're
watching comes back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the record that won't go away,'' said Monica
Mylod, marketing manager for Propellerheads at DreamWorks Records.
Mylod says though the record has sold only 200,000 copies, less
than half the amount it takes to achieve gold record status, her
phone is ``ringing off the hook'' with requests to use the music in
movies, TV shows and commercials. She adds that she's nearing a
deal to put another of the album's beat-driven cuts into a major
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gifford _ half of Propellerheads, along with Will White _
also wrote, produced and performed music for a big chase sequence
in 1997's James Bond film, ``Tomorrow Never Dies.'' Two cuts on
``Decksandrums'' have a definite Bond-like quality; others range
from hip-hop to techno.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' at theaters,
maybe it's time to discover this year-old CD and give it a spin.
For Propellerheads, who've been keeping busy with producing work,
this renewed interest in their only full-length album is all just a
little bit of history repeating. &QL;

 &HT;    Web a wealth of info on adding zest to dining solo
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For people who find themselves having to prepare meals for only
themselves, like young people just starting out or older folks
having to start over, eating solo can be a depressing and
intimidating experience. Even business travelers are sometimes
known to dread eating alone in a strange restaurant. So pervasive
is this phenomenon it has been given a name: solomangarephobia _
the fear of eating alone.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who dine solo at least part of the time is
increasing dramatically. A recent survey of young people and adults
showed that between 1960 and 1990, the number of solitary diners,
at least part of the time, has increased some 16 million, tripling
the 1960s figures.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people adversely affected is also increasing,
especially among senior citizens. A survey of nearly 700 volunteers
from age 60 through their 90s showed that eating alone is the most
common factor behind poor nutrition among older people. Preparing a
meal can seem like a waste of time if you have always cooked for
others and are used to company around the table. ``Why bother, it's
only for me'' is a common refrain among solo eaters, who often fall
into the rut of relying on fast food or snacks or skip meals
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   But eating by yourself doesn't have to be a reason not to
prepare healthful, delicious and enjoyable meals. There is a wealth
of information (though a dearth of recipes) available for those who
are up to the challenge. Here are just a few sites we found when we
searched ``cooking for one'' and ``eating alone'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ohio State University has an excellent site devoted
exclusively to seniors cooking for themselves:
www.ag.ohio-state.edu/(tilde)ohioline
</P>
<P>
   /ss-fact/0161.html. They advise to make the most of every meal
and realize that eating is a wonderful event. Some hints:
</P>
<P>
   Spice it up with herbs. Try something new to avoid boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Create an ``atmosphere'' when you eat. Don't be afraid to use
your best china or silver. Decorate the table and light a candle.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  At www.menshealth.com/features/
</P>
<P>
   mensconf/docs/doc58.html, you will find an article by Martin
Yadrick, registered dietitian and spokesman for the American
Dietetic Association, who writes about his father, who loves to
cook but has lost weight through the years, probably because he is
alone most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of his suggestions on how to buck the trend:
</P>
<P>
   Snack wisely. If the idea of a meal alone seldom appeals, be
sure to snack on healthy foods like precut carrots, pretzels, fig
bars or dried fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Check out what's new. More and more supermarkets are stocking
healthy prepared meals. Look for roasted chicken breasts, pasta
salads and lean roast beef. And don't forget the salad bar _ a
substantial salad can make a nutritious, filling meal.
</P>
<P>
   Make lunch your big meal. Lunch often holds more social
opportunities than dinner for both working and retired men. Don't
be afraid to fill up at noon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The article ``Cooking for One,'' at
www.shoppernews.com/c012595.html, contends that cooking for one is
no reason to punish yourself with recipes you would not serve
others. The site offers some lovely for-one recipes and a wonderful
bit of philosophy that solo eaters should keep in mind from the
ancient Roman host Lucullus, who said: ``It is precisely when I am
alone that you are required to pay special attention to the diner.
At such times you must remember, Lucullus dines with Lucullus!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An all-around good site that addresses the problem and offers
specific information about shopping and cooking for one is
``Cooking Solo'' at www.ext.nodak.edu/extpubs/yf/foods
</P>
<P>
   /he516w.htm by Joye Bond, nutrition specialist at North Dakota
State University.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Other university sites specifically geared to solo seniors are
Colorado State's ``Cooking for One'' at
www.colostate.edu/Depts/CoopExt/PUBS
</P>
<P>
   /COLUMNCC/cc970918.htm and Ohio State's ``Cooking for One or
Two'' at www.ag.ohio
</P>
<P>
   -state.edu/(tilde)ohioline/ss-fact/0161.html. Both present
helpful hints in a can-do way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  One difficulty facing people who cook for themselves is a
shortage of recipes. There are lots of tips and helpful hints, but
we could find no recipes on the Internet geared to just one person.
Don't let that be a hindrance. If you are cooking for yourself, you
can cook any recipe that strikes your fancy ... just do the math
accordingly. Because it's easy enough to buy a piece of fish you
need for one serving, we chose fish recipes originally written to
serve four and tested them for one.
</P>
<P>
   Fish is a good choice to put on the menu when you're cooking. To
search out some tasty and healthful seafood recipes, see
www.geocities
</P>
<P>
   .com/NapaValley/8645/
</P>
<P>
   indexofrecepies.htmlas.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients for stir-fry dishes and salads also can be adjusted
easily. There are tons of sites with recipes, but you can start
with busycooks.miningco.com/library/weekly
</P>
<P>
   /aa090798.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Another site where you may find some interesting and imaginative
recipes is ``Thai for Two'' at users.nova1.net/(tilde)thai4two/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For the solo traveler who dreads eating alone, see

www.abcnews.go.com/sections/travel
</P>
<P>
   /Crabby/eatsolo.html.

 &HT;    Test-kitchen secret: Simply fine recipes
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most home cooks I know have a Betty Crocker cookbook on their
shelves somewhere. I know I have two that have been with me for
decades. The first is a Betty Crocker Boys and Girls Cookbook _ a
bit wrinkled from a flood. But I used it just a few months ago to
make the castle birthday cake for a special neighbor's second
birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   The second is my mother's Betty book from the 1960s. I've used
it so much it has duct tape for binding.
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury is as familiar. I know my grandfather often served
Hungry Jack biscuits to go with his infamous gravy. My grandmother
used them to make dumplings. I'm delighted to find a new use for
Hungry Jacks in the Country Apple Coffee Cake below.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you firsthand that both the Carmelitas and the Tunnel
of Fudge recipes were a huge hit with my friends and office mates.
I've filed them in the special drawer in my kitchen where I keep
all my favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   And the ravioli from Betty's latest cookbook was not only great,
but it turned me on to the idea of using wonton wrappers as a
shortcut ravioli. I can't wait to stuff them with other ingredients
like cheese and greens.
</P>
<P>
   Why are the ideas that flow from the test kitchens of these two
food giants so appealing?
</P>
<P>
   Because they are simple and simply good.

   Susan Porubcan of Whitewater, Wis., created this biscuit
coffeecake that combines pastry-shop appearance with down-home
flavors. She won the grand prize in the Pillsbury Bake-Off in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Cake:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons margarine or butter, softened, divided
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Using 1 tablespoon of the margarine
or butter, generously grease a 9-inch round cake pan or 8-inch
square pan. Spread 1 cup of the apples in the greased pan.
</P>
<P>
   Separate dough into 10 biscuits; cut each into quarters. Arrange
biscuit pieces, points up, over apples. Top with remaining 1/2 cup
apples. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine remaining 1 tablespoon margarine or
butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, corn syrup, whiskey and egg; beat 2
to 3 minutes or until sugar is partially dissolved. Stir in pecans.
Spoon over biscuit pieces and apples. Bake 35 to 40 minutes or
until a deep golden brown. Cool 5 minutes. If desired, remove from
pan.
</P>
<P>
   For the glaze: In a small bowl, blend confectioners' sugar,
vanilla and enough milk for a desired drizzling consistency.
Drizzle over warm cake. Serve warm or cool. Store in refrigerator.

   Millicent Caplan of Tamarac, Fla., won top honors for this dish

   This recipe from the 17th bake-off contest is one of the most
popular Pillsbury recipes of all time. The cake was created by Ella
Helfrich of Houston, Texas, and originally called for a frosting
mix for the filling that is no longer available. So the Pillsbury
kitchens have updated the recipe _ but it's every bit as good. The
popularity of the bundt fluted tube pan increased after this recipe
won the contest, prompting the sole factory that produced it to go
on a 24-hour production schedule to keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   Filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1 (3.4-ounce) package chocolate fudge pudding and pie filling
mix (not instant)
</P>
<P>
   1 6-ounce package (1 cup) semisweet chocolate chips
</P>
<P>
   Cake:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/3 cups granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) butter, softened
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup shortening
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla

   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt

</P>
<P>
   Glaze:
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup confectioners' sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 teaspoons milk
</P>
<P>
   In medium saucepan, combine 1 1/2 cups milk and pudding mix;
cook as directed on package. Add chocolate chips; stir until
melted. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour 12-cup bundt pan or
10-inch tube pan. In large bowl, combine sugar, butter and
shortening; beat until light and fluffy. Add vanilla and eggs; mix
well. Lightly spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. Add flour,
1/2 cup cocoa, baking powder, salt and 1 cup milk; beat at low
speed until moistened. Beat 3 minutes at medium speed. Stir in
walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve 2 cups of the batter. Pour remaining batter into greased
and floured pan. Spoon filling in ring on top of batter, making
sure it does not touch sides of pan. (You may not use all the
filling, but you should use at least 2/3 of it.) Spoon reserved
batter over filling.
</P>
<P>
   Bake at 350 degrees for 50 to 60 minutes or until cake springs
back when touched lightly in center. Cool 1 hour; remove from pan.
Cool 1 1/2 hours or until completely cooled.
</P>
<P>
   In small bowl, blend all glaze ingredients, adding enough milk
for desired drizzling consistency. Spoon over top of cake, allowing
some to run down sides. Use very sharp or serrated knife to slice
cake. Best when served same day; store any remaining cake in
refrigerator. _ From ``The Best From 50 Years of Bake-Off

   These bars are absolutely yummy _ the test kitchens staff served
samples to visiting food stylists, home economists and journalists.
The bars were an entry in the 1967 contest, and this recipe, too,
is one of the most requested ever. Try the bars once, and you'll
see why.
</P>

   Crust:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Pillsbury Best All Purpose Flour
</P>
<P>
   2 cups quick-cooking rolled oats
</P>

<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt

   3 tablespoons Pillsbury Best All Purpose Flour
</P>
<P>
   1 (6 ounce) package (1 cup) semisweet chocolate chips

<P>
   1/2 cup chopped nuts
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 13-by-9-inch pan. Lightly
spoon flour into measuring cup; level off. In large bowl, combine
the flour, oats, brown sugar, baking soda, salt and margarine or
butter; mix at low speed until crumbly. Reserve half of crumb
mixture (about 3 cups) for topping. Press remaining crumb mixture
in bottom of greased pan. Bake for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in small bowl, combine caramel topping and 3
tablespoons flour; blend well. Remove partially baked crust from
oven; sprinkle with chocolate chips and nuts. Drizzle evenly with
caramel mixture; sprinkle with reserved crumb mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Return to oven; bake an additional 18 to 22 minutes or until
golden brown. Cool 1 hour or until completely cooled. Refrigerate 1
to 2 hours or until filling is set. Cut into bars. _ From: ``The

   Creative home cooks across the country are busy cooking up new
ideas and old favorites to enter the 50th anniversary Pillsbury
Bake-Off, to be held Feb. 26-29 in San Francisco. The grand prize
has grown a bit from the original $50,000 in 1949 _ it is now $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   But before a recipe can reach that pinnacle, it will undergo a
great deal of scrutiny in the Pillsbury test kitchens. At the close
of the entry phase in October, all entries will be screened by an
independent agency to make sure they meet all the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Then each recipe will be assigned a code number, and the
entrant's name and address is removed. Coded recipes then go to
home economists who will read through them again, eliminating those
that are inaccurate, too involved or require unusual equipment or
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the field is narrowed to 1,000 entries, and from
there home economists get cooking _ sampling and evaluating every
detail of each recipe. At the same time, another team digs through
a library of publications, making sure recipes have not been
previously published or chosen as winners in contests.
</P>
<P>
   Then consumers at a number of locations around the country will
be asked to try the recipes and rate them on two general criteria:
overall appeal and quick and easy preparation. These consumers are
not made aware that they are bake-off entries, and their ratings
are kept confidential until the final judging, when they are
revealed only to the judging panel.
</P>
<P>
   By December, the field will be narrowed to 100. Notifying those
folks can be tricky for Pillsbury. Sally Peters, director of
consumer foods and publications for Pillsbury, said they've had to
use the highway patrol, the U.S. Forest Service and local CB radio
users to track down finalists.
</P>
<P>
   The final 100 contestants are given an all-expenses-paid trip to
San Francisco for the final competition, in which contestants will
have a set time to prepare their recipes and send them to judges.
</P>
<P>
   Entries for the bake-off must be postmarked on or before Oct. 18
and received no later than Oct. 22. For an entry blank, call
1-800-306-1111 or go online at www.bakeoff.com. Entries may be
submitted electronically via the Web site.

   Betty Crocker recently sponsored a dessert mix contest, and the
grand prize went to the Trinity Lutheran Church Women of Birchwood,
Wis., who created this irresistible combination of a brownie, a
Rice Krispies treat and a Reese's Cup.
</P>
<P>
   1 package (1 pound, 3.8 ounces) Betty Crocker fudge brownie mix
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup water

<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease (or use cooking spray) the
bottom of a rectangular pan (13 by 9 by 2 inches). Stir brownie
mix, water, oil and eggs in medium bowl until well-blended. Spread

   It's not hard to see why this recipe made it into ``Betty
Crocker's Best-Loved Recipes'' (Macmillan, $24.95). The sauce is
truly a classic taste. This summer, try finishing these off on the
grill, brushing on sauce during the last five minutes of cooking
and setting some sauce on the table.

   The beauty of many of the Betty Crocker cookbooks is that they
cover the basics, like pizza crust and coffeecake, and then show
you how to make some of the more elegant dishes, too. That's
especially true of their latest, ``Betty Crocker's A Passion for
Pasta'' (Macmillan, $21.95), which includes everything from ``pasta
in a pinch'' to pasta from scratch. We especially liked this dish,
which uses wonton wrappers as a shortcut for ravioli and easy
additions of shredded carrot and ginger to give canned tomato sauce
a more exotic twist.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound ground chicken or turkey
</P>
<P>
   5 cloves garlic, finely chopped, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated ginger root, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper (cayenne)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspon salt
</P>
<P>
   20 wonton wrappers (3 1/2-inch squares)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons margarine or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, shredded ( 1/2 cup)
</P>
<P>
   1 can (15 ounces) chunky garlic-and-herb tomato sauce
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh cilantro, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Mix chicken, 3 chopped cloves of garlic, 1 teaspoon ginger root,
the coriander, red pepper and salt. Place 1 tablespoon of the
chicken mixture on center of each wonton wrapper. Moisten edges of
wrappers lightly with water. Fold wrappers over filling, forming
triangles; press edges to seal.
</P>
<P>
   Melt margarine or butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat.
Add the onion, carrot, remaining garlic and remaining 2 teaspoons
ginger root and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in
tomato sauce; reduce heat. Simmer uncovered 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While sauce is simmering, heat 4 quarts water to boiling. Drop
ravioli into boiling water; reduce heat. Simmer about 4 minutes or
until chicken is no longer pink. Begin testing for doneness when
ravioli rise to surface of water. Drain well. Spoon tomato sauce
over ravioli. Sprinkle with cilantro.

 &HT;    Corona's success is in marketing, not taste
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The decor at La Cazuela, a Mexican restaurant in
Cumming (GA.), is bright as a parrot, the food simple but artfully
prepared and the beer list as Mexican as you'd want.
</P>
<P>
   Tecate, Dos Equis, Carta Blanca, Negra Modelo _ they're all
there and they're not alone. There's another beer that's impossible
to ignore these days: Corona.
</P>
<P>
   With a wedge of lime jammed in its neck, a clear glass bottle of
Corona is a familiar sight not only in Mexican restaurants but
yuppie bars as well. Indeed, Corona, a brand originally made for
field hands, has become the No. 1 imported beer in the United
States, surpassing Heineken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corona's triumph,'' The New York Times prominently reported on
its business pages recently, ``is a testimony to the power of
clever marketing.'' Growing numbers of Americans, as the Times
noted, are happy to pay $6 and more for a six-pack that goes for
less than $2.50 in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be explained simply by differences in currency. Here is
a thoroughly dreadful beer, ignored a decade ago, transformed into
a beach bum's Dom Perignon. What kind of marketing works wonders
like this?
</P>
<P>
   ``The key,'' as the Times reported, ``seems to be (Corona's)
shrewd tactics in appealing to a core group of Mexicans living in
the United States while giving Corona a special cachet among
American college students and 20-somethings.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it's like the cachet that Coors enjoyed in the
'60s, except that Coors for years was smart enough to remain a
regional beer. Unable to buy it outside Colorado or the Rocky
Mountain states, college students from the East would borrow pickup
trucks and drive halfway across country to load up on a beer they
could not have distinguished from Miller High Life if you'd
blindfolded them.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you can buy Coors in Dunwoody as easily as Denver,
there's nothing particularly special about it _ not that there ever
was. But clever marketing means creating an image in people's
minds, regardless of the merits of the product.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that there are any number of Mexican beers better
than Corona _ and a few just as awful. None of them is really
exceptional (most diminish their character by adding corn) and none
is intrinsically ``Mexican.'' But such light-bodied, golden beers
as Tecate, Carta Blanca and Superior will slake the thirst while
providing a vaguely pilsner taste better than Corona. (For that
matter, so will Budweiser.)
</P>
<P>
   But these beers scarcely exist in most buyers' minds. It's the
image of that enameled, clear-glass bottle they see. And that lime
(which probably does more good than harm, given the taste without
it).
</P>
<P>
   Corona's success in the United States, the British beer writer
and judge Michael Jackson writes, ``has done a disservice to
Mexican beer. Corona is a cheaply made, watery, sweetish beer,
originally intended simply as a thirst quencher for manual
laborers.''
</P>
<P>
   And by the time it reaches distant markets (like Atlanta), it's
frequently light-struck as well.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Tim Morse, head brewer for the John Harvard's chain
of brewpubs, conducted a seminar in Atlanta. Its purpose was to
help people recognize faults in a beer. One by one, various off
flavors that had been intentionally created _ some subtle, others
sharply unpleasant _ were identified and their causes explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the session Morse poured into glasses a few ounces
of beer he had bought that morning in an Atlanta store. He was
careful to conceal the bottle he was pouring from, but everyone
immediately recognized a ``skunky'' taste.
</P>
<P>
   The beer was light-struck, and it was Corona.
</P>
<P>
   The cause: the transparent bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason beer is usually bottled in brown. Dark glass
reduces light penetration. A green bottle _ Heineken, Pilsner
Urquell and Moosehead, among others _ doesn't do it nearly as well.
But it does it better than clear glass.
</P>
<P>
   Along with heat (prolonged storage at, say, 75 degrees or
higher), nothing destroys the flavor of beer like exposure to
light. Not just sunlight but also the fluorescent lighting of
supermarkets and package stores. Once the yeast begins to go bad,
the beer goes bad.
</P>
<P>
   And yet light is at the heart of Corona's marketing image, even
more than subliminal messages about Cancun or other tropical
locales. When Miller High Life, its golden hues visible through
clear glass, used to market itself as ``the Champagne of Bottled
Beer,'' no one took it seriously and no one thought to ask for a
lime. It was just another Milwaukee lager, more or less the same as
Schlitz. You don't see either of those old American standbys much
anymore. In fact, in many a restaurant you'll find more beers from
Mexico than from Milwaukee. A few are fine but little known. The
best-known among them would make me settle for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   PICK OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   The name doesn't make you think of cactus or Cancun, tacos or
anything remotely tropical. Bohemia, after all, was in Central
Europe, not Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But the best golden lager from Mexico might well be Bohemia,
named after the birthplace of the style. The golden Superior is
respectable but less consistent. Others, such as the amber Dos
Equis and the darker Negra Modelo, are excellent with Mexican
dishes but are closer to the maltier Vienna lager style. Bohemia is
in the pilsner style most Americans look toward, and it doesn't
take liberties in calling itself a pilsner.
</P>
<P>
   Light to medium in body, it has a nice hoppiness without being
assertive. If there's corn in the grist _ typical of Mexican beers
_ it's less than in most. It's not an especially complex beer, but
you can detect the barley malt character, something that can't be
said of most golden Mexican lagers.
</P>
<P>
   Bohemia, in fact, is better than most American mass market
lagers and comparable to many imports brewed in the pilsner style.
At La Cazuela in Cumming (Ga.), as at most Mexican restaurants,
Bohemia occupies its place on the menu without fanfare. But
longtime aficionados of that cuisine know that, along with Dos
Equis and Negra Modelo, this is the one to look for.

 &HT;    Well known rivals General Mills and Pillsbury are researching,
testing and refining much of what America eats
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Stroll down the hallway of test kitchens at
General Mills any given day and you might hear the ground beef
sizzling in skillets in a Hawaiian-themed kitchen with faux thatch
roof, where Hamburger Helper products are tested.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the aroma of bread baking will entice you to the
blue-and-white Cape Cod kitchen, where nearly a dozen bread
machines are lining the countertops, kneading and baking the latest
bread mix.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few miles away, there's another set of kitchens _ all
sleek, with a fair touch of stainless steel.
</P>
<P>
   There, each afternoon, a panel of tasters gathers round to
sample the day's projects _ perhaps a new rendition of an old
Pillsbury favorite, such as the Tunnel of Fudge Cake, or some new
trick with Old El Paso bottled salsa.
</P>
<P>
   New York and Los Angeles may be the temples of trendsetting
cuisine, but the heart of American home cooking lies here in the
heartland _ at the home of Betty Crocker and Poppin' Fresh.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 100 years, General Mills and the Pillsbury Co.
have grown up in the same Minneapolis neighborhood, competing and
co-existing, with the shared goal of getting us into the kitchen.
And they apparently succeed: Last year their combined sales totaled
more than $15 billion ($9 billion for Pillsbury; $6 billion for
General Mills), about 3 1/2 percent of all grocery store sales.
</P>
<P>
   They supply us the staples _ Gold Medal and Pillsbury flours;
the conveniences _ Hamburger Helper, Hungry Jack biscuits; and the
inspiration _ Betty Crocker Cookbooks and the Pillsbury Bake-Off.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as importantly, they're willing to do whatever it
takes to give us the confidence to use their products again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of their products or recipes reach your kitchen, they
go through a rigorous process of research and testing that attempts
to account for everything from battered old pans (you know how your
favorite cookie sheet looks) to haphazard measuring (the ``looks
about right'' approach).
</P>
<P>
   ``People always tell you their oven is right, but in the next
breath they'll say they always take things out early,'' said Kay
Emel-Powell, manager of Betty Crocker test kitchens. ``We have to
see how a product or a recipe will perform under all the
variables.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason the home economists also go by the more modern
and accurate title _ consumer food scientists.
</P>
<P>
   At Betty Crocker, the scientists and their assistants work in
seven artfully decorated kitchens _ each reflecting a different
American region or style, from Colonial Williamsburg to tropical
Hawaiian. That's because until 1985, the public was allowed to tour
the test kitchens, so the company wanted to present something more
than an industrial look. They wanted the kitchens to remind folks
of home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are three ``camera kitchens'' where the food
photography for Betty Crocker cookbooks and magazines takes place.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pillsbury Consumer Food Center, there are 20 test
kitchens to work with Pillsbury foods, Pillsbury Bake-Off entrants
and several other product lines that are a part of the company,
including Progresso and Haagen-Dazs brands. Here, the look is more
modern, with remodeling having taken place four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern beginnings
</P>
<P>
   Both clusters of kitchens are impressive, given the fairly
humble beginnings of their companies. General Mills began as a
single mill in 1866, built by Cadwallader C. Washburn on the banks
of the Mississippi in Minneapolis. It was known as ``Washburn's
Folly'' by those who were sure there would be little demand for
Midwestern spring wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
   It was no folly, and in 1880, Washburn's flour received the gold
medal at the Millers' International Exhibition, and thus became
known as Gold Medal Flour.
</P>
<P>
   In 1881, Charles Pillsbury, along with his father, George, was
attracted by the same Midwestern wheat and the same river and built
the first Pillsbury mill.
</P>
<P>
   Such close proximity between the two rivals does call for added
measures of secrecy. In fact, one reason Betty Crocker stopped
public tours of its test kitchens was concern over security. Both
companies did, however, recently agree to give a group of visiting
food professionals and journalists a peek inside their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Stages of development
</P>
<P>
   The initial stages of product or recipe development begin with
home economists, researchers, manufacturers and marketers all
brainstorming (called ``ideation'' at Pillsbury). The test kitchen
staff is expected to track trends in tastes, technologies and
techniques for cooking, along with shifting lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, both companies rely on surveys and focus groups with
consumers. They learn, for instance, that while there may be
insulated baking pans in stores, most people have ``good old
aluminum pans'' at home, explained Powell.
</P>
<P>
   They know if you take five people and ask them to measure a cup
of water, you're likely to get five different amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also monitor current periodicals and cookbooks
extensively, which helps them gauge trends. They know, for
instance, when cilantro is in and sun-dried tomatoes are out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have someone reading all the magazines and newspapers,
tracking every recipe and ingredient for our database,'' explained
Andi Bidwell, senior food editor at Pillsbury. ``We can pull up
every garlic recipe that has been printed within the last year and
test 100 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   This early brainstorming will lead to ideas for new products or
new flavors and variations on old products. At Betty Crocker, for
instance, when Americans began shifting from ground beef to chicken
as a standard weeknight meat, the idea of Chicken Helper was
hatched.
</P>
<P>
   For food products, the developers and manufacturers then take
the idea to the factory to see how it will be produced. They'll
return to the test kitchens with different versions of the product
to be tested and tasted.
</P>
<P>
   The critical phase here _ as in the testing of recipes for
cookbooks and magazines _ is known as tolerance testing. This is
where the recipe or product is prepared a number of different ways
to account for all the usual errors or practices, such as doubling
ingredients without adjusting the cooking time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We test all our recipes using butter, margarine and Parkay,
which has a high water content,'' said Jill Crum, a home economist
and test kitchen manager for Pillsbury. ``We'll do the recipe as
written, then try it with the flour lower and the fat and sugar
higher. Then vice versa. Then at different temperatures. It has to
be acceptable in each test.''
</P>
<P>
   At both companies' kitchens, home equipment is used rather than
professional stock in order to best replicate the home kitchen
experience. Products such as bread machine mixes are tested on all
the major brands of bread machines available. And they have testers
in mountainous areas such Albuquerque, N.M., who test and write the
high-altitude directions.
</P>
<P>
   Data from each test are charted _ such as prep time, cooking
time, the type and temperature of the oven, ingredient
measurements, the utensils used and the result. Once it has passed
through the tolerance testing phase, a recipe will go to a tester
who hasn't previously seen it for a final run. ``They find the
flaws that occurred as the recipes were rewritten, like including
bacon on the ingredient list, but not saying what should be done
with it,'' said Crum.
</P>
<P>
   Contest prep
</P>
<P>
   At Pillsbury, recipe testing goes into high gear every two years
for its popular Bake-Off, the granddaddy of all cooking contests.
The test kitchens receive thousands of entries vying for the grand
prize of $1 million (up from the $50,000 grand prize in the first
contest 50 years ago).
</P>
<P>
   After an initial screening, the test kitchen will make 1,000 of
the recipes in an effort to whittle down the list of contenders to
100. Literally dozens of extra testers _ many college students
studying consumer science _ work long hours to try out the contest
entries.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Sally Peters, director of consumer foods and
publications, got her start at Pillsbury 23 years ago. She's been
testing recipes ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is not only knowing something about the science of
food,'' said Peters, ``but also knowing the culinary side of it.
You have to love food to do this job.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just as essential to have a feel for what the public wants
to eat _ and is willing to make.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Crocker's Powell agrees. ``You definitely build up taste
and food knowledge that others don't have,'' she says. ``You also
are grounded in `Bettyness.' ''
</P>

   Betty Crocker
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1921, Betty Crocker began as a pen name for the consumer
response department of the Washburn Crosby Co., a flour mill
founded in Minneapolis in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The surname Crocker was chosen to honor a popular director of
the company, William G. Crocker. Betty was chosen because it was a
friendly-sounding name. Women employees submitted signatures; the
one chosen is still used today.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  General Mills was formed through the merger of several
regional milling companies in 1928; Betty Crocker was maintained as
a company icon and a brand name.

<P>
   &QR;  Betty Crocker cake mixes hit the market in 1947, when
GingerCake first appeared on grocers' shelves. PartyCake and
Devil's Food followed soon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In 1950, ``Betty Crocker's Picture Cook Book'' was first
published and became a national best seller. More than 200
cookbooks have been published since, along with a monthly recipe
magazine sold at grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  There have been eight portraits of Betty Crocker from 1936 to

 &HT;    Krall goes for vintage and variety
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An acolyte of a certain kind of mood evoked by the phrase ``pop
standard,'' Canadian vocalist Diana Krall has become a star by
reviving the sexy gentility of songs jazz musicians have been
bending and adapting for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, she's smarter than your average throwback diva: Krall's a
pianist first, and she's no stranger to the blues. She hires
excellent musicians, including former Atlantan Russell Malone,
whose guitar work is animated by sly mutations of familiar forms.
Along with bassist Ben Wolfe, the trio finds something freshly
appealing in Cole Porter, Irving Berlin, Harry Warren and George
Gershwin, classic ``tunesmiths'' whose songs, timeless when Ella
Fitzgerald sang them, have become a well-worn currency.
</P>
<P>
   This, the third of Krall's major-label albums, is also her most
ambitious. Songs boast a greater variety of arrangements _ with
Johnny Mandel cueing an orchestra on several tracks, and the trio
swelling to quartet or quintet on others _ and help to steer Krall
away from a potential niche implied by her previous success with
the Dave Frishberg novelty, ``Peel Me a Grape.'' There's a nod in
that direction: a frisky reading of Michael Franks' ``Popsicle
Toes'' that will likely become an airplay favorite. But, mostly,
Krall sticks with vintage, such as a version of Porter's ``I've Got
You Under My Skin'' that profits from the syncopated insinuations
of bossa nova, as strings swell in the background. Effortless and
elegant, Krall is refining a sound that, without blazing trails, is
quietly reinventing the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When
</P>
<P>
   I Look in Your Eyes''

 &HT;    `Taxi Driver's' terror more relevant than ever
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A grim masterpiece of the 1970s, Martin Scorsese's brooding,
bloody ``Taxi Driver'' seems more vital than ever in the wake of
recent high school shootings, not to mention such madmen as Ted
Kaczynski and the Centennial Olympic Park bomber. A new DVD
collector's edition offers a crisp audio-visual version of the
film, plus fine extras. These include an interactive version of
Paul Schrader's shooting script, selected storyboards and an
hourlong documentary on the making of the 1976 movie. (Suggested
retail price: $26.99.)
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his Oscar-winning role as the young Vito Corleone in
``The Godfather Part II,'' Robert De Niro plays insomniac cabbie
Travis Bickle, who prowls the nighttime streets of New York,
simmering with disgust at the hookers, pimps and drug addicts
shadowing its sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not so much his puritanism and racism that spark his
vigilante actions. It's a bigger problem, his inability to connect
with other people _ specifically, Cybill Shepherd. The
cream-and-honey personification of his fantasy view of women, she's
a presidential campaign worker who's at first charmed by Travis'
alternative-airwave viewpoint, then unnerved by it. (The porn movie
he treats her to on their first date doesn't help his case.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie is quietly terrifying as it charts how loneliness and
missed connections can translate into gruesome dreams of grandeur,
helped along by a cache of heavy artillery. Plotting a masturbatory
kamikaze strike on the world, Travis focuses his efforts first on a
senator, then the prostitution ring run by Harvey Keitel, whose
jewel is 12 1/2-year-old hooker Iris (Jodie Foster).
</P>
<P>
   With slo-mo, jumpy edits and some eccentric camerawork, Scorsese
sucks us directly into Travis' head as he preps for one of the
bloodiest finales in film. Scariest of all is the deadpan ending,
which finds psychopath Travis lauded for his actions, welcomed back
into the world as a folk hero. This cynical view of the sliding
scale of fame has proved to be prophetic in the 23 years since the
movie opened. Proof of its spooky accuracy: John Hinckley Jr.'s
Travis-inspired attempt to kill Ronald Reagan, an attempt to win
the attention of actress Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp cast also includes Albert Brooks as Shepherd's
amiable, dry co-worker, Peter Boyle as a taxi driver who tries to
get Travis to lighten up, and Scorsese himself, powerful as a
cuckolded husband with murder on his mind. The score, a mixture of
horror-movie stings and lush jazz lament, was by Bernard Herrmann
(``Psycho'') _ his last. The movie earned four Oscar nominations,
including best picture, actor (De Niro), supporting actress
(Foster) and original score.
</P>
<P>
   The making-of documentary on the DVD includes interviews with De
Niro, Foster, Keitel, Shepherd, Brooks, Schrader and
cinematographer Michael Chapman. One note that they hit is
consistent: The Method devotion of De Niro, who got a chauffeur's
license and drove a taxi in New York as prep for the movie, and
whose performance gave Shepherd a genuine case of the willies.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also learn more than you may want to about the bloody
makeup effects and the reason the colors are desaturated in the
climactic gunplay scenes. Interesting trivia: Foster's young friend
onscreen was actually the real girl who inspired Schrader's
teen-hooker character. Scorsese had not intended to be in the movie
(except for a cameo shot of him sitting outside the campaign office
when Shepherd makes her entrance). De Niro didn't shave his head;
that's actually a skullcap, and the Mohawk is made of horsehair.
</P>
<P>
   And for the record, in his script Schrader wrote only a
description of Travis talking to himself in the mirror. De Niro
improvised that famous riff, ``You talkin' to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the parodies, those words are spookier than ever
more than two decades after ``Taxi Driver'' came out.

 &HT;    Brothers' scheme not so simple
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Simple Plan'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   Fans of chain saw-happy director Sam Raimi (the ``Evil Dead''
movies) won't recognize his restrained, mournful work here. That's
not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton plays a family man in small-town, snowy Minnesota
who, with his slow-witted brother (Oscar nominee Billy Bob
Thornton) stumbles upon a crashed plane that has a corpse inside .
. . and also a bagful of $4 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the guys' plan? Simple. Well, at first anyway. The
brothers and Thornton's best pal (Brent Briscoe) agree to split the
cash. But greed takes hold, and soon the snow is splashed with
blood.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's cold setting clashes with the eruption of hot
passions. Raimi's tone likewise strikes a balance, managing to be
tragic and darkly funny at the same time.

 &HT;    Rhythms rule in Missy's `World'
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Missy is many admirable things. Nowhere on that list, however,
is the artist's simple, stream-of-consciousness rhyme style. To her
advantage, though, when producer Timbaland's energetic drums kick
in _ as on her first single, ``She's a Bitch,'' and the charismatic
``Smooth Chick'' _ that deficiency is easily overlooked in favor of
his imaginative and muscular rhythms. Missy's a better writer, able
to make slang such as ``All N My Grill'' and ``Stickin Chickens''
into incredibly catchy songs, if not particularly smart ones. Just
as notably, when it comes to singing, the underappreciated vocalist
proves she can move easily from rap to the rankings of such young
R&AMP;B talents as Coko or Faith Evans on the emotive ``Crazy
Feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, the heading on this review is ``rap'' because that's
what Missy insists upon doing most of the time. Only, passably.

   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror Twilight''
</P>
<P>
   Pavement. Matador. 11 tracks. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Pavement was such a ramshackle outfit that
it could barely sustain a coherent song for more than two minutes.
Lo-fi as a musical designation was practically invented to describe
the quintet. Though many miss the unhinged early days, the relative
discipline of the last few albums has allowed the band's strengths
to shine. Stephen Malkmus' gift for melody could fuel a hundred
Hansons. Catchy tunes run through odd chord progressions like fudge
ripple through ice cream, a tasty treat that makes you wish for
more. These guys have never been virtuosos, but they're adept at
quirky turns of instrumental phrasing, strange tonalities and
hair-trigger timing. When those strengths combine, it's simply the
perfect mix of sweet and sour.

   ``Wild Wild West Soundtrack''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Overbrook/Interscope. 15 tracks. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Infectious in spite of Will Smith's almost Al Gore-like
blandness, the ``Wild Wild West'' title track wins with guest
vocalist Sisqo's energy and Stevie Wonder's classic ``I Wish''
underneath. In fact, the entire soundtrack spills over with such
remarkable combos. Remarkable in a good way when we're talking
about Lil' Bow Wow and Atlantan Jermaine Dupri's bouncy ``Stick
Up'' or the taut strings local producers Tim &AMP; Bob apply to MC
Lyte's aptly titled ``Keep It Movin.'' It's remarkable in another
way when the usually lethal rappers Eminem and Dr. Dre fire an
uninspired dud (``Bad Guys Always Die''). And the long-sought
reunion of R&AMP;B trio Guy finds Aaron Hall relegated to background
vocals on ``The Best.''

   ``The Red Violin''

<P>
   Score by John Corigliano. Joshua Bell, violin, with the
Philharmonia Orchestra, Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor. Sony
Classical. 20 tracks. Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's new film, ``The Red Violin,'' is a picaresque
chronicle of the 350-year journey of a fine Italian instrument,
from its birth in Cremona around 1650 to a high-profile auction
today. The music is by far the most authentic thing about the
movie, which goes for melodrama and histrionics over musical
integrity. American composer John Corigliano based his score on a
bittersweet chaconne for strings, the theme of the tarot card
reader who foretells the violin's adventures. So closely has
Corigliano honored Vivaldi (a concerto grosso played by an
orphanage orchestra) and Bach (a partita played by a 6-year-old
prodigy) that you'll wonder if he's stumbled on some lost scores.
The violin's theme is a languorous lament, played by Joshua Bell (a
soloist with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra next season) with
appropriate passion and not too much schmaltz.

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ The four scraggly
thieves stopped Albana Koshe's car by the woods because they wanted
a ride, but under her tenacious questioning they provided a clue in
her dreadful quest. Yes, they said, they had been released from a
Serb jail as the Serbs withdrew from Kosovo. In jail, they said,
they worked in the kitchen cutting bread, so they knew that 150 men
from her town had been brought there. Finally, providing the answer
she dreaded, they said they recognized her brother, Alban, among
them. The world now watches ethnic Albanian refugees return to a
NATO-controlled Kosovo, but, for Koshe and thousands of others from
her region the war is over but not resolved. Their relatives are
being held prisoner and, it appears, have been taken to Serbia by
the withdrawing troops. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

ENDANGERED FISH THREATENS CALIFORNIA WATER SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A tiny endangered fish that lives a year,
then dies, is hanging around too long in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta, prompting a water shortage for the Silicon Valley and
California's vast agribusiness operations.
</P>
<P>
   Federal environmental law protects the 3-inch-long Delta smelt,
a source of food for salmon. When the smelt swims near massive
water pumps in the Delta, the operations must slow down so the fish
don't get sucked up and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown is causing massive amounts of fresh Delta water to
simply flow into the Pacific Ocean instead of to Southern
California. That has prompted the accelerated drainage of San Luis
Reservoir west of Los Banos in Merced County, a major source of
water to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   By August, Santa Clara County will have to tap its ground water
and local reserves because silty water from the lowered San Luis
Reservoir is no longer pure enough to process delicate high-tech
products or supply 1.7 million customers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very, very serious problem we are facing,'' state
Sen. Jim Costa, a Democrat from Fresno, said at a special
legislative hearing on the problem Tuesday. ``What we have here is
the linchpin of the plumbing system for the state of California.
Over half of our state's population gets its water from the Delta,
and we have a system that is severely stressed.''
</P>
<P>
   For Silicon Valley computer and chip manufacturers, the crisis
means a loss of up to one-third of their water supply.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said they are concerned about health and safety
issues because local supplies aren't as pure as water from San
Luis.
</P>
<P>
   Switching to lower-quality water means substantial costs to
Silicon Valley businesses because they have to upgrade their
treatment facilities. Many manufacturing processes require
ultra-clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it's going to be a substantial cost and cause
substantial difficulty,'' said Walt Wadlow, assistant general
manager of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. ``We won't have
the kind of insurance in terms of water supply that we expected to
have going into the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta smelt has become a sort of aquatic spotted owl, a
focal point for farmers and others who see environmental laws
interfering with the state's huge water needs. A 1992 federal
agreement requires 10 percent of Central Valley water be used to
protect fish and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Some Central Valley lawmakers and water agencies would like to
use the current Delta smelt crisis to change how the U.S.
Endangered Species Act effects their business needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply can't have a crisis every time a fish population
moves in the way of the pumps,'' said Timothy Quinn, deputy general
manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California,
which serves 16 million people. ``The smelt are going to be in the
system next June and May, and if we're sitting in front of this
committee next year, heads should roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the slowdown at the pumps, farmers face a critical
shortage of water at the same time the summer weather is hottest.
</P>
<P>
   Many crops were planted with the expectation farmers would
receive a certain amount of water, and the supplies have already
been reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta smelt are usually out of the way of the pumps by the
end of May, but they continue to linger for unknown reasons and
officials have declined to allow the pumps to be started
full-force. On Tuesday, a gradual increase in pump capacity began,
but the damage has already been done for the summer, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put continued stress on the system due to the Delta smelt
is putting a lot of farmers at significant risk,'' said David Orth,
with the Westlands Water District, which manages federal water
contracts. ``We will not be able to meet the needs of farmers
through July and August.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta has been described as the gills of California. The
pumping stations near Tracy were constructed in 1968 to ship water
from the plentiful Delta through the California Aqueduct system.
Southern California uses about 80 percent of the water taken from
the Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The area is the home to several endangered salmon species.
</P>
<P>
   The Splittail and the Delta smelt also are protected by the
federal Endangered Species Act. Thousands of other types of fish
are routinely sucked through the pumps, but they aren't protected
by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups testifying Tuesday said the pumps near
Tracy have sucked up and killed 100,000 Delta smelt _ five times
the allowable number. Rather than continuing policies that kill
more endangered fish, they said, farmers and water agencies should
look to other sources or reduce exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``This did not start because one fish went over the take,'' said
Gary Bobker, program director for The Bay Institute. Bobker
estimated that 75 percent of the Delta smelt are in danger zones.

<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS (Mexico City) _ In a little-remarked but crucial
shift, the technocrats' 18-year domination of Mexican politics,
during which government policies have modernized the economy but
impoverished the country's working class majority, appears to be
ending. Unlike President Ernesto Zedillo (Yale Ph.D.'78) and his
two predecessors, Carlos Salinas de Gortari, (Harvard Ph.D.'78) and
Miguel de la Madrid, (Harvard M.A.'65) none of the four candidates
currently seeking the presidential nomination of the governing
party, the PRI, which has won 11 straight presidential elections
here, are technocrats. By Sam Dillon. (Eds: May hold).

perspectives represented the division of opinion that appears to be
growing here. By Stephen Kinzer.

</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-STATES'-RIGHTS (Washington) _ State governments cannot be
sued against their will in state courts by people seeking to
enforce some federal right, the Supreme Court said Wednesday in a
major decision on states' rights. In a richly written 5-4 ruling,
the court said that the Constitution's ``structure and history''
shields states not only from being sued in federal courts, but also
makes them immune from individuals' state court lawsuits seeking to
enforce a federal right. By Linda Greenhouse.

a fairly expansive political and policy agenda. Plans to intensify
battery of Republicans for failure of gun legislation, announce a
new environmental initiative, unveil his Medicare plan and tour
poverty-mired regions from Appalachia to an Indian reservation to
talk about new investment to help the poor. Heavy fund-raising
schedule for congressional Democrats and continuing efforts to
juggle the competing Clinton, Hillary, Gore agendas. By John
Broder.

oldest and most famous of California's nude beaches, may be history
as town clamps down. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAID-DENTAL (Manchester, N.H.) _ Even though the vast
majority of the poorest Americans, particularly children, are
covered by Medicaid for dental care, they are not getting it. At
least, not in numbers anywhere near that of children better off and
not at levels near what they need. Why not? Several reasons,
experts say. Most dentists tend to be loath to take Medicaid
patients because the program scrimps on payments and involves
pencil-breaking bureaucracy; also, Medicaid patients, often with
transport and day-care problems, are likelier to miss appointments.
By Carey Goldberg. (Eds: May hold.)

<P>
   S.C.-POLITICS (Columbia, S.C.) _ South Carolina's primary is
going to be more crucial than ever this campaign season to
Republicans, who are showing up earlier and more often than in
years past. By David Firestone.

<P>
   GUNS-LAWSUITS (Undated) _ As a sign of the impact on gun

police themselves. By Fox Butterfield.

SAN FRANCISCO PUTS THE `X' ON THESE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The X Games are nearly upon us, and don't you
dare laugh, wise guy. You've been living right in the middle of the
X Games ever since you moved here, only nobody thought to give it a
name and sell T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you think about it, San Francisco is the absolutely
ideal place for the X Games, in the same way that New Orleans is
the perfect place for the Super Bowl, Montreal is the perfect place
for the Stanley Cup, and anywhere else is the perfect place for the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   We have all the X Games any town could need, and that's just at
the bike messenger hiring hall. We have all the dangerous pastimes
you could try, all the places to try them, and we don't really need
to build a single ramp, spread even a truckload of gravel, or even
move a single chair. In fact, we host the perfect X Games event on
the last Friday of every month when the bike riders and commuters
do symbiotic war at every freeway onramp.
</P>
<P>
   We are, frankly, perfect. In fact, we are more than perfect.
Give us two days for permits and brochures, and we could out-X the
X Games without breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   We could take the skateboarders to the top of Lombard Street and
give them a shove. Stop and you lose. If more than one makes it to
the bottom without leaving a trail of screams and scabs, bring 'em
back to the top of the hill, blindfold them and shove again.
</P>
<P>
   We could make them skate the Bay to Breakers, with the multiple
horrors that entails. Yes, we could dress them up as Mary
Engelbreit teapots, pregnant chickens, multiheaded nurses or
Charles Durning impersonators, lead them to the starting line with
80,000 other lunatics and send them on their way. Through the
badlands of South of Market, up the Hayes Street Hill, through the
Park and all the way to the beach _ and we'll even leave the option
of not turning left at the shoreline up to them.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, there's X and then there's X.
</P>
<P>
   Or, worst of all, we could have them ride down the stairs at
Candlestick Friday night wearing Dodger caps and shirts that read,
``Dusty Baker Likes Polka Music.'' They'd all be X-Gamers in the
X-est sense of all.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're probably not noticing a huge difference between this
and everyday San Francisco living, surely no more dangerous than
running through the Tenderloin neighborhood without shoes. You
surely won't be able to discern the difference in dress between X
Gamers and mailroom workers on casual days at Bank of America,
except for the bibs the X Gamers have to wear for television.
</P>
<P>
   But the X Games being a national matter, thanks to ESPN's need
for programming that doesn't require a rights fee, much of what the
athletes do as competition seems odd to the sheltered Midwestern
eye, in the same way that their behavior would be if they all
congregated in a mall parking lot and created a disturbance outside
Hickory Farms.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, it's actually tame stuff. Driving Grant Avenue
without swearing is an X Game. Slaloming around the street artists
around Pier 39 is an X Game. Outsmarting the meter cops is an X
Game, with a dollop of Y and Z Game on the side.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means we can't try to give our newest guests a
little more than they figured on when they arrived here.
</P>
<P>
   We could assemble the BMX riders and their lighter-than-air
bikes, and let them run the Fifth Street gantlet with the cab
drivers. Not only is that X, we can all but guarantee an X-rider or
two.
</P>
<P>
   We could also get the bladers, strap a hundredweight of Beach
Blanket Babylon hats to their heads and have a joust on Van Ness
with 2-by-4s.
</P>
<P>
   We could make them climb the Vaillancourt Fountain while
balancing hot lattes on their heads, or plunge down the stairway of
Coit Tower, or ride through City Hall with a tray full of paint
without spilling a drop. Losers would have to listen to a lecture
by Mayor Willie Brown on being neat in the palace halls.
</P>
<P>
   We could assemble the winners, match them up against our own
local team (which could be assembled in about an hour, tops), and
bet the budget surplus on our side. Not to disrespect the X Gamers,
but frankly, the X Games are what they train for, while we do them
every day just to get to work. The one is a labor of love, the
other is trying to avoid being hit by a city bus.
</P>
<P>
   In such matters, one should always side with the more motivated
group.
</P>
<P>
   And don't even start on how the post-Games party would work.
There is no evidence currently available to suggest that X Gamers
could even imagine the kind of fete San Francisco can throw, let
alone last the evening. Remember what we did just for winning a
stadium vote.

SPAGHETTI SALAD? WELL, IT IS PASTA
</HEADLINE>

By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader writes looking for a cold spaghetti salad recipe.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds a bit on the distasteful side until you think how
popular pasta salad is. It's all in a name, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these recipes are from the Internet _ the first from a
personal Web page, the other from the National Pasta Association.
</P>
<P>
   The second recipe may seem odd, as well, but if spaghetti can be
salad, there's no reason it can't be dessert.

<P>
   12 lasagna noodles
</P>
<P>
   4 cups ricotta cheese
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar, divided
</P>
<P>
   8 kiwis, peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 cups strawberries, washed and trimmed, 8 reserved for

</P>
<P>
   4 cups blackberries, washed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup toasted, sliced almonds
</P>
<P>
   Mint sprigs, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta according to package directions. Rinse, drain and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, stir together the ricotta cheese and 1/2 cup
sugar. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In the food processor, puree 4 kiwis with 2 tablespoons sugar.
Transfer the puree to a bowl and set it aside. Rinse the processor
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the processor, puree half the strawberries with 2 tablespoons
sugar. Strain the puree into a bowl and set it aside. Rinse the
processor bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the processor, puree half the blackberries with 2 tablespoons
sugar. Strain the puree and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   Slice remaining 4 kiwis into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Slice the
strawberries into 1/8-inch thick pieces. Slice the blackberries in
half.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve 1/4 cup of each of the purees to use as a garnish when
serving.
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the lasagna, first cover the bottom of a
9-inch-by-13-inch glass baking pan with 3 pieces of pasta. Spoon
1/3 of the ricotta on top and spread it evenly. Pour the kiwi puree
over the cheese and arrange the kiwi slices on the puree. Lay on 3
more pieces of pasta and cover with 1/2 the remaining cheese. Pour
the strawberry puree over the cheese and sprinkle with sliced
strawberries. Lay on 3 more pieces of pasta and cover with the
remaining cheese. Pour the blackberry puree over the cheese and
sprinkle with blackberries. Top with a final layer of pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Cover tightly with plastic and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, sprinkle the lasagna with the remaining 2
tablespoons sugar and with the toasted almonds. Cut into 8
rectangles and use a spatula to set the pieces on dessert plates.
Decorate the plates with dots of reserved purees. Garnish each
piece of lasagna with a strawberry and a sprig of mint.

FACE OFF FOR A GOOD CAUSE WITH HULL-O'S CEREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Stars' season is over, but you can still cheer for
one of their popular players.
</P>
<P>
   Hull-O's made its debut this season in the cereal aisle and will
remain on shelves even as the Cup chase and the crease controversy
fade into memory. Right wing Brett Hull, in partnership with PLB
Sports, lends his name to the cereal with the payback being that
the profits go to Camp John Marc, a North Texas camp that helps
children suffering from catastrophic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The cereal is just one offering from PLB sports, which is based
in Pittsburgh. The company's first product was Jaromir Jagr Creamy
Peanut Butter, a partnership with the Pittsburgh Penguins. But the
product that put the company on the map was Flutie Flakes, a cereal
introduced last fall. Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie donates
his profits from that product to autism research. His son is
autistic.
</P>
<P>
   All of PLB's products are sold only in the area where the
endorser's team plays. (Omar Vizquel's Hot Salsa is sold in
Cleveland, Ed McCaffrey's Rocky Mountain Horseradish Sauce is sold
in Denver and Jerome Bettis ``The Bus'' Salsa is sold in
Pittsburgh.)
</P>
<P>
   But that is about to change. The first national product is Nolan
Ryan Texan Style Steak Sauce. The Ryan Express is donating his
profits to the Nolan Ryan Foundation, which funds the Nolan Ryan
Center for Continuing Education.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Hull-O's at Tom Thumb and Minyard stores. Nolan Ryan
Texan Style Steak Sauce is available at Tom Thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Find other PLB Sports products on the Web at www.plbsports.com.
Flutie Flakes are now available online; the rest of the company's
line will be available by mail later this summer.

NOTHING TO FEAR AT X GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fearless: adj., free from fear; bold;
courageous.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that: a concept not grasped by X Games athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really consider myself fearless,'' frowns champion
street skateboarder Danny Gonzalez of San Francisco. ``Afraid of
what? There isn't that much risk, really, by the time you get to
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah? When last seen, on the cover of a skateboarding
magazine, the 20-year-old was flying over a chain link fence with
nothing separating him from the metal but his skateboard and a few
inches of air. Doesn't the ``X'' in X Games come from the word
extreme? Gonzalez admits that what he does might look harrowing:
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, you might look at me and say `This kid's crazy.' But I've
never pushed myself so far that I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconding that emotion is 20-year-old Fabiola Da Silva of Santa
Rosa, Calif., princess of vertical in-line skating with a closet
full of medals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to skate with boys most of the time,'' the petite,
Brazilian-born spitfire says in broken English, ``because girls are
sometimes scared to do what I do. I don't know why, though! It's
not such a _ I don't know _ big deal? It just takes practice!''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and Da Silva are two of 400 ``alternative athletes''
participating in the upcoming X Games, being broadcast by the ESPN2
cable network. Each will compete in one of eight sports offered
during the nine-day event, which begins Friday at Piers 30 and 32
on the Embarcadero. In addition to skateboarding and in-line
skating, there will be stunt-bicycling, sportclimbing,
snowboarding, motocross, street luge and wakeboarding.
</P>
<P>
   If these X athletes have one thing in common, it's a puzzling
view of themselves as nothing out of the ordinary: average citizens
who just happen to enjoy scaling rock walls lickety-split like
Spiderman, skating up the side of a semicircular ramp (known as a
half-pipe) and finishing with a backflip, lying down on metal
planks and hurtling down twisting streets at 80 mph, stopping only
when shoe soles are ground into the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Derammelaere, 26, of Novato, Calif., is a heavy favorite
in the street luge event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose it's somewhat dangerous, but any form of racing
is,'' he says. ``The thing is, you can't think about fear. You have
to put it out of your mind; get past it, or you'll get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Derammelaere, something of an X Games pinup boy with photos in
magazines from Bikini to Mademoiselle, knows whereof he speaks. He
shows a serious scar on his ankle, from an accident at last year's
X Games that left him with a shattered ankle. His lip has a small
scar as well, from being bitten by a dog unhappy with finding him
at his level on the street. He has a scar under his jawline, too,
but he's not sure where that came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the crash, I needed to get past the fear _ the idea that
something else bad could happen,'' he says. ''I had to make that
first run without being afraid. It was a crucial part of the
recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Derammelaere, a graduate of Sonoma State University and a
computer programmer for Mindscape, is modest and soft-spoken _
hardly hellbent on showing-off.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs. ``I'm trying to get people off that stereotype,'' he
says. ``The guys with the purple hair _ they're a novelty and why
people watch it (on ESPN2). But we are serious athletes. People
think we do this just because it's crazy, but that's only one
element. For me, it's a jumping-off point to auto racing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also bucking the stereotype is Chris Bloch of San Francisco, a
rock climber ranked fourth in the country in the speed category,
which requires him to not only scale walls the height of a
five-story building, but do it fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Climbing is the only X sport that's not based on style, but on
the clock,'' he says. ``It's all about speed, although everyone has
their own style. My own is fast-paced; I let momentum drive me up
the wall. It's like a dance _ it can be very graceful.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what he thinks he might have in common with other X Games
athletes: ``Maybe it's that everyone moves really fast through the
air? Maybe we all want to be birds! To push Earth's gravity to its
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Also fearlessness? Bloch hesitates. ``It's not fearlessness,
exactly,'' he says. ``I don't think fear really enters into it that
much. Let's just say everyone who does this is good at calculating
risk. They have a good sense of their own abilities and
limitations. That's all.''

FROM BIG LEAGUES TO MINORS, WITH NO REGRETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM REYNOLDS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Two years ago, Mark Lemke earned $2 million as a
member of the Atlanta Braves. Today, he makes $700 a month, sings
karaoke ballads as part of rookie hazing rituals, travels on rented
buses, gets a paltry per-diem for meals and stays in budget motels.
</P>
<P>
   It only sounds like rock bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke is part infield coach, part aspiring knuckleball pitcher
for the Northern League's New Jersey Jackals, who played a
doubleheader Tuesday against their Eastern Division rival, the
Albany-Colonie Diamond Dogs, at Heritage Park. Laboring in an
unaffiliated, low-level baseball league hardly seems fashionable
for a man who was the Braves' second baseman for parts of 10
major-league seasons and owns a 1995 World Series ring, but Lemke
insists this is exactly where he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a lot of fun for me,'' Lemke said. ``It's kind
of like when you're a little kid playing ball. That's all it is,
really, just loving to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   His former boss, John Schuerholz, the Atlanta Braves' executive
vice president and general manager, said Tuesday night that he
wasn't surprised by Lemke's up-beat approach to his new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Mark is a guy who really loves baseball and loves to be
a part of it, and I'm sure what he's doing now is a reflection of
that,'' Schuerholz said. ``His passion for the game has been
obvious to everybody, and going from a member of world championship
teams with us to becoming a knuckleball pitcher in an independent
league ... that pretty much says it all.''
</P>
<P>
   This strange tale started May 19, 1998, near the second base bag
at Fenway Park. Lemke was playing his 31st _ and, as it turns out,
final _ game with the Boston Red Sox, against the Chicago White
Sox.
</P>
<P>
   A grounder off the bat of Mike Caruso came to Lemke, who tried
to tag Chad Kreuter between first and second and start a double
play. But when Kreuter crashed into Lemke, the 5-foot-9, 167-pound
second baseman didn't know which way was up. He suffered a
concussion, and the resulting postconcussive syndrome left him
feeling dizzy and light-headed all winter.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke, who was hitting only .187 at the time, went on the
disabled list for the fourth time in his career. Over the winter,
when it became apparent that his major-league days were over, he
envisioned himself going home to Utica, N.Y., playing a little
baseball for his brother's beer-league team and spending his days
on golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   Then an old minor-league teammate, now managing in an
independent league, called with an offer Lemke couldn't turn down.
</P>
<P>
   Kash Beauchamp, who played with Lemke in 1988 at Class AA
Greenville in the Southern League and again in 1989 at Class AAA
Richmond of the International League, had a place for his old
friend on the Jackals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about Mark, and what makes him great, is you'd never
know he made $2 million,'' said Beauchamp, who was selected ahead
of Kirby Puckett in the first round of the 1982 amateur draft.
``I've played 13 years in the minor leagues and I saw a lot of my
friends go to the big leagues, and I saw a lot of them change, a
lot of them stay the same. He's one of those guys who hasn't let
his stature affect him in the least. He hasn't changed since we
played together in 1988 in Greenville.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemke toyed with a knuckleball back in high school at
Utica-Notre Dame, and continued to throw one every now and then
while playing catch as a big-leaguer. But pitching, before this
year, was never an option.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackals activated Lemke one week ago, and last Friday, he
took the hill for the first time against the Adirondack
Lumberjacks. Lemke pitched the ninth inning of the Jackals' 14-4
win, striking out two on slow knucklers, but allowing three wild
pitches which led to one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemmer just had nasty stuff out there,'' Jackals catcher D.C.
Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Lemke enjoys his first official foray into coaching,
the desire to play the game still burns. He's only 33 and still in
good shape, and if it not for a four-year run of bad luck with
injuries, he still could be playing for the Braves. He's not
eligible to play the field for the Jackals, though, because the
team already is at the league limit for experienced professional
players. He is considered a rookie only as a pitcher, a position he
had not played professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is the hand he's been dealt, or rather, the hand
he's dealt himself. Lemke isn't hurting for money. He doesn't need
to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play, I really do,'' Lemke said. ``I know it seems
differently, but it gives me a whole lot of opportunities to kill a
bunch of birds with one stone. And I'm just having the time of my
life doing it.''

   BELGRADE _ NATO killed far more Serb civilians than soldiers
during its 11-week bombardment of the country and most of the
Yugoslav Third Army emerged unscathed from the massive air attacks
on its forces in Kosovo, according to evidence emerging in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officers have been astonished that thousands of Yugoslav
battle tanks, missile launchers, artillery batteries, personnel
carriers and trucks have been withdrawn from the province with
barely a scratch on their armor.
</P>
<P>
   At least 60,000 Yugoslav troops rather than the 40,000 estimated
by NATO _ were waiting to fight the Western armies in Kosovo if
NATO had mounted a land campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military sources say that more than half the 600 or so
soldiers who died in Serbia were killed in guerrilla fighting with
the Kosovo Liberation Army rather than by NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   They added that military preparations for war began a year ago
when military intelligence in Belgrade learned that the United
States was building a secret satellite targeting navigation station
at a remote airfield in Bulgaria, close to the Serbian border.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has also become clear that the entry of Russian
forces into Kosovo _ far from being the act of ``renegade
soldiers'' or a ``misunderstanding,'' as the White House would have
it _ was organized a week before NATO troops entered the province.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of defense in Moscow sent a coded message to
Russian troops at Uglevik in Bosnia _ not far from the
American-controlled air base at Tuzla _ ordering them to take
Pristina airport in advance of British forces; the Russian name for
their troops' arrival in Kosovo was ``Operation Shield.''
</P>
<P>
   Wartime statistics are notoriously unreliable _ and they are
still slippery in the immediate aftermath of war _ but
investigation of NATO bombing incidents during the bombardment by
western correspondents and humanitarian agencies appear to confirm
the official civilian casualty toll of around 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   At least 450 of these died in NATO's repeated ``mistakes,'' when
alliance aircraft bombed a train at Grdelica, a road bridge at
Varvarin, housing blocks at Surdulica, Aleksinac and Cuprija, a bus
at Luzane, an Albanian refugee convoy in Kosovo and other attacks
on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Many others died in what NATO referred to as ``collateral
damage'' _ in attacks around Belgrade, Kraljevo, Kragujevac, Nis
and Novi Sad.
</P>
<P>
   According to figures given to ``The Independent'' by a Yugoslav
military source, only 132 members of the armed forces here were
killed in NATO attacks. General Nebojsa Pavkovic, the commander of
the Yugoslav Third Army has given a different figure: 169 soldiers
killed in Kosovo under NATO assault and 299 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic says that 462 members of
the Yugoslav army and 112 police (including the MUP, the interior
ministry forces) were killed during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 300 soldiers are thought to have died in guerrilla
attacks, several in explosions following the theft of two trucks
loaded with Yugoslav army land mines by the KLA in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Enquiries by ``The Independent'' in Kosovo suggest that Serbian
troops died at KLA hands in Djakovica, Stimlje, Pudujevo and
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation this weekend of military fatalities among
soldiers whose homes were in the center of Novi Sad _ Yugoslavia's
third largest city _ turned up only two names: that of a reservist
who was murdered by the KLA in Pristina after the peace agreement
was announced and the commander of a SAM-6 missile battery who was
killed in action by NATO planes 20 miles from the city on June 1. &QL;

<P>
   BELGRADE _ NATO officers began to realize the discrepancy
between their own claims and reality within hours of the start of
the Yugoslav military withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   In just the first stage of the Serbian retreat, they logged 250
tanks moving out of Kosovo _ all undamaged _ and at least 40,000
men. This was supposed to be the troop strength of the entire Third
Army; thousands more soldiers left in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   All of which casts serious doubt on NATO's wartime propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, for example, NATO spokesman James Shea was boasting
that the alliance was ``knocking the stuffing out of Milosevic''
while General Wesley Clark, the NATO commander, said on May 27 that
after 27,000 NATO sorties, his pilots had conducted ``the most
accurate bombing campaign in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO repeatedly struck power stations and
radio-television repeater stations _ and suggested that it had
killed more than 500 Yugoslav soldiers in a B-52 raid on Kosovo in
the last week of bombing _ it seems to have caused little damage to
Serbian military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   General Nebojsa Pavkovic's claim that his Third Army lost seven
tanks, three transporters, 13 antitank guns and other artillery
could not be disputed after a 400-mile tour of some of the most
heavily-bombed areas of Kosovo last week.
</P>
<P>
   During my entire journey, I saw only four damaged Yugoslav army
trucks, two abandoned trucks and a destroyed Serbian military jeep.
Numerous barracks had been totally destroyed by Cruise missiles _
but the buildings appeared to have been empty when they were
struck.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav military official in Belgrade claimed that Third Army
troops had discovered how to avoid attack. ``They fired their
missiles and then replaced the batteries with mock-ups,'' the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time it took NATO's photo reconnaissance people to
identify the point of fire and the vehicle location and return to
bomb the mock-up was a minimum of 12 hours. So we knew when we had
to move our equipment _ every 12 hours.``
</P>
<P>
   The same source also said that army missile technicians had
taken apart an unexploded U.S. Tomahawk missile and concluded that
its targeting partly depended on a chip that guided the rocket to
its target by heat sources rather than imagery.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Yugoslav reservists were set to work burning tires
beside major road and rail bridges that would emit greater heat
than the surface of the bridges themselves, and also painting the
road on Kosovo bridges in many different colors _ because the
colors emit different degrees of heat.
</P>
<P>
   The tarmac of many bridges in southern Kosovo are in fact still
colored in red, yellow, purple and green rectangles. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 125 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 450) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav air force was meanwhile hidden from view. Although
a number of its machines were destroyed _ including three that were
shot down _ several Mig-29s were moved around the country,
sometimes secreted at night in the trees off the roadway west of
Belgrade, surrounded by farm machinery and metal sheeting so that
NATO's photo reconnaissance officers would not recognize their
``signature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't enough room for the Mig-29s to fly in,'' an
official here said. ``The sooner you take off, you're approaching
your own border. We quickly realized that flying was out and that
combat was hopeless. The order was to sit and protect the aircraft,
to save the lives of our pilots.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why did Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic agree to the
entry of international troops into Kosovo when his army was still
ready to fight?
</P>
<P>
   Some say he feared that a ground war would lead NATO troops all
the way to Belgrade _ and his own dispatch to the Hague on
war-crimes charges.
</P>
<P>
   But another source suggests that Victor Chernomyrdin, Moscow's
Balkan peace envoy and the head of Russia's multimillion dollar
Gasprom project, threatened to cut off all gas to Yugoslavia if
Belgrade did not accept the NATO-EU-Russian ``peace'' terms. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 225 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 675) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military is known to have been angered by
Chernomyrdin's activities_ indeed, a Russian general publicly
denounced the agreement as ``confused'' in the envoy's presence on
his return to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   And the Russian military clearly acted in defiance of its
political leadership when it sent the first Russian contingent into
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The officers involved had learned of NATO's desire to make their
headquarters at Slatina when they heard NATO radio transmissions
referring to Slatina as ``Tuzla 2'' _ Tuzla being the NATO airstrip
in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, according to the Yugoslavs, decided to move into Slatina
while NATO commanders were arguing over whether British or U.S.
troops should enter Kosovo first.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being an insignificant Balkan airfield _ as British
General Sir Michael Jackson has portrayed Pristina airport _ the
military air base is one of the most sophisticated in ex-Yugoslavia
with an underground runway and nuclear-proof bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   At least six Yugoslav Mig-21 jets spent the war there _
undamaged by NATO bombing _ and flew out of the air base before
NATO troops arrived in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians reportedly want to transport into Kosovo Russian
troops from the 106th Guards Division at Tula (two of whose
regiments fought in Afghanistan) and from the 76th Guards Division
based at Pskoff near St. Petersburg. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's first suspicions that the Americans might be planning
a military campaign against them were aroused last summer when
Yugoslav military intelligence officers learned that U.S. forces
were building a MASH-type hospital in Bulgaria close to the River
Yerma.
</P>
<P>
   These suspicions, according to one official, were increased when
Belgrade heard that the Americans were constructing a reserve
military air base at Kustendil in Bulgaria _ a base which they say
was used during NATO's war as a targeting navigation station for
B-52s and a transport base for C-130 transport aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the war, the army realized they could survive when NATO
started bombing civilian targets,'' the Yugoslav source said. ``We
came to the conclusion that NATO knew it couldn't find our vehicles
concealed in the hills and forests so it deliberately targeted
civilians and civilian infrastructure. That's when we knew we could
maintain our battle readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombing of dozens of civilian targets, NATO
repeatedly stated that it never intended to cause civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   What has not, predictably, emerged here are the grim statistics
of ``ethnic cleansing'' and the degree to which the regular
Yugoslav army did _ or did not _ have a hand in the assault on
Kosovo's Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Most eyewitness reports of massacres over the past two months
suggest that paramilitary or interior ministry forces rather than
regular troops were principally involved.
</P>
<P>
   But last month's indictments against Yugoslav leaders by the
International War Crimes Tribunal include the name of General
Dragoljub Ojdanic, the Yugoslav army chief of staff. &QL;

wedding in Windsor, admitted he had replaced the figure of William
in the shot released to the Press, with a shot from a different
frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince Edward said he didn't think Prince William looked
absolutely his best, so digitally we were able to put in another
picture of Prince William from one of the other shots where he is
smiling and laughing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Geoffrey also revealed that a new ``alternative'' official
photograph of the wedding couple is to be released, showing them
superimposed against a ``cleaner background'' than the cabinet now
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were condemned by Horst Faas, European photo editor of
the Associated Press news agency and a legendary photojournalist.
He said it was a ``terrible precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``How can we trust the official handout photographs
from the Palace if something like this is happening? To change a
picture is against the very basic rules of photojournalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our editors are permitted to do is improve the quality by
cropping or removing specks of dust. You can't make the sky blue
when it was a grey, rainy day. A photo is a photo, is a photo and
you shouldn't tamper with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sir Geoffrey said Monday night: ``I'm sure Prince William
would like the best picture of himself. I hope I haven't in any way
erred. I feel very strongly that poor Prince William has a hard
enough time as it is so I don't want to bring him into the picture
by doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first experience the Royals have had of
photographic manipulation, but it is the first time that they have
approved it.
</P>
<P>
   A recent example was before the death of Diana, Princess of
Wales, when a tabloid newspaper rotated Dodi Fayed's head to make
it look as if he was about to kiss her. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL;

   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL;

   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL;

<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

traditional Democratic-Republican constraints regarding government
expansion, the manner in which they present themselves is as
important as the messages they convey.
</P>
<P>
   In their first official sorties onto the field of battle, Bush
won with an excellent performance.
</P>
<P>
   Like the great theatrical figures of the past, he outshone
Democrat Gore and his fellow Republican hopefuls by delaying his
grand entrance into Iowa and New Hampshire until almost all of his
competitors were on stage, by generating speculation and suspense
about his stand on key issues and then by delivering a performance
worthy of such an accomplished actor as Anthony Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Bush had about 200 reporters trailing him and covering every
nuance of his appearance. The result was a stunning debut in the
national arena.
</P>
<P>
   Gore fared less well. Announcing his candidacy at a tumultuous
rally in Carthage, Tenn., he had to shout and gesticulate like a
bombastic politician of the pre-TV era to make himself seen and
heard over the shrill cries of AIDS demonstrators and the constant
waving of placards by his enthusiastic supporters.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush spoke in modulated tones, exuding quiet charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's message was no more vital to the future of
America than the vice president's, but his freshness on the
national scene and his professionally staged performance proved
that star power is as much a part of politics as of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Barrymores, the Lunts and Katherine Cornell, who
illuminated Broadway when his parents were young, Bush timed his
entrance so that it would eclipse his competitors in their
shop-worn hand-shaking, back-slapping, baby-kissing,
platitude-reciting quest for the GOP presidential garland. His task
now is to keep the momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has been a fixture on the national scene since his
failed 1988 presidential bid, now must correct his mistakes and
streak across the heavens like a meteor.
</P>
<P>
   He has only one opponent for the Democratic nomination, the
formidable Bill Bradley. Bush faces 11, although most are political
Lilliputians who are dwarfed by Bush and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in announcing his candidacy, sought to distance himself
from Bill Clinton's tawdry sexual adventures while identifying
himself with Clinton's strong national economy and the victory over
tyranny in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemingly failed to bury the most-quoted cliche of the
campaign: Al Gore is dull and wooden.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who knows him sees Gore as likable, witty and
intelligent. They respect him as a man dedicated to protecting our
environment and natural resources, making government run more
effectively, improving education and, like Bush, promoting stronger
family values.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates differ on how they would save Social Security
and Medicare, improve education, deal with abortion and taxes and
control the proliferation of guns. But Bush has put distance
between himself and militant rightwingers while Gore has steered
clear of militant leftwingers.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the moment, it comes down to who has that undefinable
ingredient known as star power.
</P>
<P>
   The presidency itself confers star power on most, but not all,
of its occupants. Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter
enjoyed it only fleetingly, and William Howard Taft possibly not at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin and Theodore Roosevelt seemingly were born to be stars,
and their brilliant aura continues to brighten the political
firmament. Woodrow Wilson's star power lay in his eloquence,
idealism and vision rather than in his physical dynamism.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower enjoyed political stardom because he was the
most admired military hero of World War II. He remained a beloved
figure during his eight-year presidency.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, the dashing young product of a much-publicized
family, possessed greater star power than his 1960 Republican
opponent, Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded to the presidency on Kennedy's
death, exhibited tremendous star power in 1964 as he criss-crossed
the nation, promising passage of Medicare, strong civil rights
measures, federal aid to education as well as implementation of his
war on poverty. By Election Day, when he won the biggest popular
plurality of the century, the turnout at his political rallies was
enormous.
</P>
<P>
   But the tragic quagmire of Vietnam robbed him of his stellar
position.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan, a minor star in motion pictures, became a major
star in politics and continues to enjoy that designation despite
his serious health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gore-Bush contest the question is whether both men
possess the star power to win their parties' nominations? If so,
the election in November 2000 could be a fascinating showdown
between two baby boomers from prominent, affluent families who
stand astride the political center.

   Fragrant Night Bloomers
</P>
<P>
   Q. I love fragrant plants, but I don't like bees! Is there
anything I can grow that will perfume the garden without attracting
insects?
</P>
<P>
   A. Perfume that doesn't attract insects would be a horticultural
oxymoron: putting out the come hither for pollinating bugs is a
flower's raison d'etre, and perfume is a large part of the mating
dance. But you can have a fragrant garden low on bees by planting
flowers and shrubs that open their blossoms at night.
</P>
<P>
   Choices range from the small, inconspicuous, but mighty perfumed
annual known as night-blooming stock (Matthiola bicornis) to the
many cultivated varieties of Brugmansia, a tropical tree that can
grow to 10 feet and has been showing up in nurseries under the name
angels' trumpets. All parts of Brugmansia are highly poisonous, but
there's no denying the plant's appeal. Its huge flowers blare
tropical sweetness from dusk until almost sunup. White is the most
common color, and usually the most fragrant, but Brugmansia also
comes in yellow, orange, peaches and pinks.
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it from the modern cultivars, which have been
bred to stay open during the day, but old fashioned flowering
tobacco (Nicotiana alata) has a very strong night perfume, and so
does its much taller, more architecturally splendid cousin, N.
sylvestris.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates include moonflower vines, night-blooming
jasmine, evening primrose and the oddball Pardon Me, a day lily
that doesn't get going until the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Brugmansia and matthiola are widely sold. Pardon me (and other
fragrant night bloomers) can be mail ordered from Snow Creek
Daylily Gardens, P.O. Box 2007, 330 P Street, Port Townsend, Wash.
98368, (360) 385-1738, catalog, $3. Pardon Me is also sold by
Abundant Daylilies, H.C. 78, Box 187, Star City, Ark. 71667, (870)
628-4820, free price list.
</P>
<P>
   The Potato Beetle Wars
</P>
<P>
   Q. Help! Colorado potato beetles are destroying my potato
plants. I've been trying to go the organic route, handpicking them
every day. It's not working. If I don't do something soon, I'm
afraid the plants will die.  &QL; 
A. Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to give the miserable creature its
proper name, is among the most difficult garden pests to control,
organically or otherwise. Don't panic. Potato plants can take a lot
of defoliation and still produce a decent crop. But do take action,
employing multiple strategies for best results.
</P>
<P>
   Start by applying a dose of the organic gardener's friend,
Bacillus thuringiensis var. san diego (or var. tenebrionis). It is
effective at killing small larvae, though only after they've
consumed some of it. This means spraying thoroughly (and
repeatedly) according to the directions that come with the stuff.
It also means you're still stuck with larger larvae and adults.
Those can be killed with rotenone, a comparatively mild botanical
poison permitted for use by organic gardeners. Neem extract
(Azadirachtin) is also on the organic list. Well-stocked garden
centers and farm supply stores will usually have these products.
</P>
<P>
   Handpicking is still very useful, if it includes crushing the
clusters of bright orange-yellow eggs that hide under the leaves.
It costs nothing, it doesn't pollute or kill any other creatures.
It keeps populations down and soothes gardeners, who if they have
potato beetles, also have frustrations and aggressions that need
release. Unfortunately, it's not perfect. No matter how thorough
you are, you always miss a few, and you don't have to miss many to
lose the war. A single female can have 10,000 decendants by the end
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage (for the beetles) of numbers like these is the
chance at resistant mutations. No matter which controls you use, a
few will be resistant, and those few will be multitudes ere long.
That's why it's important to attack on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to infestation, Colorado potato beetles can live a
full two years. But they won't stay around where there's nothing to
eat, so the final, or first, line of defense is late planting. If
they don't find any potato, eggplant or nicotiana leaves when they
emerge from the ground in spring , they'll leave. More will appear,
but if you can thwart that first wave, subsequent ones will be much
smaller.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The ordinary garden hose has more uses than simply watering the
grass. It can be used to wash the exterior of the house, the patio,
the deck and the car. It is a necessary tool for bringing water to
a place that may be away from a faucet, so you can mix cement
without having to carry buckets of water to the construction site.
</P>
<P>
   All garden hoses may look alike, but they are distinguished by
their length, diameter, and their construction. Most stores stock
hoses in 25-foot increments, so you can buy a hose 25-, 50-, 75- or
100-feet long.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a hose, consider the size of your property and where
you intend to use the hose. If your lawn is 50 feet long, but you
often wash your car in the driveway only 15 feet away from the
faucet, it may be better to buy two 25- foot hoses. You can couple
them together when you water the lawn, but use only one to wash the
car.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular hose diameters are 1/2 inch, 5/8 inch and 3/4
inch. The length and the diameter of the hose affect how much
pressure is needed to push the water through the hose. More
pressure is needed to push the water through a long, wide hose than
through a short, narrow one.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference in hoses, however, is in their
construction. The materials and composition of any hose determine
its performance, weight, durability, function and, of course,
price. Most stores carry a basic garden hose made of vinyl
reinforced with nylon tire cord. This kind of hose is relatively
inexpensive and also light in weight. It is easy to coil, carry and
store. It is a good choice for general household uses and light
gardening tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The vinyl-reinforced hose is not very durable, however, and will
wear quickly if subjected to frequent use. Hoses with some rubber
in their composition are more rugged. Rubber makes a hose heavier,
and thus somewhat harder to handle, but it will last longer than a
vinyl hose. Composite rubber-vinyl hoses are therefore a good
choice for the serious gardener and for light construction work.
</P>
<P>
   For heavy-duty construction work, there are hoses that combine
all-rubber composition with double-reinforced spiral cords. These
industrial hoses have the capacity to carry water at 500 pounds per
square inch without bursting. In addition they can tolerate water
temperatures as high as 200 degrees Fahrenheit. Obviously these are
not concerns for the average homeowner. A hose of this quality can
be four times the price of the average garden hose but will take
more abuse and last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   When working outdoors on a hot summer day, some people quench
their thirst by drinking directly from the hose. Surprisingly, not
all hoses are considered safe for carrying drinking water. They may
have internal cores that can add small amounts of contaminants to
the water. There are, however, hoses that are designed to carry
drinking water. Called ''boat and camper,'' or '' recreational,''
hoses, they feature a nontoxic, Food and Drug
Administration-approved core that can carry water without tainting
it.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that when a hose develops a leak it should either
be repaired or replaced, but sprinkler hoses are designed for
watering a garden; they leak water along their length. There are
two types of sprinkler hose. The most common variety consists of
three narrow hoses bonded together side by side. The top side of
the triple hose has a series of tiny pinholes that allow water to
spray out in a fine mist.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of sprinkler hose is called a soaker hose. Unlike
the triple-sprinkler hose that only sprays water from the top
surface, soaker hoses generate a water mist on all sides. Most
gardeners bury this type of hose a few inches below the garden
surface to keep the soil and plant roots watered. Soaker hoses
generally come in 50-foot lengths. Some soaker hoses can be
shortened by tying a knot at the desired length.
</P>
<P>
   If limited storage space is a consideration, you can buy a flat
hose. Flat hoses remain flat, with compressed sides, but they
expand to a round diameter when water is forced through them. Many
come with their own reel and carrying handle so they can be coiled
up for easy storage.
</P>
<P>
   If you use your hose often, you will probably want to attach a
nozzle at the working end of the hose. The nozzle makes it easy to
shut off the water, and it controls the water from a solid stream
to a fine spray. There are two types of nozzles, twist nozzles and
trigger nozzles. It's easy to shut off the water with a trigger
nozzle _ simply release the trigger _ but it can cause hand fatigue
if you must keep the water spray going for a length of time. &QL;

LIKE A RECIPE FOR COCOA, SANS CHOCOLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know what's amazing about politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, a lot of things are amazing about politicians: their
breathtaking proclivity for deceit, their mind-boggling penchant
for manipulation, their shocking propensity for greed and
self-indulgence, their limitless capacity for trampling the
interests of the people they are elected to serve ...
</P>
<P>
   But the amazing trait of which I speak is the politicians'
infuriating habit of reacting to problems by proposing solutions
that have nothing to do with the problems they propose to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Take the airline passengers ``bill of rights'' that has been
bouncing around in Congress for months but was more or less
preempted last week when the air travel industry announced a
voluntary plan that's supposed to turn disgruntled customers into
happy campers. Take it, please, to quote the great philosopher and
social critic Henny Youngman.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress started pushing various versions of the
passenger-rights law in response to last winter's debacle at
Detroit's Metro Airport, where passengers were held hostage for
hours in airplanes that were unable to take off because of bad
weather. The trapped passengers were outraged and the incident
attracted much news coverage, which in turn attracted many
camera-and-microphone-addicted politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians vowed that no citizen of these great United
States would ever again be subjected to such misery as that
suffered by marooned airline passengers in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   And just how did politicians such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona
and Rep. Bud Shuster of Pennsylvania propose to fulfill their vow?
</P>
<P>
   You guessed it: by offering up laws that included no provision
whatsoever for rescuing passengers who might be ensnared in a
situation like the one in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   No kidding, folks. Not one of the passenger ``bill of rights''
proposals provoked by the winter horror in Detroit even so much as
hinted at what ought to be one of passengers' most fundamental
rights: the right to get off an airplane that isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   If a taxicab is hopelessly gridlocked in city traffic, a
passenger can get out and walk. If a bus stalls en route to its
destination, the passengers can exit the bus and search for
another.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose you're out of luck if a subway train breaks down. But
then, nobody has to ride the subway; there are times when we
basically have no choice but to get on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   And once you get on the plane, you have to stay on until the
self-anointed airline deities decide to let you leave.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the air travel industry can give you plenty of reasons why
it has to be this way, and some of the reasons might even make
sense. But if the politicians want to throw a fit about passengers
being trapped on airplanes and want to be seen on the evening news
promising to save travelers from such abuse at the hands of the
evil airlines, wouldn't we expect that the very first item on the
resulting passenger bill of rights would be the right to deplane
when a flight is unreasonably delayed in taking off?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's what we would expect. Which only goes to show
that just plain folks are incapable of the advanced thinking
processes employed by politicians. In a politician's scheme of
things, the only sensible approach to solving a problem is to
devise a solution that makes no reference of any kind to the
problem that needs solving.
</P>
<P>
   So. We get a passenger bill of rights that requires airlines to
give us more information about frequent-flier programs but doesn't
even mention the hostage-on-the-runway dilemma that prompted the
bill of rights in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   And now the airline industry decides to upstage Congress by
adopting its own passenger bill of rights _ which likewise fails to
include the right to deplane.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress marches on, responding to school violence with
proposals that promote pet issues such as gun control, movie
censorship and religion in the classroom but don't begin to address
the actual causes of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. Just amazing.

STUDENTSPEAK TAKEN SERIOUSLY AT LANGUAGE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SALLY McGRANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley isn't the only part of California with
its own dialect. If you're a student in San Luis Obispo, for
example, you may have spent the morning ``classing'' before meeting
some ``slocalocals'' at ``Bubble Gum Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: After attending class, you met some natives of San
Luis Obispo near an alley that students have been slathering in
bubble gum since the late '60s.
</P>
<P>
   The language quirks common in the coastal region surrounding San
Luis Obispo have found a lexicographical home. Posted a little more
than a year ago, the California Central Coast Online Dictionary
(www.multimedia.calpoly.edu/libarts/ccod) is a database of more
than 400 words with definitions, pronunciations and illustrative
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs and video footage on the site illustrate collegiate
and surfer slang. The dictionary, compiled by students from
California Polytechnic State University, is the creation of John
Battenburg, 37, a professor of linguistics and literature. A former
Fulbright scholar who taught in Tunisia and researched the death of
the Berber language there, Battenburg decided to turn his
linguistic know-how to a vernacular that was closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot to be gained by talking about how we can
describe language and what we can learn about speech communities
because of that,'' Battenburg said. ``We're not only learning about
language, we're learning something about this unique culture or
subculture on the central coast of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking through the San Luis Obispo Farmer's Market, he pointed
out a group of clothing stores. ``See there?'' he asked. ``That's
`sorority square.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sorority Square, which is actually a triangle, has its own
entry, complete with usage example, in the dictionary:
``so-ror-i-ty square /srrtI skwEr/ noun. 1. Shopping triangle
formed by Express, Gap and Victoria's Secret, which is always
heavily populated by sorority women. Is called a square to
emphasize the dippyness of sorority women.
</P>
<P>
   Humorous, San Luis Obispo. I was going to buy socks at Gap, but
the lines are so long it looks like there is a house field trip to
sorority square. (Square in the sense of being conventional and not
venturing out of the norm.).''
</P>
<P>
   The California Central Coast Online Dictionary is the result of
university initiatives to incorporate technology in its classrooms,
an effort financed by student fees garnered under what is called
the Poly Plan. (The dictionary illustrates the Poly Plan entry with
the sentence: ``I cannot believe this school is asking for more
money with this bogus Poly Plan scam.'')
</P>
<P>
   The self-described poster boy for the use of technology in
liberal arts classes, Battenburg was initiated into the world of
the Internet in 1997, after he returned to Cal Poly from his two
years as a Fulbright professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Rip Van Winkle,'' he said. ``I came into my office
and they had a new computer for me, and I asked my neighbor, a
historian, `How do you get on the Web?''' Since then, he has
incorporated into his multimedia lectures material from Web sites,
like photographs of Walden pond and audio readings of Hawaiian
Creole nursery rhymes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the dictionary is a cultural archive that can be
searched, other linguists doubt its effectiveness as a serious
reference tool, pointing to its relatively small size and spelling,
grammar and lexicographic errors. ``Lots of things you have kids
do, they aren't going to do as well as people you pay to do it,''
said Geoffrey Nunberg, the usage editor at The American Heritage
Dictionary and a consulting professor of linguistics at Stanford.
``Which doesn't mean they shouldn't do it. It's not going to be
scholarly, but so what?''
</P>
<P>
   Battenburg believes that the online dictionary is a useful
pedagogic tool that teaches students not only how a dictionary is
made, but how they should learn to examine the language around
them. It gives students ``a chance to test drive their
lexicographers' skill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly sounds more useful than any bulimic learning
system (``bu-li-mic learn-ing sys-tem noun. 1. Study method used by
Cal Poly students to memorize and regurgitate lecture information
on exams and in papers. San Luis Obispo. I have successfully
completed four years at Cal Poly utilizing the bulimic learning
system with zero retention'').

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What would cause a printer to print incorrectly with odd
lines and letters, even though it looks fine on screen and prints
OK from another printer?
</P>
<P>
   A. One thing you will want to check first is the type of cable
that you are using to connect your printer to the computer. On the
surface, a parallel cable may look just like any other, but most
printers manufactured in the last few years require what is called
an IEEE-1284-compliant parallel printer cable. Most modern printers
use bidirectional communication technology to talk to the computer,
as it can make data transfer rates 10 times faster than older
parallel connections that are not bidirectional.
</P>
<P>
   If you are seeing peculiar things on your page, like garbled
letters, weird type characters or unexpected lines that are not
visible in your document on the screen, odds are you probably have
the wrong cable. You may also get false error messages on your PC
telling you the printer is off-line or out of paper, and in some
cases, the printer just won't work.
</P>
<P>
   You can purchase an IEEE-1284 cable at most computer stores. Get
one that is shorter than six feet, because too-long cables can
sometimes cause data errors. When you plug it in, make sure it is
not lying on or near the printer's power cable so that you don't
get electromagnetic interference between the two cords. If you
change the cable and still have problems, you may want to call your
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there any way to get old files off a dead hard drive, or
are they gone for good?  &QL; 
A. If your old computer went to that great desktop in the sky
because of hard-drive failure, there are several companies that
will try to save your data. That can be rather pricey (several
hundred to several thousand dollars), but if your files are
irreplaceable, it might be one of your only options.
</P>
<P>
   Most data-recovery places can handle a variety of platforms and
media, and offer a telephone number for you to get an estimate on
the cost before sending in the drive. Such services include Disk
Savers, (800) 440-1904); Drive Service (888) 272-8332, and Absolute
Recovery (760) 776-1841.

NEW PALM SHOWS UP, UNATTACHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 3Com Corp.'s Palm VII handheld computer, which is now being
sold only in the New York City area, is like one of those odd,
futuristic devices that movie aliens are always accidentally
leaving behind after they touch down briefly to abduct a few
Earthlings. Later, someone finds it on the ground, pokes it a few
times, lifts the built-in antenna _ ``Hmm, I wonder what  &UR; this &LR; 
thing does?'' _ and jumps back in astonishment when the little box
comes to life and magically displays the up-to-the-minute score of
the Knicks game.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks playing in the NBA finals? Now,  &UR; there &LR;  is science
fiction. The Palm VII, on the other hand, is very real. It is a
computer from the near future, a future in which people keep little
computers in their pockets and tap into the Internet wirelessly,
gathering news headlines, trading stocks, sending and receiving
electronic mail, calling up a map for directions, paying bills,
doing personal banking, tracking down the nearest automated cash
machine, ordering theater tickets and other earthly delights.
</P>
<P>
   We have already seen the change happen to telephones. Almost
overnight, wireless phones have become nearly as popular as
traditional, wired phones. In Japan and northern Europe, one person
in three now carries a cellular phone. In this country, pagers and
cellular phones are so commonplace that when one chirps, nearly
everyone in the room instinctively twitches.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we will see the same thing happen with wireless computers.
People will still use wired computers for heavy-duty computing
tasks, but increasingly they will also carry little wireless
communicators that handle simple voice and Internet data calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII is the first of these wireless communicators to be
made available to the masses. But it is too expensive, too slow and
too limited to achieve the cult popularity of its predecessors, the
Palm Pilot and the Palm III. The user is permitted to tap into only
a limited number of World Wide Web sites, and even then only for
snippets of text, not for graphics or pictures.
</P>
<P>
   However, as a harbinger of things to come, it will appeal to
gadget lovers and information junkies. Others will probably want to
wait for the next generation of wireless data devices, expected to
arrive in the next year or two, which will offer more features
(like voice calls and faxing) and significantly higher connection
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   3Com says it is confining sales of the Palm VII to the New York
area for now because it wants to make sure the system works
properly; by late fall, the company says, the device will be sold
in all major metropolitan areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, though, it works throughout the United States _ in the
260 major cities where 3Com and its partner Bell South operate a
radio-based wireless data network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Works'' can be a relative term, however. I've been testing the
Palm VII for a few weeks in Texas and California. In Texas, more
often than not I had to move near a window or even step outside to
get a signal strong enough to connect to 3Com's radio network.
Earlier this week, just south of Los Angeles, I was never able to
get a connection and thus had to find out about the Knicks' victory
Monday the old-fashioned way: by walking 20 feet into the bar to
look at the satellite television broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm VII is physically and functionally almost identical to
the Palm Pilot and Palm III, except for a flip-up antenna on the
right side of the case. The dark gray device, for those who have
never seen one peeking out from the pocket of a Silicon Valley
tycoon or clipped to the belt of a computer geek, is just a bit
over 3 inches wide, 5 inches long and } of an inch thick. As the
name implies, it fits easily in the hand and weighs 6.7 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   At $599, however, the Palm VII costs hundreds of dollars more
than the basic Palm III; that little antenna, for receiving data,
costs more than its weight in gold. Users also have to buy a
monthly subscription to the proprietary wireless data service
Palm.net. The basic service plan costs $9.95 a month and entitles
the user to send or receive 50 kilobytes of data wirelessly. Each
kilobyte thereafter costs 30 cents. After Aug. 31, 3Com will also
charge a one-time setup fee of $19.99.
</P>
<P>
   The average brief e-mail message is about 1 or 2 kilobytes in
length, so the basic connection plan is good for about one message
a day. I've talked with some early Palm VII users who exhausted
their monthly allotment of kilobytes within the first week.
</P>
<P>
   The more useful the Palm VII's wireless capabilities become, the
more it costs. The ``expanded plan'' costs $24.99 a month for 150
kilobytes of messaging, which 3Com describes as 90 brief e-mails,
60 stock quotes, 30 sports scores, 30 traffic reports and 30
weather updates.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the most amazing thing about this device is how
rapidly it beams money from your credit card and transfers it
wirelessly to 3Com's bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless Internet access does not mean, in this case, the
ability to browse Web pages or download software in the same way it
is done on a desktop machine. The Palm VII uses a technique called
Web clipping, which extracts key elements of a Web page, typically
text, and presents it on the Palm's two-inch-square,
green-and-black screen.
</P>
<P>
   A small cluster of companies eager to drive more visitors to
their Web sites have agreed to create special ``Palm Query
Applications,'' or PQA's, for the Palm VII, enabling users to
select an icon on the screen and download a Web clipping or two.
The PQA's themselves can be downloaded from the Palm.net site,
www.palmnet.com, to a desktop computer and transferred to the Palm
VII via cable.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the companies with PQA's include The Wall Street
Journal, USA Today, ABC News, Bloomberg financial news, The Weather
Channel, ETrade, Fodor's and Frommer's travel guides, the OAG
flight guide, Moviefone, Etak traffic reports, Bank of America home
banking, the Pagenet and Skytel paging services, Yahoo! People
Search for access to a data base of 100 million Americans, and
United Parcel Service package tracking.
</P>
<P>
   In a case of deus ex machina, there is even Godsword.com, which
can automatically deliver a random Bible verse each day to the Palm
VII. There is even a wireless translation service, the Go Network's
Translator to Go, that does on-the-fly language conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from its pricing model, 3Com never intended for the Palm
VII to become wildly popular, like its littermates the Palm III and
Palm V personal information organizers. Rather, it is a working
prototype, a proof of concept, a first draft of a wireless device
that offers Internet access from almost anywhere. Well-heeled
information addicts and executives looking for the latest high-tech
toy will find it amusing, and some may even wonder how they ever
got by without it.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us will probably want to wait for the next
generation of wireless data network devices, perhaps something like
the Qualcomm Corporation's forthcoming PDQ phone that combines a
Palm Pilot with a cellular phone. Within months, there will
definitely be a lot of little wireless gizmos from which to choose,
ranging from smart cell phones with large display screens, to
Palm-like pocket computing devices, to in-dash computers for the
car.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless data services will eventually become ubiquitous, but
not until the industry moves to a flat-rate, unlimited access
pricing plan similar to the one that jump-started the consumer
Internet.

<P>
   There was no such thing as a nerd back in 1947, when Erich Klein
opened a small factory on Chicago's North Side and became one of
the first manufacturers to make plastic pocket protectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slipped into a shirt pocket and was useful to anyone who
carried a fountain pen or a ballpoint pen, which had ink leakage
problems,'' said Randy Silton, Klein's grandson and president of
the company, Erell Manufacturing. ``We still make hundreds of
thousands a year, but most others have dropped them from their
lines. I guess pocket protectors aren't so popular anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a polite way to put it. Made possible by the same
heat-sealing process used to make World War II flak jackets, the
pocket protector was intended as an advertising giveaway,
emblazoned with a company logo. But this simple polyvinyl chloride
product evolved into something far more culturally symbolic: it
became the ultimate emblem of nerdiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first computer course in college was taught by a guy with
so many pocket protectors he seemed to be some sort of animatronic
device with a bad haircut,'' said Alan Robbins, an associate
professor of design at Kean University in New Jersey. ``Pocket
protectors organize tools on the wearer's body, turning the user
into a kind of rudimentary cyborg _ part human, part toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, pocket protectors enjoyed a brief heyday. Since
then, they have become self-conscious. The Massachusetts Institute
of Technology Museum gift shop sells a $1.25 protector emblazoned
with the phrase ``M.I.T. Nerd Pride''; a recent Levenger's catalog
offers a leather protector for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes poke fun of it as a cultural icon, but I feel
naked without one,'' said John Shipman, an applications specialist
at the New Mexico Tech Computer Center in Socorro, N.M. ``Ever
since high school, when all the other kids were going down to the
gun store to look around, I was going to the local office supply
store. I guess I was a proto-geek.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Tenner, the author of ``When Things Bite Back: Technology
and the Revenge of Unintended Consequences'' (Knopf, 1996), said:
``Now, anything as aggressively useful as trying to protect your
shirt from ink is anti-chic. The fact that the pocket protector is
a joke is an example of the triumph of culture over technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Friedel, a professor of history at the University of
Maryland, says one problem with the protector was the material it
was cut from because plastic ``promises imperviousness to ruin and
to soil, but in a way so avowedly artificial that there's another
part of us that tends to recoil a bit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When they presented their new fall collection recently, the SoHo
designers who call themselves Orfi (for the Organization for
Returning Fashion Interest) included one outfit that consisted
solely of an enormous blanket. But despite the hard work of two
models who appeared on stage with it over their shoulders, the
blanket-as-clothing concept is probably not destined to be a big
seller.
</P>
<P>
   But another, less avant-garde article of clothing from Orfi has
gained attention outside the group's loyal circle of downtown
fashion mavens. Laminated cotton men's Rifle Team pants ($260 to
$270 a pair) have been flying out of the designers' store in the
past few months because of a special feature: the pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, these are not just any old pockets. The Rifle
Team pants have a horizontal pocket on the front of each leg, 13
inches long, with a secure zipper closure and mesh lining. Never
mind house keys and a discreet comb. Each pocket can handle a
cellular phone, a beeper and an electronic scheduler _ all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``These pants are a reaction to how people live now,'' said
Donald Hearn, one of Orfi's owners. ``This whole trend in pockets
specifically responds to the idea that when you leave the house
these days, there are a lot more things you need to carry with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rifle Team Pants are signs of an era in which electronic
gadgetry has moved from accessory to necessity. Gone are the days
when the things that went into pockets _ the pen, the wallet, the
lowly pocket protector _ were as humble as the pocket itself.
</P>
<P>
   Today's digital accessories are bulky and self-important. And
why not? After all, they are essential tools, communications
lifelines to a pants wearer's office or home. So it's up to pockets
to conform.
</P>
<P>
   From the ``lightweight, knee-length summer topper,'' as it is
called at the upscale Barneys clothing store in Manhattan
(translation: a jacket, and it sells for $396 at the store) to
Equipment for Legs, a new line of pants from the more
egalitarian-priced Dockers, pockets are being re-sized, refitted
and rethought to accommodate the sprawling collection of personal
electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. ``As much as human beings like to look
good, we like convenience as well,'' said Christina Lindholm,
chairwoman of the department of fashion design and merchandising at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designers can't lose sight of this new aspect of clothing _
that the customer is likely to be a working person or someone with
a very busy life who has to have the cell phone and beeper with
them to keep their day organized.''
</P>
<P>
   One could argue that the Palm Pilot is to blame. From its
inception, the Palm Pilot had designs on the pocket: its earliest
prototypes were blocks of wood that the designers carried around in
shirt pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to make sure that the size was comfortable
because a person who carries a Palm Pilot accesses it 14 to 20
times a day for two to three minutes each time,'' said Andrea
Johnson, a product manager at Palm Computing, a subsidiary of the
3Com Corp. ``It has to be easy to get to, to turn it on and off.
And people want to carry it not just when they're working but when
they're skiing, when they're backpacking, hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   But how comfortable is it to carry around an electronic
scheduler _ or even a block of wood _ in a shirt pocket?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little chunky,'' said Len Abbazia, who was the manager
of corporate communications for one of Palm Computing's smaller
competitors, Franklin Electronic Publishers, which makes the Rex
Pro, before he left the company recently. ``Put a Palm Pilot in
your left pocket and see how the whole left side of your body drags
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course, even the Rex Pro, which is the size of a credit
card, has special pocket needs. ``If you sit on it, you could break
the screen,'' Abbazia said.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sorts of concerns that recently prompted Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. to hire the European designer Massimo Osti to create
a whole new vision of pants for the Dockers line. The result _ the
Equipment for Legs line _ is trousers with hidden pockets
configured to hold specific kinds of electronic devices. The pants
($120 to $130 a pair), which will arrive in stores in the United
States in September, will feature a range of pocket styles: some
will be sized to hold a Palm Pilot, others a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the trousers are of Kevlar (often used for bulletproof
vests) or other fire-resistant fabrics, said Kim Steigerwald, a
Dockers brand manager. ``The idea is to have the pants made from
technologically evolved fabrics as well,'' she said, ``so the
pockets and the pants both have a lot of functionality.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital era is really prompting just another step in the
evolution of the pocket. The earliest pockets evolved hundreds of
years ago from pouches that hung on a string from the neck or
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This custom probably came from Europe'' Ms. Lindholm said,
``and eventually evolved into something that they would button on
to their clothes. It is something we did see more in a peasant type
of population than among the wealthy because rich men had someone
who could carry their things for them. But for instance, on the
American prairie, women would carry something like a needle case in
a pouch because a needle was amazingly expensive and valuable
beyond hens' teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the mass manufacturing of clothing replaced custom
tailoring in the 20th century, the pocket had become a standard
feature on clothing. Certain pockets had specific purposes _ that
anachronistic little pocket-in-a-pocket on the front of jeans, for
instance, was created for a pocket watch. But the size of the
general-purpose pocket has never been standardized.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, some pocket designers are reluctant to make a
commitment to match their pockets to the specific dimensions of a
particular device. ``Because technology is changing so quickly,
these devices are almost disposable,'' Hearn of Orfi said. ``The
shape of a common cell phone you carry today may be different from
the one you have in nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, designers say they have more to consider than just the
mere pocket: there's also the issue of lint. ``Pockets collect
lint, and that's not good for electronic devices,'' Ms. Lindholm
said. To prevent lint buildup, many designers are replacing
traditional fabrics in pockets with mesh.
</P>
<P>
   Mesh has other benefits as well. ``Mesh provides a way to vent a
shirt in hotter weather,'' said Devony Hastings, a spokeswoman for
Recreational Equipment Inc., a Seattle company whose rugged sports
clothing is designed to appeal to adventurous travelers. ``And the
other reason is drainage, if some people wear them in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pocket linings promise even more. Last fall, for example,
Barneys sold a polyester men's trench coat with a specially lined
pocket that was designed to shield the wearer from cellular-phone
emissions. Although the store no longer stocks the coat, it did
quite well, a store spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some designers and retailers are embracing digital devices in a
more general way. Take cargo pants, for example, a many-pocketed
style that has become ubiquitous in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   While the pockets were not added specifically to accommodate
current gadgetry, ``it's clear from all the pockets in cargo pants
that there's plenty of room,'' said Lonnie Fogel, a spokesman for
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, a retailer whose cargo pants ($59.50 to
$69.50) are marketed primarily to device-laden college students.
</P>
<P>
   Where will pockets go next? ``I see this as a short-lived
trend,'' Ms. Lindholm said. ``Think about it. There is no place on
my body that needs any added dimension. Where do you want the extra
bulk you get from carrying a device? Around the waist? Down on your
thigh?''
</P>
<P>
   Put that way, it makes the blanket from Orfi sound positively
slimming. Does it come with pockets?

SINCE ``PULP FICTION,'' TRAVOLTA HAS BOOGIED FROM ONE GREAT ROLE TO
ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He's a bold and impressive actor, John Travolta _ maybe
better at playing arrogance than any other actor of his generation.
Which is why his sunny, agreeable disposition is a little
disconcerting. There have been reports of the Vulcan Mind Meld that
he employs with interviewers, turning the tables on them.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Dallas to promote the new military murder mystery, ``The
General's Daughter,'' he's easygoing and open. When asked why he's
working so much these days _ he hasn't taken a break since 1994's
``Pulp Fiction'' re-ignited his career _ he strokes his
salt-and-pepper goatee and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the scripts I'm getting now are so much better,'' he
responds. ``I've gotta be honest with you, based on the couple of
scripts a year I was getting then, there was no reason to push
myself. But the material now is so much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another period, roughly 20 years ago, when he was
offered everything under the sun. He was slated to be the lead in
``American Gigolo.'' Noted recluse and Texas native Terrence Malick
also wrote ``Days of Heaven'' for Travolta, but the actor couldn't
get free from his commitment to play the shaggy-haired chowderhead
Vinnie Barbarino on TV's ``Welcome Back, Kotter.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Grease'' and
``Urban Cowboy'' days, before bombs like ``Perfect'' and schlock
like the ``Look Who's Talking'' pictures had damaged his momentum.
But after ``Pulp Fiction'' led to successes including ``Face-Off''
and ``Get Shorty,'' it was as if the actor didn't want to sit
still, as if he were afraid he might miss an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That extends to publicity; Travolta has actively pushed his
recent projects, including last winter's ``A Civil Action.'' On
press rounds in Dallas for ``General,'' Travolta's not wearing the
black Armani suit that he's sported for so many of the ``Oprah''
appearances _ like last week's, when he was smoothing down a rep
tie over his pasha's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's wearing a chocolate brown number, with an iridescent
dark-brown shirt and matching tie as he eases himself onto the
sofa. His bright, blue eyes shining as if they had been lubricated,
Travolta becomes reflective at a moment's notice; he speaks very
intently, so as not to be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Although he gained fame for his prowess on the dance floor (see
his breakout film, ``Saturday Night Fever''), Travolta is just as
good with language. In the dialogue-heavy ``The General's
Daughter,'' Travolta plays Paul Brenner, a military intelligence
officer investigating the gruesome murder of a female captain who
turns out to be the daughter of a general with political
aspirations. He notes that he had a lot of dialogue in ``A Civil
Action'' and ``Primary Colors.'' But the difference in ``Daughter''
is that he's not winding up and delivering speeches.
</P>
<P>
   This movie, he says, pursing his lips, ``is probably the most
dialogue-heavy based on character. There's all these layers. And
that's what I love about it; you never know until he's in the
middle of the cycle of communication where he's going. (Brenner) is
very shrewd about how much he shows to people. And the humor, his
wryness is so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one can't help but ask him about doing a musical, given
the splash he made in ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Grease.'' He
can appear to be outsized and relaxed at once, shifting his weight
and sprawling on the sofa as he warms to the conversation. He seems
a natural to play Dean Martin in the biopic to be directed by
Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he corrects, ``(I'll play) Sinatra.'' But in Los
Angeles, there were stories circulating that he was offered the
Martin role. And it seems like such a logical choice. When pressed
on the subject, he sits up, his eyes twinkling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me Dean,'' he says, nodding, ``but I didn't say
yes to it right away. To be honest with you, I didn't know there
was a deadline on saying yes to it. My agent had said, `Look,
there's this (Dean Martin biography by writer Nick Tosches). They
just wanna develop it for you.' And Marty (Scorsese) wasn't
involved yet. And (my agent) said, `I don't recommend it because of
this and that.' But I said, `Let me think about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was in the luxury mode of thinking, `I got time,
this is something to think about.' So, that Friday came and I
didn't know (about the deadline) and they were on Tom (Hanks). And
Tom said yes. Maybe it'd be more interesting for me to play
Sinatra. But (the script's) not done yet. It's not finished. If
they finish it, and they still want me to do it, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be more evident that Travolta is itching to throw
himself into a musical the way he's been immersing himself in other
work in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he says, loosening his tie. ``I love the idea of
doing something musical. And Hollywood's not very for it, y'know.
You have to fight every inch of the way. They'd just as soon put
you in a legal thriller that might have more potential to the
audience. Who can figure it? All I know is I have the confidence in
it. They don't. But how do you talk someone into it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a peculiar spectacle, to hear John Travolta _ the man who
brought new life to musicals with ``Saturday Night Fever'' and
``Grease'' after the genre was pronounced dead _ being forced to
defend the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, (`Fever') producer Robert Stigwood was music. He was the
Bee Gees. He believed in the music. You see, those guys were coming
from the record side of things. (Stigwood managed the Bee Gees and
they recorded for his label.) He understood it, like the MTV people
today, they understand those things. Studio heads don't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about a place like Paramount, where he made ``Daughter.''
The studio is a part of Viacom, which also owns MTV. Travolta sits
back and smiles. ``They still don't get it,'' he emphasizes.
``Garth Brooks is gonna do a musical for them. It'll still take him
two or three years to get it off the ground, because of the
tenacity one would have to go to the studio with to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interview ends, Travolta mentions that a planned musical
project, ``Standing Room Only,'' based on the life of singer Jimmy
Roselli (''a would-be superstar who could've been as big as Tony
Bennett or Sinatra'') had to be postponed for a while. Gus Van Sant
had been slated to direct, but, Travolta says, ``I don't know if
he'll do it in a year. He may be on to another project. I don't
know if he would want to wait a whole year when he has other things
he could do. I could find a good director (to replace him).''
</P>
<P>
   And who would Travolta have in mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Travolta says, laughing, ``Scorsese would be good.''

ELECTRONIC RETINAL IMPLANTS MERGING COMPUTERS AND NEURONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Md., Mass., Ill.)  (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By ANNE EISENBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic retinal implants are not the bionic eyes of science
fiction, the sort that Geordi on ``Star Trek'' had, but they are
getting closer. Work on these implants, which would be among the
first marriages of computers and neurons, is progressing fast,
researchers say, partly because of the increasing power of computer
chips. Such implants may start giving blind patients limited vision
within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have third- and fourth-generation computer chips that can
electrically stimulate the retina,'' said Dr. Mark Humayun, a
retinal surgeon, biomedical engineer and professor at the Wilmer
Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ``The way the
engineering and biological testing have been going, we feel very
confident we'll have a prototype for human use not in 10 or 20
years, but in 2 to 5 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Humayun and Dr. Eugene de Juan Jr. lead a group of scientists,
surgeons, electrophysiologists and electrical engineers, one of a
handful of multidisciplinary teams in the United States and Germany
that are working on prototypes for retinal prostheses. At least
three start-up companies have also formed to develop the new
implants.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving neural tissue in the eyes of blind patients can
respond to electrical stimulation. When blind patients' retinas
were stimulated by handheld electrodes, precursors of the tiny
silicon chips the team hopes to implant in the future, the patients
reported that they could see points of light, dim outlines and the
shapes of letters, Humayun said. ``We can get patients to see a
simple geometric shape like a box or a letter like `H.' It's very
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Humayun does not expect to replicate the complexities of natural
vision. ``Simply providing mobility-type vision, or the ability to
distinguish between light and dark to patients who are completely
blind, will have far-reaching consequences,'' he said. ``Being able
to see the outline of a person or doorway makes a different world
than the world of total blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   The new prostheses will work by electrically stimulating the
millions of neurons in the retina, a thin layer of light receptors
and other neurons in the back of the eye. The silicon chip that
stimulates the nerves will be placed either near the retinal layer
where nerve impulses are sent to the brain, a method being
developed by the Johns Hopkins group and a group at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, or close to the
front-line light-detecting cells, the rods and cones, a method
developed by Dr. Alan Chow and his brother Vincent, co-founders of
Optobionics in Wheaton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients are blind because of light-sensing cells that
have degenerated or died,'' Humayun explained. ``But the rest of
the retina is made of neurons that are relatively intact. Our idea
_ and the idea of other teams in the field _ is to jump-start these
other retinal neurons that are waiting in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The microelectronic prostheses are designed to help the
estimated 30 million people worldwide who suffer from two diseases
of the retina: macular degeneration and retinitis pigmentosa. Even
when the the rods and cones in these patients have died,
researchers say, the remaining retinal circuitry, when stimulated
by electrical signals, is powerful enough to send signals through
the optic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both of these diseases, the rods and cones degenerate,''
said Dr. John Wyatt, a professor of electrical engineering at MIT.
Wyatt and Dr. Joseph Rizzo, a neuro-ophthalmologist at Harvard
Medical School, lead a research group that has worked for nearly 10
years on a retinal implant that would stimulate the cells that
carry signals from the retina to the brain, the ganglion cells,
which are close to the lining in the back of the eye. ``The rods
and cones have died, but the ganglion cells that communicate
straight to the brain still live in substantial numbers and
apparently still work,'' Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt emphasized that the new devices were designed for
degenerative diseases of the retina and not for damage to the optic
nerve or brain. In particular, he said the devices would not be
helpful for vision loss from glaucoma, in which there is damage to
the optic nerve.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard-MIT group plans to use at least two silicon
microchips. One chip, the signal processor, will be mounted on a
pair of glasses, along with a camera. Once an image is captured, it
will be transmitted wirelessly to a second chip embedded in the
eye. After that chip receives the signal, it will stimulate the
retina.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT-Harvard group has not yet implanted a microchip in a
person but has started experiments in which the retinas of blind
patients are stimulated with microelectrodes. Earlier this year,
the group implanted a microelectrode array, three millimeters wide
and one-eighth the thickness of a human hair, in the group's third
patient and left it in place for about three hours. The technical
challenges were daunting because the device had to be inserted in
such a way that both it and the retina survived unharmed, Wyatt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The retina is delicate, ``about as strong as one layer of wet
Kleenex,'' he said. If torn, the retina will become detached from
the lining of the eye; if compressed, it can squeeze the blood
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we are only doing short-term experiments of a few
hours in humans,'' Wyatt said. ``Presumably our patients would
continue to learn if the prosthesis were left in the eye for
months.'' The ability of the brain to learn and adapt over time is
expected to be an asset once the devices remain in place longer.

<P>
   The researchers hope that electronic implants that bypass
damaged rods and cones in the eye may one day be as successful as
the cochlear implants used in the inner ear. Since the 1970s,
cochlear implants have restored some hearing to thousands of deaf
patients, and their ability to hear often improves over time as the
brain adapts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cochlear implants, patients continued to show improved word
recognition scores as the years passed,'' Wyatt said.
</P>
<P>
   While the strategy of both the John Hopkins and Harvard-MIT
groups is to place the stimulation near the ganglion cells, which
is called an epiretinal approach, Optobionics has developed a
silicon chip that is designed to stimulate the area near the rods
and cones; it will need no wiring because it will be powered by
incident light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a simple silicon chip embedded with thousands of
microscopic solar cells,'' said Chow, of Optobionics. ``The
placement of the chip underneath the retina is actually closer to
the remnants of the rods and cones than the epiretinal approach,
allowing better processing of the signal by the remainder of the
retina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have looked at the device mostly in rabbits and rats,''
Chow said. ``The implants are biocompatible and will continue to
function over long periods of time.'' Chow said he hoped to begin
clinical trials with patients with retinitis pigmentosa within a
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we are satisfied with the level of safety and
biocompatibility, we will pull together data to submit to the Food
and Drug Administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt cautioned that many problems remained to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data are encouraging, but they are not yet good enough to
justify chronic implantation in humans. We have a ways to go.''  &QL;

SINCE ``PULP FICTION,'' TRAVOLTA HAS BOOGIED FROM ONE GREAT ROLE TO
ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ He's a bold and impressive actor, John Travolta _ maybe
better at playing arrogance than any other actor of his generation.
Which is why his sunny, agreeable disposition is a little
disconcerting. There have been reports of the Vulcan Mind Meld that
he employs with interviewers, turning the tables on them.
</P>
<P>
   But, in Dallas to promote the new military murder mystery, ``The
General's Daughter,'' he's easygoing and open. When asked why he's
working so much these days _ he hasn't taken a break since 1994's
``Pulp Fiction'' re-ignited his career _ he strokes his
salt-and-pepper goatee and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the scripts I'm getting now are so much better,'' he
responds. ``I've gotta be honest with you, based on the couple of
scripts a year I was getting then, there was no reason to push
myself. But the material now is so much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another period, roughly 20 years ago, when he was
offered everything under the sun. He was slated to be the lead in
``American Gigolo.'' Noted recluse and Texas native Terrence Malick
also wrote ``Days of Heaven'' for Travolta, but the actor couldn't
get free from his commitment to play the shaggy-haired chowderhead
Vinnie Barbarino on TV's ``Welcome Back, Kotter.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Grease'' and
``Urban Cowboy'' days, before bombs like ``Perfect'' and schlock
like the ``Look Who's Talking'' pictures had damaged his momentum.
But after ``Pulp Fiction'' led to successes including ``Face-Off''
and ``Get Shorty,'' it was as if the actor didn't want to sit
still, as if he were afraid he might miss an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   That extends to publicity; Travolta has actively pushed his
recent projects, including last winter's ``A Civil Action.'' On
press rounds in Dallas for ``General,'' Travolta's not wearing the
black Armani suit that he's sported for so many of the ``Oprah''
appearances _ like last week's, when he was smoothing down a rep
tie over his pasha's belly.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he's wearing a chocolate brown number, with an iridescent
dark-brown shirt and matching tie as he eases himself onto the
sofa. His bright, blue eyes shining as if they had been lubricated,
Travolta becomes reflective at a moment's notice; he speaks very
intently, so as not to be misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Although he gained fame for his prowess on the dance floor (see
his breakout film, ``Saturday Night Fever''), Travolta is just as
good with language. In the dialogue-heavy ``The General's
Daughter,'' Travolta plays Paul Brenner, a military intelligence
officer investigating the gruesome murder of a female captain who
turns out to be the daughter of a general with political
aspirations. He notes that he had a lot of dialogue in ``A Civil
Action'' and ``Primary Colors.'' But the difference in ``Daughter''
is that he's not winding up and delivering speeches.
</P>
<P>
   This movie, he says, pursing his lips, ``is probably the most
dialogue-heavy based on character. There's all these layers. And
that's what I love about it; you never know until he's in the
middle of the cycle of communication where he's going. (Brenner) is
very shrewd about how much he shows to people. And the humor, his
wryness is so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one can't help but ask him about doing a musical, given
the splash he made in ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Grease.'' He
can appear to be outsized and relaxed at once, shifting his weight
and sprawling on the sofa as he warms to the conversation. He seems
a natural to play Dean Martin in the biopic to be directed by
Martin Scorsese.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he corrects, ``(I'll play) Sinatra.'' But in Los
Angeles, there were stories circulating that he was offered the
Martin role. And it seems like such a logical choice. When pressed
on the subject, he sits up, his eyes twinkling.
</P>
<P>
   ``They offered me Dean,'' he says, nodding, ``but I didn't say
yes to it right away. To be honest with you, I didn't know there
was a deadline on saying yes to it. My agent had said, `Look,
there's this (Dean Martin biography by writer Nick Tosches). They
just wanna develop it for you.' And Marty (Scorsese) wasn't
involved yet. And (my agent) said, `I don't recommend it because of
this and that.' But I said, `Let me think about it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was in the luxury mode of thinking, `I got time,
this is something to think about.' So, that Friday came and I
didn't know (about the deadline) and they were on Tom (Hanks). And
Tom said yes. Maybe it'd be more interesting for me to play
Sinatra. But (the script's) not done yet. It's not finished. If
they finish it, and they still want me to do it, I'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't be more evident that Travolta is itching to throw
himself into a musical the way he's been immersing himself in other
work in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' he says, loosening his tie. ``I love the idea of
doing something musical. And Hollywood's not very for it, y'know.
You have to fight every inch of the way. They'd just as soon put
you in a legal thriller that might have more potential to the
audience. Who can figure it? All I know is I have the confidence in
it. They don't. But how do you talk someone into it?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a peculiar spectacle, to hear John Travolta _ the man who
brought new life to musicals with ``Saturday Night Fever'' and
``Grease'' after the genre was pronounced dead _ being forced to
defend the genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, (`Fever') producer Robert Stigwood was music. He was the
Bee Gees. He believed in the music. You see, those guys were coming
from the record side of things. (Stigwood managed the Bee Gees and
they recorded for his label.) He understood it, like the MTV people
today, they understand those things. Studio heads don't understand
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What about a place like Paramount, where he made ``Daughter.''
The studio is a part of Viacom, which also owns MTV. Travolta sits
back and smiles. ``They still don't get it,'' he emphasizes.
``Garth Brooks is gonna do a musical for them. It'll still take him
two or three years to get it off the ground, because of the
tenacity one would have to go to the studio with to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the interview ends, Travolta mentions that a planned musical
project, ``Standing Room Only,'' based on the life of singer Jimmy
Roselli (''a would-be superstar who could've been as big as Tony
Bennett or Sinatra'') had to be postponed for a while. Gus Van Sant
had been slated to direct, but, Travolta says, ``I don't know if
he'll do it in a year. He may be on to another project. I don't
know if he would want to wait a whole year when he has other things
he could do. I could find a good director (to replace him).''
</P>
<P>
   And who would Travolta have in mind?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Travolta says, laughing, ``Scorsese would be good.''

FOR UKRAINE, HE'S A NATIVE SON, REGARDLESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (Eds: Richard Taruskin is the author of ``Defining Russia
Musically'' and other books.)  
 By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this much for nationalism: Its cultural salvage missions,
however perversely motivated, can yield up fascinating flotsam. In
a new recording, a group of singers and instrumentalists from Lviv
_ formerly Lvov and, before that, Lemberg _ in newly independent
Ukraine has lovingly resurrected ``Alcide,'' an opera by Dmitri
Bortniansky, a distinguished native of the Ukrainian village of
Glukhov who never thought of himself as a Ukrainian, and who spent
most of his life trying to forget he ever saw the place.
</P>
<P>
   Bortniansky wrote ``Alcide'' to an Italian text by the great
librettist Pietro Metastasio during his apprentice years in
Bologna, where he was studying at the expense of the German-born,
French-speaking Russian Empress Catherine the Great.
</P>
<P>
   Performed in Venice (once only) in 1778, when the composer was
27, the score now rests in the British Library. The next year,
Bortniansky went home _ not to Ukraine, where he lived only until
his ninth year, but to St. Petersburg, where he became director of
music to the future Czar Paul I and later took over the Imperial
Chapel Choir, in which he had flourished as a child star.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 40 years and more, he wrote a wealth of Italianate
``concertos,'' or a cappella cantatas for the choir, and it is on
these that his fame now chiefly rests. At his death, in 1825, he
was the most lavishly decorated, socially exalted musician the
Russian empire had ever produced rather than imported. If
Bortniansky was a Ukrainian composer, Irving Berlin was a Siberian
one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Ukrainians are not going to perform his operas,
who will? And so, thanks to their possibly misplaced but welcome
national pride, Bortniansky's ``Alcide'' (performed from an edition
published in Kiev in 1985) joins the tiny cache of post-Handelian,
pre-Mozartean Italian ``serious'' operas that have been recorded
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The genre was cosmopolitanism itself, a tribute to the
internationalism of the European upper crust at a time when social
solidarity was everywhere defined ``horizontally'' (by class)
rather than ``vertically'' (by nation).
</P>
<P>
   The rise of nationalism in the wake of Romanticism was actually
among the things that killed off the opera seria. Yet the recent
New Grove Dictionary of Opera, along with countless Soviet and
post-Soviet hack writers, persists in the romantic fantasy that
``Bortniansky's operas are based on Italian models but incorporate
elements of Ukrainian monophonic chant and Ukrainian and Russian
folk music.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't even try to look for such things. To have included them in
his operas would have altogether defeated the Empress' purpose in
educating the composer. But if you have enjoyed the rare recorded
operas by Johann Christian Bach or Johann Adolf Hasse, or if you
would like to sample their style at somewhat shorter length and in
somewhat more vivid colors, then Bortniansky may be your man.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter length and the vivid colors are due neither to the
composer's national origin nor to any personal bent. Rather, they
are attributes of the specific subgenre to which ``Alcide''
belongs. It is a ``festa teatrale,'' a ``theatrical celebration''
or mythological pageant with choruses and an expanded orchestra, of
a kind Metastasio wrote to order for birthday or wedding feasts at
the Vienna court.
</P>
<P>
   Hasse, who worked there alongside Metastasio, made the original
setting, in 1760. After it went into general circulation, a
Neapolitan composer named Nicola Conforto set it for the Spanish
royal court in Madrid before it was handed to Bortniansky.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stiff moral allegory, meant both to compliment and to
instruct the royal bridegroom or birthday boy with a flattering
comparison to the title character, better known as Hercules. Left
at a crossroads by his teacher Fronimo (tenor), Alcide must choose
between the realms of pleasure and virtue, ruled by the goddesses
Hedonide and Aretea (dueling sopranos).
</P>
<P>
   Having made the right choice _ can't guess which? ask William
Bennett _ Alcide qets to have it all. Hedonide, now chastened and
obedient, joins him in Virtueland to reward his good deeds as only
she can do.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The performance (Erol ER 98001; two CDs), conducted by the only
non-Ukrainian, Jean-Pierre Lore, is about as good as one can expect
under the circumstances: earnest and pretty in the spirit of early
music, but a long way from the virtuosity and glamour that provided
opera seria with its reason for being.
</P>
<P>
   Only the harpsichordist seems to be using a period instrument,
but opera seria is the one early genre that really needs period
instruments: vocal ones.
</P>
<P>
   Its prospects for modern revival are virtually nil, since (as
anyone knows who has seen the movie ``Farinelli'') the instrument
needed most of all can no longer be legally obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Natalya Datsko, a soprano, brings plenty of girlish pep to the
role of Alcide, but it is impossible to associate a voice like hers
_ or even like Marilyn Horne's, say what you like _ with the manly
``Herculean'' virtues castrato singers were manufactured to flaunt.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties are not only anatomical. The remaining singers
_ the sopranos Narina Zagorulko (Hedonide) and Olga Pasichnyk
(Aretea), and especially the high tenor Patrick Garayt (Fronimo),
who gets to sing the obligatory simile aria (``Time is fleeting as
the current in the stream, the arrow in the air'') _ have been
instilled with modern notions of taste and decorum that rigorously
preclude the kind of vainglorious ornateness and creative abandon
that even mediocre operatic singing once displayed. Score-bound
literalness, what used to be called historical authenticity, as
ever killeth the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Textual fidelity here extends even to the scrupulous
reproduction of the misprints (or, perhaps, the transcription
errors) in the 1985 score. Ornaments and cadenzas are tiny,
grudging, gingerly. The most extended one, right before the da capo
repeat in Hedonide's last aria, unfortunately strays off key.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of the wildness that daring singing would have
provided (and that the composer was counting on), Bortniansky's
consistently sweet and cheery music grows cloying.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are moments to savor, even if they are mainly to be
found on the margins, in the choral and orchestral numbers. The
dramatic high point, Alcide's stormy confrontation with a chorus of
furies (in a singular and very welcome excursion into the minor
mode) comes off well. The three big orchestral items (Overture,
``Dance of the Spirits,'' ``Dance of the Furies'') are played with
gusto, and, curiously, they are encored at the end of the second CD
in a makeshift orchestral suite, perhaps to encourage plugs on
singerphobic FM.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for opera guild parties, there is ``Dove ando?''
(``Where has she gone?''), Alcide's slow aria in quest of Aretea,
virtually plagiarized, one assumes unconsciously, from Orfeo's
great aria ``Che faro senza Euridice?'' in Gluck's most famous
opera, which was new at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Doubtless some musicologist in Kharkov or Odessa has managed to
trace it to a Ukrainian folk song in an effort to get the callow
Bortniansky off the hook, but the resemblance is patent, and it
will tantalize your most knowledgeable friends. Ms. Datsko sings it
becomingly.

DOUBLE SLAYING PERPLEXES ILLINOIS TOWN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GORHAM, Ill. _ Most of the time, the trains barrel through this
small town at 70 mph, far too fast for anyone to get off.
</P>
<P>
   But now and then, one has to stop at the switching station to
let another train go by.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of June 15, one stopped long enough, authorities
believe, for Rafael Resendez-Ramirez to slip out of a boxcar,
through the woods and into a trailer home where Carolyn Frederick,
51, was caring for her 79-year-old father, George Morber.
</P>
<P>
   They were slain that morning for reasons that still puzzle
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' Jackson County Sheriff Bill
Kilquist said this week after fingerprints found in the home were
identified as those of Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have taken from that old man anything he wanted ...
including his truck. There was no need to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Morber's truck was found a day later in a school parking lot in
Cairo, Ill., on the Kentucky border, about 60 miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez, 38, a Mexican national, is believed to have
killed at least eight people in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky during
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, authorities in Pontiac, Ill., 80 miles southwest of
Chicago, confirmed that Resendez-Ramirez is a possible suspect in
last week's slaying of Juanita Sapp, 40, whose body was found near
her apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Like the six murders credited to Resendez-Ramirez in Texas and
Kentucky, the three in Illinois occurred a short distance from
railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims have been murdered with such ferocity that law
officers think rage is the primary motive.
</P>
<P>
   Although police are withholding many details, the killer
reportedly covered each victim, as if to conceal his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are creatures of habit,'' Kilquist said. ``You know ...
it's like some people in a restaurant will take their napkins and
cover their plates after they've eaten. They're covering up their
messes.''
</P>
<P>
   The double murder here shocked and terrified the community of
about 300, unaccustomed to even petty crimes, though there are
three prison units in the immediate area. Most residents earn a
living farming or working for one of the prisons.
</P>
<P>
   George Morber was a retired prison guard, living in a trailer
home outside of town, beside a small pond that separated his
property from that of his daughter and son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   About 1:30 p.m. June 15, Donald Frederick found the bodies of
his wife and father-in-law and called the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Kilquist had been at the scene for about five minutes, waiting
for crime scene technicians to arrive, when he made the connection:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asking my investigator, `Who could have done this? Why
would anybody have done this?' Then I heard a noise. I looked up
and there was a train going by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Am I going crazy or did I read somewhere about
murders being committed near railroad tracks?' He said, `No, I read
that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilquist contacted the FBI and Texas Rangers, who were probing
the murders in Texas, investigations that had centered on
Resendez-Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week passed before fingerprint analyses confirmed on
Monday that Resendez-Ramirez had been in the Morber home.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a week, some residents of Gorham breathed
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of people scared around here,'' said Ray Miller,
a friend of one of the victims. ``I suppose if he was going to
choose another person, though, he would have moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was frightened,'' admitted Ellen Fritsche, the postmaster.
``Everybody was. People were locking their doors and they've never
done that. They were checking out their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Arena, who lives behind his bait shop a few miles from
Gorham, said his wife became nervous when he left the house to
check on his store after dark. ``She's packing her gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine _ he's a prison guard _ lives just up the
hill and my wife goes to work the same time he does. She meets him
up there and follows him into (Murphysboro).''
</P>
<P>
   After the fingerprints were identified, Morber's son, Bill, told
the local newspaper, ``Everyone is on edge and will be until this
Ramirez is caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, family members are saying little.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Frederick, driving away from his house across the pond
from where his wife died, seemed relieved that a suspect now had a
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad there's only one of them sonsabitches out there
instead of two.''

FOR PASTORS AND RABBIS, IT'S THE SEASON OF SAYING GOODBYE

   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC;

</P>
<P>
   URBANA, Ohio -- Don Hilkerbaumer stood in front of his
Presbyterian congregation one recent Sunday to conduct his final
worship service here -- and to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row sat a despondent and tearful Polly Wilbur. For
the 13-year-old, Hilkerbaumer was the only pastor she had ever
known. And though his new church is only 40 minutes away, the break
from this congregation will be permanent, in accordance with
Presbyterian polity.
</P>
<P>
   Hilkerbaumer himself cried so often during the service, he
finally stopped in mid-sentence while delivering his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever wonder why God made us in such a way that our
noses run when we cry?'' he sniffled loudly, as the congregation
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   This scene will be replayed thousands of times over the next
several weeks throughout the country. For American churches and
synagogues, the period between Memorial Day and Independence Day is
clergy-moving season.
</P>
<P>
   There are scandals, illnesses and other reasons that cause
pastors and rabbis to leave their posts abruptly. But most clergy
follow a well-ordered, time-tested moving season defined around
academic calendars and summer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A rabbi in Sacramento also teaches Hebrew at a local university,
so she waits until the end of the academic year to accept her new
position.
</P>
<P>
   An Episcopal priest waits until the school year ends before he
moves his two elementary-age children to a new community -- with
hopes they can make a handful of friends before entering a new
school in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other element of congregation life, each denomination
gives the event its own twist.
</P>
<P>
   While Presbyterians, Lutherans and Episcopalians typically honor
</P>
<P>
   their pastors with a Sunday evening potluck and tribute, United
Methodists and Roman Catholics seem less likely to overflow with
emotion. Their pastors move frequently and can be abruptly snatched
away at the whim of higher church officials. Goodbyes are sometimes
nothing more than a handshake and a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern and American Baptist churches and in almost all
African-American churches, the pastor's move can be genuinely
traumatic. He typically serves the congregation 15 to 20 years and
is usually not just a religious leader but a community force as
well, sitting on local boards like United Way, the Chamber of
Commerce and the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative rabbis average eight to 12 years at one
congregation, and their reputation for community involvement is
second only to black pastors. Their good-bye dinners typically
include an audience that extends far beyond their own
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor-parish specialists from all denominations agree on three
golden commandments for departing clergy:
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt allow several weeks between the day thou announce
thine departure and the day of thy final service.
</P>
<P>
   This gives members enough time to adjust to the change and
prepare for the new clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six weeks, and church members tend to feel robbed.
More than a few months, and they begin to wonder if the pastor is
actually leaving.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt not allow thy final worship service to become a
tribute to thee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the final service should closely follow the
congregation's traditional worship form but include what
denominations call ``The Release of Pastoral Duties.''
</P>
<P>
   In this litany, the congregation formally says goodbye to the
pastor or rabbi while forgiving him or her of any past mistakes and
thanking him or her for past contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the pastor or rabbi forgives members of the
congregation for their errors and thanks them for their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spirit of an ancient Hebrew covenant, the pastor
and congregation commit each other to God and part ways.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt make a clean break.
</P>
<P>
   No fuzzy departures. No saying good-bye and then hanging around
to see if you can help out at the next wedding or funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A change in clergy means a change in leadership style, the
likely addition of new ministries and probably even alterations in
the worship services.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation must be allowed to develop a relationship with
the new clergy without interference from the former.

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I always cover my floors and carpet with plastic sheets when
painting a room. However, when I last painted the baseboards in my
carpeted living room and bedroom I had a problem with some paint
from the baseboards dripping down or getting smeared onto the edges
of the carpet _ especially where the carpet has a deeper pile. I've
tried cardboard and plastic guards that I slide along as I paint,
but still get smears on the carpet. Any other ideas on how to avoid
this?
</P>
<P>
   A: An almost foolproof method is to use a wide putty knife to
force the edges of the plastic drop cloth under the baseboard as
shown here. Some paint may drip onto the plastic and into the joint
between the baseboard and the plastic, but this seal can be broken
before you pick up the plastic by pushing down on the plastic sheet
before you try to pull it out. That way none of the dried paint
will get pulled off the baseboard.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We live in a mobile home park and our water comes from a well
that the park operates, although we do have city sewer lines. Our
problem is that we get a strange odor (something like sewer gas)
whenever the water is running in the shower or in the washing
machine. The well water supply is tested by the state on a regular
basis, so we know that this is OK. Can you tell us what we can do
to solve this problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Chances are that the odor comes from minerals in your well
water, although it may still be perfectly safe for drinking. If
this is the case you can install an odor-removing filter in your
water line. Small filters that fit under the kitchen sink will get
rid of the odor in the water used for drinking and cooking, but if
you want to also eliminate the odor from the water going to the
bathroom and other appliances you will have to install a larger,
``whole house'' filter in your incoming water line. There are many
companies that install and service such filtering systems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our detached two-car garage was originally near the back of
our lot and we had it moved nearer to the street some years ago,
but there was no special foundation put down for the building other
than some timbers on the ground. Now one wall is sinking and the
ground timbers are rotting. We want to save this garage, so can you
tell me what steps should be taken?
</P>
<P>
   A: Every building needs a foundation that goes down into the
ground deep enough to be below the frost level. Saving or restoring
your garage will require jacking it up (so you can excavate the
ground under it) or moving it out of the way temporarily, and then
building a proper underground masonry foundation where you want the
garage to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 20-year-old house has lap siding that is made of exterior
hardboard or pressed wood of some kind. It was originally finished
at the factory with dark brown paint or coating. On the south and
west sides which are exposed to the sun the color is starting to
fade and seems to have a whitish film over it. How can I prepare
this surface for painting it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your best bet is to contact the manufacturer of the siding to
get their recommendation. If this is impractical, then you should
scrub the surface down completely, sand lightly with fine paper and
dust thoroughly (scrubbing and sanding will remove the oxidized
paint that you think is a film). After that, apply a coat of
exterior primer, followed by one or two coats of exterior latex
house paint.

MEN SHEDDING SUPERMAN COMPLEX, STARTING TO WORRY MORE ABOUT THEIR
HEALTH
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by MEN-HEALTH-TESTOSTERONE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``stronger'' sex is beginning to toughen up, finally.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy is at an all-time high of 76.5 years in the
United States _ 73.6 years for men, who have started to close the
gender gap in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Our fathers, grandfathers, brothers, husbands and sons continue
to smoke more, eat more cheeseburgers and have fewer screenings for
serious diseases than their female counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they are experiencing life-threatening chest pains,
shortness of breath or blurred vision, millions of men say they
would not go to the doctor. A big part of the reason is attitude:
Men have traditionally believed that they just don't get sick.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, most men don't believe that they are Superman,
and more and more men are showing that they do care about staying
healthy. Cheeseburgers or not, signs of a sea change in the way men
view their bodies and their health are clear.
</P>
<P>
   The forces of change? Everything from Bob Dole to Propecia, and
from AIDS to HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you see men throwing their fear of gender
self-degradation to the wind and enrolling in coed aerobics
programs and even water ballet,'' says Charles Inlander, president
of the People's Medical Society, a national consumer health group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember,'' said Inlander, who is also the author of ``Men's
Health for Dummies'' (IDG Books, $19.99), ``it was men who started
the jogging craze, went to the gym at lunchtime and asked their
employers to create on-site wellness programs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most men still believe they are bulletproof on different
levels. They believe men don't or shouldn't get sick. But that's
changing,'' said Dr. Kenneth Goldberg, former medical director of
the Male Health Institute in Dallas and a contributing editor for
``Men's Health'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still the basic fear, the denial aspect,'' Goldberg
said in a telephone interview on his way home from the first
National Men's Health Collaborative in Philadelphia. ``It's still
not socially acceptable for a man to get sick or have medical
problems. I think we've got a long way to go to get over that `I'm
invincible' attitude, but a change is in the making. It's out
there,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who is also the author of ``How Men Can Live as Long
as Women'' (The Summit Group, $22.95), points out that the gender
gap in life expectancy is down from seven to less than six years.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have contributed to the changes in men's health
care, including the availability of more conservative forms of
therapy for erectile dysfunction and all the national media
attention to Viagra and new treatments for prostate cancer and
benign prostate disease, he said. Having a national spokesman like
Bob Dole talk about prostate cancer makes a big difference, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we continue to see women more actively involved with men's
health as well as their own,'' said Goldberg, whose newest book is
titled ``When the Man You Love Won't Take Care of His Health''
(Golden Books, $22).
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are smarter about their health. If a man took as good
care of his body as he does his car, he'd be a lot better off,''
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The closing of the gender gap in life expectancy is also one of
the topics Gail Sheehy addresses in her new book, ``Understanding
Men's Passages,'' (Ballantine Books, $14).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most stunning developments of the 20th century has
been to stretch the life cycle by an average of 30 years,'' Sheehy
said. ``In 1996 alone, American men added six months to their life
expectancy and reached a new high.''
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy for U.S. men has reached an all-time high of
73.6 years, 5.6 less than the 79.2 years for women. The gender gap
is more than a year closer than it was in 1990, when men could
expect to live to 72 and women to 79, according to the most recent
calculations from the National Center for Health Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Falling death rates from major diseases including heart attacks,
strokes, cancer and AIDS are helping men live almost as long as
women, Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Inlander said that men's success in addressing disease has been
spurred by new screening tests and medications _ and by concerns as
simple as hair loss and as serious as AIDS that are getting men
into their physicians' office with more regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have much better screening tests for some of the health
problems that trouble men most,'' Inlander said. ``The single thing
that did the most to get men into the health care system was the
development of the PSA exam for prostate cancer. Men are absolutely
scared to death of prostate problems. Now that the PSA is
encouraged for all men beginning at age 50, more men are getting
into doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing encouraging men to seek medical help is the fact
that we have new medications to resolve certain problems, like hair
loss. It may not be the worst disease in the world, but because men
are so concerned with it, they are getting into the system
earlier,'' Inlander says.
</P>
<P>
   Also, sexually transmitted diseases, especially AIDS, are a
great concern for younger men who traditionally have avoided
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men have become better educated about STDs. AIDS has become a
major scare, so a lot of younger men are approaching the health
care system,'' Inlander said. ``They are still not going to the
doctor for things like treatment for depression like they should
be, but they are beginning to come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Inlander said, the role that managed care has played in
getting men into the health care system should not be discounted.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs encourage members to come in for physical exams and
screening tests including tests for prostate disease and
hypertension and diabetes and high cholesterol and skin cancer and
TB.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they are enrolled, they are able to be reached. Most men
under 30 didn't even have a doctor until they started joining
HMOs,'' Inlander said.
</P>
<P>
   While experts are happy to point to the signs that men are
taking new control over their own health, they also note that
progress does not mean complete success. Guys may now know that
they're not Superman, but they still have a lot to learn.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey, released by ``Men's Health'' magazine for
Father's Day, shows that 7 million U.S. men have not had a basic
health check in more than a decade. The survey also finds that
one-third of men would not go to the doctor even if they were
experiencing life-threatening health problems such as severe chest
pains or shortness of breath, two top symptoms of heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This probably explains why so many men end up in the cardiac
care unit of hospitals clutching a package of antacid tablets,''
said Michael Lafavore, editor in chief of ``Men's Health''
magazine. ``Guys still need to learn there's a big difference
between indigestion from eating too many nachos and a clogged
artery.''

TENNIS ASSOCIATION PRESIDENT RETURNS TO REMINISCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LAURA ROLLINS HOCKADAY  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Judy Ade Levering, the first woman president
of the United States Tennis Association in its 118 years, visited
her old neighborhood recently and reminisced about Arbor Villa
Park, the first steppingstone to her historic role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized how much playing in that park meant to me and how
safe I felt,'' said Levering, 60, who grew up across from the park,
bounded by 66th Terrace, Main Street and Edgevale Road. ``When I
think about schools having to have metal detectors today ... We
need to help neighborhoods get back to what is safe and wholesome
for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish every kid could grow up with a park like this,'' she
told friends and neighbors gathered for a reunion at Arbor Villa.
``Children need a place where they can play safe and learn life
skills, such as how to get along with people.''
</P>
<P>
   During the two-year term she began in January, Levering serves
as the top volunteer for the USTA, which has a $150 million annual
budget and a 121-member staff based in White Plains, N.Y. She has
been traveling throughout the world, meeting with tennis
professionals, heads of state, diplomats and celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 30 Levering will welcome visitors from around the globe
to the 1999 U.S. Open Tennis Tournament at Flushing Meadows in
Queens, N.Y. The USTA owns and operates the tournament, its major
source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Levering is warming up now for the Davis Cup quarterfinals, for
which the USTA will be host July 16-18 at the Longwood Cricket Club
in Chestnut Hill, Mass. The American and Australian teams will face
each other at the event, which celebrates the 100th anniversary of
the Davis Cup, launched at Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   Levering will be mistress of ceremonies for gala dinners in
Boston at the Harvard Club and at the John F. Kennedy Library.
</P>
<P>
   ``Longwood can accommodate 5,400 people,'' she said. ``Seats for
the three-day match were sold out in 81 minutes. We had 24,000
requests from people all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Solid, simple foundation
</P>
<P>
   Levering credits her family and a simple, solid neighborhood
lifestyle with shaping the skills she relies on now in her
demanding role.
</P>
<P>
   Appreciating what tennis has done for her, she initiated ``A
Plan for Growth'' while USTA first vice president two years ago.
The plan's purpose is to offer grants to foster the growth of
tennis programs in cities across the country. Levering inspired the
USTA to commit $32 million for the five-year project. The Tennis
Industry Association, representing hundreds of manufacturers,
kicked in $18 million, establishing a fund of $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual awards banquet, the Greater Kansas City Sports
Commission and Foundation recently recognized Levering for her
leadership and accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before the banquet, Levering, accompanied by her
husband, Gordon Levering, and her brother, Carl F. Ade Jr. of
Kansas City, arrived at Arbor Villa Park for a celebration in her
honor. Former neighbor Deb Shigouri prepared gallons of lemonade
and dozens of iced cookies. Children waited on the park's single
tennis court for Levering, while others played in the pool where
she had been a summer lifeguard. And former neighbors _ still
lifelong friends _ gathered around for a hug and a handshake. Many
remarked that the former Judy Ade was the same kind, warm
individual they had always known in spite of her celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when your mother would call, `Carlie Fred and Judy
Lou, come to dinner,' and our mother would whistle us home?'' asked
Joan Hovey Waller, a childhood neighbor who returned with her
sister, Ann Hovey, for a reunion with Levering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall always remember Judy as the friend I grew up with,''
Hovey said. ``We enjoyed many carefree days growing up around the
park, playing hide-and-seek, jacks, dolls and tennis. She had a
wonderful, thoughtful family who took me on many of their
outings.''
</P>
<P>
   Festivities got under way with city councilwoman Becky Nace
presenting Levering with a key to the city and a proclamation.
Vickie Shelton, athletic director for the Kansas City School
District, came with a box containing a big orange varsity ``S''
letter and the numbers, 56, indicating the year Levering graduated
from Southwest High School. Shelton had retrieved all the sports
memorabilia from Southwest after it closed a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sue Elias met Levering for the first time. Elias and her
family own the home where Levering lived from birth to adulthood
with her older brother and their parents, the late Carl and
Virginia Ade. After the program, Elias invited Levering for a
nostalgic visit to the blue-trimmed white stucco home at 6633
Edgevale Road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Carpenter lived next door; he was Jean Harlow's father,''
Levering recalled. ``Dr. Carpenter and my father both played tennis
and got us out on the court. Dr. Carpenter was a dentist and a very
nice man. I remember a beautiful portrait of his daughter hanging
in his home. He and his wife were divorced and she had taken their
daughter to Hollywood'' where she became a legendary movie star and
died young.
</P>
<P>
   Married a boy from home
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Southwest, the former Judy Ade went to
Northwestern University where she met her future husband. Gordon
Levering, now 61, had graduated from what's now Shawnee Mission
North High School. He and Judy both graduated from Northwestern in
the spring of 1960 and married in December, following her
presentation as a Belle of the American Royal in the BOTAR Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the Leverings settled in Lancaster, Pa., headquarters
for Armstrong World Industries, Gordon Levering's employer for 37
years until he retired in 1996 as president of Armstrong Canada.
During his career, the family moved 13 times, living for a while in
Montreal and in London. They now reside in Stowe, Vt. But Lancaster
was where they reared their three children and where Judy Levering
founded a tennis association to promote neighborhood tennis,
particularly for children who had no access to it. She has now
taken her Lancaster experience to a national level, hoping to make
tennis available on a community basis for anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe tennis teaches so many lessons,'' she said. ``It
starts with personal integrity, by simply calling a ball out or in.
If you gain the reputation of a cheater, it's hard to get rid of
it. You have to make decisions about where you are going to hit the
ball. If you win, you get the glory, but if you don't, you can't
blame anyone else. In tennis you are putting yourself on the line,
trying to do your best, but knowing you could be a loser.
</P>
<P>
   She's troubled by the trend of youth violence, by tragedies like
the one in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some kids are not learning how to deal with adversity,'' she
said. ``In tennis you can let out aggression in a healthy way.
You're not physically hurting anybody. When our schools are cutting
back on outside activities, we have to use our parks and public
facilities to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Levering said that when she was a teen-ager, a friend, (the
late) Bill Fuhri, entered her in a competition at the Plaza tennis
courts. The opponent she drew was Lucille Davidson, a renowned
athlete from Lee's Summit who excelled in tennis, golf and
basketball. Davidson's championships included the 1949 Women's
National Public Parks Singles and the 1951 Canadian National
Singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``She beat me handily,'' Levering said. ``I thought she was much
older but she could have been only in her 40s. Since then I've
played against some young girls, and I know they're thinking the
same thing about me.''

   Bigger than life. A complicated icon. He was an American voice
in America's century: bold, exuberant, blustery. He honed his craft
at The Kansas City Star. Then he went on to war, to Europe and to
become literature's self-made man. He was not always easy to take.
Forget perfection, he told a fellow writer. Characters are not
symbols. ``Keep them people, people, people.'' In other words, all
humans are flawed. And redeemable. Four decades after his death,
and near the turn of another century, Hemingway's simple code still
rings loud and true.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWODD, Calif. _ In the back office of a Hollywood studio,
Arlo Eisenberg, 25, with lamb-chop sideburns and fading black nail
polish, was staring at a three-inch-square video clip on a computer
monitor about in-line skating.
</P>
<P>
   ``MTV revolutionized television,'' he said, gesturing toward the
screen. ``But this will replace TV.''
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the plan of Eisenberg _ a program host _ his
colleagues and the management at the Digital Entertainment Network.
DEN's plan is to create Internet-only programming, low-budget,
niche shows aimed at specific audiences and released via streaming
video.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective audience includes gay teen-agers, fraternity
brothers, punk rockers and skateboarding 16-year-olds. Some Web
sites, including Showtime, are creating Internet-only shows on a
piecemeal basis, but DEN appears to be the most aggressive in
creating an entire portfolio of Web-based shows.
</P>
<P>
   The nine programs DEN is showing include ``Tales From the
Eastside,'' the story of gang members in Los Angeles that people in
the company refer to as `` `Beverly Hills 90210' in the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   It has 21 other shows under construction, including ``Redemption
High,'' which revolves around Christian teen-agers trying to hold
to their beliefs in the face of peer pressure and acne.
</P>
<P>
   DEN shows are shown in six-minute episodes displayed on a
three-inch-square box on computer monitors. Program schedules are
available at the DEN Web site (www.den.com).
</P>
<P>
   David Newman, president of DEN and former president of Walt
Disney Network Television and Touchstone Television, said his new
endeavor was truly a breed apart. In the background, a monitor
played ``Frat Ratz,'' DEN's fraternity house narrative; the pilot
involves a fraternity member getting an internship at a magazine
called Perfect 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our shows are not about the same old white faces in the same
old places,'' Newman said. ``We're about why people flow to the Net
_ narrowcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is the underlying concept at DEN; if it is possible to
create radio and magazine content on the Net that caters to every
audience under the sun _ what is called narrowcasting _ why not
television-like content, too? Why not create shows that appeal to
every demographic group, until each one has its own version of
``Party of Five''?
</P>
<P>
   The DEN office in Santa Monica, Calif., could be a niche show
itself, one about young adults pursuing idealism and stock options.
Teeming with people _ half 20-something programmers and half
20-something writers, producers and aspiring actors _ the office is
a mix of Silicon Valley and Silicone Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The fusion of those worlds has produced big dreams. The staff
members here talk of moving beyond information, entertainment or
``infotainment'' to a new place, a land some of them called
telefusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad coinage,'' acknowledged Adam Solomon, the head of
marketing at DEN, leaning back in a leather chair in a DEN
conference room and sweeping his hands through carefully unkempt
hair. ``But we are the essence of forward movement. This is a new
stage of entertainment relevant to whoever you are, wherever you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon appears to be a combination of high school guidance
counselor and Hollywood agent, underscoring a clear tension here
between the drives for creativity and cash. The parking lot may be
full of BMWs, but the staff insists it wants to create a better,
more diverse world.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the best symbol of that dichotomy is Eisenberg, a
professional in-line skater and host of the DEN program
``Aggronation,'' about sports like extreme skating. An evangelist
for the cause of in-line skating (he calls himself the Happy Black
Jesus of Rollerblading), Eisenberg helps design the e-commerce
aspect of the Aggronation site to sell T-shirts and in-line skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He totally embraces capitalism, but underneath is a social
conscience,'' Solomon said. ``It's totally trippy.''
</P>
<P>
   The marginal nature of DEN's intended audiences makes television
production a very expensive and risky proposition. Industry
analysts say Web speeds are still too slow to support video-heavy
programming.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research, said that
the small audience size wouldn't attract the advertising revenue
necessary to support the programming. But Hardie said DEN deserved
credit for trying. DEN officials said they hoped to have 1.5
million individual users a month by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to take a lot of arrows, like any pioneer,''
Hardie said. ``They're going to be faulted for creating stuff that
doesn't measure up to the richness of TV. But TV is 60 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   DEN has addressed its financial challenges in three ways: it has
deep pockets and low-budget programs, and it augments the
programming with interactive elements that ordinary television
cannot offer, like offering archived programs accessible at any
time and several shows in more than one language.
</P>
<P>
   The deep pockets belong to Marc Collins-Rector and Chad
Shackley, who co-founded DEN; they are also the co-founders of the
Concentric Network Corp., one of the earliest ISPs. Along with
other investors, they have poured at least $40 million into the
project, Solomon said. DEN's chief executive is Jim Ritts, a former
commissioner of the Ladies Professional Golf Association and a
former chief executive of the Channel One Network, an in-school
news service of which Newman was president.
</P>
<P>
   In all, DEN intends to show 30 pilots in the coming months, but
they will be done on the cheap. Each 6-minute video segment and its
accompanying 15 minutes of interactive content _ viewers can get
information by clicking on actors or backgrounds, for example _ has
a budget of $15,000. That means shooting on location rather than
building sets, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the production values are still fairly high. ``The
Royal Standard,'' for example, about a young man using high-tech
gadgets to ascend to the Arthurian throne, was directed by Randal
Kleiser, who directed the films ``Grease'' and ``Blue Lagoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of fusion, much of DEN's programming
follows the familiar patterns of the ABC ``After School Specials.''
The pilot of ``Tales From the Eastside,'' for instance, begins with
gang members trying to recruit a boy. ``Your barrio needs you,
Cholo,'' the lead gang member tells the boy in a bit of phoned-in
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   The story line of another show, ``Fear of a Punk Nation,'' has
rival punk bands joining forces to save a struggling nightclub. It
sounds like a plot line that received a D in Screenwriting 101, but
Newman said the emphasis should be on the demographics of the cast
and viewers, not the story line. ``Suddenly young punk rockers have
a show of their own,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   This new so-called telefusion has impressed at least one
observer, Darren Carl, who says he knows a thing or two about what
makes Hollywood run. Carl, who owns Darren's Detail, a traveling
car-detailing service that has operated on numerous Hollywood lots
in the past 15 years, has become a regular buffer of the expensive
cars of DEN's 20-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be huge,'' he said while polishing a white
Range Rover in the DEN lot. ``Most of Hollywood is trying to redo
`The Flintstones' or `The Mod Squad.' They don't have a connection.
But these guys have the lifeline of youth.''

MAPPING EVERY STRUCTURE IN AN ENORMOUS PARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By DEBRA NUSSBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ In the past, when staff members of the Fairmount
Park Historic Preservation Trust here wanted to find out about
maintenance needed on a historic building, they would consult paper
files in all sorts of offices, look at park maps that were 12 feet
by 5 feet and tap into ``Mike's Brain.''
</P>
<P>
   (That would be Mike DeSanto, who has been with Fairmount Park,
the city's park system, since 1981 and has decades of information
stored in his memory banks. He is now the facilities manager.)
</P>
<P>
   The park system has more than 400 buildings spread over 8,900
acres, encompassing one-tenth of the city's land. It was a
bureaucratic nightmare to get a handle on information that, when a
fire alarm went off at historic Mount Pleasant Mansion last March,
the fire department could not find the building. It has different
street addresses on utility company records and in park files.
</P>
<P>
   Fairmount Park was the site of the Centennial Exposition of
1876, and the park holds buildings from that fair and others,
including six National Historic Landmarks, along with everything
from Gothic chapels to snack shacks to Japanese gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is now mixing with history to address some of the
problems the park presents. Last year, staff members from Fairmount
Park Historic Preservation Trust, a nonprofit agency dedicated to
preservation and planning, began working with employees of the
Fairmount Park Commission, a governing body that oversees the park,
and the city, started creating a comprehensive inventory of
everything with a roof (or that should have a roof) in the park by
using Geographic Information System software made by ESRI
(www.esri.com), the Environmental Systems Research Institute, of
Redlands, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historic organizations are often timid about technology,''
said Barbara Silberman, director of the Preservation Alliance for
Greater Philadelphia's Heritage Investment Program, which provides
technical assistance to historic sites
(www.libertynet.org/historic). ``This is cutting-edge. It will be a
model for organizations nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The software can also help organizations find historical
connections among buildings, Ms. Silberman said. ``I would love to
have that kind of information,'' she said. ``How many places did
George Washington really sleep?''
</P>
<P>
   The software is used by 250,000 clients, who can call up maps
along with detailed pictures and information, said Paul Hartwell, a
marketing representative for ESRI in its Washington offices. Most
users, Hartwell said, are government agencies that use it to map
cities and towns for public works projects like repaving streets
and to aid in zoning and planning issues.
</P>
<P>
   The software has allowed the Fairmount Park trust to create ``an
intelligent map'' of the park, said Peter Godfrey Jr., a consultant
retained by the trust to help manage the Geographic Information
System project. So far, 371 buildings have been cataloged and 1,600
digital photographs of buildings have been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Haavik, who is the project coordinator on the trust's staff
and took the digital photographs, is affectionately called ``the
GIS geek.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 320 pieces of information can be stored for each
building, including details on construction materials, architecture
styles, uses of the property, any leases and whether the building
is the responsibility of the park or another organization.
</P>
<P>
   The software will also help give consistent names to each
building. For example, Mount Pleasant Mansion, which was completed
in 1765, is sometimes mistakenly called Arnold Mansion because it
was owned by Benedict Arnold ``for about 15 minutes,'' said Amy
Freitag, executive director of the Fairmount Park trust and
planning and development administrator with the park commission.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold bought it as a wedding present for his bride, Peggy
Shippen. He was convicted of treason before they could move into
the mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Some Philadelphians call it the Macpherson Mansion, named after
its original owner, a Scottish sea captain, John Macpherson.
</P>
<P>
   And the Case Building, now used for offices, is often called the
Golden Age Building, named after an organization that used to use
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Geographic Information System lists each building by its
proper name, and any other names associated with it are also noted.
</P>
<P>
   Since grant money is the name of the game in historic
preservation, the system is also expected to be helpful in tracking
down dates, architectural styles and other details that might be
required on grant applications.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the project will require Haavik, the
coordinator, to walk the park and inventory and photograph every
man-made item that is not a building. That would include poles,
fences, signs, furnishings, trash bins and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park is so large and so spread out, and the information is
in such different places,'' he said. ``This has all been quite
daunting at times.''

UNCLE TYLER HEMINGWAY: KC CONNECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City fascinated the young Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   But he may never have seen it if not for his uncle, Alfred Tyler
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   It was Uncle Tyler, as the younger Hemingway called him, who
knew Henry J. Haskell, editor of The Kansas City Star. Uncle Tyler
spoke to Haskell about a possible reporting job for his nephew,
who, after graduating from high school in Oak Park, Ill., was not
interested in college.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Tyler subsequently met Ernest at Kansas City's Union
Station in October 1917 and installed him in a room at his mid-town
Kansas City home.
</P>
<P>
   Every Hemingway biography mentions Uncle Tyler only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was Uncle Tyler in Kansas City _ according to Patrick
Hemingway, the author's second son _ who, to Ernest, represented
the most successful of the Hemingways.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the Hemingways of Oak Park were an admirable and
respected family: Ernest's father, Clarence, was a doctor and his
mother, Grace, a singer and music teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that Alfred Tyler Hemingway, Clarence's
brother, married well.
</P>
<P>
   He met Arabell White at Oberlin College in Ohio just before the
turn of the century. She was the daughter of John Barber White, one
of Kansas City's most prominent lumbermen.
</P>
<P>
   They married in Kansas City on April 8, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Tyler paid dues. After graduating from Oberlin in 1902 he
worked in Louisiana's timber fields. He later spent two years
managing a lumberyard in Alliance, Neb. By the time young Ernest
arrived in the autumn of 1917, Alfred Tyler was working in his
father-in-law's Kansas City offices and had just moved his wife and
two children into a new home at 3629 Warwick Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Tyler also was an early practitioner of success
publishing. In 1915 he wrote a book titled How to ``Make Good.''
The slim volume is full of advice to young professionals just
starting out in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   By 1922 Alfred Tyler was serving as secretary and general
manager of the Forest Lumber Co. If he was the ``successful''
Hemingway, he also looked the part. A 1922 photograph captures his
strong, handsome face and striking gray hair.
</P>
<P>
   He died that same year, of pneumonia, at age 44. He is buried in
Mount Washington Cemetery in Independence. Not long after, a
gymnasium bearing Alfred Tyler's name was built on what is today
the Wornall campus of the Pembroke Hill School.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother gave that to (the former Sunset Hill School for
girls) in memory of her first husband,'' said Jean Arabell Gordon
Dibble, a Kansas City granddaughter of Alfred Tyler. Today the
building, still bearing Alfred Tyler's name on its facade, houses a
theater and art gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Dibble's grandmother, meanwhile _ familiar to Ernest Hemingway
students as ``Aunt Arabell'' _ stood in no one's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916 President Woodrow Wilson appointed her to direct local
food conservation efforts. (``Aunt Arabel is doing lots of Food
conservation work and is quite high up in the Food ring,'' Ernest
wrote home on Nov. 19, 1917.) Arabell also was president of the
local consumers league in the early 1920s and helped establish pure
milk laws.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927 Arabell married Clarence Shepard, a Kansas City
architect who designed many homes in the Kansas City's Country Club
district, as well as the Alfred Tyler Hemingway gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   By 1928, when Ernest Hemingway was looking for a comfortable
place for his wife, Pauline, to deliver her first child (his
second), Kansas City and Aunt Arabell apparently proved a more
attractive option than Oak Park and his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she were alive today, she would be very relieved and proud
of Ernest's success,'' said Dibble of her grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in the face of her nephew's obvious success, Arabell
disapproved of some of the author's habits. Dibble can still recall
once seeing the author's face on the cover of Life magazine and
then asking her grandmother about Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother,'' Dibble said, ``said, `Yes, darling, Ernest
Hemingway is part of our family, but he drinks and swears and likes
women and has never gone to college.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, darling, Ernest Hemingway is part of our family, but he
drinks and swears and likes women and has never gone to college.''
</P>
<P>
   _Arabell Hemingway, Ernest's aunt, to her granddaughter, Jean
Dibble

   ``I keep going back to the stories. I can't resist them. Even
now after I don't know how many times over the years I've read them
and taught them. They still are great. They'll stand forever, I
think. Or a dozen at least will stand forever. And that's a dozen
more than anybody else's.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Although I never felt comfortable (in a readerly way) with
Hemingway's novels I did recognize flashing power and beauty in
much of the writing. In a way I think those strong, hard sentences
have stayed inside me as a writerly example to trim the sentence
down, though not to the irreducible minimum as Hemingway often
did.''

<P>
   ``As a black author, I don't trust Hemingway's observations on
race. Not at all. And I get a bit nervous when he thumps his chest
to show his masculinity. Having said all that, I must confess that
I appreciate his attempts, flawed as they may be, to deliver the
culture of men in literature _ specifically the culture of the
sportsman, and I'm sure I felt confident about publishing three
stories that explore the world of the Asian martial arts precisely
because Hemingway made it OK for a male writer to address, without
apology, those time-honored male activities that give men a ``rite
of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Charles Johnson
</P>
<P>
   Middle Passage, Dreamer
</P>
<P>
   ``In a book like For Whom the Bell Tolls, you get the American
who goes abroad and seems to understand everything a bit too
quickly. There is that kind of desire to be a part of that foreign
place. It's understandable that he wants to be a part of it,
whether it's Cuba or Spain. There is an assumption that he can
articulate that place that doesn't work for me.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Ondaatje
</P>
<P>
   The English Patient
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have found in reading and rereading his fiction and
nonfiction is a man deeply tied to the land. He was desperate to
find a sense of wildness, not only in the environment he chose to
inhabit but in himself. ... I also think his view of women and
gender is much more complicated than we are led to believe in the
popular culture.''

</P>
<P>
   ``The length of sentences, the sound of words, word choices,
it's all sound. It all happens in the mind's ear. And Hemingway was
a master controller of the mind's ear. He could make in the mind's
ear a kind of solemn incantation that had a moral valence to it. In
the way that Gregorian chant or chanted Tibetan mantras have their
sound, Hemingway has a kind of moral resonance.''

NOT A CYBER-MOGUL AT 25? YOU CAN DREAM

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   The Web site cascades onto your screen. The design is slick. The
content is impressive. The rhetoric is mesmerizing: ``You dream of
creating your own business. You're fascinated by the high-tech
industry, where fortunes are made and lost as businesses scramble
to keep up with the latest technological innovations.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a pitch for The Wall Street Journal Online, or Fast
Company or TheStreet.com, or electronic banking or corporate
E-commerce ``solutions'' for small businesses. It's the teaser for
a game: Start-Up, a simulation that lets armchair Web moguls play
the role of a young, high-tech entrepreneur en route to the IPO
sweepstakes. ``If you succeed in doing so,'' the pitch continues,
``you'll destroy your competition and become the virtual Bill Gates
of the 21st century!''
</P>
<P>
   Start-Up is millennial Monopoly, and its greedy, high-strung,
go-go thrills derive from a skillful combination of reality and
fantasy. The goal of the game is to build an empire with the next
hot gadget _ a plausible scenario in the world of Palm Pilots and
Startac phones. Your products just happened to be sleeker and
sexier than anything in today's market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the hypothetical game console comes with a
high-bandwidth modem and browser for downloading DVD games (think
of it as Dreamcast Plus). The digital set-top box is also a network
computer with online program recording, playback and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Further down the pike of feasibility, Start-Up's personal
digital assistant is a mobile phone that transmits data, video and
voice over the future high-bandwidth Internet 2. The operating
system (Start-OS) includes voice recognition software (the phone is
held facing you, rather than against your ear). You can manufacture
this device with a small display that holographically projects a
full-size virtual screen image, but for the average road warrior, a
backlit LCD will do.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've designed and manufactured your gizmo, you have to
figure out how to sell it. Here, the role-playing vaults completely
over the top. All of the charts, bar graphs and marketing readouts
would look fabulous in a corporate Powerpoint presentation. There
are axes and usage curves and stick figures arrayed in quadrants
(so it must be scientific), and it's all backed up with tables of
information about sales volume from real-world retail channels _
Comp USA, Wal-Mart, America Online. Consumer research! Revenue
growth! Percentages! In color!
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to dominate your market, you have to identify
potential partners. So it's imperative to keep abreast of the
latest headlines, which are downloaded onto your desktop
``Bomberg'' terminal. The Bomberg Newswire is displayed on a box
that is much sleeker and sexier than its real-world counterpart
(and, needless to say, the graphic design is better). But the
headlines are plausible:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fujitsu to Announce High-Speed Video Processor.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``China to Expand Free Trade Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``American Investors Flush With Funds: New York _ U.S. venture
capital investment last year surpassed any previous record, with
private companies receiving $24.4 billion. `The ever-increasing Dow
has left investors flush with funds _ there's no shortage of
capital out there for the entrepreneur with a good idea,' says Ian
Leming of investment house Goldsachs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. One can dream.
</P>
<P>
   And as long as you're dreaming, you might as well be plotting
world domination in a beautifully appointed office where you can
look up from the flat screen atop your beveled glass desk to gaze
out the window at skyscrapers _ the World Trade Center, from the
looks of it.
</P>
<P>
   The old Chanel commercial springs to mind: Share the Fantasy.
And that's appropriate, considering that the designers of Start-Up
are not scruffy, ill-groomed geeks in Silicon Valley; they're
French businessmen on permanent vacation from previous careers in
finance and management consulting.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Montecristo Multimedia, started with Virtual
Trading, a simulation of international capital markets designed for
a European Commission forum on the Euro. In short order,
Montecristo souped up the product, packaged it with an educational
guide to financial markets and sold it to universities and business
schools across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The game spawned a robust online tournament scene and a sequel:
Wall Street Trader '99, written in English and subsequently
translated and distributed throughout Western Europe. Aiming at
business schools, financial institutions and investment groups, the
little company struck deals with AOL Europe, Yahoo and (cough,
cough) Bloomberg. It set up a Web site affiliate program. It
started moving and grooving like the caffeine-chugging,
equity-building, high-tech poster child in Start-Up.
</P>
<P>
   The glass desks and flat screens have yet to arrive. ``We moved
last summer from a very old _ fourth floor without elevator _ small
flat to a bigger and more convenient location but we are still
miles away from the look of the interface,'' said Jean-Cristophe
Marquis, Montecristo's co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for our environment compared to Silicon Valley,'' said D.M.
Crimmins, Start-Up's chief scenarist, ``well, you know, this is
Paris, not San Jose. One-hundred-hour weeks? In Europe, that's
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the civilized Continental workweek, Montecristo
has a goal in common with countless companies in the faceless
industrial parks of Northern California and with the company in its
own game. ``In Start-Up,'' Marquis said, ``you win if you are the
market leader, which means that you have more than 50 percent of
market share. Theoretically, you can win without going public, but
I doubt that anyone would win the game without going public. Which
is our own philosophy in the real business as well.''
</P>
<P>
   So if one of the big French game publishers called up and said,
``Bonjour, we'd like to buy your company,'' that wouldn't be
acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said after a long pause, ``you haven't mentioned
the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Start-Up, published by Montecristo Multimedia; CD-ROM for
Windows 95 and 98. Demos are at www.montecristo-multi.com; the full
version, $49, goes on sale in October.  &QL;

   ``People have babies all the time. Everybody has babies. It's a
natural thing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Catherine Barkley to Frederic Henry in Ernest Hemingway's A
Farewell To Arms
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway faced two deadlines in June 1928.
</P>
<P>
   One involved his unborn child. Hemingway's second wife, Pauline,
was eight months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The other involved his current manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   As yet untitled, Hemingway had begun his story several months
before in Paris. In it, a laconic, almost numb World War I
ambulance driver is wounded. He begins an affair with a nurse in a
Milan hospital. Soon the nurse is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   By June Hemingway wasn't sure how the novel, already being
considered for serialization, would end.
</P>
<P>
   But both deadlines would be met _ not in Paris, or in Milan _
but in Kansas City in the summer of 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published in 1929, 70 years ago, under the title A
Farewell to Arms. The novel, perhaps Hemingway's most celebrated
and examined, achieves an emotional climax with the difficult labor
and the Caesarean delivery of the nurse Catherine Barkley's
stillborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Then Catherine dies.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence suggests that Hemingway assembled the book's opening
and middle passages from a smorgasboard of historical events and
personal experiences. But the arrival of the author's real-life
child, Patrick, apparently proved vivid to Hemingway, who weeks
later incorporated an anxious delivery room drama into his novel's
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, 1928, Patrick Hemingway was delivered by Caesarean
section at old Research Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Pauline had been in labor 18 hours. Her husband, who had missed
the birth of his first son in 1923 while on assignment for the
Toronto Star, may well have been riveted by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, if my mother hadn't undergone that business here in
Kansas City, my father wouldn't have written with as much detail
and insight as he did,'' Patrick Hemingway said during a recent
Kansas City visit.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Reynolds, Hemingway biographer, goes further.
</P>
<P>
   In Hemingway: The American Homecoming, the third volume in his
five-book series on the author, Reynolds maintains that two events
in 1928 prompted and ended A Farewell to Arms: an accident in Paris
in March, when a falling bathroom skylight left a deep cut in
Hemingway's forehead, and his son's Caesarean delivery that June.
</P>
<P>
   The falling skylight roused Hemingway out of a writing block. It
also, Reynolds said, seemed to spur him to confront the trauma he
experienced driving an American Red Cross ambulance during World
War I. Hemingway had been circling this material in his fiction and
journalism for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of his son, meanwhile, gave Hemingway a conclusion to
the book, as well as the verisimilitude the writer so prized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down below, under the light, the doctor was sewing up the
great long, forcep-spread, thick-edged, wound,'' Frederic Henry
narrates in Chapter 41 of the novel. `` ... I do not think I could
have watched them cut, but I watched the wound closed into a high
welted ridge with quick skillful-looking stitches like a cobbler's,
and was glad.''
</P>
<P>
   The detailed description of the procedure suggests that
Hemingway witnessed Patrick's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Through close analysis of the novel and other materials,
Reynolds also has concluded that before Hemingway arrived in Kansas
City, he had not decided on any particular ending for the novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hemingway tended to avoid planning ahead, saying that it would
ruin the story for him,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   The book originally might have ended with Henry's plunge into
the Tagliamento River in Italy, as he tried to escape troops
preparing to shoot him as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   But the nature of Patrick's arrival probably changed that,
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe,'' Reynolds said, ``that Pauline's operation
was what triggered the ending.''
</P>
<P>
   `All those things'
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingways arrived in Kansas City on June 14, 1928, because
they wanted to have the child here.
</P>
<P>
   The author's distractions were many. On June 15 he visited the
Republican National Convention, then under way at Kansas City's
convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   There were visits to Don Carlos Guffey, the Kansas City
obstetrician they chose to deliver the child. There were letters to
answer from Hemingway friends in Paris as well as Maxwell Perkins,
Hemingway's editor in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hemingway continued thinking and writing about northern
Italy during the autumn of 1917, keeping his focus on Frederic and
Catherine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I find incredible is all those things happening just when
he really whipped that book into shape,'' Patrick said. ``It just
shows you that when people are really good, they can concentrate
and get the work done no matter what the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   After Patrick's birth, the Hemingways stayed in Kansas City
until mother and son were strong enough to travel. They left for
her family's home in Piggott, Ark., on or around July 20.
</P>
<P>
   During the preceding 35 days, Hemingway wrote the bulk of the
novel's Book 3. That section details Frederic Henry's flight during
the Italian retreat following the late October, 1917 breakthrough
of Austrian and German troops at Caporetto, on the Isonzo River
northwest of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This narrative is often cited as the most compelling section
of the novel,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway awoke every morning to a warm and humid Kansas City.
Then he sat down and summoned forth a cool autumn rain in northern
Italy in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   He achieved this through research _ checking maps and war
histories _ and the distillation of personal experience. MORE

AN EARNEST YOUNG MAN IN HIS LETTERS TO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Drinks purchased to get a story are by order of the boss called
car fare.
</P>
<P>
   _Ernest Hemingway, 1918
</P>
<P>
   To examine the letters written by a teen-aged Ernest Hemingway
from Kansas City is to encounter pre-Jazz Age moxie committed to
paper.
</P>
<P>
   They are full of the breezy swagger that might be expected from
any man of the world. In this case, however, the man was 18 and the
drinks he described in a letter, dated March 14, 1918, were three
Coca-Colas and one lemon phosphate.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway wrote many letters home during his 61/2-month
apprenticeship in Kansas City in 1917 and 1918.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote them on Kansas City Star stationery, plain newsroom
copy paper or ``miscellaneous report'' forms from the Kansas City
Police Department, which was part of his beat.
</P>
<P>
   In his letters, Hemingway describes his Uncle Tyler and Aunt
Arabell, at whose home he stayed during his initial days in Kansas
City; his routine at The Star and the former morning Times, where
he reported to work Oct. 18, 1917; his training with the Missouri
National Guard; his infatuation with silent film star Mae Marsh;
and ultimately his pursuit of an assignment with an overseas
ambulance service.
</P>
<P>
   Just four of Hemingway's early letters from Kansas City appeared
in Ernest Hemingway: Selected Letters, which was edited by Carlos
Baker and published in 1981. A memorable one had the young
journalist explaining to his mother that his work schedule
prevented his going to church on Sunday mornings: ``Don't worry or
cry or fret about my not being a good Christian. I am just as much
as ever and pray every night and believe just as hard so cheer up.
Just because I'm a cheerful Christian ought not to bother you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other early Hemingway letters exist in library collections
around the country. Some letters on deposit at the John F. Kennedy
Library's Hemingway Collection in Boston include notes to his
parents about his grueling work life here, his occasional
``scoop,'' and his good behavior (``I haven't seen a girl in Kansas
City yet,'' he tells his mother, ``and that is a bad predicament
...'').
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his father, he talks about meeting Grover
Cleveland Alexander and the rest of the Chicago Cubs. He bought a
few players the Cokes and they bought him the phosphate, ``all of
which goes on the expense account.''
</P>
<P>
   What's often palpable in his letters is the nascent author's
unbridled energy.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true in the letters from Ernest to his older
sister Marcelline. Those excerpted below appeared for the first
time just this spring in a new edition of At the Hemingways, a
memoir originally published by Marcelline Hemingway Sanford in 1961
and recently reissued by the University of Idaho Press. (Proceeds
benefit the Ernest Hemingway Foundation in Oak Park, Ill., which is
preserving the writer's birthplace.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed most the obvious affection for his sister,'' said
John E. Sanford, a son of Marcelline who helped prepare the new
edition. ``There is also a protective quality that I found
endearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the excerpts of his letters to Marcelline presented
here (and used by permission of John Sanford) have been edited for
space, the idiosyncrasies of the young Hemingway's grammar and
spelling have been retained:
</P>
<P>
   - Oct. 26, 1917: ``And how is it at that most dear Oberlin huh?
I also am working hard. Yesterday morning I had six yarns in the
sheet and 1 on First Page. A veritable reporter the old Brute ...
All cops love me like a brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``(...) At St. Josephine I was and have chance to work on St.
Josephine Gazette. But the salary! Merci! Is is nought. A mere
pittance! Here I receive 60 of them per month. A princely
stipend.''
</P>
<P>
   - Jan. 31, 1918: ``Say kid this newspaper business is the life.
Since being here I have met and talked with Gen. Wood, Lord
Northcliffe, Jess Willard, V. Pres. Fairbanks, Capt. B. Baumber
British Army, Gen. Capper of Kas. and any amount of others. Tis the
life. Also I can distinguish chianti, catawba, malvasia, Dago Red,
claret and several others sans the use of the eyes. (...) I can
tell mayors to go to Hell and slap police commissioners on the
Back! Yeah tis indeed the existence.''
</P>
<P>
   - March 2, 1918: ``Anyway Kid that was no idle Jest about the
Great none other than that Mae Marsh, whom you and Sam glimpsed. If
she would ever become Mrs. HemOOOOOOO---y joy would reign supreme.
(...) Any way did I tell you that I was enlisted as an Ambulance
driver for the American Ambulance service in Italy? Yes it is an
fact. Mit me my love but say nought to the fambly. They might worry
and I probably wont be called for some time. Any way it is a big
relief to be enlisted in something. (...)''

HEMINGWAY HELPED DEFINE THE AMERICAN CENTURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was born on July 21, 1899, and died by his own hand on
another July day 62 years later. In the intervening years, his life
not only paralleled the rise of the ``American century,'' he helped
define it.
</P>
<P>
   He was an American abroad. He was all brawn and swagger. And in
one of the surest ways to extend one's life beyond its natural
boundaries he wrote it all down, and much of what he wrote down was
very good.
</P>
<P>
   This year marks the centennial of Ernest Hemingway's birth, and
unlike the 100th anniversary of, say, James Gould Cozzens or Robert
McAlmon, two of his contemporaries, the event is drawing
considerable attention.
</P>
<P>
   Literary scholars have sharpened their testimonials and
critiques, book publishers cranked up their presses, the marketing
folks have launched their Hemingway product lines _ Papa's got a
brand new sofa! _ and readers around the world are rediscovering
what it was that made him a giant of modern American literature.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest events of the Hemingway year is the
publication in July of one last book from his unfinished
manuscripts. True at First Light _ a ``fictional memoir'' it's
called _ is based on a Hemingway safari in Africa in 1953-54. The
book will be the fifth major Hemingway work published since the
writer's death in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway scholars and enthusiasts will gather for remaining
conferences and other events from Chicago to Bimini, from Petoskey,
Mich., to Piggott, Ark. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington
D.C. has installed a Hemingway exhibit with an accompanying
catalogue suitable for coffee tables.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, where Hemingway lived for more than 20 years, is luring
tourists and scholars with the Hemingway mystique and conferences
in June and October, and there are Hemingway tributes planned in
Japan, the Ukraine and elsewhere around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from True at First Light, other new books coming off the
press include the fifth and concluding volume of Michael Reynolds'
much-admired and long-in-the-making Hemingway biography.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of Hemingway's influence on the writers who followed
him is nearly indisputable: The way he used the American
vernacular, the language of real people, simple words. His
attention to scene-setting and close observation and just the right
detail. And how what he left out was just as important as what he
put in.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway has alternately engaged or given the willies to
generations of American school kids. Along with William Faulkner
and F. Scott Fitzgerald, he was part of a triumvirate whose writing
put American literature on the world map, or, at least, the
American literature of ``whiteness,'' as Toni Morrison put it in a
landmark essay.
</P>
<P>
   One contribution to Hemingway's longevity -- aside from the
larger-than-life mythology that he helped create for himself -- has
been the depth of character and insight that people continue to
find in his work, still four decades after his death.
</P>
<P>
   A recent milestone was the posthumous publication in the
mid-1980s of an unfinished novel, The Garden of Eden, which
directed readers to a new consideration of Hemingway's virile
stance.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's concern with ``gender confusion'' in a love triangle
helped launch an academic cottage industry. A new generation of
scholars, including feminists who had long dismissed Hemingway'
overt machismo, could now read his stories and novels in an
entirely new light. Toni Morrison even found evidence in the book
of a notable ``Africanist'' presence.
</P>
<P>
   For many readers that kind of unexpected depth always has been
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great hallmarks of Hemingway as a writer is his
wonderful duplicity,'' said Gerry Brenner, a professor of English
at the University of Montana and a Hemingway scholar for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories seem to be clear little pools of lexical lucidity.
But once you put your eye down on them, you see all kinds of depth
and refractions that raise all sorts of significant questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway, of course, has his detractors.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Annie Proulx, for one, while acknowledging ``the
power and beauty'' in Hemingway's writing, dismissed ``his hungry
need for constant praise and attention, his egoistic construction
of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Adventurous life
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Miller Hemingway was born in Oak Park, Ill., a Chicago
suburb, the son of a doctor and a singer. The family often summered
in the outdoors of northern Michigan, the setting of some of his
best-known short stories.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1917 he arrived in Kansas City, where an uncle
lived, and spent seven months as a cub reporter at The Kansas City
Star. He long acknowledged his debt to The Star's sheet of writing
guidelines (``Use short sentences,'' it began): ``Those were the
best rules I ever learned for the business of writing,'' he once
declared.
</P>
<P>
   He traveled incessantly and seemed to embrace one adventure
after another: ambulance driver in Italy and wounded ``war hero''
of World War I; European correspondent, covering the rise of
Mussolini in Italy and bullfighting in Pamplona; big-game hunter
and deep-sea angler; chronicler of Spain's civil war; resistance
fighter and journalist in World War II France. Above all,
celebrated writer.
</P>
<P>
   His work created a sensation from nearly the very beginning,
blazing a territory of modern sensibilities and racy realism. In
short stories and then in novels such as The Sun Also Rises (1926)
and A Farewell to Arms (1929), published when he was only 30, he
created works that were both highly popular and critically
acclaimed, a combination that remains all too rare in American
letters.
</P>
<P>
   As his literary stature grew _ even as some of his later work
fell flat _ so, too, did his fame as a carousing, adventuring,
much-married celebrity. And by the end of his life _ even after the
Nobel Prize in 1954 _ that presence often threatened to overshadow
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The didactic momentum of the biography,'' Joan Didion wrote in
The New Yorker last fall, ``was such that we sometimes forgot that
this was a writer who had in his time made the English language
new, changed the rhythms of the way both his own and the next few
generations would speak and write and think.''
</P>
<P>
   Didion is among those who are none too pleased with the way
Hemingway is returning to print this summer. Hemingway's son,
Patrick, edited his father's pages, trimming 200,000 words down to
100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In her early volley last November, Didion issued a sharp rebuke
to the Hemingway family:
</P>
<P>
   ``(E)ight hundred and fifty pages reduced by half by someone
other than their author can go nowhere the author intended them to
go, but they can provide the occasion for a chat-show hook, a faux
controversy over whether the part of the manuscript in which the
writer on safari takes a Wakamba bride does or does not reflect a
`real' event.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, suggest that any new Hemingway is quite welcome.
Hemingway's reputation is already made and secure. Publishing
unfinished manuscripts is not much different, the argument goes,
than exhibiting a painter's sketches.
</P>
<P>
   For many people there will continue to be two Hemingways, the
writing one and the hard-living celebrity. For Hemingway, of
course, those two lives were inseparable. His life and his
experience fed his art in a way that still remains remarkable, if
not, in Annie Proulx's estimation, somewhat pathological. ``I
suppose,'' Proulx noted, ``he might have had an atrophied
imagination, that he might have had to substitute the lived event
for the imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to see the conclusion that Hemingway may have
drawn at the very end, when he put the shotgun to his forehead.
July 2, 1961. Wracked by pain and depression and the effects of
shock treatment. All of that and something else: He was unable to
write any more. Perhaps Hemingway saw that as the greatest weight
of all.

BIOGRAPHY CYCLE: THE FIFTH VOLUME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN BURNES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hemingway: The Final Years, by Michael Reynolds (416 pages; W.W.
Norton &AMP; Co.; $30)
</P>
<P>
   That Ernest Hemingway could be exasperating has been
established.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, that's not the entire agenda of Michael Reynolds, the
Hemingway scholar who now has completed his cycle of Hemingway
biographies with Hemingway: The Final Years.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth and final volume of the series Reynolds began
back in 1986 with the appearance of The Young Hemingway. Through
these books Reynolds has established himself a scholar who, while
possessing a vast store of sympathy for the Hemingway the artist,
has never hesitated to identify troglodyte conduct when he
encounters it.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, there's plenty to describe in the period of Hemingway's
life this last volume spans, from 1940 through to his 1961 suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's public disregard, for example, of his fourth wife
Mary Welsh when in the company of younger women such as Venetian
teen-ager Adriana Ivancich was embarrassing 50 years ago and hasn't
improved with time.
</P>
<P>
   He did his best to disparage James Jones, author of From Here to
Eternity. Jones' sin apparently was to be a young war veteran who
in 1951 published a celebrated war novel _ rather like the
once-young Hemingway had done in 1929 with A Farewell to Arms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hemingway's behavior improves when put in context. An
example is Hemingway's decision to lead an armed crew on his
private yacht during the early years of World War II, patrolling
for German submarines in Cuban waters.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds supplies such compelling evidence of German submarine
activity in the Gulf of Mexico that if Hemingway's apparent
adventurism seems amusing in 1999, Reynolds assures the reader it
had little comic value in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   These also were the years when Hemingway began to orchestrate
his own legacy, alternately fighting off and welcoming entreaties
by academics such as Charles Fenton of Yale and Princeton's Carlos
Baker, both of whom produced significant biographies of the writer.
These and others would pursue scholarship that would help establish
Hemingway criticism as the small industry it is today _ despite the
exaggerations and outright hooey Hemingway sometimes supplied them.
</P>
<P>
   But then Hemingway may have been beguiled by his own developing
cult of personality.
</P>
<P>
   Being Hemingway in the 1940s and 1950s meant wandering the globe
in well-publicized sojourns and safaris. Reynolds' book includes
seven maps, allowing the reader to follow the author's travels to
and from China, to northern Italy, to central Africa and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Such relentless living _ Theodore Roosevelt's strenuous life
updated and run amok _ arguably shortened Hemingway's life. While
touring Africa in January 1954, Hemingway and Welsh survived two
plane crashes in two days. Among the author's injuries after the
second crash was his fourth serious concussion in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hemingway stayed at the typewriter through everything.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds describes how, for all of Hemingway's achievements
through the 1920s and 1930s, the author's postwar period now ranks
as his most productive.
</P>
<P>
   Books produced then include Across the River and Into the Trees
in 1950, which was largely reviled, and The Old Man and the Sea in
1952, which represented to many a stirring comeback. Hemingway also
assembled several unfinished manuscripts that have been released in
the years since his death, beginning with A Moveable Feast in 1964
to True at First Light, which is coming out in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, Reynolds' story is one of profound sadness.
It concerns how the author kept writing while wrestling with the
deep depression that, as the years passed, seemed ever more capable
of swallowing him whole.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Hemingway's mood swings could be plotted,
Reynolds writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently when the curve moved upward, he was writing well,
followed by depression with a book's publication,'' Reynolds
writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always when a book was completed he was faced with the
immediately unanswerable question of what to write next. If the
last book was as good as he could create, how then could he now
create a better one? Each book used up experience he could not use
again, making the answer more difficult to know and longer to
find.''
</P>
<P>
   In April 1961 Hemingway wrote his editor expressing doubt that
he could complete his sketches of his young life in Paris _ the
work that would become A Moveable Feast. Despite the best efforts
of doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, Hemingway's depression
apparently was such that the author saw no way out.

<P>
   When he finally succeeded in shooting himself on July 2, 1961,
it was merely the last suicide attempt of several.

HANNEMAN'S HEMINGWAY JUST HAD TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long after Ernest Hemingway died in July 1961, Audre
Hanneman, a bookish young woman from Kansas City then living in New
York, sent a generous letter to his longtime publisher.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to give whoever needed them the extensive notes she
had compiled on Charles Scribner's Sons' most famous author.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, she supposed, Scribner had somebody documenting the
output of such a great American writer, and she'd been gathering
this material for six or seven years: notes about various editions
of books he published, details of where and when his magazine
articles or reviews of his work appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Her thick notebook would help someone create a much-needed
Hemingway bibliography. Because they amount to a catalog of all
that can be known about a subject, bibliographies are vital
research tools for students and scholars, staples on library
shelves and invaluable to rare-book dealers and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a Scribner editor told her, no such project was in
the works.
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman was astounded, if not a bit disappointed. Soon, though,
she convinced herself that she should be the one to do it. ``If no
one else is going to, I will try,'' she recalls thinking. ``I will
give it a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the work she had already put into it, this would be no
easy task for an amateur..MDNM/ She had no professorial mentor. She
had no cadre of graduate students doing the legwork. She hadn't
even been to college.
</P>
<P>
   What Hanneman had instead were a booklover's passion and a head
for the tiniest details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little amazed I did that much work,'' Hanneman says in
retrospect, sitting in the pleasant, art-filled living room of the
Brookside apartment she shares with her sister, Marjorie Hanneman.
``If you know ahead of time the enormous amount of work a thing is
going to take, you'd never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman, tall and slender, with white hair that flips in the
back, chuckles at the memory as her brown eyes light up behind her
glasses. Yes, she did do it.
</P>
<P>
   In the next 13 years, during a period when students and scholars
argued over Hemingway's place in the firmament of 20th-century
literature, Hanneman produced not one but two volumes of a
descriptive Hemingway bibliography, totaling close to 1,000 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The first book alone corralled 3,510 items in eight sections:
From Hemingway's earliest known articles for his high school
newspaper and his first limited-edition book, Three Stories &AMP; Ten
Poems, published in Paris in 1923, to articles about him, reviews
and academic essays published in late 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than a mere listing of publications: Hanneman
describes the physical makeup of each book by Hemingway _ ``the
title and author's name are enclosed in a ruled border with a thick
second rule at top'' _ and tracks variations between editions. She
summarizes or quotes many articles and reviews. Hemingway was a
prolific letter writer, and Hanneman guides the user to the library
collections across the nation where many of his letters exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monumental,'' one reviewer wrote after the first book appeared
in 1967. A model of bibliography, a German reviewer noted. Carlos
Baker, the great Princeton scholar and critic who soon would issue
his landmark biography of Hemingway, told Hanneman in a letter her
reward would be that henceforth her name would appear in any book
that dealt with Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   So far Baker's prediction has proved true. And more than 30
years later, Hemingway people _ the community of scholars,
students, enthusiasts and book collectors _ still rave about
``Hanneman,'' which is their shorthand for her two reference works:
Ernest Hemingway: A Comprehensive Bibliography and Supplement to
Ernest Hemingway: A Comprehensive Bibliography (1975), both
published by the Princeton University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as its status in the field of Hemingway studies is
concerned,'' says Stephen Plotkin, curator of the Hemingway
Collection at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, ``I would say
that `indispensable' about sums it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Beegel, editor of The Hemingway Review, an international
scholarly journal, calls Hanneman's bibliography ``thorough,
meticulous and foundational.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe,'' Beegel says, ``that Hemingway would never
have become so widely taught and written about in the academy if
Hanneman had not given scholars this remarkable tool for
manipulating vast quantities of printed material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine doing that in an era before online searches and
computer databases.''
</P>
<P>
   The few thousand dollars that Hanneman earned from the book
didn't come close to compensating her for the time, travel and
book-buying expenses she put into it. Without any sense of
boasting, Hanneman checks off the work that consumed her for so
long: ``I was my own researcher. I was my own corresponding
secretary. I was my own manuscript typist. I was my own indexer and
my own proofreader.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the current era of technological ease, no one has had
``the courage,'' Beegel says, to pick up where Hanneman left off a
quarter century ago. Some supplemental bibliographic efforts have
appeared, but without the scope and depth of Hanneman's.
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman long ago lost touch with the Hemingway community. But
they remember her.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Bruccoli, a prominent scholar at the University of South
Carolina, greeted the news that Hanneman was alive and well with
Hemingwayesque fondness: ``Tell her that Matt says she's a lazy
broad, and why didn't she ever do another supplement?''
</P>
<P>
   The irony brought a smile to Hanneman's face.
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't she stick with Hemingway? ``I have often said the
bibliography was a labor of love; the supplement was mostly just
labor,'' she says. ``I have never been sorry that Princeton
University Press did not request a third volume.'' MORE
</P>
<P>
   (volume.'')
</P>
<P>
   Still a record keeper
</P>
<P>
   Floral prints, family pictures, paintings by Marjorie cover the
walls of the Hannemans' apartment. On a bookshelf, among Hemingway
titles and art books and books about books, sit Audre's two-volume
bibliography. Inside one is a hand-written notation, dated Oct. 18,
1995: ``This supplement went out of print in 1989, with 2,392
copies sold; and the bibliography in 1995, with 5,399 copies
sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman has always been a record keeper, a list maker of one
kind or another. In the midst of a conversation about artists and
self-portraits, she lifts the corner of the blotter on her living
room desk and pulls a magazine clipping from her current ``file.''
</P>
<P>
   When she worked in the publishing industry in New York in the
1960s and '70s _ for much of the period when she was working on the
bibliographies, too _ it was in indexing. She was so good at what
she did that when she returned to Kansas City in 1981 she kept up a
free-lance relationship with her longtime employer, McGraw-Hill.
Her last project was editing a 200-page index for an organic
chemistry textbook a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she says, at age 72 and a cancer survivor, she finally has
retired and can devote the bulk of her time to her own projects,
which include a novel in the closet that she declines to speak
about and a biography of an artist. (Marjorie, too, is a writer,
working on poetry and a collection of short stories.)
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman is a native of Council Bluffs, Iowa. In an early show
of independent-mindedness she convinced a school registrar to drop
the ``Y'' from the end of her first name (originally Audrey), much
as a grandfather had dropped an `N' from the end of the family's
original, Germanic name.
</P>
<P>
   For a good part of her young adult life Hanneman stayed at home
with her invalid mother, while Marjorie worked as advertising
manager for two of Kansas City's best-known clothing stores. Their
father had died when Audre was 16.
</P>
<P>
   It was while reading her way through a list of great books that
Hanneman discovered Hemingway. She read his early novels, The Sun
Also Rises and A Farewell to Arms, and was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway gave her not only an outlet but also a personal
project that would keep her mind engaged. She spent many of her
spare hours in libraries and a used-magazine store, where she
picked up copies of Esquire and Collier's and Ken and other
periodicals that published Hemingway's articles and dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman loved Hemingway's writing. But there was more to it
than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a teacher,'' she says. ``He tells you how to fly fish,
about all the maneuvers of the matador or toreador. He had advice
about writing. That was very important: someone teaching me. That
was a big part of the attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   During her research she took special pleasure in excerpting
reviews of Hemingway's books. She leafs through the Supplement to
find a favorite passage, a review in the American Mercury of Green
Hills of Africa: ``Hemingway has never written better than this and
few men ever as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that wonderful?'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 Hanneman moved to New York City and thrilled to its
intellectual stimulations. ``From the time I was 13,'' Hanneman
says, ``books were the only thing I wanted to be involved with.''
And here she was in the book capital of the known universe. When
Marjorie joined her there a couple of years later, Audre never
missed an opportunity to point out the house where Edna St. Vincent
Millay once lived or other literary landmarks near their Greenwich
Village apartment.
</P>
<P>
   She also tried to make up for the college education she never
got. She went to lectures on literature at the New School for
Social Research and New York University, listening to the likes of
Bernard Malamud, Anthony Burgess and Caroline Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   She never met Hemingway, but she corresponded, at least briefly,
with two of his four wives. She had a memorable lunch with his
brother Leicester and visited several times with his widow, Mary,
who by then was living in a Madison Avenue penthouse. ``She had us
up for tea,'' Marjorie says of their first meeting, ``and we stayed
for cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   As her project got going seriously, Hanneman's biggest challenge
was to prove her credibility and get cooperation from the right
people _ important book dealers and collectors and university
librarians. But word got around, and certain people put pressure on
certain other people, because they realized that if Hanneman didn't
succeed, it could be years before anyone tried again to harness
Hemingway for a bibliography.
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman knocked on Scribner's door again when she finished a
draft of the bibliography in 1963. This time an editor was
impressed enough to refer her project to Carlos Baker, who referred
it to Princeton University Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't feel obliged to publish with them,'' Baker told her.
``Of course,'' Hanneman says, ``I was absolutely thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a couple more years of research trips and writing
before she finished a third draft _ 995 manuscript pages _ and a
couple more before the bibliography finally came off the press and
she had a joyous book-signing at a New York shop.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hanneman completed the second volume in 1974, she
had spent some 20 years working on Hemingway. Enough was enough.
She needed something new, and this time that would be something
old: A 17th-century Dutch painter named Adriaen Hanneman, no
relation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued by the idea of going from someone who was so
famous to someone who was so obscure,'' she says. ``Of course, he
wasn't as obscure as I first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again Hanneman found herself drawn into an obsession whose
only way out seemed to be working on a book. She has traveled to
art libraries around the country and taken research trips abroad.
She hopes to have her book about the painter finished by 2004, the
400th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Hanneman on Hanneman. That would be something.

   CALIFORNIA-SCHOOL-AID. Why are California's poor school children
getting hundreds of millions of dollars less in federal aid each
year? The main answer is an obscure amendment inserted by Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, into a 1997 spending bill, which penalizes states
like California that annually gain schoolchildren. The provision,
called ``hold-harmless,'' has prevailed partly because the state's
congressional delegation hasn't worked well together, partly
because of federal budgetary dynamics, and partly because big
states are outnumbered in the Senate. But all that may change this
fall, when Congress votes on its yearly education spending bill.

   GEORGIA-NORWOOD-HEALTH. As things heat up on Capitol Hill with
Democrats in both chambers pushing for a debate on health care
reform, Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood is making some advances

   - Hemingway was unimpressed by the young Bohemians who were
arriving in Paris not long after he did. He wrote this in 1922:
``The scum of Greenwich Village, New York, has been skimmed off and
deposited in large ladlesful on that section of Paris adjacent to
the Cafe Rotonde. ... It is a strange-acting and strange-looking
breed. ... They have all striven so hard for a careless
individuality of clothing that they have achieved a sort of
uniformity of eccentricity.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Sun Also Rises (1926) was Hemingway's first great success
despite it selling only 26,000 copies in its first year. When Life
magazine, on Sept. 8, 1952, published The Old Man and the Sea (a
week before the book came out), it sold more than 5 million copies
in two days.
</P>
<P>
   - Hemingway wrote 44 pages of alternate endings to A Farewell to
Arms.
</P>

HEMINGWAY MAKES A MISTAKE

 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the fiction writer's prerogative to change facts, but
somewhere in the Hemingway annals an apparent fact became etched in
stone and no one noticed it was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   In writing and recollections by him and others of his work at
The Kansas City Star in 1917-18, the stories always refer to Police
Station No. 4 on 15th Street as being part of Hemingway's beat. It
has always been identified that way in newspaper stories, books and
reference works. But Hemingway (and the others) were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came to the Union Station from the Fifteenth Street Police
Station across a long viaduct,'' Hemingway wrote in the previously
unpublished manuscript fragment that is the subject of the
accompanying story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I covered the short-stop run,'' Hemingway told a biographer,
Charles A. Fenton, in 1952, ``which included the 15th Street police
station, the Union Station and the General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ernest was on the paper here,'' staff member and
columnist Landon Laird told Fenton in the early '50s, ``he was
always bouncing up to the now departed No. 4 police station at 15th
and Walnut to ride squad cars with Officer Bauswell and others.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by October 1917, when Hemingway joined the
staff of the newspaper, the station had moved.
</P>
<P>
   According to city directories of the period and other documents,
the No. 4 station was located at 1430 Walnut, or the northwest
corner of 15th and Walnut, as late as 1915. But according to the
directory for the next year, 1916, Police Station No. 4 was located
at 115 W. 19th St. The building still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the correction to Monroe Dodd, assistant managing editor
for production and special projects and one of our resident
historians (he edited Kansas City: An American Story, which is
being published this summer by Kansas City Star Books). Dodd's
curiosity was piqued enough by the manuscript fragments that he did
something no one else apparently had ever done: He checked it, as
we say, finding the address discrepancy in the city directories.
</P>
<P>
   Further research led me to the historic inventory of the Kansas
City Landmarks Commission, which pointed back to a story in, of all
places, The Kansas City Star. The story was about how the Walnut
Street and Southwest Boulevard stations would consolidate into the
renovated two-story building at 19th and Baltimore: ``New Police
Station Opens Today,'' read the headline. The date: July 29, 1916.

HOME THEATER INFILTRATES HIGH-END AUDIO'S HALLOWED HALLS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Foul winds are blowing through the hallowed halls of high-end
audio. Some members of this closely knit fraternity are crawling
into bed with the mongrels _ abandoning their principles, in the
view of their colleagues, by succumbing to the temptations of the
home theater movement.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to buy a stereo system these days. Once you pass
the all-in-one starter-system stage, you can go to Radio Shack and
buy inexpensive stereo components. Or you can enter the world of
high-end, two-channel (two-speaker) audio, where most amplifiers
use vacuum tubes and a complete audio system is expected to include
not just a CD player but also a turntable for vinyl records _ and
cost $10,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   There's little between those extremes. Home theater systems,
based around multichannel amplifiers or receivers that are supposed
to be connected to six speakers and a television set, have captured
the mainstream market whole. (Of course, these systems will also
play stereo music.)
</P>
<P>
   High-end audio manufacturers sneer at home theater as a
perversion of what they see as their near-divine mission, the
no-compromise pursuit of the perfect reproduction of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very dedicated to two-channel,'' said Dennis Had,
president of Cary Audio Design, maker of a full line of
``monoblock'' amplifiers (you need a pair of them for stereo),
which have exposed tubes so the owner can admire the glow. In the
high-end audio press, this look is called sexy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some thought in our industry that you have to get into
home theater to survive, but I don't believe that at all,'' he
added, leaning against a hallway wall at Hi-Fi 99, a convention of
high-end audio and home-theater manufacturers in Chicago last
month. Behind him, explosions, hysterical screams and automatic
gunfire roared from the Marantz room, where a home-theater
demonstration was under way, prompting Had, visibly irritated, to
step quickly down the hall and ask someone to turn down the volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raised three kids without television,'' he said when he
returned. ``To me the whole thing is a brain retard.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some others in his industry, Had is part of the problem.
This year, Cary began selling a home-theater amplifier _ and a
solid-state unit at that. One of his distributors asked him to do
it, Had grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in trying to come to grips with home theater. Up
and down the halls of the Palmer House Hilton, where Hi-Fi 99 was
staged, manufacturers of expensive audio equipment faced up to a
disquieting reality. To draw a crowd at the show, they had to put
in a television set, preferably a large projector, and show an
action movie, using their expensive equipment to play the bangs,
booms and blasts on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   While home theater companies assert that the quality of their
products is now quite high, the audio companies, particularly
amplifier manufacturers, argue that home theater equipment just
doesn't sound as good as their own, sonically pure devices, most of
which use vacuum tubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic how bad the state of the art is,'' said Geoffrey
Poor, sales director for Balanced Audio Technology. The company's
best-known product is a monoblock tube amplifier with eight tubes
that produce 120 watts of power; a pair costs $9,900. Balanced
Audio Technology has 12 employees and sells 20 to 40 amplifiers a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, home theater is compelling,'' Poor conceded, but he added
that his audio equipment could give the listener a more stimulating
l experience. ``Sit in a room, turn the lights out and listen,'' he
advised. Then said: ``We're not ignoring an obvious reality. Let's
be frank. Our whole engineering effort in 1999 is dedicated to
designing a multichannel amp.'' In other words, a tool for home
theater.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the high-end manufacturers succumb, they insist that
their pure, two-channel systems sound far better _ better even than
the multichannel products now being marketed by their brethren. So
I decided to put this to a test by listening, side by side, to a
first-class two-channel product and to a high-end home theater
amplifier.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Vacuum Tube Logic. ``Pure Tube'' is the company's
slogan. Vacuum Tube Logic's amplifiers are perfect representatives
of the two-channel audio ideal. Stereophile magazine, the voice of
high-end audio, rates this company's MB-185 monoblock amplifier
among the best of its kind. A pair costs $5,500, the price point
where the worlds of high-end audio and home theater meet.
</P>
<P>
   These are tube amplifiers, of course. The tubes are visible,
though they are behind a cage. So in the lexicon of the high end,
these amps may not be fully sexy, but they do show a little leg.
(Compare that with the Nagra VPA's, $13,000 monoblock amplifiers. A
pair of large, plump tubes project from the top. You can look, but
don't touch. The tubes heat up to 535 degrees Fahrenheit.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the other side for this comparison is the Madrigal Corp.,
maker of high-end monoblock amplifiers that many in the industry
view as solid-state reference standards. (A pair weighs 435 pounds
and costs $35,000.) A newer arm of the company makes home-theater
equipment, including the Proceed Amp 5, a five-channel solid-state
device that is a mere 119 pounds and costs $5,000. It's intended
for both movies and music. Stereophile Guide to Home Theater rates
this one among the best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Manley, president of Vacuum Tube Logic, is one of the few
high-end manufacturers who have not succumbed to home theater. ``We
don't have a TV in our home,'' he said, but he added that he would
happy if his amplifiers were used in a home-theater system. ``We'll
make as many monoblocks as you need _ two, five, seven.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Glazier, president of Madrigal, said: ``I absolutely do not
agree with the notion that there is anything limiting about making
a multichannel amplifier, beyond the limits of the company
designing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies lent me samples for this sybaritic comparison of
the best of home theater versus the best of two-channel.
</P>
<P>
   I first listened to the two amplifiers in sequence, playing a
piece of music using the Vacuum Tube Logic monoblocks, then playing
it again using two of the five channels on the Proceed Amp 5.
Later, I used one channel from one amplifier to power the left
speaker and one channel from the other to power the right speaker.
Then I played a piece of music in mono, turning the balance control
quickly from left to right to compare the performance of the
different amplifiers on difficult passages.
</P>
<P>
   The first conclusion from all this was that both products were
magnificent performers _ far better sounding than the notably less
expensive amplifier I usually use. For anyone who thinks all
amplifiers sound the same, this proved to me that they don't. And
in fact, there were differences even between these two high-end
products.
</P>
<P>
   Music played through the Vacuum Tube Logic amplifiers sounded
softer, sweeter and generally warmer in tone. But music played
through the Proceed amp was sharper, more precise and detailed. And
in the end, which amplifier sounded best was a purely subjective
matter of taste.
</P>
<P>
   For most music, I preferred the Vacuum Tube Logic equipment,
which is intended primarily for music. But on other pieces, the
Proceed amplifier for home theater sounded better.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the differences were subtle at best, and they will
not be heard at all unless the amplifiers are used in a
sophisticated audio system. But it is subtle differences like these
that fuel passions and drive careers in the audio industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the economics of the industry _ and sometimes-hidden
appetites of its leaders _ insure that more high-end audio
companies will slide into the home theater market.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Huey of Monarchy Audio was showing the company's SE-100
Delux Mono-block amplifier at the show _ without the aid of a
television set. ``Personally I'm not into this home theater
thing,'' Huey said. ``Anything associated with television doesn't
interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he conceded, his company is about to make a
home-theater amplifier _ five monoblocks strapped together. ``The
owner of the company wanted to do it,'' Huey said. ``He said it
would be nice to have one at his home.''

SMALL TOWN NEAR NEW WORK WONDERS: IS THE FIRST LADY COMING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH SALEM, N.Y. _ As the rumors drift along tiny Main Street
here, like a fog that just won't lift, the citizens of this bucolic
town are gearing up for the onslaught of stone-faced Secret Service
personnel, paparazzi and television vans.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about Hillary Rodham Clinton's new house.
</P>
<P>
   And although the White House swears there is no new house _ at
least not yet _ Mrs. Clinton is widely believed to be interested in
Westchester County, and some residents here are convinced that
North Salem is just the place for the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone heard the wife of a caretaker talking in line in a
supermarket, maybe it was in Katonah, about how somebody working
for Hillary _ or having something to do with somebody who did _ was
coming to look at some property in town,'' Cipa Dichter, the
pianist, who lives in North Salem, said a bit breathlessly. ``We're
all so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a personal assistant to the first lady did come to
North Salem, to check out the contemporary stone lodge of David
Liederman, the David of David's Cookies and the owner of Chez Louis
restaurant in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a big fan of Hillary's,'' Liederman said, ``so I called up
and offered my house.'' (After all, he has a couple of others.)
Initially, he offered it just for a vacation in August. Before
long, it was being scrutinized for a yearlong rental, so Mrs.
Clinton could establish residency for her putative Senate run, and
get a feel for the neighborhood, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Mrs. Clinton came to videotape the house and its
insides, the restaurateur said. But just when the Liedermans were
getting ready to break the news to the children and call the
movers, the word came back: too rustic.
</P>
<P>
   Also, as Liederman tells it, the first lady might have thought
his 40 foot-long kitchen and adjacent dining/sitting room were
unsuitable for fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kitchen is huge and all open,'' said Ms. Dichter, who with
her husband, Misha, has been a guest in the house many times. ``I
don't even know where the living room is. You want to be able to
close off the kitchen and entertain in the living room.''
</P>
<P>
   The house is also ``pretty close to the road,'' explained Ms.
Dichter, a close friend. ``Maybe Hillary should have something back
from the road,'' she continued, ``maybe behind a gate. People think
maybe the security wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   In an informal poll of real estate brokers in northern
Westchester, security is listed as a major concern of the Clintons
_ or a probable major concern, since few admitted to having been
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that she and I have talked,'' began Rhett Mitchell, the
owner of Merritt Associates in Larchmont, N.Y., ``but with the
carpetbagger thing and all, I imagine she'd want to live within her
means and get something that isn't too flashy.'' Mitchell and other
brokers speculated that Mrs. Clinton might want to live in one of
the communities in Westchester with gates and guardhouses, places
like Premium Point in New Rochelle and Manursing Island in Rye.
</P>
<P>
   (On Wednesday, Mayor Timothy Idoni of New Rochelle _ a Democrat
_ said he had written the first lady a letter, extolling the
virtues of his city. ``We have a 185-man police force in 10 square
miles, and we're home to 20 ambassadors,'' he said. ``We'd be
honored to have her.'')
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton has to be careful, Liederman said: ``She can't
live in any community that excludes anybody or is too fancy.''
</P>
<P>
   One broker is known to have the inside track _ sort of: Jerome
Billingsley's brother was Bill Clinton's campaign manager when he
ran for president of the freshman class at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   But even Billingsley, who owns Frances Billingsley Real Estate
in Katonah, professed to be in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they're looking,'' he groused, ``but you have to go
through a chain of command. They've seen our ads and called our
office, but we haven't seen her. We send things, and we don't hear
back.''
</P>
<P>
   How about using his Friends of Bill connection?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never asked,'' he said. ``I just might, though. As soon
as we get off the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants the first lady to move to his or her
community. ``It's turned out to be a very controversial thing,''
Ms. Dichter said. ``People around here feel very strongly _ one way
or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings were also mixed when rumors hit New York City co-ops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, they don't have a stitch of furniture,'' said one
socialite, a Democrat. Not only that, but the Clintons ``really
don't have any money at all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it might be tough to pass a Park or Fifth Avenue co-op
board. In co-ops, even renters have to pass the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard she's had some problems in the city,'' said Mitchell,
the Larchmont agent.
</P>
<P>
   But Dolly Lenz, Sotheby International Realty's top-selling
broker, said she doubted that Mrs. Clinton had gotten anywhere near
a real estate broker, let alone a co-op board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty people told me she'd looked at an apartment at 30 E.
85th St, but I called the doorman, and it turns out she was just
visiting somebody,'' Ms. Lenz said.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed, nonetheless, that it might be tough for
president and Mrs. Clinton to pass muster with one of the city's
ultra-difficult boards _ or even those that aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe a town house,'' she said. ``They wouldn't have a chance
of getting into 99 percent of the co-ops. And they might even run
into a snag with a condo.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's a Secret Service nightmare,'' she said. ``It
really disrupts a place, and any sophisticated board would know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   How about North Salem, a 75-minute train ride on the Metro North
commuter line, a horsy town, with everything from hidden estates to
raised ranches with Rubbermaid mailboxes _ along with a sprinkling
of celebrities and a reputation for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I could see,'' Ms. Lenz said.

   Good news is: We'll still eat.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the far-fetched futuristic meal-replacement pill dreamed
up and anticipated by Hollywood will not be revolutionizing
culinaria.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news is: We'll eat a lot.
</P>
<P>
   The date won't be the only thing getting rounder as the zeroes
roll over on Jan. 1. According to David Pursglove, an industry
professional in Washington, D.C., who has accurately forecast food
fads since 1963 using a tried-and-true number-crunching system,
food shoppers and restaurant patrons also will be getting fatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will continue to care less and less about health and
nutrition, just wanting good taste,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at the Food Marketing Institute, the food industry's
trade association, are reporting the same trend in their research.
</P>
<P>
   So, what glories will we be gorging on?
</P>
<P>
   Blueberries, for one. Pursglove says they'll soon be replacing
the cranberry as the national favorite fruit flavor. According to
his forecast system, which predicted such crazes as wraps and
smoothies, they've been the No. 2 fruit for a while. They'll trump
cranberry when the public starts to be more aware of already
published medical research that shows blueberries act similarly to
red wine in reducing heart-attack risks. So look for
blueberry-sauced chicken and blueberry chutney, chutney being a
trend of the future itself.
</P>
<P>
   We've included recipes for these and other food fads so you can
get a hop on being hip.
</P>
<P>
   Pursglove's crystal ball also says that the sun-dried tomato
will fade in favor of the sun-dried banana, which will find its way
into mainstream dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare, expensive, and putatively healthy,'' says
Pursglove.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Zen in the kitchen. Restaurant menus will start
incorporating this to appease the growing American following of
this far-eastern philosophy, even though it may mean no more than
adding Zen to the name of a dressed-up tofu dish.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of soy, bean curd is growing through the roof. Thanks
to the recent announcement by the Food and Drug Administration that
listed soy's glories, it will find its way more and more into the
mainstream, and in very creative ways. Think chocolate soy
martinis, berry soy smoothies and soy-based hot fudge sauce.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, creativity itself will be an obvious trend, according
Art Siemering, who authors and distributes a forecast publication
called ``Trend/Wire'' that is read and regarded by such industry
leaders as Starbucks Coffee and Williams-Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get past Y2K, provided something terrible doesn't
happen, there is going to be a great feeling of confidence washing
over people,'' he says. ``We're going to make a great leap, there
will be a general sense of possibility, and this unleashes
creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffee industry is certainly feeling innovative. According
to Pursglove, toasted bran and chicory will replace the coffee bean
for the brew of choice. Actually, we've been drinking them for a
while in Postum and Luzianne Tea, we just didn't know it. Soon, we
will.
</P>
<P>
   The burrito fad will continue on its craze, but before it's
done, we'll see chocolate-strawberry burritos and, of course, bean
curd burritos. Two food fads will be combined in blueberry
burritos. (See recipe for blueberry wraps.)
</P>
<P>
   Wood-fired ovens will pop up in more places than pizza shops as
Americans get spoiled by the tempting taste they lend to food.
Polenta, for example, might get scooped up off the grill and taken
for a turn in these ovens. Polenta's hot now (trendsetter Monica
Lewinsky orders it all the time), but look for it to replace pasta
as the carbohydrate of choice. Why? It comes prepackaged in the
grocery store and it's really, really good.
</P>
<P>
   Also watch as Americans want to be where the wild things are.
Wild mushrooms will be even more popular; they're being advertised
in prime-time radio slots now. Wild game will also go mainstream,
and we're not talking duck. Think emu, ostrich and alligator.
Buffalo, even.
</P>
<P>
   Even normal things will start to get a bit weird. Creme brulee
will turn savory, filled with things like mussels. Baby greens will
be replaced by microgreens. Beef will be shunned in favor of
Argentinian beef, recently the subject of a ``Wall Street Journal''
weekend ode.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend is a big step towards the upscale, thanks to a
good economy. According to Siemering, there will be designer
everything, as in California Pizza Kitchen gourmet gone awry.
Enchiladas will contain filet mignon, there will be a fashionable
French fry, and Ralph Lauren may be set to launch a line of snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of snacks, here's where Siemering sees us getting
rounder. Hershey, that lovable maker of all things darkly
irresistible, is coming out with Hershey Bites, a foodstuff that
Siemering categorizes as a ``desk-drawer food.''
</P>
<P>
   They're easily hidden, he says, and consumed in small bites.
We're betting they're consumed in large, work-related
stress-induced quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're on sweets, we'll progress to the final course of
this discourse: dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Even here, bean's the thing. Wagashi, an artistic Japanese sweet
confection made mostly from bean paste, will become as popular as
its cultural counterpart, sushi. Wagashi will start to make a major
showing in Japanese restaurants by the end of the year. By 2000, it
will be in upscale grocery stores like Trader Joe's and, as a true
food fad of the future, available online: Wagashi.com, where you
can buy kits to make this sweet at home, is set to be launched
soon. &QL;

 &HT;    SISTER SEARCHES FOR BROTHER, REMINDS WORLD OF PRISONERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN-0624.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ They were just four scraggly thieves
hitchhiking on a wooded roadside, but they held clues in Albana
Koshi's desperate search.
</P>
<P>
   Through her car window, they told her they had been cutting
bread in the kitchen of a Serb jail, so they knew that 150 men from
Koshi's town had been there.
</P>
<P>
   Further, prison officials told them the men were headed north
out of Kosovo province to a city in Serbia. Finally, the thieves
said, they recognized Koshi's brother, Alban(CQ), among them.
</P>
<P>
   As the world now watches ethnic Albanian refugees return to a
NATO-controlled Kosovo, for Koshi and thousands of others from her
region the war is over but not resolved. Their relatives are
missing and, it appears, have been taken to Serbia before the Serbs
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   While many in this decimated region of southwestern Kosovo were
still sifting through the ruins of their burned homes, Koshi
started a list of 300 missing men and began searching for clues.
</P>
<P>
   The trail of the missing men leads past the sad streets of
Djakovica, to execution sites and a building filled with women and
children used as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The search has taken Koshi, a 25-year-old architecture student,
to abandoned factories, the offices of NATO commanders and an
apprehensively accepted volunteer post with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she began leading her community in protests to draw
attention to what may become a major lingering issue as the haze of
destruction clears in war-shattered Kosovo, the southern province
of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Some estimate more than
1,000 men may be still held by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Daloni Carlisle of the International Committee of the Red Cross
said her group is now negotiating in the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade with the Serb government. It seeks a list of prisoners
that it can make public.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carlisle notes that mothers still sit outside the Red
Cross office in Bosnia, awaiting word on sons taken in the conflict
that ended there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Time is the enemy of the missing men from Kosovo. Prisoners
released during the NATO bombing report being tortured and starved.
As Shkendije(CQ) Hoda, KLA deputy commander for information in
Djakovica says, ``I hope they won't change from prisons to death
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica was an area of heavy fighting between the KLA and the
Serbs. The civilians paid the price of Serb revenge. Most of the
town is burned out and looted. More than 100 mass graves have been
found in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO troops entered on June 12 the destruction ended. But,
dreams of family reunions are fading away and the rumors run with
false leads about missing men.
</P>
<P>
   The petit and somber Koshi is a leader in the effort to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   She has set up shop in the KLA office now. There, encouraged by
radio requests, dozens of people come daily with information about
mass graves and missing people.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is the best resource for information. But, Koshi is not
the military type. While others around her have camouflage and
Soviet-made Kalishnikovs, she wears jeans and resists pressure to
wear a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this,'' she says in a whisper, ``I am doing just for my
brother. I have told them that.''
</P>
<P>
   Albana Koshi was two years old when Alban was born and she has
always called him ``Locka,'' (pronounced ``LOACH-ka''). It means
``sweetheart.'' He is the only boy between two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   In a picture she carries, she is pulling his long hair back into
a ponytail to prepare for high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Serious like his sister, Alban studied economics and wants to go
into business. He stays away from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother is a teacher and their father worked in a travel
agency until he lost his job five years go. They lived in a tall
stone house in the old Ottoman bazaar area of town. Koshi's
great-grandfather was born in the house more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar was meticulously destroyed by several nights of Serb
arson after NATO began the bombing campaign. The Koshi house stands
gutted.
</P>
<P>
   The Koshis moved in with three other newly-homeless families
and, like the rest of Djakovica, stayed inside for weeks eating
bread and cheese, watching television report the bombing and hiding
from Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce battle between the Serbs and KLA separatist
guerillas on a hill near town, the Serbs told ethnic Albanians to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Koshis left May 10, walking to the bus station for a ride to
southern Kosovo and, possibly, Albania. But, after a few blocks,
Serb police stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   They said they just wanted to take Alban briefly and then drop
him off at the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of the war, this was what he was afraid
of,'' Albana recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As she talks, she is preparing for her fourth meeting with
Italian NATO troops. Normally stoic, she cries when asked Alban's
parting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'You may go. I will be back soon. Don't be afraid,'''
she says in her strained English. ``He said, 'It's OK. Don't
worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Alban never showed up at the bus. He was gathered with
hundreds of other young men near a park in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the trail gets murky. Many were taken to a small
metal shop on the edge of town, which Albana has searched
unsuccessfully for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the prisoners' wives and children were taken nearby
and held in an appliance factory. The Serb police had been using
the factory but now they stayed out, guarding the doors with guns
from far away.
</P>
<P>
   Most suspect the Serbs hoped NATO would think the factory was
still used by the police and bomb the human shields. But, three
days later they released the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the account of the four thieves, Koshi believes many of
the men were taken to Pec, a city in western Kosovo. From there,
some were trucked to Serbia and others sent to another Kosovo city
where some were executed.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor turned up back in Djakovica and looked at a
photograph of Alban.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he saw him in the group headed for execution. But
Koshi says Alban looks much like a cousin who is also missing.
Either one, then, may have been executed. The other would be in the
Serb prison.
</P>
<P>
   She has not told her parents about the inconclusive photo
identification.
</P>
<P>
   As she searches, life slowly returns to Djakovica, an mostly
agrarian town of about 70,000. The first few stores have reopened
and bicyclists line the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But, on any corner you can find people missing relatives and
tears come quickly when they tell their stories. Koshi looks down
the main street and knows life is not normal for the people of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all with broken hearts,'' she says.

<P>
   The war in Kosovo has reinforced the Balkans' image as a
cauldron of ethnic hatred. And yet we still need help understanding
the extent of the violence and cruelty involved in ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Although journalists such as Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote
``Balkan Ghosts,'' tend to regard Balkan violence as inherent in
Balkan cultures, it is postmodern orthodoxy in the academy to
insist that it is ``socially constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither perspective is very enlightening. State-imposed violence
is quite different from the violent actions of individuals, whether
acting on state orders or on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ottoman Empire, kinship-based blood feuds of the type
common to medieval western Europe survived well into the 20th
century. They did so because the Turks did not efficiently provide
security and justice to their subjects after the 16th-century
Ottoman golden age, while the authorities they sanctioned among the
non-Muslims usually lacked the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Largely though not entirely suppressed after 1918, the ethic of
blood revenge, binding individual members of extended families,
sprang back to life when states disintegrated and civil wars
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this ethic has been successfully grafted onto
ethnic nationalism. The individual murders customary to blood feuds
are committed against the anonymous national enemy. This helps us
understand how such people as Slobodan Milosevic's security police
in Kosovo can murder and deport civilians of all ages. It also
helps explain violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the postcommunist Yugoslavian civil wars, rape's age-old
dishonoring effects have been heightened by perpetrators bent on
implanting their own ethnic offspring in the wombs of the national
enemy's women _ an ``essentialization'' of national identity if
there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances of civil war and ethnic cleansing, the
most ruthless rise to the fore. Some of the less ruthless manage to
escape the situation by, for example, emigrating to the U.S.
eastern seaboard, where hundreds of thousands of Serb and other
Balkan refugees unwilling to participate in the slaughter have
congregated. Those who cannot escape are forced to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurs in U.S. prisons, organized as they
usually are along ethnic lines that pit gangs of black, Latino, and
white racists against one another, leaving little or no room for
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of state-imposed violence, attacks upon the enemy's
human numbers _ such as the expulsion of the Kosovo Albanians and
the murder of many Kosovar Albanian men capable of bearing arms _
have a long history in the Balkans, stretching all the way back to
Thucydides' Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evident here is the military and technological weakness of the
Balkan state, which, in Machiavellian manner, counsels destroying
the enemy's manpower in lieu of his industries or arms as the best
way of crippling his capacity to fight back. This can be grimly
effective. At the same time, ethnic cleansing may succeed, as
Milosevic seemed to hope, in establishing an irreversible fait
accompli in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in both the 1992-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia and the 1999 war in Kosovo expresses not unmediated ancient
hatreds, but the insecurities accompanying the breakup of the
multinational communist confederation of Yugoslavia and the
unresolved conflicts over the establishment of new political
boundaries. In short, civil war sparked by conflicts over the
frontiers of the successor states has triggered the violence and
inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Had those wars been fought more impersonally, in the high-tech
American way, the U.S. reaction to all the carnage would perhaps be
less horrified. The United States' fearsome bombing of German and
Japanese cities in World War II was far more destructive of
civilian life than anything that has occurred in postcommunist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies are frequently drawn between Serbian ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo and the Nazi genocide against the Jews. In some
particulars _ such as the victims' brutal uprooting from their
homes at gunpoint and their inhuman transportation by railroad _
the analogy, though inexact, is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it is misleading. The Holocaust was a program
of biological extermination based on racist eugenic theories.
Balkan ethnic cleansing does not require mass extermination but
rather mass removal, which can be hastened along by displays of
murderous violence drawn from the repertory of revenge killings and
blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   This has, unfortunately, frequently occurred in the last century
_ for example, the destruction and expulsion of the Greeks by the
Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything
less fails to justify the West's resort to arms.

<P>
   The war in Kosovo has reinforced the Balkans' image as a
cauldron of ethnic hatred. And yet we still need help understanding
the extent of the violence and cruelty involved in ethnic
cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Although journalists such as Robert D. Kaplan, who wrote
``Balkan Ghosts,'' tend to regard Balkan violence as inherent in
Balkan cultures, it is postmodern orthodoxy in the academy to
insist that it is ``socially constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither perspective is very enlightening. State-imposed violence
is quite different from the violent actions of individuals, whether
acting on state orders or on their own initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Ottoman Empire, kinship-based blood feuds of the type
common to medieval western Europe survived well into the 20th
century. They did so because the Turks did not efficiently provide
security and justice to their subjects after the 16th-century
Ottoman golden age, while the authorities they sanctioned among the
non-Muslims usually lacked the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Largely though not entirely suppressed after 1918, the ethic of
blood revenge, binding individual members of extended families,
sprang back to life when states disintegrated and civil wars
erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, this ethic has been successfully grafted onto
ethnic nationalism. The individual murders customary to blood feuds
are committed against the anonymous national enemy. This helps us
understand how such people as Slobodan Milosevic's security police
in Kosovo can murder and deport civilians of all ages. It also
helps explain violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   In the postcommunist Yugoslavian civil wars, rape's age-old
dishonoring effects have been heightened by perpetrators bent on
implanting their own ethnic offspring in the wombs of the national
enemy's women _ an ``essentialization'' of national identity if
there ever was one.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances of civil war and ethnic cleansing, the
most ruthless rise to the fore. Some of the less ruthless manage to
escape the situation by, for example, emigrating to the U.S.
eastern seaboard, where hundreds of thousands of Serb and other
Balkan refugees unwilling to participate in the slaughter have
congregated. Those who cannot escape are forced to toe the line.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurs in U.S. prisons, organized as they
usually are along ethnic lines that pit gangs of black, Latino, and
white racists against one another, leaving little or no room for
dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   At the level of state-imposed violence, attacks upon the enemy's
human numbers _ such as the expulsion of the Kosovo Albanians and
the murder of many Kosovar Albanian men capable of bearing arms _
have a long history in the Balkans, stretching all the way back to
Thucydides' Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Evident here is the military and technological weakness of the
Balkan state, which, in Machiavellian manner, counsels destroying
the enemy's manpower in lieu of his industries or arms as the best
way of crippling his capacity to fight back. This can be grimly
effective. At the same time, ethnic cleansing may succeed, as
Milosevic seemed to hope, in establishing an irreversible fait
accompli in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence in both the 1992-95 wars in Croatia and
Bosnia and the 1999 war in Kosovo expresses not unmediated ancient
hatreds, but the insecurities accompanying the breakup of the
multinational communist confederation of Yugoslavia and the
unresolved conflicts over the establishment of new political
boundaries. In short, civil war sparked by conflicts over the
frontiers of the successor states has triggered the violence and
inhumanity.
</P>
<P>
   Had those wars been fought more impersonally, in the high-tech
American way, the U.S. reaction to all the carnage would perhaps be
less horrified. The United States' fearsome bombing of German and
Japanese cities in World War II was far more destructive of
civilian life than anything that has occurred in postcommunist
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Analogies are frequently drawn between Serbian ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo and the Nazi genocide against the Jews. In some
particulars _ such as the victims' brutal uprooting from their
homes at gunpoint and their inhuman transportation by railroad _
the analogy, though inexact, is enlightening.
</P>
<P>
   But fundamentally, it is misleading. The Holocaust was a program
of biological extermination based on racist eugenic theories.
Balkan ethnic cleansing does not require mass extermination but
rather mass removal, which can be hastened along by displays of
murderous violence drawn from the repertory of revenge killings and
blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   This has, unfortunately, frequently occurred in the last century
_ for example, the destruction and expulsion of the Greeks by the
Turks in Asia Minor following the ill-fated Greek invasion of
Turkey in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Even the lamentable Armenian genocide of 1915 was an extreme
form of ethnic cleansing, not an attempt to rid the earth of every
last Armenian. In 1914-15 czarist Russia forced the mass exodus of
its German-speaking subjects who lived along its borders with
Austria-Hungary. The largest such expulsion was that of the Germans
from eastern and Balkan Europe following the Nazi defeat of May
1945. Here some 12 million to 15 million people were uprooted and
driven from their homes amid rape and murder.
</P>
<P>
   These points suggest that Milosevic falls short of Hitler.
Although his and his allies' complicity in war crimes justifies
their moral and legal condemnation, demonizing them serves no good
strategic purpose. The West is dealing with ruthless nationalists
who seek secure and (to them) honorable borders _ a goal understood
and shared by all Balkan peoples.
</P>
<P>
   A defeated Serbia seething with nationalist extremism would cast
shadows on neighboring states struggling toward democracy. The only
way to remove Milosevic from power is to achieve a peace within
which liberal, democratic civil-society movements can sink deeper
roots than they now have.
</P>
<P>
   It may take a long time for such an opposition to become a
majority in Serbia, as it will in Croatia and other postcommunist
Balkan regimes. But it is vital to the region that they do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Washington should take every care neither to impose
the peace of the graveyard on Serbia nor to turn its back on a
million or two Albanian Kosovar deportees. NATO _ which does not
mean the United States alone _ has now intervened deeply enough to
commit itself for the long term to peace in the Balkans. Anything

 &HT;    DATA ON CHEMICAL DANGERS POSES A DISCLOSURE DILEMMA
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is racing to solve a digital-age quandary:
how to inform citizens about potential chemical disasters in their
communities without giving terrorists a blueprint of ways to
exploit these industrial dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the 1990 Clean Air Act, companies that make or store
hazardous chemicals have informed the federal government about
potential disasters at more than 60,000 industrial sites across
America.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires that this information be made public.
However, heeding advice from the FBI and other security agencies,
the Environmental Protection Agency has abandoned plans to post
these ``worst-case scenarios'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using the Internet, a terrorist, criminal or disgruntled
employee could identify the scenarios and fine-tune an attack'' to
achieve maximum death and destruction, Robert Blitzer, a private
security analyst and former FBI counterterrorism section chief,
told a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to approve this week an amendment by Sen.
James Inhofe, R-Okla., that would suspend dissemination of the
``worst-case scenarios'' for one year except to local and state
government emergency response units.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment would also require the administration to come up
with plan for making the information available to the public but
not to terrorists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can use the information to target potential bombing
sites,'' said Inhofe. ``You can already find information on the
Internet on how to make a bomb. The last thing we need is
information collected by the EPA being used to select targets in
communities around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1990 law, the companies were required to give the EPA
a detailed report on their five-year history of accidental
releases, emergency response plans, proximity to schools and
hospitals and the worst accidents that could happen at the
facility. Monday was the deadline for companies to submit the data.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone asks for the data, the agency has 30 days to respond,
said Kim Rubey, an EPA spokeswoman. During this period, the agency
will be working with Congress to reach a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is committed to both public disclosure and national
security, she said. However, she noted that some companies may have
already voluntarily put the information out on their own Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The complex issue illustrates how the Internet, which allows
instant global distribution of information, has created conflicts
between national security and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is going to come up again,'' said Ari Schwartz, an
analyst for the Center for Democracy and Technology. ``This is just
the first case.''
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, he said, it makes more sense to have the EPA
post reliable data on the Internet rather than restrict its
distribution to paper reports, which will doubtless be posted on
private Web sites anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the best way to stop a terrorist threat _ not tell
people about the dangers, or build stronger protections'' such as
buffer zones at the dangerous sites, he asked. ``Probably the
latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, said the Supreme Court has already ruled that the
Internet is entitled to the highest protection of free speech. He
said banning online distribution of the public EPA documents
violates the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The effort is ``futile'' anyway, he said. ``The EPA may not put
it on the Internet, but others will.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, environmental activists have said that the Internet is
the best way to get the information to the most people who live
near the chemical facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Senate staffers said Wednesday that Congress is trying to find a
compromise acceptable to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   At a Senate hearing on the issue in March, even witnesses
raising the security concerns acknowledged the conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the competing interests at stake here, between
providing the necessary information to the community, which allows
them to make informed decisions on local planning and preparedness
issues, and limiting the risk associated with the distribution of
information that can be used against those same communities in a
criminal manner,'' said Robert Burnham, chief of the FBI Domestic
Terrorism Section.

   &UR; MYSTERIES &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG BAD CITY. By Ed McBain. (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25.) The man
with the golden ear for urban street voices delivers another
pitch-perfect 87th Precinct police procedural, in which a nun, a
psycho and a burglar who bakes cookies for his victims figure in a
story about life in a city where ``things were happening all the
time, all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   EASY MONEY. By Jenny Siler. (John Macrae/Holt, $24.) The offbeat
but articulate heroine of this lethal debut thriller is a young
drug courier, schooled in the trade by her dope-running father in
Key West, who is chased clear across the country by sinister agents
intent on retrieving a computer disk with secret evidence of an
ugly Vietnam War conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   FLAT LAKE IN WINTER. By Joseph T. Klempner. (Thomas Dunne/St.
Martin's, $24.95.) This grave and thoughtful legal thriller, set in
a cold, remote corner of the Adirondacks, challenges a New York
criminal lawyer to come up with a defense that will hold off an
almost certain death conviction for a young man accused of
murdering his grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   IN A DRY SEASON. By Peter Robinson. (Twilight/Avon, $24.) In a
mystery with melancholy echoes from the past, Inspector Alan Banks
sets out to identify a human skeleton unearthed when a flooded
village emerges from the mud of a dried-up reservoir in the
Yorkshire dales, only to discover some deeper secrets buried in the
rural countryside during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   MARY, MARY. By Julie Parsons. (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23.) A
middle-aged widow who returns to her native Ireland to care for her
dying mother takes vengeance on the sadistic killer who raped and
murdered her daughter, in a dark, psychologically dense first novel
that takes the suspense thriller into emotional territory where it
rarely dares to go.
</P>
<P>
   A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES. By Ruth Rendell. (Crown, $24.) The
worship of beauty leads to murder and madness, as this English
mistress of suspense charts a collision course for two
preternaturally beautiful teen-agers: an unloved boy who grew up to
be a sociopath and the overprotected girl who grew up to be his
perfect victim. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE FICTION &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BLACK LIGHT. By Elizabeth Hand. (Harper Prism, $25.) As she did
in ``Waking the Moon,'' Hand brings ancient mythology to terrifying
life. Once again, innocents are at risk when heedless gods resume
the age-old struggle between the forces of reason and passion.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXTREMES. By Christopher Priest. (St. Martin's, $24.95.)
This serious novel about violence in our time subjects its heroine
_ and the reader _ to a series of harrowing scenarios before
achieving a surprising yet (on its own terms) believable happy
ending. A remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   PARABLE OF THE TALENTS. By Octavia E. Butler. (Seven Stories,
$24.95.) Continuing the story she began in ``Parable of the
Sower,'' Butler finds pathos and hope in the life of a 21st-century
prophet who, at great personal cost, preaches that the true test of
a religion is whether the solace it offers conforms with the nature
of the universe we live in.
</P>
<P>
   VIGILANT. By James Alan Gardner. (Eos/Avon, paper, $5.99.) The
adolescent heroine of this breathless romp overcomes feelings of
personal inadequacy to save her world. Despite the trappings of
science fiction, this is wish-fulfillment fantasy of a high order. &QL;

   COKE-MAIN _ BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The Belgian government today
said it will lift its partial ban on Coca-Cola products once the
company has met certain conditions, including enhancing safety
measures at bottling plants. Coca-Cola Co. has accepted the
conditions, which also include a thorough cleaning of the plants
and better monitoring. Company spokesman Paul Pendergrass said the
company may be able to have its products on store shelves within a
few days. The government, however, said vending machines carrying
Coke products will still be off-limits to consumers until it is
more satisfied with their safety. Belgian Health Minister Luc Van
den Bossche said there is still a foul smell coming from some of
those machines. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 25.

whether rat poison was the source of contamination on soft drinks
that were transported on fungicide-treated wooden pallets. (Holmes,
Cox News Service). 15.

   COKE-STOCK _ ATLANTA _ A look at what analysts think the

   OLY-HIGHJUMP-AUSTIN _ SAN MARCOS, Texas _ When he broke the

around.'' The surprise, though, isn't necessarily that Austin did
what no American has ever done by clearing a bar 7 feet, 10.5
inches off the ground at an outdoor meet. Perhaps the surprise is
that he hasn't done it since that magical meet in Zurich,
Switzerland, on Aug. 7, 1991. That's especially true since the
former Southwest Texas State Bobcat, now 31, definitely knows what
he is doing and assuredly isn't goofing off. (Riggs, Austin

   HKN-WADDELL _ Don Waddell was never known as a physical player
in his career, which spanned one NHL game with the L.A. Kings and
several years in the minor leagues and Europe. But you'd be
hardpressed to find an NHL executive who has emerged from more
difficult times, growing up in racially torn Detroit, where he was
once was locked in a high school safe with other white kids during
a riot, been held up at gunpoint while working at a convenience
store, was nearly blinded in one eye when another player hit him
with a stick requiring surgery and growing up poor in a two-bedroom
house with five kids and a single mother. His father left home for
another woman when Waddell was young, then got into a car crash
that crippled him for life. So by comparison, forming the core of
the Atlanta Thrashers over a span of two drafts in 48 hours won't
seem so difficult for Waddell. (Schultz, Atlanta

what no American has ever done by clearing a bar 7 feet, 10.5
inches off the ground at an outdoor meet. Perhaps the surprise is
that he hasn't done it since that magical meet in Zurich,
Switzerland, on Aug. 7, 1991. That's especially true since the
former Southwest Texas State Bobcat, now 31, definitely knows what
he is doing and assuredly isn't goofing off. (Riggs, Austin

POOR PERFORMANCE OF CD-ROM DRIVE MAY JUST BE CASE OF KIDS' STICKY
FINGERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: We have a single computer in our house that I share with my
wife and two small children. I have noticed that, when the children
are using the computer, their CD-ROM software doesn't work as well
as it used to. Usually it involves the CD drive stalling out and a
blue screen comes up saying the computer can't read from the CD-ROM
drive. I've installed new drivers, checked the connections, but
nothing seems to work. What could be wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's wrong is probably your children's sticky fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The clue here is the fact that it's happening only with your
children's software, not with your own. If you had driver or
connection problems, all your CD-ROM-based programs would be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Take a close look at the disks your children use. I suspect
they're dirty and need to be cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Try cleaning a disk as you would a pair of eyeglasses _ with a
soft tissue, perhaps blowing on it first. If this doesn't work, you
might want to pick up a CD-ROM cleaner at your favorite computer
store.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible the disks in question are severely scratched.
In that case, you'll need to replace them. Some software publishers
will replace scratched CDs for free if you send them the damaged
ones first. Contact the publisher's technical support line for
details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are three computers in our house now, and I am
considering setting up a network so we can play games and share the
modem. I am confused about what to get, though. I see both
10-megabit and 100-megabit home network kits that use Ethernet, and
I see some wireless and phone line kits that only can send with 1
megabit. What are the benefits of the faster kits, given my needs?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on whether you value convenience and simplicity
over speed.
</P>
<P>
   Unless your computers are all in the same room, the phone-line
and wireless kits will be much easier to set up and install. For
printing, dial-up modem sharing and most multiplayer games, these
1-megabit systems are just fine.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you will be moving large files back and forth
between computers, or want to run multimedia applications over your
home network, you'll find these non-Ethernet systems to be woefully
inadequate. Moving a 25-megabyte file over a phone-line network can
seem to take forever, while it takes just seconds with 10- or
100-megabit Ethernet. And if you are trying to view video over the
network, you should definitely consider 100-megabit Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   One other consideration: If you are planning to get cable modem
or high-speed ADSL service, you may want to consider Ethernet. The
average transfer rate for cable-modem service is in the six- to
eight-megabit range, while ADSL can go as high as six megabits
(though residential ADSL service in Houston averages between 384K
and 1.4 megabit). That's faster than the 1-megabit throughput of
the wireless and phone-line networks, making those systems a
bottleneck when you are sharing one of these fast connections.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Ethernet is that you must string cable between
the computers, and a lot of people aren't comfortable with this
process, which may involve cutting holes in walls and running
wiring through them. But for some folks, the speed is worth the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I connect to a Web site, I sometimes see a picture of a
lock at the bottom of my browser. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means your browser has made a secure connection to the
site, and is sending and receiving information that's encrypted, or
scrambled. This guarantees a private exchange, and usually is used
for electronic commerce.

OFFICE 2000 SINGS BIG, EXPENSIVE TUNE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there are remaining doubts about whether Microsoft ``gets''
the Internet, they are dashed by the latest version of the software
giant's cash cow, Office 2000. It's the first application suite
that treats the Net as a given.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 presumes its users are connected to a network and
presumes they are also connected to the Internet. That's great if
you are _ this is going to be a popular product with big companies
and users who are on the cutting edge of such practices as document
collaboration. But if you don't fit into those categories, Office
2000 is either a dubious upgrade, or a way for users to begin to
explore this advanced way of working.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I reviewed the competition from Corel, WordPerfect
Office 2000 Professional (See
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/06/11/compute.html). While
it's not as Internet-oriented as the Microsoft suite, it costs
quite a bit less and is otherwise as feature-rich as Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For this review, I looked at the Premium edition of Office 2000,
which includes Word, a word processor; Excel, a spreadsheet;
PowerPoint, for presentations; Access, a database; Outlook, a
contact manager; FrontPage, a Web site manager; PhotoDraw, an image
editor; and a set of small-business tools.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`BLOATWARE' SLIMS DOWN SOME
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft claims it has responded to user complaints
about ``bloatware'' by letting you install only the feature you
think you'll need, this is still a lumbering giant of a package.
The typical installation will drop about 300 megabytes onto your
hard drive. The Premium edition comes on four CDs.
</P>
<P>
   This remains the best-integrated suite _ everything works well
together, and the menus and button bars all follow the same design.
Documents designed by any of these applications can be imported
smoothly into other Office components.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000's Web integration begins with the most fundamental
aspect _ Hypertext Mark-up Language, the programming language used
for Web pages. In other suites, HTML is treated as a secondary file
format. With the Office components, though, it's a primary format.
</P>
<P>
   This means that if you design a nifty-looking Word document and
save it as HTML, the HTML version will look as good as if you saved
it in Word's own .DOC format. In the past, saving a Word document
as an HTML file was a hit-or-miss proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 also lets you save an HTML document directly to a
Web server, whether it's on your corporate network or out there on
the Internet. When you install the suite, it adds an item in the
Windows Explorer called Web Folders. You can save directly to these
folders, just as though they are sitting on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. In order for this to work, the server must
be running special software that works with Office. That's too bad
_ Microsoft could have made this a much simpler, more universal and
less proprietary solution if it had used FTP, or File Transfer
Protocol, the standard way to post documents to most Internet
servers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CUSTOMIZING THE FEATURES
</P>
<P>
   As with the Corel suite, you can install only those features of
Office 2000 that you need. Then, if you later try to use a feature
that you didn't originally include, the ``Install on Demand''
module either grabs it from a central server on your corporate
network, or prompts you for the CD.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of installation _ the install routine gives you
literally hundreds of choices. If you choose a custom setup, you
can choose to install a feature; install it on first use; or never
allow it to be installed; or to run it from the CD. It's a dizzying
array that can be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the applications, there very few outward changes in
the programs' interface. (Access, which has had a welcome facelift
to make it more user-friendly, is the biggest exception.) The
button bars and top-level menus will be comfortingly familiar to
longtime Office users. One major difference, though, is in the way
Office hides less-frequently used features, and then brings them
forward if you use them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you click on Excel's Tools menu, you'll see only
about six selections, including one that says Options. If you click
on Options _ or even if you just sit there for a few seconds _ then
the menu automatically expands to show you more. Wait long enough,
and the Office Assistant (Microsoft's animated help feature)
appears to provide help. If you choose one of the hidden options,
and then use it several times, it will appear each time you select
the Tools.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there's good news for the many Office users who
consider the irritating Office Assistant characters to be the
business-software equivalent of Jar Jar Binks. You can now access
the Help features without having to look at the stupid things.
</P>
<P>
   One of Office 2000's nicest features is its ability to fix
itself. If you accidentally delete a key file, or if one becomes
corrupted, the Office applications can figure out what's wrong and
will install the missing or broken file automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the Premium edition of Microsoft's suite is steep.
The least you can get away with is $449, and that's if you are
upgrading from a previous version or a competitor's product. Even
the lowest-end configuration of Office 2000, dubbed Standard, will
set you back at least $249.

 &HT;    INDUSTRY TO HELP PARENTS USE NEW 'V-CHIP' TO SCREEN TV SHOWS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A campaign to help parents use TV ratings and the
new ``V-chip'' to protect children from broadcast sex and violence
was previewed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can program the V-chips to block particular programs
rated under voluntary industry guidelines according to age and
violent, sexual or profane content.
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and broadcast networks use the ratings, although the
NBC broadcast network does not use content labels and the Black
Entertainment Television cable network does not use any ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that half of all televisions larger than 13
inches sold in the United States be equipped with the chips by July
1. The other half must be equipped by Jan. 1, 2000, and all
manufacturers are on schedule to meet the deadline, said Michael
Petricone, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-Chip Education Project,'' a partnership of the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Center for Media Education, will get
under way next week. It includes a series of public service
announcements, an Internet site (http://www.vchipeducation.org) and
a booklet that outline how the ratings system and V-chip work.
</P>

 CPT- COMPUTERS-BOMBAY-COLUMN-TEX 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: I'm a 77-year-old computer neophyte. (My kids gave me this
PC to drive me out of my mind. I keep a 2-pound sledge beside me,
and one day _ kapow! _ out of my misery!!) I've started getting a
screen from the ``content adviser'' on America Online blocking Web
sites because the sites were not rated and a supervisor's password
was needed. I've talked to AOL three times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Access Denied
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DENIED: You know, you'd think AOL would have known the
answer since it is its program that's giving you fits. Or maybe AOL
thinks you really enjoy listening to Muzak while you're on infinity
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it sounds as though you're running up against the filter
that was intended for horndog teen-agers looking for naked pictures
of Star Trek: Voyager's Seven of Nine _ at least those teen-agers
with parents responsible enough to enable the filter.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL account can have multiple users with different screen
names, but only the big honcho who first set up the account _ and,
since a credit card was required, is presumably at least 18 _ can
adjust the parental controls. I'm guessing your kids set you up as
a peon on their account.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that what you've been trying to look at is dirty. At
least that's what we'll tell the kids. The sites probably don't
carry any of the embedded information AOL is looking for in order
to rate them. If it doesn't know for sure, stuff gets blocked.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell right away if you're the boss. Just go to the
parental controls part of the member setup and try to change your
login to 18-plus. Or have those rotten kids do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the only user of the account, and you're already set
to 18-plus, then something is goobered up elsewhere. I'd uninstall
AOL to wipe out any bogus settings, then reinstall the latest
version. And if that doesn't work, I'd guilt the kids into getting
you an account with a real Internet service provider instead of
depending on AOL's gateway to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My 56K modem connects to AOL at around 28K.
Only rarely do I get anything above 30K. My neighbors have no
trouble connecting at 56K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow Burn
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BURN: Almost nobody connects at 56K. There are too many
things out there conspiring to slow you down. I feel lucky to get
on at 31.2 from home, and I'm using the finest equipment I could
hide in my briefcase on the way home from the office. Maybe you
should ignore that last part.
</P>
<P>
   You might have cruddy wiring in your house. Maybe you have a
cheap modem with out-of-date brains. Maybe you're dialing into a
lousy connection. Maybe the modem you're connecting with is limited
to 28.8. Maybe you have bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   Haul your rig next door where they supposedly get 56K
connections and see what happens. That should narrow things down.
Or try dialing other 56K modems, like the one on 3Com's bulletin
board ( (847) 262-6000). You may just have to live with 28.8. It
isn't really that horrendous. You kids today are just spoiled. In
my day, we downloaded barefoot all day at 300 baud, and we never
complained. We made our own electricity with hand cranks and
coconut shells filled with salt water, and when that didn't work,
we'd hook up our telegraph keys, which in those days were called
hyperambulatators, to the streetcar combine's secret Tesla coil
flux generators. ...
</P>

 &HT;    INDUSTRY TO HELP PARENTS USE NEW 'V-CHIP' TO SCREEN TV SHOWS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A campaign to help parents use TV ratings and the
new ``V-chip'' to protect children from broadcast sex and violence
was previewed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can program the V-chips to block particular programs
rated under voluntary industry guidelines according to age and
violent, sexual or profane content.
</P>
<P>
   Most cable and broadcast networks use the ratings, although the
NBC broadcast network does not use content labels and the Black
Entertainment Television cable network does not use any ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that half of all televisions larger than 13
inches sold in the United States be equipped with the chips by July
1. The other half must be equipped by Jan. 1, 2000, and all
manufacturers are on schedule to meet the deadline, said Michael
Petricone, a spokesman for the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``The V-Chip Education Project,'' a partnership of the Henry J.
Kaiser Family Foundation and Center for Media Education, will get
under way next week. It includes a series of public service
announcements, an Internet site (http://www.vchipeducation.org) and
a booklet that outline how the ratings system and V-chip work.
</P>
<P>
   The chip allows parents to create their own daily TV schedule,
said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America and chair of the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, the responsibility for using this power lies
solely in the hands of Mom and Dad,'' Valenti said at a news
conference to introduce the education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters and the National Cable
Television Association are also participating in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Tristani, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission's V-Chip Task Force, applauded the education effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the mother of an 18-year-old daughter and a 6-year-old
son,'' Tristani said. ``I know the concerns and frustrations of
parents who want to protect their children from material they deem
unsuitable.''

LATEST PALMTOPS ARE PUMPED UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HENRY NORR   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
 &HT;    Combine the proven popularity of 3Com's Palm handheld organizers
with the allure of the Internet, make it work without wires, and
you have something that ought to be unbeatable.
 &HT;    It's called the Palm VII, and it truly is nifty _ a tantalizing
taste of a future in which wireless communicators are as
commonplace as calculators, or maybe even wristwatches. But put it
to work in the here and now, as I have been doing for the past
couple of weeks, and you quickly bump up against some frustrating
limitations.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, I have also been trying out the Cassiopeia E100, a
pocket-size competitor from Casio. It does not have wireless or
even a conventional modem built in, and its software, Microsoft's
Windows CE, is not as elegant as Palm's. But the E100 has some
unique virtues of its own _ notably, a gorgeous color screen and a
headphone jack that lets you listen to digital music in stereo.
 &HT;    Neither device is easy to get hold of, and in both cases prices
are steep. The Palm VII costs $599, plus monthly service fees, and
it is currently on sale only in the New York area, although the
wireless features work anywhere in urban America. (It is slated to
go on sale nationwide this fall.). The Cassiopeia E100 lists for
$499, and although in theory it is available anywhere, in reality
dealers report long waiting lists for it.
 &HT;    PALM BASICS: The Palm VII looks like older Palm organizers,
rather than the sleek and silvery new Palm V. In most ways, it also
works like previous models. It has the same easy-to-use software
for recording names and addresses, appointments, to-do items,
expenses and notes. You enter your information the same way, by
writing on it with a stylus in a simplified alphabet called
Graffiti. And, as before, you can connect the device to a PC or a
Mac and synchronize handheld and desktop data at the press of one
button.
 &HT;    The new model also shares the shortcomings of its older
siblings. The monochrome screen is sharp but small _ about 21/4
inches square _ and dim. Switching on backlighting turns it a
garish green. A pair of AAA batteries can still run it for weeks,
depending on usage; unfortunately, unlike the new Palm V, it does
not have a rechargeable power pack built in.
 &HT;    NET ACCESS, PALM-STYLE: Aside from a slightly elongated shape,
the only visual clue to the Palm VII's uniqueness is a small
plastic antenna along the right side. Swing it up, and within
seconds you are automatically connected to 3Com's Palm.net service.
Work your way through a few simple screens to set up your account
and you are ready to start exchanging e-mail or gathering
information from the Web wirelessly.
 &HT;    Within limits. You have to use a new e-mail address at Palm.net,
rather than your existing address. Long messages are cut off or
simply not delivered, and attached files, except plain-text memos,
are removed.
 &HT;    Altogether, it is somewhere in between a full-blown e-mail
system and a text pager. Unlike a pager, though, the Palm VII does
not automatically receive new messages sent your way _ you do not
get them until you fire up Palm's iMessenger program to check for
them.
 &HT;    As for the World Wide Web, you can't browse it in the
traditional sense from the Palm VII _ the screen is too small and
the wireless network Palm uses too slow (a paltry 8 kilobytes per
second) for that. What you can do is choose among a set of small
Palm programs that let you retrieve specific bits of information,
which Palm calls ``Web clippings,'' from selected sites.
 &HT;    You can, for instance, get news briefs from ABC News and USA
Today, headlines and summaries from the Wall Street Journal (and
full stories if you open an extra-cost subscription) and sports
scores from ESPN. You can get stock quotes (but not trade) via
E-Trade, check your Bank of America balance and get the address of
the nearest ATM. Or look up phone numbers, e-mail addresses,
airline schedules, movie show times, hotel and restaurant listings,
traffic and weather reports, even miniature maps. Answers generally
come back within 5 to 15 seconds.
 &HT;    Such tidbits are a far cry from the breadth and depth of the Web
itself, but they will be of great value to many users, especially
busy business travelers. And being able to get them within seconds,
wherever you are, without even having to plug into a phone line, is
a huge convenience.
 &HT;    You will pay for the convenience, though. Besides a one-time $20
set-up fee, basic service is $9.99 a month. But that covers only 50
Kbytes of transferred data _ something like 30 messages (one a
day), 20 stock quotes, 10 sports scores, 10 traffic reports, and 10
weather updates. For $24.99 a month you can receive three times as
much data. But serious Internet junkies will eat through that in
days, and with either monthly plan, Palm charges 30 cents for each
extra kilobyte.
 &HT;    Altogether, the Palm VII is both elegant and innovative. But as
an Internet access device, it is also pricey and limited. If you
want full untethered access to the Net, you will be better off, at
least in the Bay Area, with one of Metricom's Ricochet wireless
modems.
 &HT;    BOLD AND BRIGHT: The Palm VII's other big weakness is its
screen, which my over-50 eyes found difficult to read under many
lighting conditions. The opposite is true of the Cassiopeia E100:
Its screen is its most outstanding feature. It is noticeably bigger
than the Palm VII's, but the real difference is that Casio's
display has bright, crisp 16-bit color. Color is not just more
pleasant to look at than the drab Palm screen _ it also makes text
much easier to read and screen controls easier to manage.
 &HT;    The silver Casio unit itself is a little thicker and heavier
than the Palm VII, but it still fits easily in a shirt pocket. Its
lithium-ion battery pack lasts around six hours. That could be a
problem if, for example, you plan to use it while hiking,
especially because you can't just swap in a new set of disposable
batteries. But if you keep it in its cradle when at your desk, and
plug its AC adapter into the cradle, it will recharge as you work
and be ready to roll when you are.
 &HT;    The device's software, the palm-size edition of Windows CE,
provides personal-information management features like Palm's,
except that, oddly, there is no expense-recording program. As with
Palm devices, you enter data with a stylus, but with the Casio you
get more choices about how: You can tap out your words on an
on-screen keyboard or use a program called Jot, which does an
excellent job recognizing either conventional block printing or
Graffiti-style script.
 &HT;    Critics of Windows CE often complain that its desktop-derived
user interface is too complex and clunky for palm-size devices.
There is truth to that, but Casio has gone a long way toward
addressing the issue by adding a new iconic program-launching
screen, plus several user-configurable buttons.
 &HT;    Windows CE's desktop-connectivity software could be simpler to
set up, but it works well with Windows PCs. (There is no Mac
version at all.) I configured the software to synchronize
automatically with Outlook 98 on my PCs at home and at work, so
every time I enter an appointment or contact name on the handheld
or either desktop machine, it is automatically copied to the others
the next time I plug the E100 into the PC. I don't even have to
remember to push a button!
 &HT;    MULTIMEDIA IN YOUR HAND: Where the E100 really leads the pack is
in its audio and even video capabilities, though you will have to
install some extra software to take full advantage of them. At
www.audible.com, for example, you can find a free player for audio
books and articles. And at www.xaudio.com, you can download the
killer app for this device: a free player for MP3 music, the
digital-audio format that has taken the Internet by storm.
 &HT;    Since the Cassiopeia comes with 16 megabytes of RAM (compared to
only 2 MB in the Palm VII), you will probably have room for only
two or three cuts. But since the E100 has a special slot for a kind
of add-on memory called CompactFlash, you can easily pop in extra
RAM. I added a 48MB CompactFlash card, which should easily hold
between 10 to 20 songs.
 &HT;    What you end up with is a full-blown pocket-size MP3 player,
comparable to Diamond Multimedia's popular Rio, except that the
E100 is also a versatile organizer. A small built-in speaker puts
out surprisingly good-quality sound, though not much volume. But
most people will use the headphone jack, which generates output
that to my ear is nearly indistinguishable from CD-quality.
 &HT;    BOTTOM LINE: Which, if either, of these devices makes sense for
you obviously depends on your needs, tastes and budget. Personally,
I was more excited to discover the Cassiopeia E100, which has not
yet received much publicity, and more frustrated by the limitations
of the Palm VII, about which there has been so much hype. But both
devices, in my opinion, are indisputably cool.

 BC-PALMSIDE-CHEAPOPTIONS-SFCHRON  
 SAME PALM SIZE AT A SMALLER PRICE  
 By HENRY NORR   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The success of 3Com's Palm electronic organizers is generating
increasing competition, not just from Casio and other manufacturers
using Windows CE, but also from new players promoting lower-cost
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The latest to enter the race is a Palo Alto startup called Fuga
Corp., which this spring introduced a palm-size device called the
eDiary. At first glance, it looks similar to the Palm III and older
3Com models. Like them, it stores contact information, calendar
entries, tasks, expenses and similar data, and it syncs with a PC
via a serial cable.
</P>
<P>
   Fuga touts two big advantages to the eDiary. One is price: It is
only $149.99, direct from Fuga's Web site (www.fuga.com). The other
is simplicity. The company says it is aiming not at the tech-savvy
computer elite that have flocked to Palm, but at ordinary
small-business people who until now have relied mainly on paper
organizers and sticky notes.
</P>
<P>
   To appeal to such users, Fuga's design minimizes reliance on
menu commands, multiple windows and dialog boxes. Most kinds of
data are displayed on a single central page, which Fuga calls
VuOne, with letters identifying the type of data (E for expense, T
for To Do and other letters for any custom categories you create).
To get more details, such as a phone number for someone with whom
you have scheduled a meeting, you simply drag the stylus over the
item name, and a small pane with additional info pops up.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, the eDiary has no handwriting recognition _ you
have to enter data by tapping on a tiny on-screen keyboard. The
screen is even darker and dimmer than the Palm's. And Fuga's PC
software does not sync automatically or on command with Outlook or
any other desktop personal-information management programs. If you
use any such software on the PC, you have to export your data
manually, then import it into the Fuga program; changes on either
device are not automatically communicated to the other.
</P>
<P>
   Fuga's eDiary is not the only low-cost option in the growing
personal data assistant market. Royal, a division of Italy's
Olivetti, now sells a device it calls the Da Vinci for $99. And
this summer it is scheduled to roll out an improved version called
the Da Vinci Pro. Casio, in addition to its more expensive Windows
CE products, offers two new items, the PV-100 and PV-200, that are
designed simply to function as mobile ``Pocket Viewers'' for data
from Microsoft Outlook; they list for $149 and $179, respectively.
Older Palm and Windows CE devices are also frequently available for
less than $200, as are units in Sharp's venerable Wizard line. And
Casio, Sharp, Franklin and other vendors make simple electronic
address books at prices that go well below $50.

SOFTWARE INDUSTRY SEES RECORD GROWTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BENNY EVANGELISTA   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S software sales increased 17.8 percent to a record $141.9
billion last year and the industry now employs 806,900 people
nationwide, according to a study released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The software industry should become the biggest contributor to
the U.S. economy of all manufacturing industries by next year,
accelerating past the century-old automobile industry, according to
the Business Software Alliance report.
</P>
<P>
   ``The software industry has emerged as one of the
fastest-growing and most vibrant segments of the U.S. economy,''
BSA President Robert Holleyman said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The trade association used the report to punctuate the third day
of a technology industry blitz on Washington, D.C. The majordomos
of leading tech companies such as Microsoft and Intel have huddled
with Capitol Hill legislators and the Clinton administration,
stressing the economic and political importance of their
industries.
</P>
<P>
   To release the report, the alliance trotted out 13 CEOs from its
top member companies, including Bill Gates of Microsoft, Carol
Bartz of Autodesk Inc., John Chen of Sybase, Bill Harris of Intuit
and William Larson of Network Associates.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives said legislators are more aware than ever
of the key issues on high-tech industry's agenda, from encryption
to software piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the industry's top issue, the Senate passed a bill
this week that would limit lawsuits caused by Year 2000 computer
problems, though the White House has threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is listening to this industry very well,'' Gates said
at the press conference. ``I'm pleased with the dialogue and I'm
pleased with the interest level. It's related to the fact we're
creating a number of good jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by Nathan Associates Inc., said software
industry employment grew 13.9 percent annually from 1994 to 1998,
which compares to an annual growth rate of only 2.5 percent for all
of private industry combined.
</P>
<P>
   The average salary for software workers is $68,900 per year,
compared with $29,800 for other private sector workers.
</P>
<P>
   If the current trend continues, the industry will have more than
1.3 million workers by 2008, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Bartz, though, said illegally copied software cost the industry
$11 billion in lost potential revenue and prevented the creation of
32,700 jobs last year. If that rate continues, the industry would
lose 52,700 new jobs by 2008, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is pushing for stronger copyright protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an area where we require help,'' Bartz said.

KEEPING AOL FREE OF COOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID EINSTEIN   
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: On my computer at home I have successfully disabled cookies
in America Online. So imagine my surprise when I loaded AOL onto my
PC at the office, only to discover that the cookies options had
disappeared. What's the story, and is there an easy fix?
</P>
<P>
   A: The story is that the version of AOL you installed at work
doesn't give you cookie control. But you can remedy the situation
easily. Just install Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 on your office
PC (ask your systems people to do it for you or get their OK to do
it yourself).
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which comes with an earlier version of IE 4, will
automatically upgrade itself to use IE 5's preferences, including
cookie options. It's unfortunate that neither AOL nor Microsoft has
bothered to tell us about this curious relationship between the two
programs, but now you know.
</P>
<P>
   To set your cookie options, go to My AOL and choose Preferences.
Click the WWW icon, which brings up the window for AOL Internet
Properties. Tab over to Security and click the button for Custom

   NO EXPRESS RECEIPTS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was very much interested to learn in your column that I
could get a receipt when I sent e-mail. You showed how to do this
for Outlook and Netscape. I use Outlook Express and the
instructions provided do not apply. Can I request receipts with
Express, and if not, how do I switch from Express to Outlook?
</P>
<P>
   A: Outlook Express has no provision for receipts, which can tell
you when an e-mail message you've sent has been received and/or
opened. But hey, the program is free, so you can't complain too
much. Switching to Outlook will cost you, because that program is
part of the Microsoft Office suite (which also includes Word,
Excel, etc.) And Office is expensive. The standard upgrade version
of Office 2000 costs $250, and the full version is $450. My advice
would be to use Netscape, or maybe another free program such as
Pegasus, which also supports receipts. You can download Pegasus
from www.pegasus.usa.com.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I do sometimes when I send an important e-mail? I
include a blind copy to myself. It's not as good as a receipt, but
if I get the copy back, I at least know that the message went
through the Internet the way it was supposed to. So you might try
that as a way to put your mind at rest.
</P>
<P>
   TO BUY OR LEASE
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm wondering about different ways to finance a new PC. I
know you can purchase one over time from Gateway. Dell, on the
other hand, offers what it calls a ``personal lease'' program that
I assume is like leasing a car. Which of these options do you think
is the better deal?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm thinking that financing a computer from Gateway is a
better deal than leasing one from Dell. Either way, you'll spend
about $1,775 over two years _ $74 a month _ for a $1,500 computer.
But at the end of that time, you'll own the Gateway. With the Dell,
you'll have to pay 22 percent of the original price to buy the
computer after the lease. Also, Gateway lets you trade in your
computer for a new one (the trade-in allowance is the wholesale
value of the computer at the time of the trade-in).
</P>
<P>
   TRANSLATION UPDATE: Last time, I gave out the address of a site
run by AltaVista that offers free online translations between
English and several European languages. Some readers responded that
they couldn't access the site. Invariably, it was because they were
adding ``www'' to the address by mistake. Just enter
babelfish.altavista.com/cgi-bin/translate? and that should do it.
(Remember to include the question mark at the end.)
</P>
<P>
   On the same subject, a few readers said the site doesn't do a
great job of translating. Some of the words they used to describe
it were ``garbled'' and ``garbage.'' So maybe a software package
such as Power Translator Pro from Lernout &AMP; Hauspie ($130),
Universal Translator from Language Force ($40) and Easy Translator
from Transparent Language ($42) is your best bet after all.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: When you conduct a search on the Internet for a
name or phrase, search engines typically go out and find thousands
_ sometimes millions _ of results that include any of your search
words. But there is a way to narrow your searches considerably.
Just enclose your search phrase in quotation marks. That tells the
search engine to look for only the exact phrase.

E-therapy: Affordable advice is now a click away 
By John Keilman  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you've got a personal problem, a computer and
a credit card, Susan Wright is ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   Just head to her web site _ www.advicelink.com _ fill out a
12-question survey about your troubles and offer up your credit
card number. For $25, Wright, a licensed independent social worker
in Cleveland, will e-mail her counsel back to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been an avant garde person, so I got in (on the
Internet) very early,'' Wright says of her service, which appears
to be the only one of its kind in Ohio. ``I knew what was going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was the birth of a service known as e-therapy or
webcounseling, the delivery of mental health services over the
Internet. Its methods, many believe, will lead to permanent changes
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether that will be for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that this will become a big area
in the future, (but) the level of involvement psychologists should
have, I don't know,'' says Cheryl Meyer, an assistant professor at
Wright State University's School of Professional Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy is virtually unstudied and unregulated. There is
little research on its effectiveness. No licensing requirements
exist. Anyone, regardless of his qualifications, can set up a web
site and charge for his advice.
</P>
<P>
   That makes many professionals nervous. Yet for now, the boards
that license psychologists, social workers and counselors in Ohio
are leaving e-therapy alone, waiting for groups like the American
Psychological Association to decide upon standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``(E-therapy) is moving so rapidly that no one knows where we
stand at this point,'' says Barbara Garwood, a member of the Ohio
State Board of Psychology. ``It's a freedom of speech issue, it's
an interstate commerce issue, it's a restraint of trade issue, it's
a protect the public issue. Holy cow, it's complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, New Albany, Ind., counselor Ed Needham was
dropping into chat rooms on topics from computers to coffee when he
noticed a curious phenomenon: Any time he mentioned his profession,
others immediately wanted to chat privately about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   That convinced him there was a desire for web-based counseling.
He built a site and ran it for free at first, though he later
decided to charge $15 a session. He guesses he had about 50 clients
until insurance worries prompted him to end the service a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a unique dynamic,'' he says. ``... You pick up on
something that's different (from office counseling) in that it's
more focused. It's definitely more intense at times ... You're
looking at a screen, and everything else tends to blend into the
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Needham believes he was one of the first mental health
professionals to use the web for treatment, and so far, he doesn't
appear to have a great deal of company. Only 162 practitioners of
Internet counseling are listed at www.metanoia.org/imhs _ a web
site dedicated to the activity. That compares to more than 28,000
credentialed counselors in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The method appears, however, to be gaining more acceptance.
Recovery Services of Warren and Clinton Counties, a public
behavioral health services provider in Lebanon, plans to put an
automated test on its web site to help people screen themselves for
alcoholism, depression, attention deficit disorder and anxiety
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy practitioners acknowledge that their techniques are
limited. A counselor can't read body language or hear the tone of a
person's voice, and some experts say those are crucial failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of (counseling) isn't necessarily what people are
saying, it's how they're saying it. You need to look at their
non-verbal communication, and you just don't get that with
e-therapy,'' says Dr. Peter Zafirides, a professor at Ohio State
University's department of psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   E-therapy practitioners and proponents respond that e-mail and
chat rooms have their own strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Schwambach, who does e-mail counseling from her office in
Evansville, Ind., says the form inspires focus and efficiency.
What's more, it can be less expensive for patients: They don't need
to pay for a $200 hour of counseling when all they want is a brief
answer to a single question (Schwambach, who also writes a column
for newspapers, charges $1.50 a minute for her time through her web
site, www.drjudith.com).
</P>
<P>
   She also allows her Internet clients anonymity. While that's
something she says many patients desire, Zafirides says it is a
questionable virtue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the whole premise of therapy itself, there
needs to be a human connection,'' he says. ``Some of the problems
today come from people who feel more and more alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I have to know the person to respond to them,''
Schwambach retorts. ``If I came upon someone having an accident, I
would not feel I have to know them to be able to help them.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I'm more of a bottom-line person. Let's deal the matter
at hand. We have to deal with what's happening right now. And I
think most people are the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also point to the lack of research on the subject and
the dearth of laws in place to govern it. A person does not need
any special qualifications to hang out a virtual shingle, and given
the Internet's fluidity and secrecy, that's a situation some
believe will never change.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I have told thousands of people, you're never going to cure
the problem, because so much of it is off-shore,'' says Randolph
Reaves, general counsel for the Association of State and Provincial
Psychology Boards. ``You can't do a damn thing about people who are
sitting on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean who wants to
practice psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   While some web counselors fear national or state regulations
could hurt their competitiveness, others say they would welcome new
rules. In the absence of such guidelines, John Grohol, who runs a
Columbus-based mental health web site, says potential patients
should exercise caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it works best for milder kinds of problems,'' he
says. `` ... I think given the seriousness of some problems,
there's too much potential for danger and negative outcomes when a
person turns solely to the Internet for intervention for serious
mental disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think we're at the point where they require
face-to-face interaction. At this time, it's better to be safe.''

SOFTWARE HEADS FOR TOP ROLE IN U.S. ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By Andrew J. Glass  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON The digital code that powers the nation's computers
provided a record $141 billion upward kick to the domestic economy,
according to a study released Wednesday by a key software trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Given current trends, the software industry's overall share of
the U.S. economy will surpass that of car, truck and motor vehicle
makers beginning in 2000, the Business Software Alliance reported.
That would mean that software makers, led by such industry giants
as Microsoft Corp., will next year exceed the value of all other
manufacturing groups in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from a year that saw overall sales rise by 17.8 percent,
most of the top executives of the 18 software firms which belong to
the group spent much of the week in closed sessions with
administration and congressional leaders, pursuing their high-tech
agenda. Since the alliance's members include an ever-shifting
universe of partners and rivals, some of the most sensitive issues
facing the industry remain out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In opening a press conference to report how the ``software
industry has emerged as one of the fastest-growing and most vibrant
segments of the U.S. economy,'' Robert Holleyman, the trade group's
president, made it clear that no questions about Microsoft's
antitrust problems with the Justice Department and 19 states would
be in order. Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, seated to Holleyman's
left, beamed with evident pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did allow, however, that ``the level of dialogue with the
Congress and the executive branch has increased quite
dramatically'' in recent years. ``The Congress,'' he added, ``is
listening to this industry very well.''
</P>
<P>
   On his appointed rounds, the Microsoft co-founder has ridden
several times past the sandstone federal courthouse on Constitution
Avenue where the antitrust trial has entered a final and, possibly,
decisive phase. But his time has been otherwise spent joining the
Democrats for their weekly policy lunch, testifying before a
Republican-led technology summit of the Joint Economic Committee
and engaging in a photo-op for a a minority youth computer
education grant.
</P>
<P>
   The receptive political climate that Gates and his fellow
industry leaders found in Washington on both sides of the aisle had
been paved by increasingly generous wallets.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997-1998 campaign season alone, technology companies
contributed nearly $9 million to congressional candidates. That sum
was double the 1993-94 election total. Moreover, and the industry
seems poised to up the ante even further for the 2000
</P>
<P>
   election, according to Holly Bailey of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a watchdog group that monitors money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, high tech is becoming an increasingly
prominent contributor,'' Bailey said. ``Anything that concerns the
computer industry is getting a big ear in Congress these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides releasing the report, the software group utilized the
press session to highlight its Washington agenda. Each executive in
turn, including Gates, tackled such matters as the need for
increased copyright protection, the need to end encryption export
restrictions, the Y2K computer glitch, digital signatures and
related privacy concerns and the rapid growth of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The study commissioned from Nathan Associates revealed that in
1998, the industry
</P>
<P>
   had 806,900 employees. It now has workers in every state who
earn an average of $68,900 a year. By contrast, other workers in
the private sector earn an average of $29,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It also also found that spending by the industry and its
employees stimulated a major ripple effect of economic activities
in other sectors of the economy. Thus, after taking the multiplier
effect into account, the demand for software employed 2.7 million
people earning $128 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, the industry estimates that currently, one
out of every four software applications are illegally loaded on
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group estimates that in 1998 software theft resulted
in 109,000 lost jobs, $4.5 billion in lost wages and $991 million
in lost tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enactment and enforcement of strong copyright laws around
the world have already reduced rampant software piracy, estimated
to cost nearly $11 billion in key global markets,'' said Holleyman.
``In just eight of the world's largest software markets, by
</P>
<P>
   reducing piracy rates from their 1992 levels to the levels
experienced in 1998, our industry was able to realize nearly $4
billion in additional software sales in these eight markets in 1998
alone.''

 &HT;    The living is easy when you're a pampered pooch at a posh pet
resort
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Firmly grasping his football, Chance races around the
pool like a maniac, while Stoney belly-flops into the water playing
keep-away with a blue plastic barbell, daring Teddy to snatch his
prize. All the while, Darby _ who can't swim and sinks like a rock,
but who also can't resist being part of the fun _ is plopped on a
blue lounge in the middle of the pool, getting her feet wet,
watching the action and trying to catch a few of the tennis balls
flying her way.
</P>
<P>
   You might think this is a scene from summer camp or a public
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The participants in these water high jinks are the furry,
four-legged kind, and swim time is a regular part of a stay at the
Pet Lodge in Alpharetta (Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   These days when you board your dog, it's entirely possible that
your pet may end up having a better time than you. Pool frolics,
nature walks, playtimes and even hayrides are among the indulgences
Fido will enjoy while visiting an upscale boarding kennel in the
Atlanta area.
</P>
<P>
   Among America's 52.9 million dogs are some truly pampered
pooches _ no longer relegated to the back yard as sentries but
folded into the family unit almost as equal members.
</P>
<P>
   These beloved pets unwind at some of metro Atlanta's most
upscale kennels _ among them Pet Lodge, Cloud 9 in Ellenwood (Ga.)
and Barking Hound Village in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>

   www.pet-lodge.com
</P>
<P>
   Owners: Ken and Karen Miller
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Basic package costs $17 per night for a 5-by-10-foot
kennel with three 10-minute outings three times a day and includes
meals. The Platinum Package includes two play times daily, one
daily nature walk and a fleece bed for $17 per day over the daily
rate. Suites measuring 15-by-20 feet _ outfitted with furniture and
televisions _ soon will be available for $60 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities: Nature walks, $10 for 30 minutes; play times, $6 for
15 minutes of private play with a staff member or 45 minutes in a
group; swim times, $10 for group (45 minutes) or private swim (25
minutes); training session for dogs while boarding, $15 for 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Availability: During the busy summer season, try to reserve at
least one week in advance; two weeks is advisable. Booked for the
Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When you first pull up to this place you'll think you've entered
a resort. And you have _ one specifically geared to dogs, although
cats and even birds are more than welcome. Situated on 13 wooded
acres, Pet Lodge offers amenities that go way beyond simply
boarding pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't warehouse dogs here, we're a pet resort,'' says owner
Ken Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Pet Lodge's canine guests get one-on-one attention as they fill
their days with 30-minute walks on trails in the wooded areas of
the resort, playtimes in groups or with an employee, swim times and
even a workout with a tennis ball machine.
</P>
<P>
   All aspects of a pet's stay at Pet Lodge are closely monitored.
Two or three employees are at the pool with the dogs _ more often
than not they're in the pool. Dogs are taken individually on walks.
</P>
<P>
   The facility, which can accommodate up to 400 pets, is
undergoing some renovations to make it even more luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting in some suites that will have furniture and a
television,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of swank living doesn't come cheap. Expect to pay
about $60 a night for the 15-by-20-foot room.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't dish out that kind of money, your pet stays in
air-conditioned comfort, with the addition of skylights and music
for $17 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Not all pets come here for the night. Lloyd and Elizabeth Smith
bring Ben, their golden retriever who was rescued from a local
animal shelter, for day care when they're away from home for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been taking him there for about a year,'' says Lloyd
Smith. ``He loves it and plays with Sailor, another retriever. He
gets playtime and goes swimming. It's a treat for him.''

</P>
<P>
   Owner: Clay Harbin
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Basic package costs $15.50 per night per dog, $16.50 on
weekends for an indoor/outdoor 15-by-5-foot, climate-controlled

<P>
   Availability: During holiday period, Cloud 9 suggests booking up
to a month in advance; but a 24-hour notice is usually fine
otherwise. Limited openings for Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Cloud 9 consider their establishment a sort of
Disney World for pets. A psychedelic van parked out front _ the pet
taxi _ offers a bit of whimsy, as does the fire-engine-red utility
vehicle used to take canine guests on hayrides. Manager Amanda
Willis says hayrides are the most popular activity for dogs at the
resort.
</P>
<P>
   Two Lilliputian cottages, complete with front porches and white
picket fences, near the front of the main building offer your pups
a private space that includes access to an outdoor run. The price
for these canine getaways: a hefty $80 per night on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Cottage packages include nature walks, personal companions and
play outings. There's also the Caribbean Suite with tile flooring,
a fireplace and television for $65 a night during the week. Regular
no-frills boarding rates run about $16 per dog, and activities are
additional.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and if you want to see how your pet enjoyed his vacation,
Cloud 9 can capture it on video.

   BARKING HOUND VILLAGE
</P>
<P>
   1918 Cheshire Bridge Road N.E., Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   404-897-3422
</P>
<P>
   Owners: David York and John Hogg
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Basic overnight boarding ranges from $20 to $30 per dog
depending on size and includes four outdoor play times and meals.
All boarding is inside.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities: Doggie gymnasium, includes a treadmill, $6 for 30
minutes and $10 for one hour; drop-off dog sitting, $4 per hour;
day care 8 a.m.-6 p.m., $14 per day; private party room, $15 per
hour; personalized cakes $10-$28.
</P>
<P>
   Availability: Booked until early August. Generally accepts pets
whenever openings permit, but they suggest you call a few days in
advance if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from personalized layer cakes to doggie gyms are
provided at this new upscale canine haven. In fact, co-owner David
York is happy to oblige most any indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a client who boarded her dog with us for four days,''
he says, ``and requested that each day we drive the dog to Burger
King for a Whopper.''
</P>
<P>
   Another client called to say that she would be bringing a
television set and a favorite piece of furniture for her dog when
she drops it off for boarding.
</P>
<P>
   But it's all in a day's work for York, a former restaurateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated all the concrete runs I saw in kennels,'' says York.
His constant companion, a coddled black and white mop top named
Sophie, was bleeding and near death on a Nashville street when he
rescued her seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   York and his partner, John Hogg, have created a little canine
oasis on Cheshire Bridge Road _ the kind of place where they would
feel comfortable leaving their own pets.
</P>
<P>
   The interior looks more like a spacious house than a boarding
facility. Kennel areas, in open view of the retail section, boast
walls painted in soft butter yellow, a few pieces of antique
furniture and wall hangings that add a homey touch.
</P>
<P>
   Along with overnight boarding and day care, Barking Hound
Village offers hourly drop-off dog sitting, obedience training, a
private party room for dogs and their owners and a self-serve dog
wash. And soon Internet service will be available. Cameras will
allow those with access to the Internet to keep a cyber eye on
their dog during its stay at Barking Hound.
</P>
<P>
   ``These aren't just pets, these are people's families,'' Hogg
says of their canine charges.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Charmatz is happy to pay for such doting attention. The
34-year old computer software tech lives in a Midtown condo with
Joey, a year-old yellow Lab and 6-month-old Sasha, a chow-mix she
found at the humane society. Each morning during the week she drops
the pair _ ``my kids,'' she calls them _ off for the day.
</P>
<P>
   She says she used to spend more than an hour at Piedmont Park
with them in the morning and one or two hours when she got home
from work. Still, she felt they were bored spending eight hours in
the apartment by themselves.

   ``Then I saw the day care sign one day when I drove by Barking
Hound and I thought it was a great idea,'' she says. ``My dogs have
a great time. I pay $80-$100 a week for both dogs. It's worth every

IN A GLASS BOX, SECRETS ARE HARD TO KEEP

 (ATTN: Ill.)  (mk)

<P>
   CHICAGO _ How could a structure as transparent as the Farnsworth
House hold a secret?
</P>
<P>
   Yet there it was, on the caption of an old blueprint that had
sat untouched in my father's library in Chicago over the decades
since his death _ ``Bld'g: Dr. E.B. Farnsworth Residence/Location:
Plano, Illinois/Architect: Wm. Dunlap.''
</P>
<P>
   William E. Dunlap? Architect of the iconic Farnsworth House?
</P>
<P>
   What about Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, that towering figure from
the Bauhaus whose disciples remade Chicago at midcentury? Wasn't it
Mies who designed this sublime archetype of the International
Style, this crystalline wafer of space framed by two horizontal
planes, stripped of ornament, serenely afloat, its every line
apparently dictated by pure reason?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But he did not account for the mosquitoes. They were left
for my father.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edith Farnsworth, an internist, commissioned Mies to design
a weekend retreat 60 miles southwest of Chicago, on the Fox River.
As the house neared completion in 1951, they had a bitter falling
out.
</P>
<P>
   The secret I had never known _ and this, after 20 years of
covering architectural landmarks _ was that as a result of that
fight, my father put the final touch on one of the most famous
buildings of the 20th century. This was not a story he told me,
perhaps because it involved a deception on his part. Rather, I
learned of it by finding blueprints of his design for a 9
1/2-foot-high, bronze-and-steel screening system, with elegantly
pivoting doors, that once enclosed the deck of the house.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing of my father's role, I see the house differently now. In
fact, I can almost hear the house, or rather the effervescent
voices of my parents visiting the place as a young couple. Around
them, I imagine America hitting its stride as the darkness of war
and Depression subside: Buildings sparkle with a newfound openness
and clarity; Mies, who has made Chicago his home, is the leading
architect of this transformation, and my parents are luckily,
happily, in his orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the austerity of the Farnsworth House, I can now see its
``aura of high romance,'' to borrow the words of Lord Palumbo, a
London real estate developer, who bought the house in 1972 and
opened it to the public two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I see something else: No amount of architectural refinement can
disguise the building's quirks, its frailties, its very human
provenance _ ``my Mies-conception,'' Dr. Farnsworth called it in
her unpublished memoirs _ all of which go into making it that much
more resonant.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with the fact that its floor slab hovers five feet above
ground, held in the air by eight wide-flange steel piers, as if on
stilts. The practical point of this extravagant esthetic gesture
was to protect the house from flooding.
</P>
<P>
   But though Mies researched previous flood levels, he
miscalculated badly. The house has been inundated several times;
catastrophically in 1996, when the river reached a height of 4 feet
10 inches inside the house, shattering window walls, scattering
artwork and badly damaging the central core, within which are
concealed two bathrooms and the mechanical systems.
</P>
<P>
   Another Fox River phenomenon that Mies underestimated was the
mosquitoes. Even today, they are fierce enough to be a source of
constant complaint in the guest register.
</P>
<P>
   In Mies' design, the only way to circulate air through a house
whose walls were made of solid glass was to open two small windows
at one end and the front door at the other. Without screens around
the deck, this was an invitation to bugs.
</P>
<P>
   One summer was all that Dr. Farnsworth could take.
</P>
<P>
   There was no going to Mies for help, however. In 1951, he sued
her, claiming she owed him money. She countersued, claiming she had
been overcharged. The house cost more than $70,000, or about
$450,000 today, allowing for inflation. While that is a lot of
money, something deeper must have accounted for their animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is simplistic to say that Dr. Farnsworth wanted the
house and Mies, and Mies wanted the house and the next client, such
a summation comes as close to the heart of the matter as any
other,'' the architectural historian Franz Schulze wrote in a
history and guide to the house.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, in their mid-20s when the house was built, were
somewhere in the middle. My father had studied and taught under
Mies at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. My mother,
Beth, was a patient of Dr. Farnsworth's. They socialized with her
at parties and jazz clubs. They visited the house in Plano during
construction. And as it neared completion, they stayed overnight.
</P>
<P>
   They did not exactly sleep there, however, since they were kept
awake all night while Dr. Farnsworth's poodles, in an amorous mood,
chased around the central core as if they were on a travertine dog
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't that cute?'' Dr. Farnsworth said, when my mother told
her of the disturbance the next morning. While the two women
talked, just before the architectural historian Henry Russell
Hitchcock arrived for a visit, my father recorded the scene with
his Kodak Vigilant 620 camera.
</P>
<P>
   He caught a moment of weekend-in-the-country informality
wonderfully at odds with the house's formalism: My mother is in
pajamas, Dr. Farnsworth in slacks; they lounge on the cantilevered
front steps, with cups of coffee and poodles nearby.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, Dr. Farnsworth asked my mother, ``Do you
think Bill would design the screens?''
</P>
<P>
   My father was then drafting part time at $1 an hour, supported
by my mother's income as a fashion illustrator for Women's Wear
Daily. Learning of the prospect, he said, ``I'm going to call Mies
and tell him there's a way to finish the screens without going to
someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to Dr. Farnsworth, my father then shared his drawings
with Mies, to be certain they met with the master's approval. At
least once, Mies was reviewing blueprints in my parents' apartment
just before the client arrived to do the same thing _ requiring
some logistical dexterity to prevent a collision between the two
warring parties in the alleyway.
</P>
<P>
   The screens were installed in April 1952, three weeks before I
was born.
</P>
<P>
   Then the battle between Mies and Dr. Farnsworth played out in
court. It appeared that my father's photographs might be called
into evidence. Sending the negatives to Mies' office, he wrote,
``Beth and I personally have no quarrel with Edith and we'd prefer
if possible that you don't use any of the shots with Beth in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Please return when the smoke clears,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke did not clear, however. After Dr. Farnsworth learned
that my father had collaborated with Mies, she never spoke to him
again. And my father, who joined the firm of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, did not speak to me or my brother of his work at the
Farnsworth House. He was the partner in charge of Sears Tower at
the time of his death in 1973, so there were truly bigger things to
talk about.
</P>
<P>
   Mies died in 1969 and Dr. Farnsworth in 1977, having sold the
house to Palumbo. One of the first things he did was install an
unobtrusive air-conditioning system and remove the screens. ``While
they had a practical value in terms of mosquitoes, they interrupted
the flow of space and closed in an area that was intended to be
kept open,'' he explained in a telephone conversation from London.
</P>
<P>
   After the disastrous flood of 1996 and a lesser one in 1997,
Palumbo restored the house, working with the architect Dirk Lohan,
who is Mies' grandson. The central core was rebuilt, and its blond
primavera wood panels were replaced.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in 1997 that I happened to be rooting through papers
in the Chicago apartment where my family has lived for 40 years.
That was when I found 20 Farnsworth blueprints, some with my
father's name, others bearing Mies' architectural stamp. I found
tracing-paper sketches, correspondence with the metal fabricator,
60 photos and a handwritten budget: $4,566.75, including $389.25
for the struggling young architect. My mother filled in the story.
</P>
<P>
   I found no trace of my father's work when I visited the
Farnsworth House recently for the first time. But I saw abundant
evidence that the Palumbos use the place when they are in town.
Sculptures come and go. An antique maple rocking chair sits
exotically among the svelte Mies furnishings. Wine bottles fill the
stainless-steel kitchen counter. A black Trimline telephone rests
on the bedside shelf. Family pictures line the bathroom walls.
Neckties are draped decorously inside the teak wardrobe. (Pardon
the intrusion, milord.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an intrusion,'' he reassured me, ``because it shows
the human side of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   He used to keep house more ascetically, Palumbo said, but that
created a problem. ``It was becoming a shrine,'' he said. ``It was
beginning to take itself too seriously. I thought it needed
livening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from comments in the guest book, the bric-a-brac is
second only to the mosquitoes as a source of annoyance. ``It is
overcluttered _ I accept that,'' Palumbo said. ``But from a human
dimension, if you want to get the flavor _ for better or worse _ of
the people who own it, there have to be things around.''
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I delight in signs that the place is inhabited, that
it is not frozen as a museum but rather breathes with the needs and
whims of its owners. After all, Mies designed a monument, but my
father first made it possible to live in.
</P>
<P>
   (The Farnsworth House is at 14520 River Rd. in Plano, Ill.,
about a 90- minute drive from Chicago. Hours: Thursday through
Tuesday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; closed on Wednesday. Admission: $15,
including a tour of the grounds, which were landscaped by Lanning
Roper. There are sculptures by Harry Bertoia, Anthony Caro, Andy
Goldsworthy, Ellsworth Kelly, Wendy Taylor and others. Telephone:

FEW TEARS ARE SHED OVER DEMISE OF DIVX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Circuit City announced the death of Divx last week, many
people in the consumer electronics industry cheered because Divx, a
hybrid DVD, may have been the most reviled new product in the
modern history of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of consumers, and the leaders of more than a dozen
companies championing the acceptance of the conventional, or
``open,'' DVD format, fulminated for years over their fears that
Divx would confuse consumers who shy away from format wars and slow
the acceptance of DVD. Paradoxically, however, Divx actually
hastened the acceptance of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Divx was a pay-per-view DVD format jointly owned by Circuit City
and a Los Angeles law firm. They licensed production of the players
to several companies.
</P>
<P>
   A consumer who bought a Divx-equipped DVD player could buy a
Divx movie for $4.50 and play it once. Playing it again would incur
another $3.25 charge. The most-touted advantage was that the buyer
didn't need to return the movie to the video store. So there would
be no need for late-night trips to the drop-off box and no late
fees.
</P>
<P>
   A conventional DVD that can be played endlessly sells for $15 to
$30. But such DVDs can also be rented in thousands of video rental
stores for about $3 each.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that Divx would spawn a format war and slow the
acceptance of open DVD, competing companies, led by Warner Home
Video, opened a fierce marketing campaign for DVD a year ago _ just
as the first Divx players went on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster and other video-rental chains were persuaded to
begin renting DVDs, even though only a few hundred thousand DVD
players were in consumers' homes at that point. And the major
manufacturers of DVD players, including Toshiba and Sony, began
giving away five DVDs with every player sold.
</P>
<P>
   Those and other promotions spurred sales of open DVD so that by
the beginning of 1999, more than 1 million players had been sold,
one of the most successful product introductions in the industry's
history.
</P>
<P>
   That success helped hasten the demise of Divx. Hollywood studios
and retailers signed on with DVD and gave little support to Divx.
``Despite the significant consumer enthusiasm, we cannot create a
viable business without support in these essential areas,'' said
Circuit City chief executive Richard Sharp in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   As Circuit City acknowledged the demise of Divx, the company
also announced a generous program of rebates and refunds for the
roughly 150,000 people who have bought Divx players. The company
probably realized that any consumer willing to pay $400 for a
speculative new product like a Divx player is likely to be a
coveted early adopter of other new technologies that Circuit City
might sell.
</P>
<P>
   So Circuit City is offering every one of those buyers a $100
rebate. That is the difference in price between a Divx player and a
conventional DVD player. Every Divx player can also play
conventional DVDs, so by Circuit City's analysis, the consumers
come out even.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who paid the small fee to convert a pay-per-view Divx
disk to one that can be played repeatedly is also entitled to get a
refund of that fee. Consumers can pick up rebate forms at any
Circuit City store, or on the Web at  &UR; www.divx.com &LR; . Circuit City
is also selling all remaining Divx players and disks at heavily
discounted prices.
</P>
<P>
   Divx disks cannot be played unless the company's central
computer authorizes it. Circuit City will keep the system
operational until June 30, 2001. After that, Divx disks will be
worthless.  &QL;

COLUMN: NATIONAL LAWN CARE NOW! 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (For release Friday, June 25)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a staff meeting the other day, it was suggested that we do a
story about how, in the summer, the grass grows so quickly that it
needs to be mowed two or more times a week.
</P>
<P>
   At first I just dismissed the idea as yet another example of the
woeful decline in American journalism, but the more I thought about
it, the angrier I became.
</P>
<P>
   Why should we _ or more specifically, I _ have to cut the grass
at all, let alone two or more times a week? The simple answer, of
course, is: Because you're too broke/cheap to hire a lawn service
to do the work for you. But why spend all that money? Aren't I, as
a taxpaying citizen, entitled to a nice, green, weed-free lawn?
Isn't there something, somewhere in the Constitution that
guarantees free lawn care to all Americans? Shouldn't, in other
words, the government cut my grass?
</P>
<P>
   Is this the king of all crazy notions? No, that would be tobacco
subsidies. Nationalized lawn care is actually an idea that's been
bandied about for some time, though it's possible you never heard
or read anything about it due to the fact that most of your major
media outlets are in the pocket of BiLCC (Big Lawn Care Companies).
</P>
<P>
   It all began on April 1, 1995, when Jeff Lindsay, an American
citizen and lawn owner, founded National Lawn Care Now!, a
``grassroots organization working for an equitable program of
nationalized lawn care in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The seed of the idea, so to speak, was planted while Lindsay was
driving around Atlanta. He noticed that the homes of poor people
often had small, weedy, unattractive lawns and that the people on
those lawns seemed tired and depressed. The only decorations he saw
were a few junked cars on cinder blocks, ``devoid of hope and
engines.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a mile away, in a wealthy area, he saw big, green, plush
lawns, lawns that were being used for parties attended by happy,
carefree people with functional cars. And then, like a 20-pound bag
of 10-10-10 fertilizer dropped on his head, it hit him: The quality
of one's life is directly linked to the quality of one's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Poor slobs who are shackled to a crummy lawn are likely to be
shunned socially, or be the victims of persecution by neighbors who
worry about lowered property values. Ultimately, they will be
denied access to jobs, education and even health care. Even worse,
their lowered self-esteem will eventually extinguish all hope and
leave them no choice but to turn to a life of crime or politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the founder: ``As the significance of lawns sank
into my thirsty soul like a Grand Epiphany, the stark truth almost
mowed me over: Rich people have better lawns because they can
afford them, while poor people don't. In fact, not only do the poor
have inadequate access to lawn care, many don't even have lawns at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free-market system has failed to provide a just and
equitable distribution of lawns and lawn care, and with it we find
an unjust, inequitable distribution of self-esteem, perhaps the
most vital resource of all.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, especially if you've been drinking heavily, you
may be saying to yourself: Wow! Nationalized lawn care is a great
idea and clearly long overdue. Who could possibly be opposed to it?
</P>
<P>
   Big Lawn Care Companies, that's who. As special interest groups
go, BiLCC makes the NRA look shy and disorganized. Its
representatives have infiltrated all levels of government, all the
way up to the White House Lawn itself
</P>
<P>
   (Lindsay blames this on Reagan/Bush and the 12 Years of Hate and
Greed but I am more inclined to blame it on Jimmy Carter and the
Four Years of Lusting in the Heart.)
</P>
<P>
   Because it is rolling in green, so to speak, and stands to lose
so much, Big Lawn Care has resisted and will continue to resist all
efforts to reform our nation's lawn care policy, such as it is.
</P>
<P>
   We must not weaken. Even as we stand, sweating, on our lawns
this summer, listening to the eerie subterranean harmonies of
growing grass and mole-cricket munching, we must not waver. Even as
we pull a groin muscle yanking on the cord of the Toro, we must
stand firm, even if it's only on one leg. Even as the unchallenged
foliage threatens to lift our house into the sky like Jack's
beanstalk, we must not show fear.
</P>
<P>
   Say no to Big Lawn Care.
</P>
<P>
   Say yes to National Lawn Care. Now!

HIGH TESTOSTERONE: GOOD _ AND BAD _ FOR MEN'S HEALTH

   Testosterone is a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   Extra testosterone protects men against high blood pressure,
heart attacks, frequent colds and obesity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, men with higher testosterone levels are more likely
to rate their health as excellent or good, says Dr. Alan Booth,
professor of sociology and human development at Pennsylvania State
University.
</P>
<P>
   But higher levels of testosterone also put men at greater risk
for smoking, drinking excessively and engaging in dangerous
activities that lead to injuries, Booth found in a study assessing
the military health records of 4,393 men.
</P>
<P>
   He found that those with slightly higher than average
testosterone levels were 45 percent less likely to have high blood
pressure, 72 percent less likely to have experienced a heart
attack, 8 percent less likely to have three or more colds a year,
and 45 percent less likely to rate their own health as only fair or
poor.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, men with more testosterone were 25 percent
more likely to report one or more serious injuries, 32 percent more
likely to imbibe five or more drinks in a single day and 151
percent more likely to smoke.

DESIGN NOTEBOOK: IDYLLIC VIEWS IN SACRAMENTO, WITH PAVILION AND
POND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANCES ANDERTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ What could be more pleasant than relaxing
in a sleek, glass-walled pavilion with views onto a rural backdrop
of pond and meandering river, where the only disturbance is the
croaking of frogs and the quacking of ducks? That picturesque
conceit has been realized in this unlikely city, the politically
active but architecturally dull state capital of California.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the homeowners, a businessman and his art-collecting wife,
commissioned a contemporary house extension _ studio, gallery,
office and living room _ that cantilevers over an artificial but
pastoral pond on the banks of the Sacramento River.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by the architect Mark Dziewulski, with the garden and
pond by Haag Landscape Architecture, the clean, simple-looking
marriage of water, concrete and glass was a complicated undertaking
that belies the extension's setting. Tucked away behind hedges,
bushes and trees are suburban backyards and bungalows.
</P>
<P>
   The client's wife, who grew up in Hawaii, has long loved water
and tropical plants. In the 1970s, the couple bought a house in a
residential neighborhood on the banks of the meandering Sacramento
River, the city's natural preserve. They commissioned Ed Haag, a
landscape architect, to build a coy pond in the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the couple bought a neighboring parcel and began
planning a large garden that, Haag said, would extend into water.
Thus was born the idea of creating another, bigger pond. But the
existing house _ a mid-'60s ranch house with three wings flanking a
courtyard that opened onto the river _ had no view onto the new
parcel. Dziewulski presented two schemes, one an extension in the
style of the existing house, the other much more striking _ an open
pavilion shooting out from the house and up from the pond, over the
water and toward the river.
</P>
<P>
   The clients took the plunge and went with the second option,
giving the architect the latitude to create a modern sculptural
form. They were captivated, the wife said, by its ``wow factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In the manner of buildings from the Rietveld House to Le
Corbusier's chapel at Ronchamp that feature interlocking vertical
and horizontal planes, Dziewulski's design consists of seemingly
discreet elements _ the soaring roof, the west wall with irregular
fenestration, the south- and east-facing wall of glass _
interconnected by what he calls the proscenium arch of supporting
concrete piers and a steel I-beam.
</P>
<P>
   It looks effortless but, as Dziewulski said, ``making things
look simple is so hard.'' Building the pavilion ``was as complex as
building the space shuttle.'' The steel-framed roof, made of stucco
for maximum lightness, does not just stretch upward, but also
widens and curves as it extends over the water. And it tapers near
the tip to appear lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the 1,200-square-foot extension blends with the
existing, 10,000-square-foot house. Sand-colored limestone flooring
flows from the old to the new space. And the new roof swoops up
from the downward slope of the house's Cliff May-style wide-pitched
roof. Dziewulski said, ``There are just enough elements like the
big overhang of the sweeping ranch-style roofs'' _ echoed in the
soaring pavilion roof _ ``to make the visual connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing east toward the river, the glass wall is folded into
louvers of translucent and clear glass panels, allowing a clear
view of the river while providing a backdrop for contemporary, New
Guinea and African sculptures. Panes had to be delicately inserted
into stainless steel channels that would allow for movement due to
wind loads, heating and cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Such a feat of construction involved coordination with the glass
manufacturer, contractor and structural engineer, Dziewulski said.
Intense cooperation between the architect and the landscape
architect was also key to the integration of the pond and pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   A whopping 6,000 square feet, and eight feet deep in parts, the
pond was built like a swimming pool with 6-inch thick Gunite walls.
To meet stringent codes, the footings for the studio were built
first, then the pond shell was poured. To clean the pond, which
laps innocently at the soft edges of the surrounding garden,
requires a concealed pump that recycles water 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The project was unusual because of the generous proportions of
the garden and pond, which fill an entire lot. These days, Haag
said, gardens are getting smaller and buildings are getting larger.
Most gardens, he added, are not as lavish as this one, which is a
veritable Monet's garden with lilies, irises, lotuses, and plump
goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   Ponds, Haag said, are costly to maintain, use a lot water and
have no function. Aside from cooling the air, they simply provide
delight. This pond is in fact shamelessly, hedonistically,
contemplative.
</P>
<P>
   But what delight! At night, frogs burst into song; ducks and
deer have wandered from the river; blue herons have homed in and,
true to their natures, tried to stab the goldfish. Moreover, the
water dapples the inside of the pavilion and mirrors the lights of
the building. The landscaping in and around the pond offers color
and texture for every season. In spring, a Western redbud tree in
full bloom offers a lush and vivid cerise contrast to the stark
gray-green limestone of the pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Dziewulski's clients were so delighted with their extension they
have virtually moved into it. They entertain, watch television and
eat dinner there. The wife, who is active in the arts community,
also works there at a desk that extends into the middle of the room
from a wall of neatly crafted shelves, drawers and filing cabinets.
The extension beckons with light and views and tranquillity, so
much so that the original house now feels like the add-on.
</P>
<P>
   Dziewulski trained at Cambridge University and has worked for
Michael Graves, for the corporate modernists Skidmore Owings and
Merrill and the English firm Ahrends, Burton and Koralek. Three of
his recent projects _ this pavilion, a Virgin Megastore in this
city and Davis Commons, a nearby retail center _ won American
Institute of Architecture awards last year.
</P>
<P>
   In this pavilion, Dziewulski wanted to build an exuberant jewel
in the landscape, a radical, architectonic form in contrast to its
pastoral setting. While some see the spirit of dynamic '50s
modernism (in the manner of Le Corbusier or Oscar Niemeyer) in his
pavilion, he is not a diehard modernist. The seeming simplicity of
the style suited this project, he said, but each commission demands
something different. ``Each one makes you reinvent yourself,'' he
said.

<P>
   Do you ever find yourself wading through dozens of claims of
baldness cures and offers to ``Make Money Fast at Home!!!'' while
looking for e-mail in your In box from people you actually know? Is
there any way to fight back against these unwanted spammers, who
often hide behind hard-to-trace or false addresses?
</P>
<P>
   Please meet the Spam Cop. Created by Julian Haight, a
27-year-old computer consultant in Seattle, Spam Cop (spamcop.net)
is a Web site that lets you track spam _ unsolicited junk e-mail
sent out in bulk _ back to its source and then complain about it to
the proper authorities.
</P>
<P>
   After providing the site with a return e-mail address, you
simply paste a junk e-mail message you have received into a form on
the site and click on a button. Spam Cop dissects the message's
header field to find out where it came from. It then sends a copy
of the unwanted mail to the network administrator of the Internet
service provider the spammer is using, along with a crisply worded
letter of complaint from you about being spammed.
</P>
<P>
   Haight said that 127,744 such letters from users were sent from
the Spam Cop site last month alone. The site also contains a
discussion forum about spam, links to spam-fighting resources, a
list of known spammers and a well-written Frequently Asked
Questions section.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting spam on the Spam Cop site is free. But for $15, you
can sign up for a Spam Cop membership that will bring you a set of
e-mail filters that can weed out messages sent from known spammers
and an electronic newsletter with updates and information about
battling spam.
</P>
<P>
   The site may not prevent all spam but may help take a bite out
of it. Many Internet providers have a no-spam policy for
subscribers, and many will close accounts opened by bulk mailers if
they get complaints about spam coming from an address.
</P>
<P>
   Haight created the Spam Cop site after being told in an online
discussion that tracing e-mail back across the Internet to its
source couldn't be done. ``I was reading a newsgroup, the wish list
for Netscape, and I suggested that they put a button in the mail
client that will let you report spam,'' he recalled. ``I was
immediately shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   His detractors told him that e-mail couldn't be tracked
automatically because of the number of e-mail programs and other
variables involved. ``So immediately I thought, `That's not
true,''' Haight said. ``I've got to prove them wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to work on a program that used a number of networking
utilities for the Unix operating system (used by most e-mail
servers) to extract information about an e-mail header. He created
the first version of the site in just a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Spam Cop has been on the beat since September 1998, and Haight
said that the complaint letters had helped close many spammers'
e-mail accounts. ``A few of the spammers have called me themselves,
trying to get me to cease and desist my operation, so I know that
something is working,'' he said. ``They're feeling the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Haight, however, is standing firm against spammers who claim
that he's hurting their ability to do business. ``They like to
threaten,'' he said. ``All my subscribers are individual people who
decided to send e-mail, and I just facilitate that.''

OLD NEWSGROUPS IN NEW PACKAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Calif.)   (af)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ads are hard to miss. In one, a photograph of a crying
newborn is shown next to a debate about circumcision (``My advice:
do it before he has memory cells''). In another, a mustachioed
woman (``plucking hurts too much'') is told where she can find a
good place to have electrolysis.
</P>
<P>
   The eye-catching advertisements began appearing last month in
magazines and newspapers, and on billboards in New York and San
Francisco. They are selling Talkway, a commercial Web site
(www.talkway.com) that gathers, sorts and organizes messages sent
over Usenet, the sprawling collection of online discussion groups
that has been an integral part of the Internet for the last two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Talkway, though the most visible, is just one of several
entrepreneurial ventures to put a commercial wrapper around the
traditionally noncommercial Usenet and offer it through the Web.
</P>
<P>
   This repackaging of Usenet newsgroups is only one of the ways in
which the old, small-scale Internet has been transformed into the
new world of connectivity. But it is particularly illuminating
because Usenet is such a major part of Internet history.
</P>
<P>
   The repackaging makes Net old-timers cranky. But the executives
of start-ups like Talkway say they are introducing Usenet's
thousands of forums to millions of ordinary Web surfers, people who
might not use them otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet was conceived in 1979 by two graduate students whose idea
was to link computers to exchange information about the Unix
operating system. Usenet grew quickly, evolving into a particularly
untamed, free-flowing part of the Internet. For years, Usenet was
the electronic conduit that carried both news and views of world
events and scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet's 45,000 or so newsgroups touch on just about any topic
imaginable, and the name of each group suggests its interest:
alt.support.sleep-disorder; rec.audio.pro; alt.fan.gwyn-paltrow;
comp.sys.ibm.pc.software.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, Usenet was, like the Internet itself, a
self-selecting place. For most users, based at universities,
participating in discussions required at least a passing command of
Unix. By the early 1990s, Internet service providers, bulletin
board systems and community-based freenets had joined universities
in offering news readers, programs that enabled the reading and
collecting of messages. The number of users grew exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, when people with ``aol.com'' at the end of
their e-mail addresses started posting to Usenet, they were harshly
attacked and harassed by those with ``.edu'' at the end of theirs.
To the dismay of many of those in the latter camp, the Web made
Usenet even more easily accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Usenet is owned and regulated by no one, which makes it ripe for
the picking by commercial ventures. Companies like Talkway can
simply collect Usenet discussions, put them on a Web site and offer
them to the browsing public as instant communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are looking to aggregate an audience around
discussion and, at some point, turn that into revenue,'' said Anya
Sacharow, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, a market research
firm in New York. ``They're tapping into an existing base of people
already exchanging information.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been around Usenet for a long time say the
content is different from what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't seem to see as much in the way of long, carefully
written literary writing,'' said Ron Newman, a computer programmer
in Cambridge, Mass., who has been posting to Usenet since the
mid-1980s. ``I see a lot of things slapped off quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Newman pointed to the travel groups. ``It
used to be I'd see people posting long reports of the recent trips
they'd taken, describing in detail what they'd done day by day,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, such groups have turned into advice forums.
Indeed, a recent sampling of posts to rec.travel.europe showed a
preponderance of people looking for tips on car rentals and other
travel logistics. Newman said he now found the thoughtful,
discursive writing at places like Table Talk on Salon's Web site
(www.salon.com).
</P>
<P>
   Also, many of the newsgroups that have been popular among
scientists have grown too noisy for those who used to frequent
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's given up on sci.physics,'' said Scott Dorsey, a
computer system administrator who has been on Usenet since 1984.
``It used to consist of serious discussions among physicists; then
the U.F.O. people took it over.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Dorsey said, serious physicists moved their
discussion to sci.physics.research. ``Then the lunatics took it
over,'' he said. Now, like others wishing to carry on serious
discussions, the physicists have, for the most part, moved their
discussion to private mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a specialist trying to carry on a discussion, it's
hard to do that when people are popping up with totally irrelevant
information,'' Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, executives at Talkway and Remarq insist that Usenet
is growing. ``We've seen that the amount of space necessary to
store the messages has quadrupled over the past year,'' said Rich
Simoni, chief technology officer of Talkway. He said that the
number of Usenet users had grown in the last four years to about 25
million, an estimate that he conceded was ``nebulous at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lee, chief executive officer of Remarq (www.remarq.com),
which sells prepackaged Usenet discussions to Web portals like
Excite and Lycos, agreed with Simoni's general assessment. ``The
amount of Usenet traffic has grown tremendously over the last
year,'' Lee said
</P>
<P>
   But the number of Usenet users has not been systematically
tracked since 1995, when Brian Reid, then a computer scientist at
the Digital Equipment Corp., counted some 20 million around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, now a researcher at Bell Labs in Palo Alto, Calif., a unit
of Lucent Technologies, said: ``One of the reasons I stopped was
that the Web made the numbers plummet. I decided that whatever
Usenet did that was useful was being supplanted by the Web and I
saw no point in publishing further measurements.''
</P>
<P>
   To replace Unix-based news readers, which required knowing
commands like ``vi/.newsrc,'' Talkway, Remarq and Deja.com
(www.deja.com) use Web sites to offer an easy point-and-click
method of reading and posting messages. Usage is free (the sites
make money mostly by selling banner advertisements), and members
can customize the set of newsgroups they regularly read.
</P>
<P>
   To some old-timers, the commercialized flavor that these places
bring to Usenet is an affront to the public broadcasting
sensibility that reigned in an earlier era, when advertising on
Usenet was particularly taboo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in 1994, when two immigration lawyers in Arizona sent
9,000 newsgroups an advertisement for their services, the outcry
among Usenet users made national news. Today, of course, such
broadcasts, also known as spam, are part of the general Internet
milieu.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Talkway and Remarq, whose executives draw a
distinction between ads they have solicited and those they have
not, have installed spam filters to keep advertising pitches from
the outside from getting into the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The first Web site to see the money-making potential of Usenet
was Deja.com, formerly Dejanews. It started in 1995 as a relatively
unadorned site, a newsgroup archive with a simple search mechanism
that Usenet regulars loved. The site recently underwent a makeover
and its board fired one chief executive and recruited another, Tom
Phillips, an executive from Internet ventures of ABC and ESPN. The
company moved its headquarters to New York from Austin, Texas, and
changed its name.
</P>
<P>
   The new site, which bills itself as a ``consumer information
exchange,'' is a somewhat confusing collection of ads and forms for
rating products and services, links to shopping sites and flashing
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The Deja.com catchword is community, but the goal appears to be
directing attention to merchandise. Although Deja.com and its
for-profit brethren claim to make Usenet easier to use, their
cluttered sites are difficult to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Madere, Deja.com's founder and chief technology officer,
said the site was still evolving. ``We're trying to figure out how
to get everything to coexist on the page,'' Madere said.
</P>
<P>
   Deja.com's new interface sent its longstanding users into high
dudgeon. In anticipation of the reaction of this small but vocal
minority, the company offered the old interface as an option,
renaming it Deja Classic.
</P>
<P>
   None of the commercial ventures seems particularly eager to
promote Usenet as a brand. Talkway, Deja.com and Remarq make scant,
if any, mention of Usenet on their front pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usenet doesn't really mean a lot to people,'' said Carlos
Tribino, Talkway's vice president for marketing. ``We're really
focusing on opening the space to the entire Web audience. Some
people don't know what Usenet is, or those who do, think of it as a
difficult or intimidating environment, which is why I didn't see
any value in promoting Usenet per se.''
</P>
<P>
   To further distance itself from Usenet conventions, Talkway has
renamed the newsgroups. The group
misc.education.home-school.christian is now ``Christian
Education.'' (In deference to the conventional practice, Talkway
allows its visitors to choose a group's Usenet name.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be accommodating while at the same time not
intimidating new users with a naming scheme that isn't even based
on English,'' said Simoni of Talkway.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, it turns out that the dialogues in the catchy new
Talkway ads that are made to look like Usenet exchanges, are not
the real thing. They are the invention of Weiss Stagliano Partners,
Talkway's New York advertising firm. ``Actual posts inspired
them,'' Tribino said.
</P>
<P>
   The slick commercial backdrops are managing to attract people
who might not otherwise have ventured onto Usenet.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gerould, for instance, a marketing consultant in Palo Alto
who has done work for Remarq, recently searched high and low in
cyberspace for tips on creating a Hawaiian theme for her daughter's
birthday. One parenting group on iVillage suggested Hula-Hoops.
Somebody else recommended canned pineapples on a skewer. ``That's
the level of what I was coming up with,'' Ms. Gerould said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, using Remarq, she found a Usenet group devoted to
discussions of Hawaiian culture. From there, she got pointers to
obscure cottage Web sites off the radar of most search engines.
``Had I not encountered Remarq, I might have thought to post
something somewhere, but not Usenet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gerould ended up with a highly authentic party, complete
with hula instruction from a native Hawaiian.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, the Usenet of old shows its colors. Last year,
someone posted to alt.folklore.computers, lamenting the
disappearance of Bell Laboratories, long the famous research arm of
AT&AMP;T. A few hours later, a Bell Labs veteran, Dennis Ritchie, the
co-creator of Unix who is to the world of serious Unix hackers what
Chris Evert is to the two-fisted backhand, posted a message saying
he had pinched himself and found that both he and Bell Labs were
still alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it got down to a discussion of, is basic research
supported in the U.S.,'' said Ronda Hauben, co-author of
``Netizens: On the History and Impact of Usenet and the Internet,''
(IEEE Computer Society Press, 1997), who took part in the
discussion. Ms. Hauben said that such exchanges demonstrated to her
that Usenet was as vital as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become even more important,'' she said. ``It's the place
where people can discuss problems that develop and in a cooperative
way figure out what to do about the problems, either problems that
are on line, or in society in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some options for retrieving and posting to Usenet
newsgroups:
</P>
<P>
   I.S.P. ACCESS Most Internet service providers include Usenet
access as part of the service. Often that access comes as part of
the Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer Web browsers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FREEWARE PROGRAMS Another option is a news reader program for a
PC or Mac. One popular program, a piece of freeware for the PC, is
called Free Agent (www.forteinc.com/getfa/download.htm). For Macs,
try Yet Another News Watcher (www.macupdate.com/info/36052.html). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEWSGUY: www.newsguy.com This subscription service strikes a
happy medium. You'll have to pay, but you'll like what you get. For
$25 a year, you get the basic service, which includes access to
7,500 newsgroups. &QL;

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Copious amounts of rain will fall Thursday over portions of the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys as low pressure sweeps across the
region. Abundant moisture moving to the north from the Gulf of
Mexico will provide fuel for repeated heavy rains, with local flash
flooding possible. Further north, showers and thunderstorms will
erupt as a weakening cold front pushes through the Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered thunderstorms will develop over much of the western
Plains from Texas to South Dakota during the late afternoon. A
vigorous jet stream disturbance at 18,000 feet will ignite
thundershowers during the warmest part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the storms could approach severe limits, with damaging
winds being the greatest threat. Thunderstorms are also likely over
Florida, where the sea breeze will trigger thunderstorms in the
early afternoon near the Gulf Coast. These storms will move inland
as the day elapses.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will have another warm day with mostly sunny skies
as high pressure just off the New England coast provides mild and
more humid breezes from the south. A few puffy cumulus clouds and
some widely separated thunderstorms will develop in the mountains
of extreme northern New England during the afternoon and early
evening hours.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and showers will continue in the Pacific Northwest,
where temperatures will remain below normal, as they have been
throughout the spring and early summer. The Southwest will be sunny
and very hot, with readings easily reaching triple digit marks in
the deserts.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Summer Lag
</P>
<P>
   Daylight is beginning to shorten, but, the most intense heat of
summer typically accompanies the reduced daylight. Two effects
combine to cause the hottest weather to lag behind the sun. The
atmosphere is heated indirectly. Energy from the sun first heats
the surface of the earth which then warms the air above.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, 30 to 40 thousand feet aloft, the
lingering chill of the previous winter is still being erased.
Moreover, the ocean surface responds more slowly to the incoming
energy than does the land, further delaying the warming of the
atmosphere over the oceans.  &QL;

IN FRANCE, PARTING GLANCES AT A PLEASURE DOME

<P>
   As deathbed scenes go, the last gasp of Chateau de Groussay was
particularly lively. Helicopters landed and cars lumbered up the
drive over 10 days in late May and early June, disgorging princes
and potentates, designers and decorators in the posh suburban
village of Montfort-l'Amaury, 30 miles south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people arrived to see the splendors headed for
the block beneath a 3,000-square-foot tent on Groussay's verdant
lawn: Canova-style busts, Berlin porcelain, neo-Egyptian side
chairs, a dazzling oddment of 18th-century sketches and paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The bidding for the contents of the house was furious. And
satisfyingly lucrative. In a room upstairs, its owner, Juan de
Beistegui, watched the sale on closed-circuit television with all
the frenzied emotion of a sports fan watching his team pummel the
competition. Each time an object sold well above its estimate, de
Beistegui (pronounced bess-TEE-ghee) ``shrieked and cheered,'' said
a friend who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, 2,416 lots later, on June 6, the greatest private
interiors concocted in the 20th century disappeared, dispersed for
$26.5 million _ more than $10 million above the estimate of the
auctioneers, Sotheby's France and Poulain &AMP; Le Fur. (The contents
of the Neuilly villa of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor sold for
$23 million.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chateau de Groussay (pronounced groo-SAY) is now just a
neoclassical shell on the market for $10 million, its 37 rooms
bare, its soulful spaces a mere memory. Yet, its mystique is such
that many experts, even many bidders, felt it should have been
preserved as a museum dedicated to the lapidary taste of de
Beistegui's uncle, Carlos, an eccentric gadfly of taste who bought
the house in 1939 and spent more than three decades grooming its
rooms and grounds before his death, in 1970, at 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale was a major event in the history and sociology of the
decorative arts,'' said Paige Rense, the editor of Architectural
Digest, who led the last tour of the chateau before its rooms were
stripped. The recent Onassis and Windsor sales were circuses of
pure celebrity. But Ms. Rense added, ``Groussay was a mecca.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, when the profession of interior decoration was in
its youth and more concerned with freshness, modernity and
practical living, Groussay was an international anomaly. Built
around 1815 by a French duchess, remodeled later by a Russian
emigre and then revamped by Beistegui, heir to a fortune derived
from silver mines in Mexico, where his Basque ancestors immigrated
in the 18th century, the chateau was a study in contradiction. It
was a temple to luxury and peace created in the midst of
deprivation and war; an Anglo-Russian country house plunked down in
a Paris suburb; a bucolic retreat owned by a man who loathed the
outdoors, and crucially, an atomic-age celebration of
turn-of-the-century values.
</P>
<P>
   All the more shocking, then, to realize that Carlos de Beistegui
was that rare beast in today's degree-conscious design world: a
gifted amateur. He had no training in design, no real experience,
save an overweening interest in the decorative arts. What Beistegui
did possess were a passion for beauty, a matchless eye for balance
and visual drama and an understanding that, finally, great design
is more about sorcery than about whether a fabric will handle daily
wear and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Beistegui was not obsessed with lifeless replications. Instead,
he was a master of sensual decoration, concocting rooms that
recalled the scents, the sounds, the daydreams, the innocence of
his youth, suffused with memories of the English country houses
that he visited as a student at Eton and at Cambridge University.
</P>
<P>
   As a friend wrote after spending a long weekend at Groussay,
Beistegui's ``adolescence is something he has never been willing to
leave in the past.'' So the chateau ended up not only a benchmark
but also a brick-and-brocade twin to Proust's ``Remembrance of
Things Past.'' It was a house devoted to the persistence of memory
_ in some cases real, in others invented.
</P>
<P>
   Another collector would have stocked up solely on masterpieces,
but Beistegui was happy to achieve the effects he wanted through
sleight of hand and keen subterfuge. Though he ferreted out major
works, he understood that the overall effect of a room is more
important than the authenticity of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings from the world's great museums were openly copied and
thickly hung floor to ceiling in the dazzling two-story library,
the profusion causing the walls to positively pulsate with
animation. He commissioned Lucien Toulouse, a Paris cabinetmaker,
to reproduce a Louis XVI porcelain-enriched mahogany cabinet from
the royal Chateau de Fontainebleau. When a wing was added for a
private theater, Spanish weavers set to work churning out
tapestries after 18th-century cartoons by Goya. The giant Chinese
jars were either tin or plaster.
</P>
<P>
   English decorator David Hicks, who never admitted to liking much
of anything except his own work, bowed before Groussay's curiously
melancholy chic, its bracing yet comforting stew of English sofas,
South American colors and French luxury. Mark Hampton, the American
decorator, once called it the most beautiful house in the world,
marveling at its confidence. But what made Groussay more than a
rich man's temporary plaything was its subtle but ineradicable
impact on domestic designers in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   As Clive Aslet, the editor of the British magazine Country Life,
has written, Carlos de Beistegui was ``a creator of the scenery of
life.'' Designers lucky enough to enjoy his hospitality at
Groussay, the Palazzo Labia in Venice or his ancestral town house
in Paris returned home enchanted, modern Marco Polos telling tales
of outlandish glories. Just as enthusiastically, they brought his
lessons, his deliberate gestures, into their own work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why. While other midcentury traditionalists
espoused Williamsburg-style propriety, with polite pastels
reticently handled, Beistegui's palette swaggered: a pea-green
salon bordered with blue-and-white Delft tiles, a staircase lined
with russet paisley cashmere, a billiard-table-green sitting room
paved with wall-to-wall carpeting in searing sapphire blue.
</P>
<P>
   At Groussay, history was open to interpretation. The overall
impression was Anglo-Gallic, but the elements were cosmopolitan in
the extreme: Russian neoclassical chairs, wood beds carved to
resemble bamboo, Polish tables, Venetian mirrors, Art Deco
blackamoors of painted plaster, taxidermied fish under glass and a
plethora of antlers.
</P>
<P>
   When he tore down the plaster walls that encased the entrance
hall's double staircase to open the ceiling and expose the stairs'
wood skeleton, the results made most other staircases seem gutless
by comparison: the twin flights curve up to the mezzanine like a
giant polished ice tong.
</P>
<P>
   Though the improvements at Groussay were solidly grounded in
traditionalism, as a young man, Beistegui had a famous flirtation
with modernity. In the early 1930s, Le Corbusier built him a
penthouse on the Champs-Elysees, severe white rooms that the
willful heir furnished like a Surrealist bordello, with gilt and
mirrors and tomfoolery like an electronically operated hedge that
parted to reveal a view of the Arc de Triomphe.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, however, he retreated to his parents'
town house. What accounts for this volte-face is unknown. But when
Beistegui ventured out to buy a bachelor pad again, in 1938, he
bought an old house, historic but not landmarked, which meant he
could realize his fancies without the intrusion of
preservationists. And there he decided to immerse himself in
history, or at least, the reinterpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
   His esthetic streak remains a mystery. No one in his family _
the Beistegui clan settled in Paris in the 1880s _ was notably
creative, except his namesake uncle, a gentleman artist whose
collection of notable 18th- and 19th-century paintings ended up in
the Louvre.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Groussay's celebrated library _ Cecil Beaton's
black-and-white photograph of this striking space, with its
corkscrew staircases and shafts of sunlight raking the mezzanine,
remains perhaps the most breathtaking image of any interior taken
in this century _ Beistegui was no scholar. Many of his beautifully
bound books were reportedly bought by the yard. Still, Beaton said,
``He is versed in the knowledge of most works of art and on certain
aspects of history could be considered an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he entertained the odd outside commission _ salons in the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Madrid, a suite of rooms at the
Waldorf-Astoria in New York, and the library at the British Embassy
in Paris (with the designers Georges Geffroy and Emilio Terry) _
his talents were utilized almost entirely for his own pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, Beistegui conjured, inventing interiors like a
composer writing a symphony: sensitively shifting from forte to
pianissimo here, inserting a grace note there, dappling the score
with disparate allusions to other civilizations, other countries.
It was this talent for detail that kept people amazed.
</P>
<P>
   When public celebrity arrived on his doorstep in 1951, thanks to
an extravagant ball he gave at his Venetian palazzo, Beistegui
seemed genuinely perplexed by the attention. Soon he retreated from
view into a private, increasingly unbalanced realm of his own.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints that he would eventually become a recluse, even
if a series of strokes had not hurried the process along. Beistegui
was as much a mass of contradictions as his exquisite decors:
generous host but alarmingly self-absorbed, a social fixture but
largely friendless, amorous but unloving.
</P>
<P>
   A rat-faced child who swelled into Savile Row pomposity as he
grew older, Beistegui was obsessed with propriety, placement,
perfection. His manner was distant, his smile thin, his sexuality a
matter of trans-Atlantic speculation, despite energetic relations
with safely married women: those who knew him said their noble
titles intrigued him more than their physical charms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he assiduously cultivated the role of elegant and highly
discriminating satyr. Even his citizenship was a tangle: French
birth, Mexican parents, Spanish diplomatic passport.
</P>
<P>
   The last allowed Beistegui to weather the Nazi occupation as the
nominal representative of a neutral country. The contrived passport
also freed him to create a personal pleasure dome in the midst of
continental devastation. ``Beistegui is utterly ruthless,'' Beaton
complained to his diary after a visit to Groussay in 1944, where he
photographed its chatelain and a houseful of high-caliber guests.
``Such qualities as sympathy, pity or even gratitude are sadly
lacking. He has become the most self-engrossed and pleasure-seeking
person I have met.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-volume auction catalog is probably the ultimate memoir
of Carlos de Beistegui and his singular creation. It is the house,
not the man, that was probably the greatest loss to the world. The
chateau may have been merely a beautiful stage set, its
Victorian-Edwardian glamour utterly unrelated to everyday life. But
for some, the gutting of Groussay is likely to go down in history
as the decorative-arts equal of the razing of Pennsylvania Station:
the toppling of an artistic apex where majesty and magic
intersected.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wait your whole life to see something like Groussay, but
when you got there, there wasn't anything joyful about it,'' said
Mario Buatta, the New York decorator, who was among the last to see
the house intact. ``Doors were closing behind us and being locked.
It was like a funeral.''

LAWMAKERS LOOK FOR WAY TO PAY FOR MEDICARE DRUG COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators studying proposals to extend Medicare to
cover prescription drugs said Wednesday they like the idea but are
perplexed about how to pay for such an historic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to provide (drug coverage,) and I believe we will
eventually provide it,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, at a
meeting of the Senate Finance Committee. ``But we cannot afford any
more rich new benefits without raising taxes or without having more
of the federal budget consumed as we go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., said it was ``inhumane'' for Medicare
to not provide some drug coverage but asked, ``How do we pay for
this...benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Medicare is projected to go bankrupt in 2015 because
the number of people receiving Medicare benefits will rise sharply
as the baby boom generation begins retiring, the Clinton
administration and lawmakers of both political parties are pushing
to expand the program to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One committee member, Sen. John Breaux, D-La., doubted whether
another layer of benefits should be added to Medicare before the
program's long-term financial problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot even sustain the program today,'' said Breaux. ``If
we add prescription drugs, we have to reform the entire (Medicare)
program.''
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare health insurance program used by 39 million elderly
and disabled Americans does not cover the cost of prescription
drugs, though it does cover the cost of drugs while a person is
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton proposed the expansion during his State of the
Union speech in January and is expected to unveil a formal plan
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican lawmakers have endorsed the concept because
their own internal public opinion polls show older Americans like
the idea a lot. A poll conducted for the Republican National
Committee in April showed that 70 percent of older Americans would
vote for a Democrat if he or she favors Medicare prescription drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals to expand Medicare clash with recent trends in
Congress. In 1997, for example, Congress voted to cut Medicare
payments to health care providers by about $20 billion annually
through the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gluck, representing the non-partisan National Academy of
Social Insurance, said the costs of providing Medicare drug
coverage would range from about $18 billion to $24 billion annually
if Medicare beneficiaries also pay for a portion. Gluck's proposals
depended on how much a beneficiary would pay out of pocket, ranging
from a $200 to $500 annual deductible as well as a co-payment on
each drug.
</P>
<P>
   If the government were to pick up the entire tab of drug
coverage, it would cost about $45 billion annually _ or nearly
one-quarter of the estimated $200 billion cost of the entire
Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   No committee member advocated that option and they all endorsed
the idea that Medicare recipients should share the cost of drugs
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Dummitt, a health economics specialist at the General
Accounting Office, warned that the rising costs of prescription
drugs could cause Medicare drug coverage to be more expensive than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this is a benefit, there are no easy ways to control
costs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dummitt said prescription drug spending grew an average of 11
percent annually from 1992 to 1997 compared with a 5 percent growth
rate for overall health care spending during the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have some
prescription drug coverage through supplemental private insurance
plans _ at an out-of-pocket cost averaging about $100 a month _ or
through insurance offered by a former employer. In most cases
retirees also pay an annual deductible and a co-payment for
prescription drugs. The remaining 35 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries have no drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said one option is to provide coverage for low-income
Medicare beneficiaries who do not qualify for Medicaid, the federal
program that pays for health care for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux, who co-chaired a bipartisan commission that examined
solutions to Medicare's financial straits, made such a
recommendation as part of the panel's final report in March. The
plan would cost about $6 billion annually and would provide people
with incomes less than $11,000 a year with drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said Breaux's plan doesn't go far enough and is
expected to propose a much broader drug coverage package.

   NEW DELHI: A Warm Welcome, But It's All Relative
</P>
<P>
   By BARRY BEARAK
</P>
<P>
   New Delhi's summer weather is ``warm,'' according to the Web
site of the government of India Ministry of Tourism,
www.tourism &QC; inindia.com. ``Warm,'' of course, is a relative term.
Boiling water could be said to be warm. So, too, could a forest
fire, a spewing volcano and smelted iron. The summer temperature in
India's capital often hits 115, which, for me, is a bit hotter than
warm.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the government-related Web sites that include New Delhi
are short on reliable information and long on hyperbole. The
tourism ministry says the city offers ``an unceasing range of
activity, a million ways of saying, `You are welcome.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lonely Planet's Destination Delhi site,
www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/ind/del.htm, more accurately lets you
know what you're in for: ``You'll most likely notice the pollution,
the crowds, the smell, the noise and the ceaseless hassles before
you notice the city's charms.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonely Planet's site is no substitute for a thick guidebook, but
it does a good job of labeling most of the bare bones. India's
5,000-year history is rendered in four paragraphs. The more popular
sightseeing destinations rate about 100 words each and are
accompanied by photos and a small map.
</P>
<P>
   Fodor's site, www.fodors.com, contains a restaurant and hotel
guide, which Lonely Planet does not. Unlike many other listings,
Fodor is willing to go out on a limb and actually make food and
lodging recommendations. The site's authors have good taste; their
faults are mainly in what they omit rather than in what they
commend. For example, they focus on the high-end restaurants and
neglect very popular and less costly ones, like Nirula's.
</P>
<P>
   For the largest variety of links, the place to go is
www.indiaa2z.com. This is essentially a search engine that, when
you search ``Delhi,'' divides into categories like arts and
culture, business and economy, and news and media. It can take you
to some fairly arcane places, like the Amateur Astronomers
Association of Delhi. But it also contains some meat-and-potatoes
information (in India, the meat must be mutton, not beef), the best
of which is the Delhi City Guide, www.allindia.com/cities/delhi.
</P>
<P>
   While the Delhi City Guide also has a very abbreviated history
section, its listings of museums, galleries, markets and historical
sites are far more complete than most. The information (with
photos) about hotels and restaurants is quite reliable.

<P>
   CAPE TOWN: Pretty as a Picture, Though the Details Are Fuzzy
</P>
<P>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that if I could read German better (it's slipped away
since high school, and learning to read road signs in Afrikaans has
helped only a little), I would think the best Web site about Cape
Town was one produced in Germany, www.kapstadt.de/allgem.htm. It
seems remarkably thorough. For English-speakers, I'm afraid, the
choices are a bit frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that many South African Web sites seem to have a
fundamental weakness: they give nice write-ups to people who buy
ads. I could find several sites with beautiful pictures of the
city, beaches, botanical gardens, the Victoria and Alfred
Waterfront and the Cape of Good Hope, which Sir Francis Drake wrote
was ``the most stately thing, and the fairest cape we saw in the
whole circumference of the earth.'' I couldn't find any with the
kind of independently verified helpful list of restaurants and
hotels that a good guidebook has.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the prettiest and most comprehensive site was
www &QC; .nelsonsguides.co.za, which is produced by a Cape Town company
that publishes pocket guides handed out free in hotels. Its opening
picture of Table Mountain, which dominates the city even more
imposingly than skyscrapers dominate New York, is stunning.
Browsing its pretty picture gallery brought up links to other Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Cape Town has the largest aquarium in the Southern
Hemisphere, and there was a link to the Two Oceans Aquarium site.
Some choices were odd _ the picture of the three-hour scenic drive
around Cape Point is of a baboon by the road.
</P>
<P>
   The maps, reproduced from the pocket guide, are detailed. Its
pages of local history go well back and put Cape Town in its
context as part of South Africa's bloody past. But the
accommodation and restaurant pages are woefully skimpy _
presumably, only those that paid to be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, www.doorway.co.za, can be slow to respond but has
the best-known restaurants and hotels. Its listings are free, but
limited to a few mostly saccharine words chosen by the lister.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent site for South Africa in general is the one
maintained by Lonely Planet guides which puts out what I think is
the best guide to the country. This site, www.lonelyplanet.com, has
a section on Cape Town and has links to a forum (Traveler's
Reports) where travelers _ mostly backpackers _ send their latest
advice about places to stay, things to do and dangers to avoid. It
doesn't give details about hotels and restaurants. For that, you
have to buy the book.

   Sifting through the many Web sites that offer tourists
information about foreign cities can be fascinating or frustrating.
How can first-time, English-speaking travelers planning a trip to
Tokyo, for instance, know if a Web site is steering them in the
right direction?

   Eight New York Times correspondents offer their views of
selected Web sites for cities they know well: Rio de Janeiro,
Tokyo, London, Paris, New Delhi, Cape Town, Vancouver and Sydney.

   RIO DE JANEIRO: The Site From Ipanema, And Lots of Carioca
Spirit
</P>
<P>
   By LARRY ROHTER
</P>
<P>
   As befits a city that ranks as one of the most beautiful and
fascinating in the world, Rio de Janeiro is the focus of numerous
Web sites in English, more than I anticipated. Many are of high
quality in terms of text and visual content, with sharp graphics
and even snatches of the music that defines Rio. Three sites in
particular stand out, each for a different reason.
</P>
<P>
   I found that the Brazilian Incentive and Tourism home page at
www.bitourism.com, for instance, contained the most detailed
information on hotels, offering small but clear photos of the
exteriors and interiors of the city's main hotels, as well as
information about their services and amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The Excite City Guide, citynet.excite.com, was useful mostly
because of its links to the Fodor's hotel and restaurant indexes
(which make judgments that I didn't always agree with).
</P>
<P>
   But probably the most entertaining site is that at
www.ipanema.com. Somehow it manages to be funny and cheeky while
also being comprehensive: there is a ``Rio Gay Guide,'' ``Rio for
Beginners'' and a section called ``Dogs From Ipanema,'' which
offers a walking tour. The site also has pictures of the city's
most famous neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites with fancy graphics and interesting concepts
seemed sloppy on content, however. Looking at a site devoted to
Rio's golf courses at www.activelifestyle.com/gt/riogolf.html, I
was distracted by the consistent misspelling of the city's name. If
they can't get that right, I wondered, what does that say about the
reliability of the rest of the information?
</P>
<P>
   It was much easier to forgive deficiencies in the homemade Web
sites created by Rio residents. Even though the spelling and
grammar may occasionally be wobbly, a passion for the city shines
through and there are plenty of tips about restaurants, nightclubs
and other amusements.
</P>
<P>
   In this category, I found the sites at www.riowithlove.com and
www.123-rio.com to be especially useful and imbued with Carioca
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   One last recommendation: if you're thinking of going to Rio at
Carnival time, or even if you're not, it's worth paying a visit to
the Rio de Janeiro Samba Home Page, at love-rio.com/samba. Here you
will find a thorough history of Carnival and a guide to the samba
schools that compete for honors in the parade that is the highlight
of the annual bacchanal.
</P>
<P>
   The photographs of dancers and musicians in their extravagant
but skimpy costumes were taken at this February's contest and are
stunning.

   TOKYO: An Internet Miracle: A $21 Hotel Room
</P>
<P>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
</P>
<P>
   A hotel room in Tokyo for $21? It seems incredible, but the
Hotel New Koyo charges just 2,500 yen for its smallest single
rooms, including service charge and tax. In a city where a fine
melon can cost more than $100, that is an extraordinary find, and I
turned it up through a Web site called Planet Tokyo at
www.pandemic.com/tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Information about Tokyo abounds on the Internet, but Planet
Tokyo is perhaps the best Web site for visitors. It offers a range
of information about restaurants and hotels _ the $300-a-night
variety and the $21 kind _ as well as temples and shrines and even
the Japanese language. The information is mostly timely and
accurate and ranges from the serious to the whimsical: this is the
only Web site I know of that tutors people in expressions like
``mapputatsuni hiki sakuwayo,'' which means ``I will tear you in
half.''
</P>
<P>
   Planet Tokyo has separate sections for restaurants, hotels,
sightseeing, general trip planning and travelers' tales. It does
not have a site index, but it is easy to navigate. Under
sightseeing, for example, it offers a four-paragraph introduction
and then a list of 19 possibilities, from amusement parks to the
Ueno Zoo, which is more than 100 years old. Click on any of them,
and you get the information.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a general section of ``culture notes,'' such as
how to bow and when to give gifts and take off your shoes. One of
the very few mistakes is in the language section, suggesting that
``moshi moshi'' can be used as a greeting when entering a room.
Moshi moshi is used only on the phone or when you call out to a
stranger _ for instance, a passer-by who has dropped his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   While Planet Tokyo is the best place to start, it is a bit short
on history. So turn also to Exploring Old Tokyo at
www.twics.com/eds/oldtokyo. It has information about museums,
shrines and temples, even about a historic Edo Period public
toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one of the problems of these Web sites is their inability
to be helpful with directions: Tokyo is so huge that location
matters enormously. Perhaps it will take 10 minutes to get some
place, or perhaps two hours, but there is not much guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the larger question of whether these sites,
however rich in information, are any better than a guidebook. A
guidebook is easier to consult on an airplane, or to browse through
on a subway, and the fact-checking may be a bit more thorough. But
these sites are good resources for someone making a quick business
trip without much time for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many Tokyo places have their own Web sites as well
(some are linked to Planet Tokyo). When I read about Hotel New
Koyo, I was skeptical that it really had rooms for 2,500 yen. So I
telephoned, and the clerk confirmed the price and referred me to
its English language Web site: www &QC; .tctv.ne.jp/members/new-koyo. It
popped out in a moment, with all the information I could want,
including photos.

U.N. PANEL SAYS MORE COUNTRIES ARE STUDYING YEAR 2000 PROBLEMS

 By BARNABY J. FEDER   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Disruptions from Year 2000 computer problems
are inevitable, but are not likely to be as widespread or serious
as feared just six months ago, said organizers of an international
conference that ended two days of meetings on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Action is under way everywhere, by and large on schedule,''
said Ahmad Kamal, the Pakistani representative to the United
Nations and chairman of its working group on information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had delegates from 173 countries, a jump from the
120 at first global Year 2000 meeting here in December. Organizers
said the regional sessions that led up to it were creating ties
that could encourage international cooperation on technical issues
long after the Year 2000 challenge had passed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from the use of two digits to represent years,
like 99 for 1999. Some computers and programs read 00 as 1900
instead of 2000, and others do not recognize it as a valid year,
leading to miscalculations or crashes. Most countries started much
later than the United States in dealing with the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of cooperation going on is fascinating,'' John
Koskinen, chairman of President Clinton's Council on Year 2000
Conversion, said. ``A lot of the worry about international
preparedness a year and a half ago was because no one could imagine
putting all these people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Koskinen said Latin American countries had created a
continent-wide map of electricity grids and had been discussing
using such information in cooperative projects.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the cheer, though, are continuing uncertainties about how
far along many countries really are and how thorough their
contingency plans are. Russia, speaking directly to a concern in
Europe, which has vivid memories of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster,
pledged to have all its nuclear power plants repaired and tested by
September. But there was no information about how the testing would
be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries are still uncertain, as well, about how much
information to divulge. Venezuela fears creating runs on banks and
food shortages if it follows the lead of the United States in
advising citizens to prepare for several days of disruptions, said
Hugo Castellanos, head of the Year 2000 agency there. Japan also
has yet to decide how to address its citizens, and New Zealand's
plans include delivering a checklist of preparations to every house
in September.
</P>
<P>
   Some historic tensions proved impossible to set aside. North
African and Middle Eastern nations refused to allow Israel to
participate in their regional meeting, which Morocco organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't force people to invite people they don't want in
their homes,'' Kamal said after reporters had expressed disbelief
at his statement that Israel could have been excluded because
Morocco had determined that Israel had no ``shared problems'' with
its neighbors. Kamal said Israel had accepted an invitation to make
a separate presentation that included an offer to share expertise
with any other country.

 IBM Points Its Wallet Toward E-Commerce for Small Firms 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  Last month, International
<TEXT>
Business Machines Corp. kicked off a $100 million marketing
campaign to promote its e-commerce products for small businesses.
Then two weeks ago, it paid even more to buy Whistle
Communications, a Foster City company that offers easy e-mail and
Internet access to small companies.
<P>
   Both events underscore an important economic fact about the
information technology industry. ``The small-business segment is
growing more quickly than any other,'' said Peter Rowley, general
manager of Global Small Business at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   International Data Corp. estimates that small and midsize
businesses make up half of the $300 billion global information
technology market and that their expenditures are growing faster
than those of large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, the small-business market is growing at 11 to
13 percent per year, compared with 8 or 9 percent for larger
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM, which is better known for its large computing systems
and PCs, faces a problem with the small-business market: It's very
fragmented, with thousands of large and small vendors.
</P>
<P>
   That is the reason for its concerted _ and costly _ crusade to
establish an electronic relationship with smaller businesses. The
campaign includes these features:
</P>
<P>
   _The Small Business Program, which unifies IBM products and
services for this market for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   _The Small Business Solutions Club, where subscribers, for a
small annual fee, can get discounts on products and 50 percent
savings at Hilton, Hyatt, Marriott and other hotels and resorts.
</P>
<P>
   _IBM Small Business Custom Connections (www.ibm.com), which is
designed to let small businesses create customized pages and
organize the Web according to their specific needs, including
reminders of appointments and events.
</P>
<P>
   _Business Advantage, which provides various online tools and
consulting services to help growing businesses use the Web for
communication, collaboration and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _ThinkCenters, in which joint ventures between IBM, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce and Small Business Administration provide
small-business owners with hands-on experience and personal
consulting. They are located in various cities, but none has been
established in California.
</P>
<P>
   Without Whistle, IBM had some products to help small businesses
establish Web sites, sell goods and services online and run their
accounting and other business operations. But it didn't have an
all-in-one system to let little companies using different hardware
and software easily connect to the Internet and send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   IBM plans to make Whistle Communications products available to
small businesses in all industries around the world. For example, a
small mortgage broker could advertise mortgage rates on the Web,
accept online applications and communicate with customers by
e-mail. An employment agency could advertise jobs and receive
resumes online, deal with prospective employers by e-mail and
receive their fees by a secure network.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley said Whistle Communications will strategically help IBM
``capture small companies and then migrate them to our other
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistle had its own reasons to become part of IBM. It had raised
$35 million from venture capital investors. But Whistle CEO John
Hamm said much more was required ``to get big enough, fast enough
to influence small-business buying patterns.'' In addition to cash,
he noted that IBM ``had the brand reach we really needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whistle and IBM's other e-commerce offerings will help small
businesses ``harness the power of the Internet and compete more
effectively,'' Rowley said. ``This levels the playing field for
small businesses and helps them appear bigger than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said IBM is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Whistle, IBM bought a conduit into the small-business
market,'' said Dataquest analyst James Staten in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of small businesses are in the early stages of
e-commerce, like sending e-mails back and forth,'' said Boston
information technology consultant Joseph Villarosa. ``But they are
not really conducting business on the Internet. IBM is smart to see
this coming and try to help early adopters move up the chain to
larger products.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major companies may not be spending as much as IBM on
marketing. But they also are targeting the small-business and
so-called SOHO (small office, home office) market with e-commerce
products, services and information at special pages on their Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hewlett-Packard (www.hp.com) provides plenty of
information about its products, as well as expert advice, customer
success stories and other Web site resources.
</P>
<P>
   Intel (www.intel.com) has a full menu of products and services
for small business, including a glossary of terms, case studies and
information on building computer networks, growing on the Internet,
and mobile computing.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit (www.quicken.com), Microsoft (www.microsoft.com), Compaq,
(www.compaq.com), Dell (www.dell.com) and most other large hardware
and software vendors offer special information for small
businesses.

   VANCOUVER: Guides to Famous People And Family Fun
</P>
<P>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, much like Seattle, its near-neighbor to the south,
likes to boast that it is its nation's most tech-hip city. So it's
no surprise that a prospective visitor to Canada's great western
metropolis can find a ton of useful, interesting and quirky
information about the city on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is discovervancouver.com, a site full of
colorful images, including maps, weather charts and ``postcards''
from the country's western edge. It also includes links to the
Vancouver phone book and lots of trivia, including a list of famous
entertainers who hail from British Columbia (Michael J. Fox,
Raymond Burr and Pamela Anderson, among others).
</P>
<P>
   The site's funny American Page explains that Canada has a
one-dollar coin nicknamed the ``loonie'' because it has a loon on
one side, and a two-dollar coin that is sometimes called a
``toonie.'' And there is a helpful guide on dealing with an
all-too-common occurrence: How to Be Happy in Vancouver Even When
It Rains.
</P>
<P>
   The site maintained by Vancouver's convention and visitors
bureau, www.tourism-vancouver.com, has daily updates and excellent
links to information on outdoor activities like kayaking and
skiing.
</P>
<P>
   At the site www.4vancouver.com, part of the 4anything.com
network of community sites, a cybervisitor can find links to
restaurants, attractions, shopping centers and local newspapers and
magazines. For those who want to book all or part of the trip on
line, www.discoverbc.com has an excellent search engine with links
to hotels and tours.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the quirkier links. A wonderful guide for
families with children, maintained by a Vancouver family that
consists of ``Mom, Dad, Nathan and Jenavieve,'' is
www.findfamilyfun.com. It has information on everything from berry
picking to watching bald eagles _ all written in a chatty way, and
the search for activities can be sorted by cost or location.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to see vivid images of Vancouver and the
surrounding area is www.beautifulbc.ca, created by a 40-year-old
magazine, Beautiful British Columbia. The Vancouver Art Gallery,
www.vanartgallery.bc.ca, has a wealth of images (not large ones,
though) from both temporary exhibits and its permanent collection.
The works of Emily Carr (1871-1945), probably the province's
best-known artist, are part of this cyberdisplay, including the
fanciful ``Zunoqua of the Cat Village'' (1931) and the colorful
``Young Pines and Sky'' (c. 1935). After that cultural tour, why
not go whale watching? For a ``virtual tour,'' I suggest the Web
site www.vancouver-whale-watch.com.

   SYDNEY: You Can Go Home Again, And to the Beaches
</P>
<P>
   By JANE PERLEZ
</P>
<P>
   As a onetime resident of Sydney who sneaks back annually during
the down-under summer, I found surfing the Web to explore my former
city as a vacation place a revelation. On Yahoo's Sydney Web site,
travel.yahoo.com/destinations (click on the Oceania heading or
search for ``Sydney''), I found solid, sometimes imaginative
information, on sightseeing, restaurants, transportation, hotels
and best of all, the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   The site opens with a refreshing essay by Mary Ann Harrell, a
writer who once lived in the city and who describes how the place
has changed. This is a fine mood-setting piece (originally printed
in National Geographic Traveler).
</P>
<P>
   A travel advisory from Knoll Travel Watch reminds would-be
visitors that Sydney is the host city for next summer's Olympic
Games: in September and October 2000, the city will be packed. But
the good news in the travel advisory is that street crime is not a
serious problem, except for late at night in King's Cross, an area
replete with strip joints and bars.
</P>
<P>
   The Where to Eat in Sydney guide on Yahoo, seemed accurate and
up to date. I clicked on my old neighborhood in Lane Cove and found
28 restaurants _ 27 more than when I lived there _ including a
Chinese takeout called Tow Yin. More seriously, the guide also
mentioned Doyle's on the Beach, a wonderful seafood place on the
harbor shore. A main course and appetizer (known as an entree in
Australia) would cost the equivalent of about $26, it was reported,
which sounds about right. At the top end of the scale, the guide
listed Rockpool, perhaps Sydney's finest seafood restaurant, where
main course and appetizer cost about $76.
</P>
<P>
   One of the weaker points of the site was the accommodations
listing. There are links to the major hotels, but some don't give
room rates. For example, the site for the Inter-Continental, a
luxury hotel built atop a colonial structure, offers a photo of its
building and panoramic harbor views, and gives the number of rooms
_ 498 _ and suites, but you have to fill out a reservation form to
get a rate. The hotel section does list less expensive choices,
including bed-and-breakfasts and corporate apartments in Sydney and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   I was encouraged to see that the opera house, Sydney's principal
venue for contemporary dance, concerts and opera, is described in
all its glory. Ferry services on the harbor _ one of the city's
strong points _ were all listed, with schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most innovative for the visitor interested in the beach
is www.realsurf.com. On the site's Northern Beaches Tour, I viewed
a photo of the waves at North Palmy, the local jargon for North
Palm Beach, one of my favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Larry's Report that day on realsurf.com said that ``Palm Beach
and the joey were the pick this morning, about a meter and glassy
waves, the peaks shifting about.'' However bizarre that sounds
(``barren joey'' is local slang for the peninsula at Palm Beach),
it is authentic Sydney beach talk, and a fair testament to the
sense of variety of city life that a Web site can give.

MARKET PLACE: SALON.COM AUCTION FAILS TO ENTHUSE INTERNET 
INVESTORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Salon.com, an online magazine with meager
revenue, went public with a whimper Tuesday, as investors continued
to weigh not only the value of Internet issues themselves but also
that of the institutions leading them to market.
</P>
<P>
   Clouding the new stock's performance was the unusual method used
to set the opening price, a process called a modified Dutch
auction, which allows individuals to bid on the stock before it
begins trading publicly. The tepid response suggests the market's
lack of interest in Salon. But first-day enthusiasm may have been
undermined by the auction format, which eliminates the role of
traditional underwriters of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was priced Monday night by W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co. of San
Francisco at $10.50 a share, at the bottom of the anticipated price
range of $10.50 to $13.50 a share, and closed Tuesday at $10.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Tuesday's initial offering by Ramp Networks got off
to a roaring start. The company's product allows multiple users in
a small office to share an Internet connection, making it an
Internet infrastructure company rather than a provider of content
for the Internet. Its stock was priced at $11 and rose 61 percent
in the first day of trading to close at $16.75.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of Salon described the mood Monday as ``jubilant''
but business-as-usual as the staff celebrated the public offering
with a pizza lunch. The company, started by former staff members of
The San Francisco Examiner, wound up the day with a market value of
$107 million, having sold 2.5 million of 10.7 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   As remarkable as the valuation may seem given Salon's losses of
$6.5 million last year on $2.9 million in revenue, the offering is
a yawner by Internet standards. In March, for example, shares of
iVillage, a women's network, rose 300 percent the first day, while
stock in the financial news company TheStreet.com exploded 216
percent on its first day of trading in May. Both stocks,
underwritten by the venerable Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs,
have since given back much of their gains but remain well above
their offering prices, providing tidy paper profits for insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Salon chief executive Michael O'Donnell said the first-day price
had to be put into context, and he pointed out that the Internet
media ``sector is down 27 percent since we filed'' April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of an IPO is to get company proceeds to grow,''
he said. ``If you're looking for a quick pop today, you may be
disappointed. We have nowhere to go but up.'' O'Donnell also said
that the auction attracted long-term investors, not day traders who
would put pressure on the company for immediate returns.
</P>
<P>
   For its stock to gain ground, Salon will need more advertising
and a bigger audience. Media Metrix reported that Salon attracted a
million individual visitors in May, substantially fewer than the
3.2 million who visited iVillage.com. TheStreet.com had 783,000
visitors in April, but it also derives revenue from more than
51,000 subscribers who pay $9.95 monthly or $99.95 yearly.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said Salon would use $5 million of the $25 million
raised Tuesday to embark on a national television, radio and print
advertising campaign. Since it began in 1995, Salon.com has spent a
mere $200,000 on marketing, though it has generated Internet buzz,
partly because of well-known writers, including Isabel Allende and
Paul Theroux, and its literary journalism and political reporting,
particularly during the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pleased shareholders is David Talbot, the former
editor of arts and feature articles at The Examiner who founded
Salon. Based on holdings reported April 15, Talbot, now the editor
in chief, has stock worth $3 million, and had options to buy
102,000 additional shares.
</P>
<P>
   The largest investor, with 26 percent of the magazine, is Adobe
Ventures, a venture capital firm, whose stake is now worth $28
million. Another prominent Salon investor is television mogul
Norman Lear, whose stake is now worth $2.57 million, excluding
25,000 warrants. O'Donnell's shares, in the form of options, are
worth $1.58 million. Hambrecht requires that Salon insiders hold
shares at least 90 days after the public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Salon offering was the second auction from Hambrecht. The
first, in April, for Ravenswood Winery was also lackluster. Those
shares, which were also priced at $10.50, closed Tuesday at
$10.625.
</P>
<P>
   In Hambrecht's auctions, investors submit bids for how many
shares they are willing to buy and at what price. At the end of the
bidding period, Hambrecht starts awarding shares to the highest
bidders. It continues down the price list until all shares are
sold. The catch is that all bidders, regardless of what they bid,
pay only the price submitted by the lowest bidder in the winning
group.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht president Ian Zwicker said the Dutch auction was less
expensive for the issuing company. Traditional underwriters usually
charge 7 percent of the gross on a small stock offering like
Salon's, and Hambrecht charged 5 percent, or about $1.5 million,
Zwicker said.
</P>
<P>
   But, as with Salon, the company going public may forfeit the
first day liftoff. That is' because individual investors eager to
snap up Internet issues have already bid on the stock to help set
its market value.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Pasternak, the chief executive of Knight Securities
Inc., one of the nation's largest market makers, said an auction
made sense in the era of highflying Internet stocks. Institutions
appear to be setting prices too low given the demand of individual
investors, a problem the auction can mitigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most IPO's don't properly reflect the pricing mechanics of
individual investors correctly,'' he said. In fact, TheStreet and
iVillage could be criticized for leaving money on the table, since
investors were willing to pay well above the offering price set by
their underwriters.
</P>
<P>
   Pasternak cautioned, though, that the auction method is still
untested, given the two small issues from Hambrecht, and its
success will be determined in coming months. The next issue from
Hambrecht will be for GreatFood.com.
</P>
<P>
   At least one investor and stock analyst was optimistic about
Salon. Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology
Stockletter and manager of a technology portfolio that bought 6,000
Salon.com shares in the auction, said, ``If this trades in the
teens as I expect, it could validate this as a way to go public.''

   LONDON: So Many Choices, So Many Glitches
</P>
<P>
   By SARAH LYALL
</P>
<P>
   There are so many Web sites about London that it should be easy
to find one that satisfies basic tourist needs: clear, concise
information about where to stay, what to do and the like. But I
tried three, and was beset with frustration at every turn. They
were either too commercial, too sparse on information, or too full
of glitches to make the cybertrip worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The first, www.tourist.co.uk, certainly looked encouraging,
promising a comprehensive guide to the city. But something was
strange. In the hotel category, for instance, the site asked for my
desired location and price range but then listed only a fraction of
the hotels that met the criteria. When I asked for hotels in
central London that were under $70 (40 pounds) a night, I got only
seven names (none with addresses or phone numbers, or Web links,
another annoyance). When I asked for ones that cost over $210 a
night, I got only four (one, the Savoy, had a Web link).
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the restaurant list was patchy and haphazard, and it
soon became clear that only some establishments (presumably those
that had paid a fee) had been included. All along, I was exhorted
to call different numbers _ one for a tourist information service,
and another offering help with reservations _ rather than being
given the basic information I needed.
</P>
<P>
   My next stop was www.a-london-guide.co.uk, which proclaims
itself the guide to ``virtual London.'' It started off very
promisingly, with a forecast of the day's weather in London and
some good, well-written advice about arriving in the city (such as
where the airports are). But the site appeared to have one aim: to
get you to buy its guides to London, on CD-ROM ($39.99) or video
($24.99). No thanks!
</P>
<P>
   That left the most promising of all, www.londontown.com, the
official site of the London Tourist Board. The board is usually
extremely helpful and thorough, and its Web site looked that way,
too. Not only did it offer guides to the London's popular sights,
but it also included an extensive list of millennium events and
attractions scheduled to open (or to be renovated) this year and in
the first few years of the next century. They ranged from the
Vinopolis, an all-about-wine attraction scheduled to open next
month, to a spiral-like extension of the Victoria and Albert Museum
planned for 2004.
</P>
<P>
   I was delighted by its opening graphic, inviting you to click on
to the section of a spinning globe that represents where you'll be
traveling from (when I clicked on to New York, I was told about a
special deal being offered for departures from there by British
Airways and the Forte hotel chain).
</P>
<P>
   But then it all went wrong. I tried my standard test again:
Could I use the site to find a hotel that I wanted to stay in? The
site listed types of hotels, ranging from inns to youth hostels,
and invited me to choose a neighborhood, amenities and a host of
other options. The list was clearly comprehensive. In central
London, for instance, the site promised to list 150 hotels.
</P>
<P>
   When I went further, however, trying to get a list of the actual
items, my computer began to emit a horrible grating noise and
froze. I thought I was having a bad computer day, but when I got
our office's computer expert involved, he had the same problem.
Perhaps it was the Web site that was having a bad day (colleagues
had better luck a couple of weeks later.) By this time, though, I
was thoroughly disillusioned. All I wanted was a nice,
old-fashioned guide in the shape of an actual book.

   PARIS: From the Louvre, To the Sewers
</P>
<P>
   By ALAN RIDING
</P>
<P>
   France was slow to join the cyberworld, but all the basic
information that a visitor to Paris needs can now be found on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Paris Tourisme, at www.paris-tourisme &QC; .com, is a good place to
start. A click on ``Welcome'' calls up an menu in English divided
into nine chapters, among them: Museums, Hotels, City Tours,
detailed maps of Paris and its suburbs; Paris Airports and Paris
for Kids. Each chapter heading leads to a wide range of options. In
the museums listing, for instance, there is lively information on
no fewer than 42 museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris for Kids section includes attractions, parks and zoos,
and even suggests where to find baby sitters at night. Under the
heading Paris From A . . . to Z is a range of practical information
like where to rent bicycles, how to find philatelists and which is
the best flea market. This site offers a limited selection of
hotels and has no information on restaurants, but it has a good
search engine. The site promotes the Touringscope bus trips around
Paris in addition to walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   The French government sponsors two sites. The Paris Convention
and Visitors Bureau site, www.paris-touristoffice.com, switches
into English by clicking on a Union Jack. It offers 10 chapters,
including some not listed by Paris Tourisme. Paris night life
covers everything from cabarets and opera houses to jazz clubs and
trendy cafes (it notes, for example, that Le Flore in
St.-Germain-des-Pres is host to philosophical discussions in
English at 7 p.m. on the first Wednesday of the month). The
restaurants section even includes where to find dining spots with,
say, terraces or views, while the hotel information offers a broad
choice, from student hostels to luxury hotels (in picking a price
range, be sure to use French francs). Although this site does not
have a search function, it does offer links to other Paris Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   The French Tourist Office, www.fgtousa.org/regional/paris.htm,
is another source of extensive information about Paris _ offering
numerous links to other sites. An example: a click on general
information leads to ``wines,'' which in turn leads to tips on
wine-tasting classes, including those that are held in English. The
site even offers pen portraits of close to 100 famous French men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   Some other useful Web sites are maintained by entities outside
of France. The (AT)Paris Traveler's Guide, at infocities.com, is
lively, though I noticed its information about museums was limited.
I enjoyed the Lonely Planet site,
lonelyplanet.com/dest/eur/par.htm, if only because it starts with
an introduction to French history and its recommended reading list
ranges from Rousseau and Voltaire to Marguerite Duras and Michel
Foucault. For the off-the-beaten-track visit, it even proposes the
Paris sewers (I have been there: they are interesting and not too
smelly).
</P>
<P>
   A site that seems particularly informative on hotels is
www.france.com/travel/hotels. It is run by the French Hotel
Reservation Center and covers just about everywhere _ Paris and
throughout the country. Hotels can be chosen by district and by
price, and there is a useful box indicating how convenient
different parts of town are for getting to museums, shopping,
businesses and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The information includes room prices as well as address,
telephone and a photograph of each hotel. The site even offers to
find hotels at the lowest possible rates.

Wednesday by unidentified assailants. The Marines returned fire,
killing one person. The Marines called in attack helicopters, and
the assailants, armed with AK-47s, surrendered. It was not

   KOSOVO-PRISONERS _ DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ The four scraggly
thieves stopped Albana Koshe's car by the woods because they wanted
a ride, but under her tenacious questioning they provided a clue in
her dreadful quest. Yes, they said, they had been released from a
Serb jail as the Serbs withdrew from Kosovo. In jail, they said,
they worked in the kitchen cutting bread, so they knew that 150 men
from her town had been brought there. Finally, providing the answer
she dreaded, they said they recognized her brother, Alban, among
them. The world now watches ethnic Albanian refugees return to a
NATO-controlled Kosovo, but, for Koshe and thousands of others from
her region the war is over but not resolved. Their relatives are
being held prisoner and, it appears, have been taken to Serbia by
the withdrawing troops. Developing. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

   COKE-MAIN _ BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The Belgian government today
said it will lift its partial ban on Coca-Cola products once the
company has met certain conditions, including enhancing safety
measures at bottling plants. Coca-Cola Co. has accepted the
conditions, which also include a thorough cleaning of the plants
and better monitoring. Company spokesman Paul Pendergrass said the
company may be able to have its products on store shelves within a
few days. The government, however, said vending machines carrying
Coke products will still be off-limits to consumers until it is
more satisfied with their safety. Belgian Health Minister Luc Van
den Bossche said there is still a foul smell coming from some of
those machines. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 25.

NEW MUSIC FOR OLD SOUND  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (af)  
 Lawrence B. Johnson is the music critic of The Detroit News.  
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an eerie encounter, hearing the high, pianissimo string
harmony rippling into clear presence over the familiar contrapuntal
weave of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra. Experience suggested that
not even the most expensive compact disk players could extract that
luminous layer of sound from a conventional CD, no matter how
painstaking the mastering process.
</P>
<P>
   But here was an ``ordinary'' disk playing in a moderately priced
machine, and delivering music as transparent, vital and complete as
one expects to hear in a good concert hall.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the CD at hand, created from a 1962 recording by Erich
Leinsdorf and the Boston Symphony, is not at all ordinary.
Standard, yes, in the sense that it can be played on any boombox.
But the breathtaking sound bespeaks a clever grafting of
cutting-edge digital technology onto the garden variety compact
disk.
</P>
<P>
   That hair-raising Bartok belongs to the first fruits of BMG's
new High Performance series, which at the bargain price of $12 per
CD promises digital revelation for classic recordings from deep
within the vault of RCA Victor Red Seal.
</P>
<P>
   The new project, headed by a veteran engineer, Nathaniel S.
Johnson, is something of a higher-tech sequel to BMG's compact disk
revival of the RCA ``Living Stereo'' series, which helped to launch
stereophonic sound in the late 1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But while the remastering of ``Living Stereo'' CDs generally
reflects great care, that process still utilizes the same digital
sampling rate of 44.1 kilohertz that has governed the compact disk
since its genesis in the early 1980s. For its High Performance
remastering, BMG uses a sampling rate of 96 kilohertz with 24-bit
resolution, compared with the 16-bit capacity of the CD as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   This more elegant digitizing process, known as 96/24, will
apparently be the standard for DVD-audio recordings somewhere down
the road. And the latest generation of DVD players can indeed play
back that supersonic mode. But no CD player can do so.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the real magic of BMG's new recycling process springs from
a digital engine that converts the 96/24 masters to the
44.1-kilohertz, 16-bit framework of regular compact disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose some very delicate upper partials in the
down-conversion,'' Johnson said, ``but I have to say a major
benefit of 96/24 is miraculously carried through.''
</P>
<P>
   Miracle or not, the result is quite amazing to hear in disk
after disk. And to experience a work like the Concerto for
Orchestra or its companion here, Kodaly's ``Peacock Variations,''
with such presence and textural depth is to gain a new appreciation
of both Leinsdorf's expansive, clear-sighted interpretations and
the Bostonians' thoroughgoing virtuosity (09026-63309-2).
</P>
<P>
   On a blazing CD of Stravinsky ballets, the Boston Symphony's
1968 recording of ``Petrouchka'' _ with a youthful Michael Tilson
Thomas at the piano _ is paired with the Chicago Symphony's 1969
``Rite of Spring,'' both under the stewardship of Seiji Ozawa
(09026-63311-2). BMG's high-speed processing and 24-bit platform
serve equally well to underscore the fearsome power of the ``Rite''
and the airy brilliance of ``Petrouchka.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another sonic thriller spotlights the Bizet-Shchedrin
``Carmen Ballet'' in Arthur Fiedler's 1969 recording with the
Boston Pops (09026-63308-2). Scored for strings and a prodigious
percussion battery, Shchedrin's quirky, droll transmogrification of
Bizet's opera has always intrigued recording engineers and
mesmerized hi-fi buffs. But this is surely the work's most vibrant
incarnation ever on disk. Shostakovich's incidental music for
``Hamlet'' and Glazunov's ``Carnaval Overture'' round out the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes from Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess,'' with Leontyne Price
and William Warfield (09026-63312-2), recorded in 1963, and works
for solo piano by Charles-Valentin Alkan played by Raymond
Lewenthal (09026-63310-2) complete the initial release of five
disks.
</P>
<P>
   The stunning immediacy of Lewenthal's piano sound, which seems
to bring the instrument forward from the loudspeakers, points up
the perhaps unsuspected sophistication of recording technology 35
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just which treasures to resurrect through the new process was,
and remains, a difficult call, Johnson admitted. ``We didn't want
to recycle the `Living Stereo' series, which will continue to have
a life of its own,'' he said, ``so we decided to focus on the later
'60s. Many of those recordings have never been brought out on CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston stuff alone, with Leinsdorf and Fiedler, is
incredible: beautiful recordings made in the great acoustics of
Symphony Hall. During Leinsdorf's directorship, the Boston Symphony
was under contract to make seven recordings a year for 10 years.
And there's another group of wonderful things with Jean Martinon
and the Chicago Symphony, plus all the London Symphony recordings.
There's got to be 200 or 250 titles without any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The clarity achieved through the 96/24 mastering technique has
proved to be double-edged, Johnson said. The revivified sound
represents long hours of meticulous work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things that were invisible 30 years ago, like splices
or air-conditiong hum, are a real problem. One particular noise in
the Boston Symphony tapes has a signature that we joke about:
`There goes the bus to Harvard Square.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're able to go in and do remarkable things. It just
takes a third again as much time as `Living Stereo.' We've really
tried not to compromise. We're seriously trying to set a new
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid overwhelming consumers in an already glutted CD world,
BMG will limit the High Performance series to just 13 releases this
year and 13 more in 2000. Among the disks scheduled for release by
autumn: Handel's ``Messiah,'' performed by Richard Westenburg and
Musica Sacra; ``The Fantastic Philadelphians,'' Vols. I and II (on
one CD); a two-disk set of Mahler's Symphonies Nos. 1 and 3, with
Leinsdorf, and the Boston Symphony in a program of Bartok's
``Miraculous Mandarin,'' Varese's ``Arcana'' and Hindemith's
``Nobilissima Visione'' with Martinon and the Chicago Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much information captured on those tapes, just
waiting to get out of prison,'' Johnson said. ``I hope this
encourages people to listen more closely.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    WebMD: The hype and the hope
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ WebMD Inc. and Healtheon Corp. may be poised for a
multibillion-dollar merger, but they are in a business that some
analysts view as smoke and mirrors, touting wildly hyped ability to
deliver goods and services _ let alone make a profit during the
foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   But wait: These same analysts predict WebMD and Healtheon will
be well-positioned to become a dominant player in their niche
business _ health care services delivered online to physicians,
institutions and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Only when discussing Internet businesses might both perceptions
be true.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Atlanta-based WebMD has come a long way fast. In one
year, WebMD has morphed from a tiny start-up, born from the ashes
of a young entrepreneur's previous company, into a big name on the
Net replete with prestigious board members, an experienced
management team, a merger deal with a California company whose
stock is worth billions and an arrangement for Microsoft to invest
$250 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cinderella storyline has everything _ except profits.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in short, a typical Internet success story, told in
Internet time. A company soars to stratospheric value, its flight
fueled by investors blind to traditional measures. Cynics compare
it to the 17th century tulip craze, in which prices rocketed beyond
all reason only to suffer collapse beyond all precedent.
Traditionalists look at the Net and say: Gravity will have its way.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not sheer madness. Look at the potential of the Net as
a conduit for the economy and communications. A new report from the
Commerce Department says the Internet and technology industries
account for at least a third of the U.S. economic growth in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Health care represents 14 percent of the $6 trillion U.S.
economy, more than $840 billion. If any significant portion of that
is shifted to the Net and if WebMD can win any sizable piece of the
market, then current valuations could be far too modest.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too early in the game to take this seriously? No, said
Charlene Li, analyst with Forrester Research. ``They are leaders in
a field that doesn't exist. But they have as good a chance as
anybody to pull it off.''
</P>
<P>
   What gives them that chance? Does WebMD have the best Web site,
the most visionary business plan, the smartest technology?
</P>
<P>
   No way, Li said. But they might have the fastest, slickest and
most-image savvy sales pitch. And they are surely first in their
class at collecting cash _ by the hundreds of millions of dollars _
needed to market themselves into a winner.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a series of missteps leaves her wondering, she
said. ``There are a lot of things about this company that make me
uneasy. I can't figure out what these guys are doing, what the
value is, because they keep casting about for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet virtues and vulnerabilities can be reversed in the shadow
reality of the Internet. Consider the idea of a business model so
fluid that it's hard to tell from quarter to quarter how the
company expects to make a buck. It could be desperation. It could
be flexibility. The rise from obscurity started with founder
Jeffrey Arnold selling off much of his previous business, Endeavor
Technologies. In August, the company received a $10 million
investment from HBO &AMP; Co. Endeavor Technologies became WebMD with a
board of high-tech stalwarts. Olympic organizer Billy Payne joined
the company as vice chairman. During the next few months, an
experienced management team was named. In November, Jay Gilbertson
left HBO &AMP; Co. as it prepared to merge with McKesson and leapt to
WebMD as it prepared for a public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Then WebMD announced a five-year deal with DuPont, in which the
pharmaceutical giant would pay $220 million, mostly to boost the
company's network of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   But the hype reached a crescendo as the company delayed and
finally called off the IPO, choosing instead to merge with
Healtheon. It seemed an ideal fit on paper. WebMD had a
consumer-oriented Web site and an information service for doctors.
Healtheon handled transactions for clinics, insurance companies and
large medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet marriage made in heaven
</P>
<P>
   The stock market loved the match.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD is still privately held, but the current value of
Healtheon stock implies a combined company worth upwards of $6
billion. That would make the company _ which will be based in
Atlanta _ one of the most valuable companies in Georgia,
approaching the value of Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Delta last year had revenues of $14 billion and net income of $1
billion while moving millions of customers around the globe. By
comparison, Healtheon last year had revenues of $49 million along
with a $54 million loss. WebMD last year had revenues of $408,000
and a $23 million loss. Although Healtheon says it will handle 475
million transactions this year, that apparently comes from a
relative handful of customers. WebMD is no longer talking about how
many doctors signed up for its $30-a-month service. As to how many
consumers have clicked onto the Web site _ that, too, is only a
guess.
</P>
<P>
   And along the way, there have been a few WebMD slips.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a case of building a business on Internet time.
WebMD has developed so quickly because it had to, changed direction
because it must be Net nimble. It has slipped once or twice in its
haste. It could also be a simple case of overselling a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company proclaimed its plan to sell services to
doctors as the key to profits. A few months later, WebMD was
emphasizing consumers and advertising as a revenue source. Earlier
this year, founder Arnold listed himself on the company Web site as
a graduate of the University of Georgia. He attended, but has no
diploma. WebMD bought CertifiedMail.com in December, only to file
suit against the company in March, charging that it had been given
false information before the purchase. Arnold also drew criticism
from The Wall Street Journal for near-cocky predictions made during
the ``quiet period'' that follows the announcement of a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of Jay Gilbertson
</P>
<P>
   And then came the clumsily handled _ and still pending _
departure of Jay Gilbertson.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbertson's arrival in November was touted by Arnold and other
officials as proof that the company was for real, compelling
evidence that Wall Street could take seriously its impending offer
of stock. But within a few days, the IPO was called off in favor of
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when Healtheon and WebMD announced the combined management
team, Gilbertson's absence from the list of jobs was striking.
Arnold assured reporters that Gilbertson would stay and be given
``an operational role.'' But on June 14, a company spokeswoman said
Gilbertson had resigned _ an announcement that Gilbertson denied
that same day. The following day, the company stopped talking about
Gilbertson altogether _ a sign that only the terms of his departure
were in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WebMD's claim to a unique set of services was being
undercut by a slew of newcomers also aiming to make a mark in the
health care sector. High-flying IPOs included CareinSite.com and
AmericasDoctor.com. Some like Claims.net, IDX, Atlanta-based
Medcast, Third Millennium Healthcare and AccentHealth are fighting
Healtheon for the online route to doctors or ``back office''
transactions. Others like Dr. Koop, Adam.com, HealthGate, WebDoctor
and CareData.com are striving to become the consumer's portal to
health care information on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   William Michalak, analyst at Wachovia Securities, chalked up the
strategic changes to an astute reading of the market. ``I think
both Healtheon and WebMD were going to approach doctors and they
found them much different than expected. That's why WebMD went to
the consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   What looks like a scramble is a clever effort to gain a foothold
before an inevitable consolidation, he said. ``I think there is
room in the market for five to seven significant players. But it's
like Rubik's Cube or like a multidimensional chess game and we are
not sure who all the players are right now. ''
</P>
<P>
   Wide-open cyberspaces
</P>
<P>
   Terry Lee, executive vice president of Claimsnet.com, said he
thinks there is space for plenty of competition. His company gives
physicians a Net-based method for handling claims, and the
potential is enormous for moving health care from paper to
electronics, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 95 percent of all health care records are still
paper-based,'' he said. ``Technology abounds in health care, but
what is hanging on the end of every hospital bed? A clipboard
chart.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks, president and COO of AccentHealth, said his company
serves about 10,000 doctors' offices, most via video feeds to
patients in the waiting room. How that connection develops is hard
to predict, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He foresees selling doctors insurance adjudication, credit card
verification, medical education, videos and software of various
kinds. ``We say that doctors have deep pockets and short arms.
Doctors are not going to adapt technology just for the sake of
technology. They have to have a reason _ either economics or
productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks have for many months been purchased according to
rules that seem not to apply anywhere else. Profitability is simply
irrelevant _ at least for now. What matters is marketing,
deal-making, and _ perhaps most critically _ burning a brand name
into the public consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   WebMD has been very good at all that. Among its deals, the
company has agreements with several well-known brands including
Lycos, Excite, CNN, MSNBC and Reader's Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Learning from the king of high tech: Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   Quality of technology and service is not the end of the story,
said analyst Li. ``Look at Microsoft. They don't even come close to
having the best products, but they have a marketing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also knows how to scare off rivals with ``vaporware,''
announcement of products that sound frighteningly powerful but are
in fact nowhere near ready. WebMD has _ in some respects _ a
similar approach, Li said. ``It's basically a PR play. It's
vaporware. It may pan out, but not for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The WebMD-Healtheon merger is to be completed by the end of
September. And Microsoft will emerge with 17 percent ownership of
the combined company. And _ vaporware or no _ with the Microsoft
seal of approval, how far away can success be?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft has leapt aboard many a bandwagon, covering its
bets as with investments ranging from Dialogic Corp.'s computer
phone technology to ThingWorld's streaming media technology to
WebTV.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, too, doesn't want to get left behind when the
Internet truly takes off. And while everyone agrees that billions
of dollars are hanging at the horizon, no one yet has the reach to
pick them off. There is as much insecurity as there is
anticipation. Hence, the hysteria and hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``WebMD has a lot of competition,'' said David Restrepo, analyst
with Jupiter Communications. ``The WebMD-Healtheon merger was
really the kick-off of the hype about the sector. It's going to be
a while until we can assess that hype.''

 &HT;    CONSTRUCTION LOAN APPROVED FOR WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL
 &HT;    By JONATHAN HALL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox news Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-awaited World War II memorial came a step
closer to reality Wednesday as a House panel authorized a $65
million loan for its construction and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, House and Senate panels approved giving a
cost-of-living adjustment to veterans with service-connected
disabilities. As in previous years, the COLA will be pegged to the
annual increase in the Consumer Price Index, based on the figure
released in September.
</P>
<P>
   The House Veterans Affairs Committee unanimously agreed to
authorize the American Battle Monuments Commission to borrow $65
million from the U.S. Treasury in order to spur construction of the
below-ground-level plaza to be located between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. It is expected to be completed
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the memorial, expected to be about $100 million, is
being raised privately. The Treasury loan would be repaid from
those private fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   House Committee Chairman Bob Stump, R-Ariz., urged Congress to
pass the legislation because many World War II veterans are in poor
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are losing 1,000 veterans a day. Let's get going on this,''
Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   In other business, the committee narrowly approved an amendment
by Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., that would allow veterans
to be covered by veterans benefits for emergency care provided
outside of Veterans Health Administration facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask veterans to choose VA care, but leave them out in
emergencies,'' Rockefeller said before the amendment passed on a
7-5 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Veterans Committee Chairman Arlen Specter, R-Pa., was
hesitant to approve the amendment. ``The objective is sound, (but)
I don't think we have a handle on the cost,'' he said.

VIRTUAL GOLF, WITHOUT THE CADDIES OR CARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all sports, golf has a reputation for being among the most
averse to change. While tennis and basketball players compete with
fluorescent clothes and shaved heads, many professional golfers
wear the long pants and polo shirts that have been worn since
before the turn of the century. As if to emphasize the
conservatism, Payne Stewart won the U.S. Open this month wearing
navy blue plus fours.
</P>
<P>
   But golf has not been so reluctant to throw tradition aside and
expand onto the Web. The sport is flourishing there, with hundreds
of sites that focus on the best courses, firsthand accounts of
holes in one and what to look for in equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites that generate particular interest are those
devoted to topics like the Open, the Masters, the Professional
Golfers' Association Championship and the British Open. Online
magazines, fans sites and sports television sites chronicle each
round; the PGA site provides frequent updates.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about the competitors may inspire some weekend players.
Dozens of sites offer tips on driving (go for the middle of the
green), putting (keep in balance) and practice (do it as much as
possible).
</P>
<P>
   But people who are looking for information about equipment and
resorts may have a harder time finding it on the Web. There are
ample articles about golf courses and new equipment, but they are
often so positive that they might as well have been written by a
publicity agent.
</P>
<P>
   As George Plimpton once observed about sports writing, the
smaller the ball, the better the prose. Though little on the Web
approaches the quality of the golf writing found elsewhere, there
is plenty online to keep the enthusiast glued to the computer
screen _ at least until the game starts on television.
</P>
<P>
   PGATOUR.COM
</P>
<P>
   www.pgatour.com
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are good!'' this site announces on its logo. That
statement, golf's answer to other sports tag lines (``We Love This
Game,'' ``The Coolest Game on Ice''), sets the tone for
Pgatour.com, home to Professional Golfers' Association, which
oversees the men's and senior tour. The site chronicles the
accomplishments of hundreds of professional players in minute
detail, with a large dose of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the site's boosterism, visitors can find more
than the usual updates about tournament leaders, player statistics
and records. There is also an archive of player biographies with a
few interesting, if decidedly uncritical, personal tidbits. The
site took note, for instance, that Tiger Woods made E!
Entertainment Television's list of ``World's Coolest Bachelors.''
People who prefer fancier sources of information can click on the
multimedia section. Here, they can watch video highlights from the
most recent tour, tune in to an occasional golf audio news show and
listen to a live radio broadcast for play-by-play coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The site also offers a quirky selection of articles by caddies
and professionals that give weekend players an inside look at what
it is like to be on the tour, often with not so glamorous
anecdotes. For example, Joe Ogilvie, a rookie player, talks about
his failure to make the cut in several tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he could get some advice from the regularly updated
feature Tour Tips, in which professionals like Lee Trevino discuss
golf basics. The lessons get extra points for having video clips so
that visitors can see for themselves how to play better in, for
example, the wind and sand.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its shortcomings, this site is probably among the best
on the Web focused on the professional tour, if for no other reason
than its access to the world's best players. The weakest features
on the site are those that try to sell something other than the
men's tour. Too often here, advertising masquerades as genuine
articles. The travel section is a repeat offender: It shovels
praise on the resorts that host professional tournaments. Another
is a golf equipment column that looks as if it was illustrated by a
golf equipment manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   GLOBAL GOLF GUIDE
</P>
<P>
   www.globalgolfguide.com
</P>
<P>
   Golf enthusiasts are drawn to images of spectacular fairways and
greens as gourmets are to photos of five-star meals. Such pictures
have probably encouraged many golfers to travel, or at least dream
of traveling, great distances to play some of the best courses in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   This site, home of the Global Golf Guide, an online compendium
of golf course, golf resort and golf real-estate images, offers
golfers the opportunity to tour famed courses via hundreds of film
clips. Visitors can view individual holes at dozens of golf clubs
in places like Scottsdale, Ariz., and La Quinta, Calif., from the
perspective of a flying helicopter or a panning camera.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most impressive clips are of the seaside fairways in
Pebble Beach, Calif., with audio descriptions. In showing the
seventh hole at Pebble Beach Golf Links, the camera zooms in from
over the ocean, following the fairway along the rugged coastline,
past its sand traps and an artfully placed lone cypress pine tree,
to the green. ``The jagged rocks of Carmel Bay are in sharp
contrast to the manicured beauty of the seventh hole,'' the
narrator says.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers looking for repeated vicarious thrills may be
disappointed. Though the virtual tours are certainly fancy, the
quality of the image hardly compares with that of a television
broadcast. The film clips are small and often fuzzy, and the audio
sometimes echoes. The tours in the panorama section are typically
more in focus. But the images, which originate from a slowly
spinning camera, show only a small portion of individual holes.
</P>
<P>
   Even less revealing is the archive of still photography from
courses around the world. But the section is still impressive for
its depth, including shots from golfing destinations like Bolivia
and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect to get much of an independent view of golf
courses. All of the images appear to come straight from promotional
videos and brochures, which do not focus on dead grass and lumpy
greens (unless, of course, they're in Scotland).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, this site would appeal only to truly devoted
golfers. After browsing through the clips, the uninitiated may be
moved to commit heresy and say, ``Frankly, all golf courses look
the same.''

   WORLD GOLF
</P>
<P>
   www.worldgolf.com
</P>
<P>
   Golf consists of much more than hitting a ball in a hole (with
an instrument ill-designed for the purpose, as Winston Churchill
once said), although that is certainly the major goal of the game.
Golf, at least as it is presented on television and through
advertising, is also an avocation that can, at its best, include
travel, fitness, tremendous mental preparation and good humor. At
its worst, golf is still associated with class, racism, bad clothes
and even worse humor.
</P>
<P>
   World Golf focuses on the sport at its best. It features a range
of information that many golfers will find useful, if not for
improving their games, then perhaps for finding a job at a country
club or getting advice about collecting old drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Instruction is taken quite seriously here. The site includes
several articles about topics like grips for putting, posture and
balance, and the proper placement of feet.
</P>
<P>
   The instruction on mechanics is insightful, though sometimes
obvious. For example, one writer advised players to putt the ball
within a 3-foot ``halo'' around the hole, which seems to be what
most golfers are already trying to do with varying degrees of
success.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice for a better golf game focused on the mental game
and fitness, which are not often mentioned on other sites. Here, a
lot of space is devoted to the mental game. An article about
overcoming blocks suggests the use of neuro-linguistic programming,
a ``technique that psychotherapists use with people who suffer from
post-traumatic stress _ victims emotionally traumatized by war,
floods, bombings, rape and the like.'' And don't forget to bend
your knees.
</P>
<P>
   When you're ready to take your neuro-linguistic programming out
on the greens, World Golf has a section in which readers offer
their own reviews of golf courses around the world. The reviews
range from the short (``not a bad course'') to detailed
shot-by-shot reports on individual holes. (``Greens could be
redone,'' a golfer said about the Oyster Bay Golf Club on Long
Island. ``They get chewed up real fast.'')
</P>
<P>
   Any criticism found there is in contrast to the site's
unimpressive reports on golf travel destinations around the world.
Like too much of the writing on these sites, the text seemed lifted
from brochures.
</P>
<P>
   For people who want to read about golf, this may be one of the
sites to visit. It is not exceptional nor is it fancy, but it does
have interesting content and a certain charm.
</P>
<P>
   LPGA.COM
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Who has earned the most money on the women's professional golf
tour this year? What is the women's equivalent of the Ryder Cup
called? Who won the U.S. Women's Open last year?
</P>
<P>
   If you can't answer these questions, don't worry: Neither can
many die-hard sports fans. (The answers, by the way, are Karrie
Webb, the Solheim Cup and Se Ri-pak.) Facts like these are the
staple of this Web site, home of the Ladies Professional Golf
Association, the organization that oversees the women's golf tour.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the site consists of almanac-style information, like
lists of the longest hitters and the winners of all the
championships since 1950. There are also updates from recent
tournaments and biographies of several hundred regular competitors.
What the site doesn't impart is any reason to know any of these
facts.
</P>
<P>
   Women's golf has traditionally teed off in the long shadow of
the men's game. But with female stars of basketball, soccer and
particularly tennis drawing attention, you might think the LPGA
would be ready to put its stars in the spotlight. Sadly, this site
does very little to advance the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The site contains very little to get a visitor excited about the
sport. The biographies, for example, are simply dry recitations of
accomplishments and an occasional predictable aside. ``Credits her
parents and coach Kelvin Haller as the individuals most influencing
her career'' is the sort of white-bread description the site offers
for Karrie Webb, one of the hottest golfers on the tour this year.
Nor does the site contain features that might give some sense of
life on the tour, like action photographs or interviews with
players.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly disappointing section was the one devoted to
the history of women's golf, which I thought would feature pages of
information about the pioneers of the game with photographs of
equipment, clothing and players. But the reality is far less
satisfying, with each decade, beginning with the 1950s, recounted
with one unidentified photograph and a few paragraphs of
generalities about, for instance, increases in prize money and
television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this site works only as a source of updated tour
results. It would greatly benefit from an infusion of flash.

SOME FEAR RUSSIA MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MANAGE ITS 
REACTORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (See also RUSSIA-Y2K, U.N.-Y2K) 
 (HLW)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The Deputy Atomic Energy Minister Valentin Ivanov has
good reason to promise that Russia's 29 nuclear reactors will be
free of the Year 2000 computer problem in January. The reactors, it
seems, are largely free of computers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivanov said, at the nuclear station nearest to Moscow,
``the general engineer promises that he'll have a New Year's party,
and he's invited me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although American experts said they would quite likely accept
such an invitations, they still have nagging questions about how
ready the reactors are. The experts said they were unsure whether
engineers could locate and check all the microchips and other
digital improvements that have been added to Soviet-era plants over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   The experts worry that Russian engineers, adept at handling
breakdowns in sometimes creaky plants, might be overwhelmed if four
or five systems fail at once, and they wonder whether backup
systems for water and power are sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the experts wonder whether the cash-depleted
government can really oversee all the work at stations flung across
10 time zones, some so remote that it is tough to administer them
even in normal times.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're taking it seriously,'' an American official said.
``Our concern is that they won't do enough, either because there
are some pockets in Russia that still aren't taking it seriously,
even though they've been ordered by the government to do things, or
because they lack the resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The official echoed an analysis by the Pacific Northwest
National Laboratories of the U.S. Energy Department about potential
Year 2000 flaws in Soviet-style reactors. The report found that
senior Russian officials had made reactor safety a priority, but
that ``the level of effort devoted to date varied from site to site
and organization to organization.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, American experts worry that the nuclear-energy
industry is so short of cash and time that even some obvious flaws
will go uncorrected. Those experts stress that their views are only
well-educated guesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans have visited all 66 Soviet-style reactors in
Russia and surrounding nations, they have not evaluated the plants
for Year 2000 vulnerabilities. In general, they said, the
millennium bug poses a small threat.
</P>
<P>
   Most ``mission critical'' functions, including crucial water
pumps, are controlled by analog devices. Some flawed computers or
chips could force a plant to shut down, but none appears vital to
stopping reactors in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, a reactor can usually be shut down instantly.
But operators still need to pump cool water to the core for a few
days, until the plant is completely stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   That underscores American experts' second concern, that reactors
could be hampered by the failure of regional power grids or other
utilities and that backup systems at cash-strapped reactors might
prove inadequate. As in the West, Russian nuclear stations have
emergency backups like multiple generators. But they can be
thwarted by many factors like poor maintenance or a shortage of
diesel fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even in Western plants,'' an American said, ``the systems
don't work right all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian experts nevertheless said they were atop the situation.
The top Year 2000 official in the Atomic Energy Ministry, Yuri
Sokolov, said in March that experts had checked 97 percent of
date-sensitive reactor components. Sokolov did not say what that
review found, but he said his ministry would use all means at its
disposal to correct any flawed hardware or programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said flatly that the only computer systems with potential
problems are those that process data and that all systems that
affect critical reactor operations had, been deemed safe, as have
the systems that contain radiation at the plants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he indicated that Russian experts harbored some of the
lingering concerns that nag American scientists. Some programs that
monitor and schedule maintenance are not ready, he said. Operators
will rely on paper schedules and forgo unplanned repairs in the
period around Jan. 1. Computers that control electricity in
regional power grids also need changes, Ivanov added.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, he allowed that some secondary safety
systems involving tasks like water and fire control might have
problems. But he pledged that those and other deficiencies would be
fixed or that the systems will be under human control on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear-power industry is in dire straits. Rosenergoatom,
the state-owned company that oversees reactor operations and power
sales, owes scores of millions of dollars in debt to tax
authorities and its suppliers, and the business came under criminal
investigation in February.
</P>
<P>
   One reactor complex in eastern Russia recently went 18 months
without collecting even a kopeck from electricity customers, who
paid their bills with barter _ if they paid them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Spare parts can be at a premium, and a number of reactors are
overdue for renovation or retirement. Ivanov said that the minimum
budget for updating reactors was $1.8 million and that plant
workers will be carrying out most of the work. If others wish to
offer financial aid, he added, ``we will accept it gladly.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, it turns out, is not the Americans' greatest concern.
The greatest potential for problems is in Ukraine, which is in even
worse financial shape. It has 14 reactors in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Armenia, home to one Soviet-style reactor, is another potential
problem spot, the experts said. The Energy Department has conducted
workshops in former Soviet nations since last year. But American
officials said it was difficult to know how extensively those
workers had inspected their equipment.

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 Thin servers help companies get around Internet congestion 
 &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  One hurdle small businesses
<TEXT>
face in the e-commerce age is finding quick-and-simple e-mail
service and online access for all employees through a single
Internet connection.
<P>
   A growing number of companies are tackling the problem with
so-called thin server Internet appliances. The devices, about the
size of a toaster and as easy to use, sell for around $1,500 to
$3,000. They allow up to 100 employees working on computers in a
small office to do a variety of tasks such as:
</P>
<P>
   _Send and receive e-mail inside and outside the office.
</P>
<P>
   _Connect to and gather information on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _Set up and maintain a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   _Maintain privacy and security for individual and company files.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, these little boxes don't require a software
guru to set up or manage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leading companies in this fast-growing e-commerce
niche are based in the Bay Area. They include Cobalt Networks of
Mountain View, Encanto Networks of Santa Clara and Whistle
Communications of Foster City.
</P>
<P>
   Ramp Networks, a Santa Clara maker of routing equipment that
lets employees in a small office share the same Internet
connection, yesterday raised $57.5 million in its initial stock
offering. Ramp shares rose 52.3 percent, from $11 to $16.75, giving
the company a market value of about $335 million.
</P>
<P>
   As another sign of the importance of this market, International
Business Machines Corp. bought Whistle Communications two weeks ago
as a key part of its campaign to expand its presence in the
small-business market. No price was announced, but informed sources
say it topped $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whistle CEO John Hamm compares his company's ``InterJet''
product to the Swiss Army knife. ``It's an all-in-one device for
small business,'' he said. ``Everything you need is right there.''
</P>
<P>
   The company started 31/2 years ago to simplify the complex task
of establishing Internet communications in small businesses and to
remove the barriers preventing nontechnical organizations from
fully participating in the online revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Weiser, executive producer and partner at Compass Rose
Media in Santa Cruz, is sold on the product. ``It's the coolest box
on the planet,'' he said. ``You plug it in and don't know it's
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produce films and commercial videos and rely on the Web and
electronic communication to an incredible degree. We couldn't do
business where we do without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiser's company learned about the product a couple of years ago
while doing a video for Whistle Communications and quickly dumped
its dedicated server and special software for the easy-to-use
Internet appliance. All nine employees are hooked up for e-mail,
and the company can quickly contact its 100 temp employees as well
as customers in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising Magic of Walnut Creek is another fan. The company,
which stamps logos and custom-printed messages on thousands of
promotional items from mugs and T-shirts to pens and paper clip
holders, had a network computer and half-dozen workstations two
years ago. But it suffered a serious bottleneck getting electronic
information to and from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Clients such as BART, Safeway and radio station K101 e-mailed
their logos and other data to a single computer with Internet
access. And all the final designs similarly had to be funneled to
hundreds of contract manufacturers through the lone Internet access
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees started coming to me one, then two, then 10
times a day to ask if their art work had come in or been sent
out,'' recalled Vice President Hari Boukis, 33, who runs the small
business with his CEO wife, Rosalind. ``It got to the point I
wasn't getting any other work done. I was an e-mail downloader.''
</P>
<P>
   Boukis began looking for technology solutions to this
information stranglehold and discovered an ad for Whistle's
InterJet in a trade magazine. He was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You basically sign up with a small business ISP (Internet
Service Provider), plug one end of the box into the computer hub
and the other into a phone, enter a code number and press go,''
said Boukis. ``A child could set this up.''
</P>
<P>
   The little tan box that Advertising Magic bought from Whistle
for $2,600 in 1997 now costs about $1,500. But Boukis is happy he
didn't wait to buy the system. All eight employees are
e-mail-enabled and together send and receive up to 9,000 messages a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also send queries and order products at the
company's Web site (www.advertisingmagic.com). Boukis said the
company picks ups as many as 15 new clients a day off the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks in large part to its leap to e-commerce, Advertising
Magic anticipates reaching $1.9 million in revenues this year,
compared to $1.3 million last year and about $1 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet appliance convert is Anderson Brule Architects
in San Jose. Two years ago, the firm had e-mail coming in to just
one computer. ``It wasn't working too well,'' said project
architect Krista Falkenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients expected us all to have e-mail, but it was only
checked occasionally, and someone here might not know for two days
that there were drawings or other messages waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, all 40 employees get e-mail in a flash, and Falkenberg
notes that access to Internet research also has made the firm more
efficient.

COURT REDRAWS BORDER BETWEEN STATES' RIGHTS AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday severely limited the
ability of people to sue states under federal law, and in the
process it substantially redrew the border between state
sovereignty and federal authority.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 decision that evoked bitter emotions among the
justices, the court dismissed a lawsuit by a group of
state-employed probation officers in Maine who sought to enforce a
federal labor law and collect overtime pay. The justices also
rejected two lawsuits accusing Florida of violating federal patent
and trademark laws.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the Constitution's ``structure and history''
shields states not only from being sued by individuals in federal
courts but also makes them immune in state courts from individual
lawsuits seeking to enforce a federal right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The generation that designed and adopted our federal system
considered immunity from private suits central to sovereign
dignity,'' Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the court's decision, the state employees in
Maine, who have a right to overtime pay under the 1938 Fair Labor
Standards Act, now have no way to enforce that right themselves.
Their only option is ask the Labor Department to sue the state of
Maine on their behalf in federal court. A lawyer for the probation
officers said Wednesday they had not decided whether to seek the
department's help.
</P>
<P>
   In broader terms, the justices' decision marked another retreat
from decades of expansively interpreted federal authority, which
began with the New Deal era. Especially in recent years, a narrow
but potent majority led by Rehnquist has emphasized that states
have powers that Congress must respect.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the court ruled that Congress had exceeded its
authority when it banned guns near public schools. It threw out the
ban in a San Antonio case, saying the law relied on Congress's
power to regulate interstate commerce but failed to show how such
commerce was involved in areas near local schools.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the court limited Congress's ability to make states
vulnerable to lawsuits in federal court, and in 1997 it said
Congress had overstepped its powers in a section of the so-called
Brady gun control law that forced states to use local law
enforcement officers to perform background checks on gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Vazquez, a constitutional law expert at Georgetown
University, said of Wednesday's decisions, ``The court signaled
once again that when it's faced with a dispute between state and
federal rights, states win.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the court's tilt toward state sovereignty likely will
continue so long as the five-justice conservative coalition remains
intact.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fontaine, a Portland, Maine, lawyer who represented the
probation workers, called the ruling against his clients part of
``an extraordinary, conservative revolution against basic civil
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The emotional division on the issue between that coalition and
the court's more liberal justices _ John Paul Stevens, David H.
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer _ was on display
Wednesday during an extraordinarily long courtroom session that
closed the court's 1998-99 term.
</P>
<P>
   Reading portions of his 51-page opinion, Kennedy emphasized the
importance of a nation built on the idea of two distinct
sovereignties _ the federal government and the individual states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress must accord states the esteem due to them as joint
participants in a federal system,'' he said. ``Congress has vast
power but not all power.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that states ``are not relegated to the role of mere
provinces or political corporations, but retain the dignity, though
not the full authority, of sovereignty. Although the Constitution
begins with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people,
it does not follow that the national government becomes the
ultimate, preferred mechanism for expressing the people's will. The
states exist as a refutation of that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter responded by reading for 15 minutes from his 58-page
dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's insistence that the federal structure bars
Congress from making states susceptible to suit in their own courts
is plain wrong,'' he said, adding that the court's reasoning was
``unrealistic'' and ``indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter accused the court majority of creating ``a very peculiar
state of affairs'' for those wanting to enforce their legal rights
against a state government.
</P>
<P>
   In the Maine case, 65 probation officers sued the state in 1992
in federal court, saying they were owed overtime pay guaranteed
under the FLSA.
</P>
<P>
   But while their lawsuit was pending, the Supreme Court ruled in
1996 that the Constitution's 11th Amendment, which limits the
judicial power of the federal government, shields states from being
sued against their will in federal court. With the option of
federal court blocked, the probation officers refiled their lawsuit
in state court, still depending on the FLSA.
</P>
<P>
   However, a year later, a Maine Superior Court in Cumberland
ruled that the 11th Amendment makes states immune from state court
lawsuits that would be barred in federal courts. The court also
said that the 11th Amendment makes a state totally immune from
being sued by employees who allege labor-law violations, although
it said federal labor officials still could sue the state to
enforce the law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Maine Supreme Judicial Court agreed with the
decision, and on Wednesday, the nation's highest court affirmed
that ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The court's conservative coalition also triumphed in the other
two cases, one on whether states can be sued for patent
infringement in violation of federal law and the other on whether
states can be sued for engaging in false advertising.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In those decisions, the court invoked state sovereign immunity
to shield Florida from having to defend itself in federal courts
against private lawsuits attacking its program to help families
save for the cost of the state's public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases involved a dispute between College Savings Bank, a
private company in Princeton, N.J., that sells certificates of
deposit for financing future costs of education, and the state of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, College Savings Bank sued Florida, alleging
that the state's program offering a similar product violates
federal patent and trademark laws. College Savings Bank contended
that the Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board
violated the bank's patent for administering its CollegeSure CD.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, College Savings Bank accused the state of
making misstatements about its tuition plans in its brochures and
annual reports, a violation of the federal Trademark Remedy
Clarification Act (TRCA) of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, a U.S. District Court ruled in 1996 that the
state could not be sued in federal court under the TRCA. A year
later, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. On
Wednesday, the Supreme Court affirmed the appeals court's rulings
in the cases.

SALINGER'S DAUGHTER PLANS TO PUBLISH A MEMOIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The daughter of the obsessively private author J.D. Salinger is
preparing to publish a memoir of her childhood and relationship
with her father.
</P>
<P>
   The book by Margaret (Peggy) Salinger, 43, is tentatively titled
``The Dream Catcher'' and is scheduled to be published by Simon &AMP;
Schuster's Pocket Books in the fall of 2000. The news comes the
same week that Salinger's carefully guarded privacy was breached by
the auction of letters that Salinger wrote to the writer Joyce
Maynard in the early 1970s. Ms. Maynard has been fiercely
criticized for writing a memoir, ``At Home in the World,'' that
included details of their nine-month romance when she was an
18-year-old Yale University student and Salinger was 53.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger's memoir is important and ``tells a story of a
child who grew up in a way that was different from what most people
experience,'' said Judith M. Curr, who noted that Ms. Salinger will
also write about her relationship with her father, who is now 80.
Ms. Curr signed the title as her first book since becoming Pocket
Book's president and publisher in April. ``I think that it will be
a wonderful book and will sell for many years to come,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The memoir, plans for which were reported in The New York
Observer this week, has had a tortured history since her literary
agent, Morton Janklow, circulated a sketchy manuscript proposal
about three years ago. Originally Ms. Salinger had signed with
Riverhead Books, an imprint of Penguin Putnam Inc., for a
seven-figure advance to write the memoir, but a conflict developed
with that publisher, Janklow said. ``She was very unhappy for
undefined reasons,'' said Janklow, who added that he urged her to
stay with Riverhead because it was unlikely that she could obtain
as much of an advance elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, he said, Ms. Salinger moved on, also severing her
ties to him with a letter from her lawyer, who also asked Janklow
to return his literary commission.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curr said she had no doubts about publishing the book
despite Ms. Salinger's split with her previous publisher. People
with knowledge of the split said that the author and Riverhead
parted over changes that Ms. Salinger was asked to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no qualms whatsoever,'' Ms. Curr said. ``If everybody
had only one point of view in publishing we'd only have three books
published every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curr added that Pocket Books had received no reaction to the
book from Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger did not respond to a call for comment placed
through her lawyer, Philip M. Cowan, who declined to outline the
contents of her manuscript. Ms. Salinger's current literary agent,
Robert Gottlieb, with the William Morris Agency, also declined to
comment about the book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salinger received an advance from Pocket Books of more than
$250,000, which was much smaller than her arrangement with
Riverhead.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright issues came up when the book was being prepared for
publication at Riverhead. In 1987, Salinger blocked the publication
of a biography by Ian Hamilton that relied on unpublished letters
written by Salinger to his editor and friend, Whit Burnett.
Salinger copyrighted the letters to frustrate the author's plan to
quote extensively from them.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Curr said that she expected that copyright issues would
not be a concern with Ms. Salinger's book.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to observe all copyright laws,'' she said. ``But
it's Peggy's life that she's writing about. I don't believe it's
going to be an issue.''

THE STUFF OF LEGEND IN A BRAZILIAN SLUM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Even before he emerged as a torchbearer
of the Cinema Novo movement here in the 1960s, the director Carlos
``Caca'' Diegues yearned to film the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he admits, as he was working on the 13 movies on
his resume, including ``Bye-Bye Brazil'' and ``Xica da Silva,''
images of what a Brazilian version of the myth would look and sound
like constantly filled his imagination.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the French director Marcel Camus had already
taken the same ancient Greek legend of a passion so strong that it
surmounts death and transferred it to one of Rio de Janeiro's
favelas, or hillside squatter settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Diegues was always convinced that he could tell the story
better. Now, after more than 40 years of dreams, delays and dashed
hopes, his persistence has paid off: ``Orfeu'' is showing in
Brazilian theaters and may be released later by Warner Brothers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Diegues is emphatic when he says that his Orpheus ``is not a
remake of the first version, in the same sense that Baz Luhrmann's
`Romeo and Juliet' is not a remake of Zeffirelli's.'' Camus'
``Black Orpheus'' won both the top prize at the Cannes
International Film Festival in 1959 and the Oscar for best foreign
film a year later, but here in Brazil his movie has always been
regarded as overly romanticized and lacking authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian poet and playwright Vinicius de Moraes, whose play
``Orfeu da Conceicao'' was the basis for that film, even asked that
his name be taken off the screenplay, so unhappy was he with the
final result.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Black Orpheus' is not an exploitative film,'' Diegues said.
``You can see that it was made with real affection and enthusiasm.
Camus fell in love with Rio and its culture, but he made a
superficial film about something he didn't really understand. It's
as if I were to go to France to make a movie about Joan of Arc.
That's not to say I don't know anything about her. But there are
others in France who know much more than I could ever hope to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   To restore what he considered the proper tone and focus,
Diegues, who is 59, went back to de Moraes' play, which places
greater emphasis on Orpheus' relationship with his community and
parents. In the original legend, Orpheus, a poet and musician,
descends to the underworld to rescue his beloved, Eurydice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing that play at the Teatro Municipal as a teen-ager in
1956 was one of the principal formative cultural experiences of my
life,'' he said. ``It not only touched me deeply; it made me
discover things about Brazilian reality I had not imagined before
and helped set me on the road to this life I have as a maker of
films.''
</P>
<P>
   Diegues and de Moraes, who is probably best known outside Brazil
as the author of the lyrics to the song ``The Girl From Ipanema,''
became friends during the heyday of Cinema Novo, which combined
magical and social realism.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, after Diegues had a worldwide hit with ``Bye-Bye
Brazil,'' the French company Gaumont offered to bankroll any movie
he wanted to make. He immediately chose ``Orfeu'' and enlisted de
Moraes as his partner in writing a new script.
</P>
<P>
   But de Moraes died just as the project was getting under way,
and then rights to the play became tied up in a complicated legal
dispute. More than a decade later, de Moraes' children asked
Diegues whether he was still interested in tackling the story, and
again he jumped at the opportunity to film ``the myth that best
explains the destiny and frustrated vocation of the Brazilian
nation,'' as Caetano Veloso, the singer and songwriter who
supervised the movie's soundtrack, said.
</P>
<P>
   Diegues, his admiration for the play notwithstanding, knew that
he could not hope to duplicate its exact mood or texture. ``This is
a film about Rio at the end of the century, not the Rio of 1956,''
he said. Since the city of today is a much more violent and callous
place, that means Diegues' version of the Orpheus legend has far
more of an edge than either of its predecessors.

TRADED GORTER TRAINS WITH HIS OLD TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wednesday was Edwin Gorter's first day as a Revolution foe. But
he spent it as a friend. Though player-coach Walter Zenga traded
Gorter to Miami for defender Mario Gori Tuesday, he permitted
Gorter to continue training with the Revolution at Babson College
in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a normal thing, because Edwin has to train,'' Zenga said.
``He asked me if he could come to training and I didn't have
anything against it. It's the right thing to do, because I made a
deal with (Miami coach) Ivo Wortmann and he is expecting a player
who is in good physical condition.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Gorter went through the conditioning and stretching drills
as the Revolution prepared for Saturday's visit to Dallas. Gorter
submitted to Zenga's general bawling out of the team during a
scrimmage and concluded the session, as usual, with some
light-hearted bets on spot kicks. Then, Gorter drove his black
Volkswagen to Quincy and prepared to move to Fort Lauderdale, where
his new team will meet San Jose Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for me to go,'' Gorter said. ``But this is the
life of a soccer player. The coaches have made a decision here and
I am sure they can live with their decision. If they lose the next
three or four games, they will have to answer for it. But, again,
that is soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed things and I said I'm not 19, I will turn 36 in
two weeks, and this is the last year of my career. I want to finish
my career in a nice way. I am happy to be going to Miami, which in
my opinion is one of the most beautiful places in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorter's experience with the Revolution was mostly
disillusioning. Former Revolution coach Thomas Rongen billed Gorter
as a rival for Marco Etcheverry and Carlos Valderrama, but midway
through the 1998 season, Gorter had been converted to a defender as
the team took desperate measures to break a losing streak. Zenga
took over as coach, and began planning for this season, even
extending the practice schedule for two weeks after the final game
of the regular season. On the final day of training in October,
Gorter was refereeing a scrimmage that concluded with a
racially-tinged fight between he and David Nakhid.
</P>
<P>
   Gorter was fined $25,000 and suspended two games by the league.
Though Gorter and Zenga seemed compatible then _ they are nearly
the same age, both speak English and Italian _ conflicts soon
became apparent. Gorter did not join the Revolution for preseason
training in Foxborough, instead meeting the team in Italy in
February. Gorter was behind on his conditioning, reasoning that he
did not have to be prepared until the third game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When Gorter finally regained his starting position, against
Columbus April 17, he was replaced in the 55th minute, leading to a
sideline argument with assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi. Gorter
started only twice more in midfield, but was effective at sweeper
in a 2-0 win over Chicago and as a substitute in a 3-3 tie with
Miami in which he converted the tying goal and the deciding goal in
the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   But though Gorter traveled with the Revolution to their last two
games, he was not listed among the substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unlucky here,'' Gorter said. ``At the beginning of the
1998 season we were playing good soccer. But then there were
injuries, red cards, players leaving for the World Cup. I
sacrificed myself, playing 10 games as libero (sweeper), doing my
best for the team. But I don't regret it. I enjoyed my life here
and I will be leaving a lot of friends and I will miss the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Gorter will be expected to fill the midfield slot left
open after Valderrama was sent to Tampa Bay in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Revolution appear to be establishing a midfield
with John Harkes and Jair directing the tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Gori was scheduled to arrive in Boston Wednesday night and could
play against Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zenga will return to Milan after the game to visit his children.
``I have three kids and I miss them,'' he said. ``It's worth it to
see them even for one day, buy them an ice cream, then say goodbye,
I'll see you at Christmas.'' . . . Zenga confirmed the visit of
former Inter defender Giuseppe Bergomi, possibly when the
Revolution play host to Ajax in an exhibition July 21 or the D.C.
United game July 25.

 RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil: its predecessors.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Brazil has a tremendous vocation for killing poor people,''
said Paulo Lins, a novelist and former slum dweller who worked with
Diegues on the script. ``Just look at all the violence that goes on
in the countryside, at the slaughter of street kids in the cities,
at the massacres of prisoners in jails. So I regard this movie as a
tragedy, as a microcosm of what goes on all the time in Brazilian
society.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring the text up to date, Diegues has added the figure of
Lucinho, the drug trafficker and gang leader who controls the
favela where Orfeu (Toni Garrido) and Euridice (Patricia Franca),
fall in love on the eve of Carnival. A boyhood friend of Orfeu,
Lucinho grows up to be as bloodthirsty, unscrupulous and ruthless
as the police whose anger he brings down on the entire community.
</P>
<P>
   The music that was crucial to ``Black Orpheus'' has also been
adjusted to reflect different times. The Camus film helped
introduce the delicate bossa nova to the outside world, but the
music most often heard in Brazilian slums today is rap, and so the
soundtrack includes not only a glorious ballad Veloso composed as a
love theme for Orfeu and Euridice and a jaunty samba, but also some
hard-hitting hip-hop by newer artists as yet unknown abroad.
</P>
<P>
   For the title role, Diegues tested ``more than 120 actors,
musicians and singers from Rio, Sao Paulo and Bahia'' before
settling on Garrido, 32, lead singer of the popular samba-reggae
group Cidade Negra, or Black City. The choice was controversial
here, because Garrido's experience as an actor was scant. But
Garrido brought other assets to the film that, he and Diegues
agree, would have been hard to find elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need a laboratory to learn about the reality this
film portrays,'' Garrido said. ``I'm a black guy who was born in a
favela, and though I was later to live among whites in Copacabana,
I understand the favela's code of honor and know what it means to
be a poor dude who lives for his art and sees it as a trampoline to
better things. I was able to draw on a life experience that is
essential to the poetic sensibility of the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrido had never seen the Camus film, and still hasn't: ``Caca
didn't want me to see it, so I didn't,'' he explains. But to
Diegues, that is beside the point. ``Toni doesn't have to interpret
the role of Orfeu,'' he said. ``He is Orfeu, and the fact that he
is a musician means that he can project onto the screen all the
nobility and poetry of Brazilian popular music.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Camus film and some of Diegues' recent movies,
``Orfeu'' has become a certified box-office success here, drawing
more than a million spectators into theaters since its release in
April. But Diegues has also made a point of taking his movie into
the same favelas where many of its scenes were shot, hoping to
assure that residents unable to afford $5 for a ticket have a
chance to see their own reality portrayed on film.
</P>
<P>
   At one such session in April, several thousand people in the
Vigario Geral slum attended a showing organized on their behalf.
Afterward, there was a vigorous discussion of the movie and how the
characters and story line corresponded to daily life in their own
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   One line in particular, uttered by Orfeu and cited by
slumdwellers at all of the screenings, seems to reflect the
bitterness and sense of isolation and neglect they feel: ``The only
thing the government sends up the hill is the police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most gratifying night I have had in connection
with this film, even more than the night of the premiere,'' Diegues
said recently. ``I don't make movies to teach, I make them to
learn, and I'm happy that this movie has been able to throw light
on a subject and a reality that a lot of people would prefer to
ignore.''

VAN GOGH FEVER SHIFTS TO HIS NEW AMSTERDAM HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ When the Van Gogh Museum closed for
renovation and expansion in September, the focus of Vincent worship
shifted to an exhibition of ``Van Gogh's van Goghs'' traveling to
Washington and Los Angeles. In Amsterdam, however, the artist's
unwavering popularity simply assumed a different form, as $35.5
million was spent on preparing the museum to handle ever larger
numbers of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Now less than 10 months later, ``Van Gogh's van Goghs'' have
returned here to find their permanent home transformed by the
addition of a handsome new annex as well as by major refurbishment
of its main building. With the reopening Thursday, the museum can
for the first time display all 207 paintings from its van Gogh
collection and simultaneously organize temporary exhibitions in the
new annex.
</P>
<P>
   In an age of mass museumgoing, museum expansions have, of
course, become common symbols of prestige and prosperity. The
National Gallery of Art in Washington and the Louvre in Paris have
already grown, while the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the
Tate Gallery in London will soon have impressive new annexes. For
the van Gogh Museum, though, more fundamental issues were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Crowd management was certainly a factor. When the museum opened
in 1973, it estimated that 60,000 would visit a year; by 1986 there
were 600,000 visits each year, and by 1990 annual attendance had
leveled off at 1.2 million. With the $14.5 million redesign, a new
office building has freed space for more exhibition room and a more
spacious lobby and museum shop. New lighting and air-conditioning
have also been installed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no matter how many tourists include it on their ``must see''
list, any museum dedicated to a sole, dead artist risks becoming a
mausoleum. And there lies the importance of the $21 million annex
designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. The museum is
counting on temporary exhibitions to keep it vigorous, starting
with one dedicated to van Gogh's dealer and collector brother,
Theo, through Sept. 5, followed by ``From Cezanne to van Gogh: The
Collection of Dr. Gachet,'' which is at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Having identified the key to its future a decade ago, though,
the museum still faced opposition to its plan to place an
ultramodern building on the Museumplein, the vast expanse of green
that stretches from the venerable Rijksmuseum to the no less
revered Concertgebouw, home of Amsterdam's famed symphony
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   When the design was unveiled in 1991, an action committee was
promptly formed to block the project. Only after five years of
arguing did a Dutch court finally give the go-ahead for
construction of the annex.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was familiar because the museum itself has never been
a much loved building here. Its design was based on sketches made
in 1963 by Gerrit Rietveld, a septuagenarian architect who belonged
to the Stijl movement in the 1920s and whose modernist ideas looked
outdated when the museum was inaugurated in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Vincent Willem van Gogh, Theo's son, who ceded his
collection to the museum, answered critics with a prescient phrase:
``This was our approach, but in 25 years they will perhaps have
completely different ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The new annex was made possible by a $18 million
donation from Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. Ltd.,
which owns one of van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' paintings. Along with
the gift came the suggestion that Kurokawa serve as the project's
architect. In accepting the deal, museum officials were
acknowledging that no attempt would be made to echo Rietveld's
building, and that the strong personality of Kurokawa's style would
inevitably make itself felt on the Museumplein.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the museum's geometric lines, the freestanding
annex has the form of a slightly rotated ellipse, itself divided
between a three-floor building and a sunken courtyard,
imperceptibly sloping so that water can trickle across it like a
broad horizontal fountain. The materials used here and their
predominantly gray colors, inspired by twilight in Kyoto, are also
unusual for Amsterdam: granite for the curvilinear facade
overlooking the Museumplein; titanium for the convex roof and
poolside elevation, and aluminum for the box-shaped room that
protrudes over the courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from the Museumplein, the annex looks somewhat bunkerlike
and, even though Kurokawa said he was seeking ``symbiosis of
environment and architecture,'' it appears to make little attempt
to integrate with its surroundings. On the other hand, viewed from
the museum or the public path separating the two buildings, where
nothing but the annex can be seen, it is both striking in
appearance and welcoming. And this impression is reinforced as
visitors take an escalator from the museum down to the sunken
courtyard, with the passage between buildings barely noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Kurokawa, 65, who already has a dozen museums to his name, again
uses the word symbiosis to describe his fusion of Japanese and
European cultures in the museum annex. Indeed, his original idea
was to turn the courtyard into a Japanese garden, although its
present austere emptiness is perhaps more appropriate. Even so,
some critics have noted that a distinctly Japanese concern for
detail is evident in the immaculate finishing of the annex's
interiors, with their wooden floors, glass and steel doors and
metal gray sun screens.
</P>
<P>
   For many tourists, of course, word that the Van Gogh Museum has
reopened is good news enough. After the museum closed last year, an
official was stationed for weeks at its entrance to explain
patiently to disappointed tourists why they could not enter this
shrine to van Gogh. Now on the museum's spacious second floor and
third-floor study area, they can study van Gogh's paintings from as
early as 1881 in the Netherlands to just days before his suicide on
July 29, 1890, in France.
</P>
<P>
   For those able to glance away from the van Goghs long enough to
contemplate the architecture, however, the courtyard gallery of the
annex is presenting a retrospective of Kurokawa's work through Nov.
14 with drawings, photographs and models of his best known projects
in Japan and Europe. The rest of the annex is given over to the
exhibition dedicated to Theo van Gogh, which includes works by
Monet, Gauguin and Toulouse-Lautrec, with whom Theo collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   For those accustomed to walking past the Van Gogh Museum,
however, there can be no overlooking the new annex. If they worry
that it looks intrusive, though, they should hold their judgment.
The entire Museumplein is being redesigned by the Danish landscape
architect Sven-Ingvar Andersson. And beside the van Gogh Museum the
Stedelijk Museum is planning its own extension, designed by the
Portuguese architect Alvaro Siza. Amsterdammers will soon have
still more to argue about.

`ANDES RISING': MISSING MAN, RARE BIRD AND THE GREATER MYSTERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD EDER   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is, or was, a children's game in which one player names
three things utterly unlike _ a locomotive, say, a wad of chewed
gum, a canary _ and another tries to weave them into a story. The
connections were strained and the narrative rickety, but it gave
the imagination a jolt. At the least it was fun, and every so often
it knocked loose an enticing image or idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andes Rising,'' as uneven as the mountains themselves and with
several mountaintop views, assembles the following:
</P>
<P>
   A California rabbi, part mystic and part chicken-soup practical,
who sets out in search of:
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged physicist, sickened by his work on nuclear
weapons, who joins the Peace Corps in Colombia and mysteriously
disappears there. He had devoted himself to studying Colombian
birds; his model and imaginary antagonist was:
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chapman, an eminent ornithologist who from 1908 to 1935
shot and set up the specimens in the vast bird collection at the
American Museum of Natural History in New York.
</P>
<P>
   From these, James Munves has put together a fanciful artichoke
of a novel. It consists of a spiral of leaves and a heart, but the
leaves are of assorted shapes and flavors, and some are missing;
and though they lead to the heart they do it erratically and only
partly attached. The heart is a parable about the conflict between
progress and the irreplaceable particulars of humanity and nature.
</P>
<P>
   Start with a few of the leaves. First: Rabbi Teitelbaum,
displaced from a comfortable California life by the importunings of
Sadie Cooper, his sister-in-law's sister-in-law's mother-in-law. A
news item has convinced her that Thomas Cooper, her physicist
son-turned-Peace Corps-bird lover, did not perish in a Colombian
rock slide nine years earlier but is alive somewhere in the
country's interior.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum must find him. The mission is comically improbable
but the rabbi, a Talmudist with cabalistic leanings, conceals a
boundlessly inquisitive spirit under his rationalization _ namely,
that ``Sadie was a widow, which it is my duty to help. Also she
happens to be the biggest benefactor of Sholom Tefila.''
</P>
<P>
   First, in Miami, he talks to a Hungarian, Arpad, who ``looked
like a fruit salad, in a green and orange shirt, yellow shorts,
white sneakers, red hair and mustaches.'' Arpad had been kidnapped
by a band of armed men in Colombia, exhibited in a cage and then
set free (Sadie's news item). The band's leader wore a watch like
Thomas' and seemed to know English (the tenuous basis for the
rabbi's mission).
</P>
<P>
   Freed along with Arpad, Teitelbaum tells us, were the birds he
had ostensibly been collecting. This crooked Papageno's catches,
though, were ``stuffed with cocaine and are now flying all over the
jungle.'' So, were the armed men after the drugs? Could they
conceivably be bird liberationists?
</P>
<P>
   It is here that Thomas makes his appearance; not in person but
in diaries that Teitelbaum locates, after a series of nervous
forays in a remote Colombian farmhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries recount Thomas' story. There are brief allusions to
his work at Los Alamos and to his presence at an underground
nuclear explosion. There is a later conversation about the 1950s
disarmament talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.
Thomas, an adviser to the U.S. delegation, became convinced that
neither side was serious about disarming.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a sketch, jerry-built to explain Thomas' retreat
years later to the Eastern Andes to study birds for a Peace Corps
project. It contrasts with the artful and suggestive account,
tinged with mystery, of his life with the birds, his discovery of a
tanager never before seen in that part of Colombia and his refusal
to shoot specimens and bring them back to Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian authorities, anxious to justify the ornithological
project, insisted; Thomas' Peace Corps superior, though
sympathetic, turned up with a rifle to do the job. It was at that
point that the rock slide occurred: seemingly though not certainly
burying Thomas and sealing up access to the tanagers' domain.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' fate remains cloudy (though it is more jerry-building to
imply that he  &UR; might &LR;  have organized pro-bird guerrillas. How? With
whom?). So does the possibility that he might have triggered the
slide himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such holes and haste, ``Andes Rising'' does some
remarkable things. Munves beautifully evokes Thomas' temporary
Andes Eden. The discussion of birds, the detailed distinctions of
markings and habitat go on at length; yet they are not tedious. On
the contrary, they are uplifting. They are part of the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Their scrupulous notation signals something larger. Thomas had
fled the deadly scientific universals he had known in Los Alamos to
live among Andean particulars. Seeing his tanager just once or
twice was enough; science and scientific bureaucracy demand
reproducibility _ and dead birds.
</P>
<P>
   Against odds, the parable largely works. So does the recurring
dialogue between an unraveling Thomas and the dead Chapman, author
of classic studies of Colombian and American birds. He had brought
back 10,000 ``skins'' of shot specimens. Why shoot even one?,
Thomas demands of the ghost. ``Science is not for sissies,'' his
interlocutor retorts. ``Nature is red in tooth and claw. ``They are
more alive than we are,'' protests Thomas. ``The air goes into
their bones.''
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Rabbi Teitelbaum has been scrawling comments on
the pages of the diary. He is pedantic, captious, perplexed. ``Can
birds be a religion?,'' he wonders. In Talmudic fashion, though, he
wrestles until he sees that they may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Thomas saying plowshares are no better than swords? Shades
of Isaiah and Micah! A terrible question.  &UR; Everything &LR;  we do causes
suffering?!,'' the rabbi scrawls upon the ex-scientist's challenges
to civilization and science itself. He gives his answer which, in
keeping with Talmudic paradox, is no answer:
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear of the Lord of the Universe whom no mind can fathom
and no thought can attain, we must retreat from, step back from the
abyss, tempted to jump. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Bit by bit, Teitelbaum in the Andes has wrestled Thomas'
contemporary ecological protest back to the ancient irreconcilable
mysteries. Mysteries they remain.

 &HT;    SISTER SEARCHES FOR BROTHER, REMINDS WORLD OF PRISONERS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN-0624.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ They were just four scraggly thieves
hitchhiking on a wooded roadside, but they held clues in Albana
Koshi's desperate search.
</P>
<P>
   Through her car window, they told her they had been cutting
bread in the kitchen of a Serb jail, so they knew that 150 men from
Koshi's town had been there.
</P>
<P>
   Further, prison officials told them the men were headed north
out of Kosovo province to a city in Serbia. Finally, the thieves
said, they recognized Koshi's brother, Alban(CQ), among them.
</P>
<P>
   As the world now watches ethnic Albanian refugees return to a
NATO-controlled Kosovo, for Koshi and thousands of others from her
region the war is over but not resolved. Their relatives are
missing and, it appears, have been taken to Serbia before the Serbs
withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   While many in this decimated region of southwestern Kosovo were
still sifting through the ruins of their burned homes, Koshi
started a list of 300 missing men and began searching for clues.
</P>
<P>
   The trail of the missing men leads past the sad streets of
Djakovica, to execution sites and a building filled with women and
children used as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The search has taken Koshi, a 25-year-old architecture student,
to abandoned factories, the offices of NATO commanders and an
apprehensively accepted volunteer post with the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   This week, she began leading her community in protests to draw
attention to what may become a major lingering issue as the haze of
destruction clears in war-shattered Kosovo, the southern province
of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant republic. Some estimate more than
1,000 men may be still held by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Daloni Carlisle of the International Committee of the Red Cross
said her group is now negotiating in the Yugoslav capital of
Belgrade with the Serb government. It called publicly Wednesday for
the Yugoslav government to release the list of names of Kosovar
Albanians being held in Serb prisons.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carlisle notes that mothers still sit outside the Red
Cross office in Bosnia, awaiting word on sons taken in the conflict
that ended there in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Time is the enemy of the missing men from Kosovo. Prisoners
released during the NATO bombing report being tortured and starved.
As Shkendije(CQ) Hoda, KLA deputy commander for information in
Djakovica says, ``I hope they won't change from prisons to death
camps.''
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica was an area of heavy fighting between the KLA and the
Serbs. The civilians paid the price of Serb revenge. Most of the
town is burned out and looted. More than 100 mass graves have been
found in the vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO troops entered on June 12 the destruction ended. But,
dreams of family reunions are fading away and the rumors run with
false leads about missing men.
</P>
<P>
   The petit and somber Koshi is a leader in the effort to find
them.
</P>
<P>
   She has set up shop in the KLA office now. There, encouraged by
radio requests, dozens of people come daily with information about
mass graves and missing people.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA is the best resource for information. But, Koshi is not
the military type. While others around her have camouflage and
Soviet-made Kalishnikovs, she wears jeans and resists pressure to
wear a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this,'' she says in a whisper, ``I am doing just for my
brother. I have told them that.''
</P>
<P>
   Albana Koshi was two years old when Alban was born and she has
always called him ``Locka,'' (pronounced ``LOACH-ka''). It means
``sweetheart.'' He is the only boy between two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   In a picture she carries, she is pulling his long hair back into
a ponytail to prepare for high school graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Serious like his sister, Alban studied economics and wants to go
into business. He stays away from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother is a teacher and their father worked in a travel
agency until he lost his job five years go. They lived in a tall
stone house in the old Ottoman bazaar area of town. Koshi's
great-grandfather was born in the house more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bazaar was meticulously destroyed by several nights of Serb
arson after NATO began the bombing campaign. The Koshi house stands
gutted.
</P>
<P>
   The Koshis moved in with three other newly-homeless families
and, like the rest of Djakovica, stayed inside for weeks eating
bread and cheese, watching television report the bombing and hiding
from Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   After a fierce battle between the Serbs and KLA separatist
guerillas on a hill near town, the Serbs told ethnic Albanians to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   The Koshis left May 10, walking to the bus station for a ride to
southern Kosovo and, possibly, Albania. But, after a few blocks,
Serb police stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   They said they just wanted to take Alban briefly and then drop
him off at the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning of the war, this was what he was afraid
of,'' Albana recalls.
</P>
<P>
   As she talks, she is preparing for her fourth meeting with
Italian NATO troops. Normally stoic, she cries when asked Alban's
parting words.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'You may go. I will be back soon. Don't be afraid,'''
she says in her strained English. ``He said, 'It's OK. Don't
worry.'''
</P>
<P>
   But, Alban never showed up at the bus. He was gathered with
hundreds of other young men near a park in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the trail gets murky. Many were taken to a small
metal shop on the edge of town, which Albana has searched
unsuccessfully for clues.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the prisoners' wives and children were taken nearby
and held in an appliance factory. The Serb police had been using
the factory but now they stayed out, guarding the doors with guns
from far away.
</P>
<P>
   Most suspect the Serbs hoped NATO would think the factory was
still used by the police and bomb the human shields. But, three
days later they released the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the account of the four thieves, Koshi believes many of
the men were taken to Pec, a city in western Kosovo. From there,
some were trucked to Serbia and others sent to another Kosovo city
where some were executed.
</P>
<P>
   A survivor turned up back in Djakovica and looked at a
photograph of Alban.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he saw him in the group headed for execution. But
Koshi says Alban looks much like a cousin who is also missing.
Either one, then, may have been executed. The other would be in the
Serb prison.
</P>
<P>
   She has not told her parents about the inconclusive photo
identification.
</P>
<P>
   As she searches, life slowly returns to Djakovica, an mostly
agrarian town of about 70,000. The first few stores have reopened
and bicyclists line the streets.
</P>
<P>
   But, on any corner you can find people missing relatives and
tears come quickly when they tell their stories. Koshi looks down
the main street and knows life is not normal for the people of
Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all with broken hearts,'' she says.

NICKELODEAN CELEBRATES 20 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like its young viewers, Nickelodeon has been growing up before
our eyes, though it's hard to believe the cable network that
changed the face of children's programming is ready to celebrate
its 20th birthday this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the story of the youth-oriented cable network that
slimed its way to popularity. Sliming, for those unfamiliar with
the world of Nickelodeon, is the dumping or throwing of a
lime-green goopy glop on contestants on ``You Can't Do That on
Television.'' Their offense? Uttering the words, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon actually started April 1, 1979, with a magazine-type
series for pre-schoolers called ``Pinwheel.'' It could be seen only
by cable customers in Buffalo, N.Y., and Columbus, Ohio. Now, 20
years later, the network is available in 75 million homes, and a
lot of them must be tuning in at least at some point each day. It
has been the No. 1-rated cable network for three straight years.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved that success partially by smartly targeting
different audiences at different times of the day. Midday is
marketed for the youngest viewers and is dubbed Nick Jr., while
late afternoon is for slightly older kids after they get home from
school. Early evenings are earmarked for the family, with shows
like ``Kenan &AMP; Kel,'' ``Doug'' and ``Rugrats,'' the network's most
popular series.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the anniversary, Nickelodeon will show favorite episodes
and series that have aired since its birth. The look back airs from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday. Saturday's
offerings will include five hours of first episodes of every
original Nick animated series, a collection of game shows, specials
and live action series. Special episodes featuring celebrities
before they were stars will be shown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Nickelodeon's growth came after it became part of the
MTV Networks (MTV and VH1) in 1984, and got the kind of financial
support it needed for program expansion and all-important
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Nickelodeon reached an entirely different audience
by turning over its prime-time and overnight schedule to reruns of
old prime-time hits, like ``Donna Reed'' and ``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doesn't believe in the power of marketing only has to
look at Nick at Nite. This was a lineup of reruns that had long ago
lost their novelty. But packaged as event programming that helped
us recapture our still longed-for past, Nick at Nite quickly
grabbed attention. It also spawned the creation of the spinoff
network, ``TV Land,'' on which viewers can see classic TV shows 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has had a simple philosophy nearly since the
beginning, when network officials credit interviews with young
viewers for setting them straight. In focus groups, the kids told
network executives that they just wanted to be kids because they
were scared about growing up.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1985, according to the network's printed history, ``Nick
was re-launched with a new identity, focused on giving kids what
they wanted, not what grown-ups thought was good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Scannell, president of the various Nickelodeon franchises,
said the original network has led to many changes in kids' TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debunked a lot of the myths of kids' television _ that boys
wouldn't watch shows starring girls, that you couldn't make scary
shows without delving into a lot of violence _ and we did it in a
consistent manner by knowing our audience and putting kids first,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Family Channel is taking a different approach to
reaching the young audience. In October, it is launching two new
gender-specific channels, boyzChannel and girlzChannel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the networks are still months away, there was much
criticism in education circles when they were announced because of
concern that the two channels will play to stereotypes of trucks
and guns for boys and dolls for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's original programming philosophy might not have set well
with the crowd that had long supported the more education-oriented
programming on PBS, but the channel has served its own teaching
function. Its programs are certainly better than most of the
toy-inspired junk that passes for after-school syndicated
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has the most popular kids' programs on the air, led
by ``Rugrats,'' which began in 1994 and has grown so popular that
it inspired a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   The network also has perhaps one of the best kids' shows on any
television network _ ``Nick News,'' in which host Linda Ellerbee
treats young viewers with intelligence in reporting the news from
around the world. Ellerbee has just the right touch in treating
kids as if they're smarter than most other broadcasters give them
credit for.
</P>
<P>
   While the broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) once ruled Saturday
morning television with kids' shows, Nickelodeon has bumped them
aside. Each of the big three has tried different approaches, with
NBC turning over time for ``Saturday Today'' and going after an
older teen-age audience with its ``Teen NBC'' lineup of such shows
as ``Saved by the Bell'' and ``Hang Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon also has been good for Florida and jobs. More than
1,800 episodes of its programs have been taped or filmed at the
Nickelodeon Studios based at Universal Studios Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And Nick is the home to ``Blue's Clues,'' the prize of Nick Jr.
In this season, preschool viewers are asked to help Steve solve
puzzles presented by his puppy, Blue. Forget all those scary and
sad rumors you may have heard. Actor Steven Burns is very much
alive, just like Nickelodeon itself.
</P>
<P>
   Happy 20th birthday!'

   SCOTUS-STATES-RIGHTS (Washington) _ State governments cannot be
sued against their will in state courts by people seeking to
enforce some federal right, the Supreme Court said Wednesday in a
major decision on states' rights. In a richly written 5-4 ruling,
the court said that the Constitution's ``structure and history''
shields states not only from being sued in federal courts, but also
makes them immune from individuals' state court lawsuits seeking to
enforce a federal right. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-ASBESTOS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court sets aside a
$1.5 billion landmark settlement that was to have resolved the
claims of as many as 186,000 victims of asbestos poisoning against
Fibreboard Corp., one of the leading makers of products using the
fire-retardant substance. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   AMA-UNIONS (Undated) _ After its members viewed themselves for
decades as elite professionals who did not need a union, the
American Medical Association voted yesterday to seek to unionize
doctors in a move described as an effort to level the playing field
with powerful managed care organizations. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BORDER (Planeje, Yugoslavia) _ This village of 29
families _ nearly all the men are bakers __ was more or less
leveled in near-daily attacks by NATO planes in the weeks before
the peace agreement was signed. This village and others nearby are
at the foot of Mount Pastrik, where some of the most furious
fighting of the war took place. At the time, refugees crossing the
border into Albania could actually hear the NATO bombs whistle down
before exploding. Now some are returning to see the damage NATO has
done, and nearly everyone thinks NATO nonetheless has an obligation
to help them rebuild. By Ian Fisher. With photos. 1,000 words.

childhood has become a serious venture, some parents are paying $70
an hour, sometimes more, to private coaches to sharpen the skills

</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-AGENDA (Washington) _ President Clinton returns from
Europe with a fairly expansive political and policy agenda. Plans
to intensify battery of Republicans for failure of gun legislation,
announce a new environmental initiative, unveil his Medicare plan
and tour poverty-mired regions from Appalachia to an Indian
reservation to talk about new investment to help the poor. Heavy
fund-raising schedule for congressional Democrats and continuing
efforts to juggle the competing Clinton, Hillary, Gore agendas. By

THE THOROUGHBREDS OF DESK CHAIRS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Desk chairs, or task chairs, as they are now called in the trade
(to distinguish them from those thronelike executive models), are
no longer just pieces of furniture bought to match a desk. A good
chair, the ergonomists tell us, is probably the single most
important office tool.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sits for more than two hours a day should invest in
an ergonomically designed seat, said Dr. Gregory Lutz, the chief of
physiatry and an assistant professor of rehabilitation medicine at
the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan. A good chair should
support the curvature of the lower spine, Lutz said. ``But no two
people are shaped alike,'' he said, ``so a proper desk chair must
be adjustable.'' Indeed, sitting long hours in a chair with a
straight back can be a source of great pain, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Designers are heeding the experts' advice by creating chairs
that mimic the shape and even the articulation of the human
skeleton. Chairs can now move effortlessly with the body and give
support in the appropriate places.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Newman, an orthotist in Philadelphia, also advises people
to look for a chair that has not skimped on the quantity or the
quality of foam padding. ``You shouldn't have to put a seat insert
or back support into a good desk chair,'' Newman said. ``With
inferior foam, your sit bones will bottom out.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree, though, that lack of movement during the day is a
major culprit in back pain. Movement increases circulation and
lubricates the spine. But modernity conspires against mobility:
E-mail keeps us posted at our desks, and electronic gossip makes
jaunts to the water cooler less frequent. Try to break for 10
minutes every hour, doctors advise. Walk, stretch, go and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   1. The Hag Capisco chair won a silver award for its ergonomic
design at this month's Neocon, the office furniture trade show in
Chicago. The Equestrian model, with its saddle seat and stubby
arms, permits full mobility. Sit frontward, sideways or backward;
the saddle shape keeps legs comfortably apart. The height of the
seat, lumbar support and head rest are adjustable, as are seat tilt
and depth. If saddles are not to your taste, the chair can be
ordered with a round or ``waterfall'' seat. It's $575 at BP
Associates, 200 Lexington Ave. (32nd Street), New York.
</P>
<P>
   2. Niels Diffrient's Freedom Chair was also a silver award
winner at Neocon. Once the height of the seat, back and head rest
are set, no further adjustments are necessary, because the frame,
modeled on the human spine, shifts position with the user. The head
rest automatically slides into place as the chair reclines. The
synchronized arm rests also move in tandem so that they are always
at the same level. Fully loaded, with a head rest and a gel seat,
the chair is $875 from Humanscale, (800) 400-0625.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Scio chair by Hag is smaller and less elaborate than the
Capisco, but it's fully adjustable. The tilt adjusts automatically
in response to the movements of the user. It is $375 from BP
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   4. Neocon's gold medal went to the Leap chair, by Steelcase. The
upper and lower back adjust separately, and the chair's ``spine''
conforms to the user's back. When the chair reclines, the seat
glides forward, but the user's visual field is unchanged. It's
$1,050 from Steelcase, (800) 227-2960 or www.steelcase.com.
</P>
<P>
   5. The adjustable Tom chair, by Tom Deacon, a Canadian
industrial designer, has a seat that actually extends in front
without leaving a gap in the back that could create an incorrect
seat position. It has a flexible back made of durable
glass-reinforced nylon. The chair can be ordered in three seat
depths and two seat widths. It's $770 from Keilhauer, (800)
724-5665 or www.keilhauer.com.
</P>
<P>
   6. Alexander Polakov, a 6-foot graphic designer at Designframe,
a Manhattan studio, has used his Pezzi Hi-Fit exercise ball as a
seat for a year, as have four other designers at the studio. For
anyone without back or spine problems, it's a comfortable
alternative to the traditional desk chair. Legs are kept at the
proper angle for sitting (knees lower than hips), and they remain
comfortably apart and flexible. Because the ball gives, the body is
constantly moving, just as it should be. The exercise ball is
$27.25 from the Equipment Shop in Bedford, Mass., (800) 525-7681.

QUESTIONS BEGIN FLOWING ABOUT DISNEY `DEATH TRAP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a place of clean streets, pastel homes, wide front porches
and a town square worthy of a movie set. It is life as Disney has
designed it. And there is no design for death in a place called
Celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But sudden and violent death has struck Celebration, Fla.,
(population 2,200) four times now in recent months and lawyers in
Florida and families in Attleboro are now asking questions _ legal
questions _ about how well the town, a Disney subsidiary, designed
its roadways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this a death trap,'' said William Osborne, attorney for
an 18-year-old who plunged to her death in a man-made pond in
Celebration last November.
</P>
<P>
   As the bodies of three Attleboro, Mass. men, who died in those
same waters near Disney World last September, were prepared for a
final journey home Wednesday their families consulted funeral
directors _ and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated about sluggish response to requests to search the
pond and puzzled by the design of the roadway that leads to it,
relatives of Scott Renquin, 35, Dan Nelson, 32, and Roger
DesVergnes, 31, are considering a courtroom fight against a planned
community where they died and its owner, the corporate titan named
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three families have voiced the opinion that this needs to
be done to see if Disney or Celebration (the planned community
opened by Disney in 1994) or both are responsible for this,'' said
Julie Renquin, Scott's sister-in-law. ``We're going to speak to a
lawyer about all that.''
</P>
<P>
   If the families file suit, they could join an emerging legal
fight on behalf of Sarah Kuser, the Casselberry, Fla. teenager who
died there two months after the Attleboro men's vehicle jumped the
curb into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no barricades,'' said Osborne. ``There were no
signs. There was nothing to alert people that this was a dead-end.
All you saw was a black void.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have said Kuser was speeding when struck the curb
and went into the pond. Toxicology reports placed her blood-alcohol
level at .15, or nearly double Florida's legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Orlando said Wednesday that autopsies on the three
Attleboro men are complete, but the causes of their deaths are not
being released until later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said police notified them that the each of the
men, found Monday submerged in the sports utility vehicle they
rented at the Orlando airport last September, carried wallets with
identification.
</P>
<P>
   The pond, about 200 feet across at its widest point, is at the
end of an isolated stretch of road that ends at a T-intersection
just a few yards short of a steep 15-foot embankment leading to the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Waters, a spokeswoman for Celebration, said the posted
speed limit is 35 mph, and there is a stop sign with a flashing
light on top of it.
</P>
<P>
   She said that work being done now to erect a wall where the
vehicles plunged into the pond is not a response to the four
fatalities there last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been part of our long-term development plan since
before April 1998,'' Waters said. ``But our hearts go out to these
families. This is clearly a very unfortunate situation. We have
taken every step on our part to make sure those roads meet or
exceed all standards for construction, signage and visuals.''
</P>
<P>
   But Matthew Ryder, Renquin's brother-in-law, said the families
want to know whether there has been ``wrongdoing'' that contributed
to the deaths of the three vacationing men. He said a family friend
has referred them to an attorney in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issue here is that they created a dangerous
situation,'' said Osborne, who said his lawsuit on behalf of
Kuser's family is imminent. Osborne, who said he has sued Disney
before, expects a vigorous fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney and Celebration have got risk managers with a lot of
experience and it's going to be a real fight for anybody bringing a
case on behalf of these three gentlemen,'' said Osborne. ``Disney
is a big force here in Central Florida. Disney's image is very
squeaky clean and they're very conscientious about protecting that
image.''
</P>
<P>
   The intersection where the accident occurred was designed by
Celebration's consultants. Local county officials made sure the
roadway met its standards. Waters said the road is now in the
process of being accepted by the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about five different jurisdictional agencies who
play a role there,'' the Celebration spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wood, a Boston attorney who has defended towns as well as
private citizens in lawsuits over roadways, said the would-be
plaintiffs in the case have their work cut out for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody saw the accident,'' Wood said. ``It's going to be
difficult to assess if they were driving responsibly or what their
state of mind was at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's going to present some challenges of proving
they went off the road because of road design,'' she said. ``But
the more times it happens, the stronger the case for the plaintiffs
that there should have been a warning.''
</P>
<P>
   A warning is precisely what Maurice Ross said he wished he had
when he, too, plunged into the retention pond on Nov. 15, precisely
one week after Sarah Kuser's Toyota sank into the water there.
</P>

   A good deal of the talk at this year's PC Expo, the annual
computer fair in New York, was about MP3, the sound-compression
software that has teen-agers' Internet connections humming and
music-industry professionals nervous.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond Multimedia Systems, which made portable MP3 music a
household term with its Rio 300 player last fall, has introduced an
improved model. Called the Rio 500, the new player features twice
the 32-megabyte storage of the Rio 300 and can be upgraded to 96
megabytes of flash memory (providing more than two hours of music).
It sells for $269, $100 more than the original Rio 300 now costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new player, which is smaller and has a larger LCD screen,
also uses a more secure downloading scheme to help ensure that
products will not be illegally obtained or copied easily, which is
a major concern to many music company executives, who have been
slow to embrace MP3. And unlike the old player, the new one can
read various compression formats besides popular MP3 music files,
including long-playing books on tape.
</P>
<P>
   The new player was one of several changes at Diamond, including
the spinning off of a new company, Rioport, which will concentrate
on developing Rio portable players, and the software that enables
them to download and play MP3 music and other files from the
Internet, as well as on providing a special portal Web site to make
downloading simpler and more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 portable market is starting to get crowded. Creative Lab
has released the Nomad, which comes with an FM radio tuner and
voice recorder, and Samsung has released Yepp, which, at 2.3
ounces, is the smallest of the three MP3 portables. The Yepp also
has a radio, recorder and a 500-name telephone directory, making it
the first one with a PDA-style feature.

   Internet Camera to Capture The Best of Baby Videos
</P>
<P>
   As if MP3 wasn't confusing enough, here comes MPEG-4. At PC
Expo, Sharp Electronics introduced the Internet Viewcam, the first
consumer product to use MPEG-4, a new video-compression format.
That means you won't just be getting baby pictures over the
Internet; you'll be getting baby video.
</P>
<P>
   The MPEG-4 format squeezes videos into files that can be quickly
uploaded and downloaded from the Net over dial-up modems. The
camera, which also works as a digital still camera, sells for $699
(available online at www.sharp-usa.com), is slightly larger than a
pack of cards and is 8.5 ounces with batteries and memory card.
</P>
<P>
   Because the videos taken with the Internet Viewcam are
compressed, the movies aren't exactly theater quality. But Sharp
expects a lot of interest in the camera and the format. ``Which
would you rather send in e-mail?'' said D. Michael Lyons, an
associate vice president for marketing at Sharp. ``One JPEG image
or 10 seconds of video?''

   How Do They Do It? The Science of Sports, Online
</P>
<P>
   Skateboarders may have a reputation for being public nuisances,
but even their most vocal critics must admit that some of their
tricks are pretty cool. How, for example, do skateboarders manage
to leap over chasms while still keeping their boards with them,
seemingly stuck to the soles of their shoes _ a maneuver known as
``the Ollie''?
</P>
<P>
   The secret, as any good boarder could tell you, has to do with
rotation around multiple axes. The physics of this trick, and many
others, is explored on Skateboard Science
(www.exploratorium.edu/skateboarding). It's one of several sports
science resources developed recently by the Exploratorium, a museum
of science and art in San Francisco, and is one of the few
scientific sites to use the word ``McTwist.''

   Souped-Up Battery to Handle Those Power-Greedy Laptops
</P>
<P>
   At three-eighths of an inch thick and a little larger than a
sheet of standard office paper, the new battery from Electrofuel
looks like a miniature welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   On closer examination, this lithium-ion superpolymer power pack
promises welcome relief: Almost doubling the previous record of
rechargeable batteries, the superpolymer battery, called the Power
Pad, can run power-greedy laptops for more than 15 hours, the
company said. In many cases, that is about 10 times the battery
capacity of many portable computers on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Pad 160 computer battery, which sells for $499, is
encased in a titanium shell, fits beneath a laptop and connects by
way of the computer's AC adaptor.
</P>
<P>
   The two-pound battery can also power, among other things,
cellular telephones, camcorders and PDAs.
</P>
<P>
   At a demonstration this week at the PC Expo, a Power Pad
provided the energy to drive an electric-motor-assisted bicycle.
And you could slip it into a saddle bag.

   Stickies and Highlighter Pens Are Put to Work on the Web
</P>
<P>
   A new company called Keeboo is bringing yellow stickies and
highlighter pens to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Keeboo has created software that enables people to pull together
materials from online and off-line, bind them together in a virtual
book, apply something like digital Post-It notes, highlight
passages and send the book through e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The recipients do not need Keeboo software to open the attached
books. They need only to click on the e-mail message's attached
``.exe'' file, which will open the book in their Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as the new communication medium for the Web,''
Michel Safars, Keeboo's president and CEO, said at an unveiling of
the software at PC Expo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The software, which is free and can be downloaded at
www.keeboo.com, uses the old-fashioned book as an organizational
guide. (The name Keeboo is a playful rearrangement of the letters
in ``book.'') To create a book, users drag icons of Web addresses
or Windows folders and drop them into the blank pages of Keeboo.
</P>
<P>
   A table of contents appears and is updated with each drop. A
window of editing tools, including highlighter pens and stickies of
varying colors, hovers near the Keeboo pages to help make the
freshest Web page look like an old library book.

   A Handheld True to Its Name, With a Keyboard for the Patient
</P>
<P>
   Though the latest handheld computers look and feel less like
handhelds and more like notebook computers, with bigger keyboards
and screens, Hewlett-Packard's recently released Jornada 680 aims
for a happy compromise: a handheld that actually fits in the hand
yet offers a keyboard almost big enough to type on.
</P>
<P>
   Weighing just over a pound, the 680 ($899) is smaller than a
paperback novel and about half the size and weight of its Jornada
820 sibling ($999). Though Hewlett-Packard says the 680's keyboard
is only three-quarters of the size of a standard keyboard, limited
touch-typing is possible with patience and practice. A built-in 56K
modem provides quick Internet connections, and the 680's 6.5-inch
color screen sharply displays Web pages containing graphics and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is touch-sensitive; a stylus is used for tapping
icons and choosing menus. The built-in pocket-size Windows CE
applications are compatible with their full-size Microsoft
counterparts on a desktop computer, which the 680 can connect to.
</P>
<P>
   The 680's rechargeable battery is estimated to last up to eight
hours. An optional expansion card connects the 680 to a desktop
monitor or projector, serving up Powerpoint presentations on the
road without having to haul a heavier notebook PC.

   Software Will Hold Your Hand When You Switch Computers
</P>
<P>
   Making the transition from an old computer to a new one can be a
hassle. You've got to redo your shortcuts, reorganize your desktop
and reset the toolbars on your applications.
</P>
<P>
   So Miramar Systems, a software company based in Santa Barbara,
Calif., has created a piece of software, Desktop DNA, that
remembers everything for you and then transfers those settings into
your new computer. Neal Rabin, Miramar's chief executive, says home
users will be able to buy the software for $69 by the end of the
year.

FRENCH COURT REJECTS SUIT BY DEALER LINKED TO NAZIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A French court Wednesday rejected a claim for $1 million
in damages brought by the Wildenstein family, the New York-based
dynasty of international art dealers, against an American writer
who suggested in a recent book that the French-Jewish family did
business with Nazi officials during Germany's wartime occupation of
France.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge lower court said that while it was not ruling on
whether or not the Wildensteins collaborated with the enemy, it
rejected their charge that the writer, Hector Feliciano, acted with
``serious and flagrant scorn for searching for the truth'' in
suggesting commercial ties between Georges Wildenstein, then the
head of the family business, and some Nazi art dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to historical documents that Feliciano used in
preparing his book, ``The Lost Museum: the Nazi Conspiracy to Steal
the World's Greatest Works of Art,'' as well as new documents
presented to the court, the judges said that ``Hector Feliciano had
in his hands elements that permitted him to believe that Georges
Wildenstein maintained direct and indirect relations with German
authorities during the occupation.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, which the Wildensteins said they would appeal, is a
blow to their campaign to clear their name after a wave of bad
publicity. The suit _ brought by Georges' son, Daniel, 81, and his
grandsons, Alec and Guy, and the New York-based Wildenstein &AMP; Co. _
said that, as a result of Feliciano's book, they had suffered
``considerable commercial damage'' and that some Jewish clients had
stopped visiting the Wildenstein gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Wildensteins won a defamation suit against the
French weekly magazine VSD. In an article last year about a messy
divorce involving Alec Wildenstein, the magazine said, among other
things, that the family ``was suspected of building its fortune
through collaboration with the Nazis.'' In that ruling, the court
said the documents presented by the magazine to support the article
did not ``sustain the thesis of collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Daniel Wildenstein said that
Wednesday's ruling was ``diametrically opposed'' to the decision in
the VSD case and that, in an appeal, his family would demonstrate
that Feliciano's book contains ``flagrant historical errors that
have distorted reality through an erroneous presentation of the
facts.'' A spokeswoman for the family said Wildenstein was
``shocked'' by Wednesday's verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildensteins brought the court case against Feliciano in
France because ``The Lost Museum'' was first published here in 1995
as ``Le Musee Disparu.'' It was published in the United States in
1997. Because Georges Wildenstein died in 1963 and libel suits
cannot be brought against the dead in France, the case was brought
under the Civil Code, which allows for damages to be sought when an
author is unprofessional or irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Feliciano's book touched only briefly on the
Wildensteins. It provoked intense debate in France, however,
because it drew public attention here to artworks that had been
recovered by France after being seized by the Nazis but had not
been returned to their rightful owners.
</P>
<P>
   In his references to Georges Wildenstein, Feliciano said that
the powerful dealer and collector did business with Nazi art
dealers before the war and for months after France's occupation by
Germany in June 1940. He also said that after Wildenstein went into
exile in New York in January 1941, he maintained contacts with a
former employee, Roger Duquoy, who ran the Paris gallery until
1944.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from New York, Feliciano said he felt
fully vindicated by Wednesday's ruling. ``They lost,'' he said.
``The Wildensteins bet that a French court would rule in their
favor, but the French court was totally objective in looking at the
evidence. It went to the heart of the matter. Not a single one of
the Wildensteins' arguments was accepted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Feliciano, who lived in France for 15 years before recently
returning to the United States, said that because of the suit, he
had made documents available incriminating Georges Wildenstein that
had not previously been published. ``With this decision, many
researchers and journalists will also be able to publish a lot of
fresh information about the Wildensteins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In its 14-page ruling Wednesday, the French court analyzed in
detail the disputed references to Georges Wildenstein in ``The Lost
Museum'' as well as the documents presented by Feliciano. Among
these are pre-war letters between Wildenstein and a Nazi art
dealer, Karl Haberstock, which, the court said, ``confirm the idea
formulated by the author that `the Wildensteins had contacts with
the Nazis.'''
</P>
<P>
   The court also refers to letters between the exiled Wildenstein
and Duquoy. According to the court, these letters ``indicate the
continuation of commercial relations between the two men after the
Liberation and lead to the belief that they were not interrupted by
the war.''
</P>
<P>
   The three judges further rejected several documents presented by
the Wildensteins to support their case, including one in which
Duquoy writes to the Nazi authorities claiming his independence
from ``the Jewish firm Wildenstein.'' The judges said this claim
``lacked all credibility given the personality of the sender and
his notorious links with the Nazi occupiers.''

<P>
   NICASIO, Calif. _ When Hill House, the monstrous, lonely setting
of Shirley Jackson's 1959 novel ``The Haunting of Hill House,''
greets its newest tenants, it is not with a welcome mat. ``Around
them the house steadied and located them,'' Jackson wrote, ``and
small eddies of air and sound and movement stirred and waited and
whispered.''
</P>
<P>
   A team of psychic investigators have come to test the mansion's
reputation as a haven for supernatural phenomena, but it is they,
not the ghosts, who are being measured. ``The Haunting,'' directed
by Jan De Bont, is the second film adaptation of Jackson's novel
(Robert Wise directed a 1963 version), and once again Hill House is
meant to sound as frightening as it looks.
</P>
<P>
   From its eerie opening scenes, ``The Haunting,'' set to open on
July 23, is layered with the sounds of inhuman conversations _
between wood and air, between stone and glass, and between an evil
entity and its tormented victims. But only a few weeks ago, Hill
House's awakening was not yet complete.
</P>
<P>
   On a recording soundstage here at George Lucas' Skywalker Ranch,
the movie's sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, had just received an
urgent call from a colleague. An image of the movie's fragile
heroine, played by Lili Taylor, was frozen on a movie screen and on
two video monitors. Rydstrom and his two assistants looked almost
as tense as the actress, who was cowering in bed, her eyes fixed on
something on the ornately carved ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the visual effect goes,' said Rydstrom, advancing
the film a few frames. ``They've just added something new to it, so
we have to come up with an additional sound effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the art of sound is often viewed as the last and hastiest
element of movie production, Rydstrom has had two months to
prepare, an unusually long time. For a suspense film about largely
unseen forces, evocative sound is essential to the movie's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find a way to give the house a voice, even before we
began shooting,'' said De Bont. ``Normally, actors would be
reacting to the director, who's saying things like: `Now you hear a
footstep! Now you hear a door creaking!' And that's horrible for
them. They don't know where the sound is coming from, where it's
going, or what it will eventually sound like in the movie. But if
you can fix it for them there on the set, you get fantastic
reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after ``The Haunting'' was green-lighted by Dreamworks, De
Bont took steps to insure that its actors (including Liam Neeson
and Catherine Zeta-Jones) could react not merely to one another but
to an invisible cast of thousands. His first choice for the job was
Rydstrom, 40, who has shared seven Academy Awards for sound design
and sound effects editing, most recently for ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rydstrom's resume is diverse. It includes ``Star Wars: Episode I
_ The Phantom Menace,'' ``Titanic,'' ``The Horse Whisperer,''
``Jurassic Park'' and ``Terminator 2: Judgement Day.'' But he had
done the sound for only one ghost movie, and that was the G-rated
``Casper.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Casper' was a friendly ghost; this was going to be
different,'' Rydstrom said. ``To me, a scary sound is one that you
can't pin down, or one that is behind you. Something we use a lot
is the sense of space, the ghostly movements. The sounds spin
around the room in a strange way. The movie is full of atmosphere
and ambiences that have little whispery sounds. You're always
becoming attuned to these things that might be a distant voice in
the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the script and by preliminary drawings by the film's
production designer, Eugenio Zanetti, Rydstrom recorded _ and then
distorted _ the sounds that would emanate from a place that Jackson
called ``a masterpiece of architectural misdirection.'' (Exteriors
were filmed at Harlaxton Manor near Lincolnshire, England, a
Gothic-Jacobean-Baroque building; interiors were built near Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To insure a fresh approach, Rydstrom and his associates searched
for new variations on the sounds that audiences associate with
haunted houses. After that, he said, the biggest challenge was to
come up with names for each sample. (The results, indexed on a
computer, sound like a record company roster: Buzzmoan-ambience,
Rumble-wave, Demon speed-by, Dreaded-booms, Thunder-switch.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The team's one concession to movie tradition, he said, was to
record a magnificently creaky door that he found in the cellar of a
Northern California winery. He also happened to have extensive
recordings made inside an old hotel near Glacier National Park in
Montana, where Rydstrom and his wife were stranded during a June
snowstorm several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent three days recording gusting winds through the cracks
of windows and doors, so that came in handy,'' he said. ``It sounds
as though the wind has a child's voice inside it _ a little
screaming, whispering human being in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sound the audience will hear upon entering Hill House,
however, is a slow, booming, rhythmic breathing. ``When the front
door opens for the first time, there's also a sort of exhalation,
an airy sound that takes you into the house,'' Rydstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   To capture that sound, he set up a digital recorder in his Saab
Turbo and risked becoming a ghost himself. ``If you drive about 80
miles an hour on the freeway and open your sunroof, you get a great
`bwaaa!' sound,'' he said. ``It was dangerous, so I did it late at
night so there was no one around to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the booming sounds, not the breathing, that proved to
be most impressive. During the filming, De Bont operated a digital
audio player and used about 100 of Rydstrom's sounds to inspire and
surprise the actors. Ms. Taylor said that the sound cues had
provided an integral part of her performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrill screaming, strange wild banging, children calling me
lightly _ all sorts of noises,'' she said. ``One time in England,
when Jan didn't have the sound machine, he started making sounds
with pots and pans for us. I loved that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most unnerving sound effects, Ms. Taylor said, were those
that suggest a huge, unseen presence moving overhead. ``It was low,
reverberating, eerie sound,'' she said, ``like a giant sliding its
feet, with a little noise in between the slides.''
</P>
<P>
   The dragging sound, Rydstrom said, was derived from a recording
of a 19th-century iron lung that he found in a San Francisco
museum. ``We slowed down the mechanical sound, and it turned into a
rhythmic sweep-clunk, sweep-clunk,'' he said. The sounds of
rapping, booms and crashes came from some energetic recording
sessions at several Bay Area houses, all abandoned and set for
demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in there with baseball bats and smashed the hell out
of walls and doors,'' he said. ``But for the final mix, we almost
always ended up using a sweetener of some distant explosion or
artillery sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pyrotechnics, Rydstrom believes that ``sound is all
about emotion, the way music is emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't quite understand why rhythm and pitch and frequency
stir us emotionally, but they do,'' he said. ``It would be hard to
write a textbook and say: With a certain pitch or frequency, you
will get a certain reaction in the listener. So a lot of sound work
is to take a guess and continually gauge your own reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great compliments I've ever heard was from a man
who told me that his son loved to watch `Jurassic Park,' but he was
too frightened so he'd turn the sound off and watch. Without the
sound, it was no longer scary to him, but he still loved it. It was
good to know that that's where the scariness came from.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra on Wednesday elected
the British conductor Sir Simon Rattle to succeed its chief
conductor, Claudio Abbado, who is to step down from one of
classical music's most prestigious posts in September 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle, 44, who made his name as chief conductor of the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in Britain, will be the sixth head of
the Berlin Philharmonic in its 117-year history. The orchestra's
dominant postwar conductor was Herbert von Karajan, who was
succeeded by Abbado in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote by the 112 full-time members of the orchestra, Rattle
was chosen over Daniel Barenboim, musical director of the German
State Opera in Berlin and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Berlin
Philharmonic chairman Rudolf Watzel said Rattle was elected ``by a
great majority'' and had accepted the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   An intense search for a new chief conductor began as soon as
Abbado, 66, announced last year that he would leave the post to
concentrate on his personal life. Numerous candidates were
considered, but in recent weeks German and British newspapers
reported that the contenders had been reduced to Rattle and
Barenboim.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle, who has frequently worked with the Berlin Philharmonic,
won plaudits from Berlin critics this month when he conducted the
orchestra in programs that included music by Mozart, Mahler and
Boulez. But some critics have also noted that Rattle was less
experienced in Bruckner and Schumann, whose works are also central
to the orchestra's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   During his 17 years as chief conductor in Birmingham, Rattle,
who was born in Liverpool and began his career as a percussionist
in the Royal Liverpool Orchestra at age 15, proved himself an
innovative and dynamic leader, turning the Birmingham Symphony into
a worthy competitor among the well-established London orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Abbado welcomed Rattle's selection, and said he expected him to
continue the artistic developments under way, including widening
the Philharmonic's repertory to include more contemporary
composers.

KOSOVO: CRUCIBLE OF ETHNIC HATRED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People outside the Balkans _ including such leaders as President
Clinton _ have often overstated the degree of historic enmity among
the Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians, the principal ethnic groups in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Serbs and Albanians _ each of whom outnumbers
the Bosnians, Slovenians, Croats, and other ethnic groups of the
region _ the rivalry is in fact bitter and centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   And Kosovo, a province seen as important to early Serbian
history, has always been the central area of contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle of Kosovo in 1389 marked Serbia's decline from its
period of greatest power and glory. Regaining it from the Ottoman
Turks, who were to rule it for the next 500 years, became essential
to the dream of restoring Serbian prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian lore hardly recognizes the existance of Albanians in
that era, and where it does, it portrays Albanians as allies and
favorites of the Turkish occupiers, who shared their Muslim
religion.
</P>
<P>
   But Albanians assert, with support from comparative linguists
and other researchers, that they descended from native peoples
dating to Greek and Roman times. They say they had been in Kosovo
for centuries before Slavic peoples, including Serbs, migrated
south into the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Serbs and Albanians view Kosovo as part of their national
heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs regained control of Kosovo in 1912 _ during the land-grab
that occurred during the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire _ and
at that time drove Kosovar Albanians from the cities and into the
mountains south of Djakovica and Pec.
</P>
<P>
   From then on, roles were reversed, with Albanians dreaming of
regaining land that had been theirs, but was lost to the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serb troops were driven from the province during World War I,
and when they returned they were confronted by Albanian guerrillas,
who were not suppressed until 1924. Then, in World War II, when
Serbia fell to Germany, Germany's Italian allies encouraged the
Albanians to attack and harass the Kosovar Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovar Albanians fiercely resisted Yugoslav Communist
forces after the war, and it took six months of fighting and 48,000
Albanian deaths before Kosovo was subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Then, however, the Communists under Tito tried to appease the
Albanians, just as they tried to do with the Slovenians and Croats,
in an effort to build a Yugoslavian identity. The Albanians were
given broad autonomy within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With a much higher birth rate than the Serbs, Albanians
constitute 90 percent of the Kosovo population. And throughout the
1980s there were signs _ such as strikes by students and miners _
that Albanian nationalism was on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milosevic, who built his political career on the
defense and encouragement of Serb nationalism, responded in 1989 by
withdrawing Kosovo's autonomy, which led to a declaration of
independence in Kosovo in 1991, around the same time that Slovenia
and Croatia were making similar moves.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Feb. 10, when Gioang Huu Nguyen boarded Singapore
Airlines Flight 25 from Kennedy Airport to Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam, he was a man in a hurry. He had one month to build his
76-year-old mother, Phung Thi Khu, a new house.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran to catch the plane that day, Nguyen had no blueprints.
The house, so vivid in its details, existed only in his mind. The
outside would be gray concrete, and inside, it would be painted
pale pink, like the azaleas that bloom in late winter and early
spring. The living room would open onto a porch, a common
vernacular style throughout Vietnam, so the breezes and sunshine
would flood the interior. It would be embellished with French
colonial touches, like the slender columns flanking the porch.
Light would be filtered through delicately filigreed metal screens.
The house, with gleaming tile floors, would have a roof that didn't
leak, a bathtub with hot and cold running water and a toilet that
flushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream,'' said Nguyen, 44, who works as an assistant
cabinetmaker for Dakota Jackson, the furniture designer whose
factories are in Long Island City, Queens. ``I did not have time to
draw.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had had time to plan. He had been dreaming about this
house for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his first house. In 1970, just before he joined the
army in Saigon _ now Ho Chi Minh City _ Nguyen and his father, Vang
Nguyen, built a house for the family, but it was not a sturdy
place. The front sported a tin roof, while the back roof and the
sides of the house, the parts the public did not see, were made of
gasoline drums, cut open and pounded flat. ``It flooded every time
it rained,'' Nguyen said. Water poured through the roof and seeped
in over the threshold. Next door was a chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   Although the house had electricity, amenities were few. The
bathroom was a small room with a hole in the ground for a toilet
and a bucket of water, drawn from the private well, for bathing.
Three bedrooms housed eight people: his parents and the six
youngest of their nine children, including Qui, who is mentally
retarded, a result of Agent Orange, Nguyen said. ``Qui,'' he said
quietly, ``means precious.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Nguyen became a carpenter; in 1985, he switched
to construction, eventually becoming a contractor. ``I quit being a
carpenter,'' he said through an interpreter, ``because I knew I
wanted to build a new house.'' Between the desire and the reality,
however, was a stretch of 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the year his father died, Nguyen and his wife, Anh
Tuyet Thi Vu, who works as a manicurist, came to the United States
with their three children. They settled in Flushing, Queens, where
he found work as a waiter and cook. The move was simple. Like so
many immigrants, including his wife's family, who had already moved
to this country, he wanted to make more money, not just for himself
but for the family. ``I promised my father I'd send home $100 a
month to support my brother Qui,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he learned that there was cabinetry work at Dakota
Jackson's. He remembered the date he reported for his new job.
``March 23, 1996,'' he said. He makes $7.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Over three years, he managed to save $3,000 toward building the
house _ a little more than half of what he needed. He also hoarded
his vacation days. Then, last December, he borrowed $5,300 from
friends and his wife's family. He was ready to go home. He called
one of his brothers in Vietnam, who has a telephone. His brother
hopped on a motorbike, picked up his mother and sped her back to
the phone. Nguyen told her he wanted to come home and build her a
new house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that seeing me was enough,'' he said, ``and that I
didn't have enough money.'' But he insisted. ``She was old, and I
wanted her to be comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   When he got home to Baria, a town of 45,000 people two miles
south of Ho Chi Minh City, he spent a day shopping. He bought
poplar for the scaffolding, stones for the foundation and steel for
the frame. He bought mortar and bricks, gallons of pink paint and
bags of cement. He bought folding steel panels for the front door,
which would open onto a deep, sheltering porch facing the street.
(In Vietnam, he said, guests are expected to drop in
spontaneously.) For windows, he bought iron grills at $25 each. He
had apportioned $5,300 of his budget for materials and labor,
$2,000 for gifts to his relatives and $1,000 for his air fare and
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen assembled a crew of 14, paying everyone $4 a day, the
local going rate. The crew _ men and women, family and friends _
worked seven-day weeks. ``The main workers were construction
workers,'' he said, ``and some of the women carried materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers arrived at 7 in the morning. As is Vietnamese
custom, they took a break around 9 for tea, coffee and cigarettes.
Later in the morning, the family provided lemonade and iced coffee
with condensed milk to accompany noodles or sticky rice with
grilled pork. At the end of the working day, they ate another
snack, usually small steamed crabs or boiled chicken. When his crew
went home, Nguyen ate dinner, then went back to the site and kept
on building. ``I couldn't sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first job was to knock down the old house, salvaging bits of
tin and wood planks. (During the construction, his mother, a
brother and his wife, and Qui, who live together, moved to the
homes of brothers and sisters.) Then the crew dug the foundation,
erected the steel frame, stacked and mortared the bricks, wired the
house, laid the plumbing, tiled the floor and raised the corrugated
aluminum roof.
</P>
<P>
   With trowels, they coated the exterior with gray cement. Inside,
they painted the walls azalea-pink, a flower that to the Vietnamese
signifies a bright future. ``My mother chose the color,'' Nguyen
said. ``It makes her happy and not lonely.''
</P>
<P>
   The roof still needs insulation, but inside the spotless home,
Nguyen's mother is radiant. In mid-March, her children moved her
into the new house, where she shares a bedroom with Qui. Her other
son and daughter-in-law have the second bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Nguyen family know that this is a house that
American money has built, Gioang Nguyen doesn't romanticize his
life in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that living here is not a heaven,'' he said. He
emigrated because their father had died, and he was the eldest son,
the one who was to start over. He has been able to send his oldest
children to college, but Nguyen himself has not had time to master
English, getting by with what he learned in high school.
</P>
<P>
   And he is always homesick. ``In Vietnam, people are closer to
each other,'' he said. ``Every Sunday, I would take my children to
visit my parents or my brothers and sisters. In New York, I rarely
visit my wife's relatives. People are too busy to pay attention to
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nguyen retires, it will, not surprisingly, be in Baria. ``I
want to go back,'' he said.

 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been exactly 55 years since Maurice Rossel,
a young Swiss investigator for the International Red Cross, visited
the infamous Theresienstadt concentration camp in Czechoslovakia
and, in a masterstroke of Potemkin manipulation by the Nazis, wrote
a glowing report about the ghetto amenities of its ``privileged
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Little could Rossel have imagined that, as surely as he let
himself be fooled by the Germans' ironhanded domestic tableaux of
uncomplaining Jewish internees, he would be diligently tracked down
across the decades by Claude Lanzmann, the director who created
``Shoah,'' the classic nine-and-a-half-hour film of Holocaust
testimony wrought from 350 hours of painstaking interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the debut of a new film Wednesday night, a riveting 65
minutes of testimony from an urbanely unapologetic Rossel, the
audience at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum sat and witnessed
the sheer creative patience of Lanzmann, a 73-year-old bloodhound
of a Frenchman who carefully shied from speculating deeply about
what he has delivered to history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the film,'' he said in gentle puzzlement to one
member of the audience who demanded to know why a moment of
epiphany, of melodramatic self-accusation, could not have been
evinced from Rossel during the several hours of interview by
Lanzmann.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this,'' Lanzmann said simply, gesturing at the movie
screen. The interview of Rossel, in which he was masterfully
plumbed rather than excoriated, had just concluded with the Red
Cross investigator's defending his report. All the while the
director, so amiable, so relentless, confronted him with fact after
fact about the Theresienstadt ghetto, from its four-burner
crematorium to the faked synagogue and playground of the Nazis'
``beautification program'' in advance of the Red Cross visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd sign it again,'' Rossel declared of his report, patiently
chain-smoking as he looked back to Theresienstadt from the vantage
of 1979, when he was a comfortably situated 60-year-old. It was
then that Lanzmann, a veteran of the French Resistance, finally
bearded him with infinite politeness as Lanzmann was midway through
his Aeneid of a masterwork, interviewing sundry Holocaust survivors
and perpetrators across 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lanzmann left that interview 20 years ago with the conviction
that the very ``architecture'' of his core film, ``Shoah,'' and the
peculiarity of Rossel's performance _ ``what it is to know and not
to know'' _ dictated the stand-alone film now unveiled as ``A
Visitor from the Living.'' The title is an inexact translation of
the phrase Rossel used in recalling how the camp's silent,
wide-eyed internees (whom he retrospectively terms Israelis, not
Jews) had looked upon him as ``un vivant qui passe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was very strong,'' Lanzmann said of the footage,
taken with a single 16-mm camera that required reloading breaks
every 11 minutes, the same as for all the ``Shoah'' interviews. The
director used the breaks to calm Rossel and bolster mutual respect.
(``I did not want to hurt him, to scare or frighten him.'')
</P>
<P>
   Artfully prodded to look back, Rossel defended his lasting
impression that Theresienstadt housed ``very rich Jews'' and
Prominenten _ German Jewish leaders buying their way out of trouble
in decent circumstances _ not varied throngs doomed for
extermination, as Lanzmann documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that no one ever said, `This is a farce,'''
Rossel said defensively of the mute Jews he glimpsed in their play
acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw was the terror of the Jews,'' Lanzmann responded,
recounting elaborate Nazi stagecraft and death warnings before the
Red Cross visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passivity is so hard to swallow,'' said Rossel, clinging
to this point as the camera mercilessly closed in on his eyes
edgily dancing about the past.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Lanzmann's ferocious technique of remembering each bit of
testimony flashed clear as he reminded Rossel how he initially
described his mission in the ghetto visit: ``My task was to see
beyond what I was seeing.'`
</P>
<P>
   Lanzmann offered a pained smile in emphasizing this idea, so
much at the heart of Holocaust history, in an interview before the
film debut of Rossel. ``He was deceived by himself,'' said the
director in a tone of sad understanding of the vagaries of
anti-Semitism. ``That is what is fascinating _ his face and what he
does not let himself say.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever polite in his perseverance, Lanzmann once more tracked down
Rossel two years ago when the film was ready, seeking the
interviewee's permission to present it to the public. (There will
be a second showing Thursday night in Los Angeles at the Directors
Guild of America Theater.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent me a strange letter, a beautiful letter,'' Lanzmann
related, describing how the once-eager 25-year-old inspector was
now 80 and infirm with palsy. ``I don't remember the man I was as
at that time,'' Rossel wrote. ``I believe I am wiser now or more
insane, and it is the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanzmann paused to savor that idea as if it explained the
passion of his own work. ``I like what he said very much. He asked
me: `Please be pitiful. Don't make me look too ridiculous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But he is not,'' the hound of the Holocaust concluded most
insistently. ``He is everything but ridiculous.''

   PLANEJE, Yugoslavia _ Syl Shigjeqi stepped into the shower
through a hole in the wall of his house, up a ramp of rubble, over
the faucet's skeleton, a shaving brush, soap and, somehow, teacups.
There is no shortage of destruction in Kosovo, but here it is
possible to see what NATO's bombs added to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had everything here,'' said Shigjeqi, 33, a baker, who came
back Wednesday to see what little was left of his home. ``Hot water
heater. Shower. Washing machine. It was very nice. Modern.''
</P>
<P>
   This village of 29 families _ nearly all the men are bakers,
with bakeries around Kosovo and Serbia __ was more or less leveled
in near-daily attacks by NATO planes in the weeks before the peace
agreement was signed with Serbia. The residents of this and other
villages in the Has region left their homes shortly after NATO
began its bombing in late March. The area became a NATO target
because several thousand Yugoslav army soldiers were dug in there
and in houses abandoned by Albanians, fighting off an offensive by
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   This village and others nearby are at the foot of Mount Pastrik,
where some of the most furious fighting took place. At the time,
refugees crossing the border into Albania could actually hear the
NATO bombs whistle down before exploding.
</P>
<P>
   Now some are returning to see the damage NATO has done.
</P>
<P>
   In Shigjeqi's yard, a Yugoslav army truck rests on its back. In
his basement, the Serbs have left dozens of empty ammunition boxes.
Several houses have crumbled to the point that it is hard to tell
where one began and the other ended. A 6-foot-long unexploded bomb
lies in a depression in the village's center. The paw of a gray dog
is near the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, it was NATO,'' Shigjeqi said. Despite the
destruction, the villagers said they do not blame NATO for toppling
their houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Serbs who are guilty,'' said Qerim Vorfaj, 45, also a
baker, whose house was destroyed. ``We are glad the Serbs aren't
here anymore. May NATO live billions and billions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But nearly everyone here thinks NATO nonetheless has an
obligation to help them rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope somebody helps us,'' said Arif Shigjeqi, 61, like
most people in Planeje a relative of Syl Shigjeqi. ``We left
Albania, we get back and what's here? I have 25 people in my
family. I don't know where to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three days in a row I have come here, just looking,'' he
added. ``How can I live here? It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Other villages along the Albanian border show similar
destruction, largely as a result of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In Milaj, the next village toward the border, German soldiers on
Wednesday posted mine warnings along the edge of the rubble. In the
town lay unexploded Serbian grenades and a twisted artillery piece.
</P>
<P>
   In Gorozhupe, a border town that was heavily bombed by NATO and
was the scene of fighting between the KLA and Serbian forces,
Serbian helmets, gas masks and camouflage uniforms lay in a
courtyard surrounded by several buildings that appeared to have
been burned from the inside. Zepa Binaj, 56, an ethnic Albanian who
owns one of the homes, said that Serbs hiding from NATO attacks
destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look what they have done,'' said Mrs. Binaj, her hands shaking
as she smoked a cigarette. She has seven children, and they built
her the house, now scorched and littered with rifle shells.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very, very poor,'' she said. ``I had enough trouble
raising them all. But you can see what they built me.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the NATO bombing and the fighting between Serbs and the KLA
went on for days after the peace agreement was approved by the
Serbian Parliament and even after it was signed. In fact, the
fighting and bombing seemed to intensify as peace neared,
inflicting some of the saddest casualties of the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, villagers in Rogove, another town in the Has
region, unearthed the bodies of two men, cousins named Asllan
Berisha, 34, and Besim Berisha, 24, who died in a firefight with
Serbian soldiers on June 4, the day after the Serbian Parliament
accepted the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   The men had been hastily buried by the Drinit te Bardhe River.
On Wednesday, the two men _ who hid and fed KLA fighters _ were put
into carved coffins, the red and black Albanian flag taped to the
lid, and taken to be mourned at their families' houses before being
buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear anybody,'' said Sefir Berisha, Asllan's
father, as his son's coffin was placed on two cinder blocks on
their front lawn. ``Nobody can cry. Nobody can say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fitim Hoti, 25, one of the men who survived the attack, with
bullet holes in his hand and shrapnel wounds, said he, the Berisha
cousins and a fourth man had fled, carrying arms, when Serbian
soldiers came into town. They hid by the river, thinking that they
would not be be pursued by the Serbs because of the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the Serbs followed and the cousins were killed
fighting them. ``It was their last offensive. Whatever they found,
they just destroyed it,'' he said of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even as returning villagers are finding bodies of ethnic
Albanians, it is something of a mystery why there appeared to be no
bodies of Serbian soldiers here in Planeje, given how badly damaged
the town was. Here and there the smell of rotting flesh rose from
the rubble, but there was no way to tell if it was human or animal.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Shigjeqi, 40, said he believed that hundreds of Serbian
soldiers had died on Mount Pastrik but that the bodies had been
taken away by the withdrawing troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to show the world that the Serbs didn't have
soldiers or arms or ammunition here and that NATO attacked
civilians,'' he said. ``But thousands of them were here.''

its 50th anniversary at its summer home in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
in July. But this week's performances of George Balanchine's
``Midsummer Night's Dream'' will bring the company's anniversary
season at the New York State Theater in Manhattan to a close on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It is a festive end to a job more than well done. After a
mammoth display of 100 ballets, the company goes out with one of
Balanchine's most spectacular and poetic productions. Darci Kistler
and Peter Boal, both dancing gloriously, led the first cast of
``Dream'' on Tuesday night with temperament and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Few ballet treatments of Shakespeare have the refinement that so
eloquently colors Balanchine's combination of narrative and
pure-dance divertissement. Many a ``Romeo and Juliet'' turns into
choreographed drama on the ballet stage. But in his 1962 version of
``Dream,'' Balanchine knew that dance had to add its own dimension
to the text. His approach is more musical than literary, with a
score composed of pieces by Mendelssohn.
</P>
<P>
   Wit runs through the two acts. There are hordes of arm-flapping
children as little bugs, and there is no sweeter moment than when
they yawn and lie down to sleep. But the ballet's grandeur lies in
the way Balanchine turns the tale in Act 1 into a pure-dance
distillation of the same story in Act 2. Here the vision is
abstract, with the reconciliation of quarreling lovers embodied by
a sublime duet, danced to perfection by Jock Soto and Wendy Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   Both seemed to swim through the music on Tuesday. Ms. Whelan,
amazingly centered in her toe work, knew nonetheless how to bring
off the beautiful final image when she sank luxuriantly into a
swoon and then twisted into a second swoon as Soto held her with
one arm.
</P>
<P>
   As ideal lovers, this pair is not the mirror image of Titania
and Oberon, the fairy monarchs who rule the first act but never
dance together in an adagio. Titania does have an anonymous
cavalier: Charles Askegard, in a debut, showed off his usual fine
versatility. Ms. Kistler's fairy queen was in her element, bold but
also playful in a duet full of departures from conventional
classical partnering. At one point, Titania and her cavalier face
each other in a social-dance position. Yet Ms. Kistler raises her
leg in ballet's attitude position.
</P>
<P>
   Boal's Oberon was commanding from the start; he flew about the
stage with dynamism and speed, detailing the small steps that
expanded into his astonishingly large leaps. Albert Evans' jolly
Puck complemented Boal's power with extraordinary lightness.
</P>
<P>
   Debuts came from Carrie Lee Riggins, a streamlined butterfly,
and Jennie Somogyi, seductive as Hippolyta. Ms. Somogyi pushed too
hard in her fouettes and went off balance, but her jetes, with
front foot extended further at the last minute, offered a
breathtaking image of sustained flight.
</P>
<P>
   The acting in Act 1 tended toward too much realism. But
Alexander Ritter, in a debut as Lysander, stylized his unhappy
lover to more persuasive effect. Riolama Lorenzo (Helena), Pascale
van Kipnis (Hermia) and Sebastien Marcovici (Demetrius) rounded out
the quartet of mortals.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Savoye's moment as Bottom in a donkey head was timed to
comic perfection, and Ms. Kistler danced endearingly with him. Hugo
Fiorato conducted a seemingly happy orchestra and chorus, with
Beverly Myers and Gale Limansky as soloists.

BOOK TALK: LOVED STRICTURES IN A LENIENT AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Upon learning of the imminent arrival of a new
edition of The Elements of Style, Strunk and White's concise and to
many seminal guide to American language, I went back to the current
edition, and in 10 minutes of perusal I was reminded of things
needed to sharpen one's writing skills. I was certainly struck with
the realization that everyone who writes, whether it be books or
journalism or corporate reports, should go back to this or a
similar work every few years for a refresher. The fourth edition of
Elements will be in bookstores in several weeks, and it could
become an unlikely but tremendously amusing and helpful beach read.
</P>
<P>
   The third edition was published in 1997, 92 pages in paperback,
and the new one has grown by 36 pages, mostly through the updating
of references to reflect not only current facts but also the modern
concern with inclusion and diversity. For instance, a fact change:
The speed limit on the New York Thruway has risen to 65 mph from 55
mph. But more important, ``she'' now alternates with ``he'' in the
examples. And in the illustrations of principles, contemporary
writers, often women, are used. Thus, in discussing the rule of
keeping the subject and the principal verb of a sentence together,
Toni Morrison's ``Beloved'' has displaced Wordsworth's
``Excursion'' in the example.
</P>
<P>
   There are other changes. Another new feature includes such
common terms as air-conditioning and word processor. Writers are
urged to become more direct and personal, with the implied third
person ``the writer'' changed to the second person ``you'' in the
book's commands.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, commands. When the book was originally put together by
William Strunk Jr. in 1919 for his students at Cornell University,
its decrees of linguistic precision were snapped out like military
orders. That tone more or less remained when one of Strunk's
students, E.B. White, the New Yorker magazine writer known for
graceful and stylish prose, put the book together in 1959 and made
it into the icon we now know as The Elements of Style (Allyn &AMP;
Bacon).
</P>
<P>
   White polished it for a 1972 edition, removing what he called
``bewhiskered entries,'' and updated it again in 1979 for a third
edition. By then, for many writers, it had become known simply as
``the little book.'' So far about 10 million copies have been sold
in hardcover and paperback, most to college and smart high school
students, said the publisher, William Barke, who refuses to reveal
how large the first printing of the new edition will be. About
400,000 copies would not be surprising. Advance copies of the book
are not available.
</P>
<P>
   This edition has a foreword by Roger Angell, also a New Yorker
writer noted for graceful style, who is White's stepson. Angell
said he really didn't much want to do the introduction but finally
decided to write it because the originally proposed foreword ``had
some careless, common mistakes'' and ``didn't sound very much like
Andy White.'' He said his sister-in-law, Allene White, ``was on
watch'' as sort of the family Praetorian Guard of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. White says that the publisher sent the galleys to the
Whites ``out of the goodness of his heart'' but that sending them
``to the White family was like sending raw meat to a cage of
lions.'' She added: ``When push comes to shove, we shove so well,
we make so much noise. Essentially it now has the same point of
view as White had.''
</P>
<P>
   These days there are other antidotes for illiteracy, and one in
particular some writers consider even better than Elements. That is
``Simple and Direct: A Rhetoric for Writers'' (HarperCollins) by
Jacques Barzan, who said that he felt that even though ``Elements
awakens a bad writer to things he or she should be aware of, it
doesn't grapple with the possibilities of the good things'' a
writer needs. There is also for many The New Fowler's Modern
English Usage (Oxford University Press, 1996), but its critics have
complained that the latest edition has taken Fowler out of the book
and that it has lapsed into a passive acceptance of some changes
that are not praiseworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Passive acceptance is not what Strunk and White are about, and
that probably accounts in part for the book's appeal and its
diverse fans. Annik La Farge, associate publisher of Simon &AMP;
Schuster's trade division, said: ``It's not only a tool for writers
but for publishers also. It helps you think in a clear and focused
way. If I ever get to such an elevated position as publisher, I
might send a copy to every writer and editor.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a sort of Roto-Rooter for prose. Doug Johnson, the
producer of C-Span's ``Book TV,'' said he started in radio, which
is ``a writerly medium, and sometimes everything you had on paper
was all clogged up; this helped unclog it.'' He said he kept it
``close by, on my shelf over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   E.B. White once said in an interview that while he used the book
and held firm to its fundamentals, he also ignored it at times.
</P>
<P>
   In the first paragraph of this column I used the word
``certainly'' to add weight to a thought. The little book calls the
use of this word a mannerism that is ``bad in speech, is even worse
in writing.'' In the third paragraph I used the word ``feature.''
Elements said that is a hackneyed word usually adding ``nothing to
the sentence in which it occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   One is cautioned: ``Do not dress words up by adding ly to them,
as though putting a hat on a horse.'' I did it in the first
sentence of the second paragraph, using the word ``mostly.'' I was
rather lazy; I should have rewritten the sentence to make the word
``most'' enough. Now I see that ``rather'' as a qualifier is among
the ``leeches that infest the pond of prose, sucking the blood of
words.'' Who knows how many more misuses I wrote befogging the
reader?

 By STEPHEN KINZER    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DHARMSALA, India _ The improbable news of free elections in
Indonesia has given Tibetan exiles like Thupten Samphel a deepening
sense of melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a degree of frustration, not only among young Tibetans
but also among the older refugees,'' Samphel, an official of the
exile government based here, said as he gazed out at the Himalayan
peaks that separate him from his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen things we thought were impossible,'' he
continued. ``The Berlin Wall fell, the Soviet Union collapsed and
majority rule came to South Africa. Even here in Asia there have
been great changes. Watching these things, we feel a tinge of envy,
and wonder why our situation hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In this remote Indian town, thousands of Tibetans have been
awaiting deliverance for nearly 40 years. Their political and
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, 64, who won the Nobel Peace Prize
in 1989, is a devoted pacifist. He has refused to support armed
actions or other forms of violence in his campaign to win
concessions from China, which occupied Tibet in 1950 and considers
it a Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
   How long he can keep exiled Tibetans united around his
nonviolent principles is the question that envelops Dharmsala.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a shaded courtyard near the Dalai Lama's residence on
a recent morning, two young Tibetans argued about how they could
best end their long exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the Dalai Lama,'' said Tzering Doyee, a 25-year-old
language student. ``If European countries and the United States
support us, we will go back. Young people in China are talking
about democracy. Maybe in two or three years, I will be living in
Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, Doyee's friend Lobsang Treten, 32, also a student,
smiled and shook his head. ``If we wait for nonviolence to work,
maybe I will spend my whole life here,'' he said. ``We need a
stronger way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Doyee and Treten have never seen Tibet. Both were born in India,
and the closest contact they have with their homeland is Dharmsala,
where Tibetans live alongside streams of Western pilgrims who come
to soak up their spiritual vibrations.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Dharmsala is home to nearly 15,000 Tibetan
exiles, who for the most part live peacefully with the region's
250,000 Indians. Many of the Tibetans work for the Dalai Lama's
exile government or run shops or hostelries with names like Lotus
Flower, Shangri-La and Tibet Memory.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the Tibetans, a people viewed as gentle innocents
crushed by a cynical world, and by the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan
Buddhism he represents, spiritual pilgrims have made Dharmsala one
of India's most unusual tourist destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hippies are everywhere,'' said Subahsh Nehria, 29, an
Indian who was born here and now guides trekkers through the
surrounding mountains. ``You wouldn't believe there are so many of
them left. They have a very romantic view of Tibetans and the Dalai
Lama, and I suppose they come here hoping some of the aura will rub
off on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Tibetans who live here aren't quite sure what to
make of these visitors. While most appreciate the money they spend
at handicraft shops and the pro-Tibet convictions they presumably
develop and bring home, some see an air of silliness in their
idealization of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heritage is Buddhism, but I wouldn't dare tell you that I
know much about it,'' said Dawa Tsering, who was born in India and
has been elected by Tibetans here as their community leader. ``When
I listen to these people, I have to laugh. Buddhism is a fad to
them, like blue jeans. They study for a week or a month and become
champions of Buddhism, at least until another fad comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   The walls of Dharmsala are plastered with signs demanding
Chinese withdrawal from Tibet and urging a boycott of Chinese
goods. They compete for space with leaflets that advertise courses
in natural healing, integral massage, soul realization, ``ancient
yoga of the inner light'' and ``the direct awakening of the
unconditional state beyond the psychological self.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama's office sponsors courses in Tibetan Buddhism,
and they draw many young visitors. One of them, a barefoot
Australian named Nerissa Parker, said she had come to Dharmsala
after having a dream in which the Dalai Lama invited her. She
attended one of the public audiences that he gives every month or
so, and said that making eye contact with him was ``a big
experience because of the very special atmosphere around him.''
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish visitor, Charlotte Pruth, said she had come not out of
curiosity about Buddhism or the Dalai Lama, but to show solidarity
with the Tibetan cause. ``The Chinese overran Tibet and are trying
to destroy the whole country and tradition and religion,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 130,000 Tibetans living in exile. About 80,000
of them live in India, many as farmers in the steamy south, living
very differently from the way they did as nomads in their frozen
homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan refugees have held together with remarkable success over
the decades. Their exile government runs 87 schools in India, Nepal
and Bhutan where Tibetan history, culture and religion are taught
in addition to a standard curriculum. Monks in hundreds of
monasteries keep alive the ancient flame of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most respected leaders of the exile government,
Rinchen Choeygyal, who holds the title of education minister, said
many visitors who come to Dharmsala see Tibetans as ``creatures
from another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But whether they are infatuated or fascinated, if they meet
the right kind of Tibetans it may be good for them and good for our
cause,'' Ms. Choeygyal said. ``When we first came here, even many
people in India had no idea who we were or where we came from or
why. Now the whole world knows, and that is certainly progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our work and in our cause, we are trying to be very
responsible, but the world should also be responsible toward a
group of people that is trying to be an example for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep inside, every one of us is carrying a very heavy load in
spite of our smiling faces and dignified appearance. As human
beings, it is natural that we feel anger and frustration and even
hatred. We are trying to suppress it.''

BOURQUE, DAFOE IN RUNNING FOR NHL AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Hockey League will pay tribute to its best and
brightest in Toronto Thursday night when it presents its annual
major awards at the Air Canada Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Two Bruins are in the running _ Ray Bourque is a candidate to
capture his sixth Norris Trophy as the league's top defenseman, and
Byron Dafoe is among the three finalists for the Vezina Trophy,
given to the best goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston University star Chris Drury has been nominated for
the Calder Trophy as the rookie of the year. Drury, who plays for
the Colorado Avalanche, has plenty of awards already. He pitched
Trumbull, Conn., to the Little League World Series championship 10
years ago, captured the NCAA title in his first year at BU, and won
the Hobey Baker Award as college hockey's top player his last year
there.
</P>
<P>
   Drury has an excellent chance to take the Calder, won last year
by Bruins left wing Sergei Samsonov. His competition is teammate
Milan Hejduk and Ottawa's Marian Hossa. Drury's and Hejduk's
nominations mark the first time in 10 years that teammates are
finalists for the award. Brian Leetch and Tony Granato were
nominees in 1989 as members of the New York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   For Bourque, it is his 14th time as a finalist in 20 seasons and
his first since 1996. In addition to Bourque's five first-place
finishes, he took second in the balloting another five times and
was third three times.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Bruins' captain was third in points among the
league's blueliners with 57, 10 of them goals. He also was third in
ice time, averaging 29.5 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   The other two nominees are St. Louis's Al MacInnis, whom many
feel will capture the trophy, and Detroit's Niklas Lidstrom.
MacInnis has been a finalist five times, finishing behind Bourque
in three of the years Bourque won it. It's the second consecutive
nomination for Lidstrom, who finished second to Los Angeles's Rob
Blake last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe received his first nomination this year. He was third in
the league in goals-against average (1.99), second in save
percentage (.926), and was tied for fifth in victories with 32.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe's competition is Buffalo's Dominik Hasek, who has won the
award four times, including the last two years, and Toronto's
Curtis Joseph, who earned his second nomination and his first since
1993, when he finished third while a member of the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, and Ottawa's Alexei Yashin are
the finalists for the Hart Trophy, given to the most valuable
player.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates to win the Selke Trophy as the top defensive
forward are Ottawa's Magnus Arvedson and two players who opposed
each other in the finals _ Dallas's Jere Lehtinen, who won it last
year, and Buffalo's Michael Peca, who took it in 1997 and finished
second last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas's Ken Hitchcock, Ottawa's Jacques Martin, and Toronto's
Pat Quinn are nominees for the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the
year, won last season by the Bruins' Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The three finalists for the Lady Byng Trophy for gentlemanly
play are recently-retired Wayne Gretzky, no doubt the sentimental
favorite, Anaheim's Teemu Selanne, and Lidstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The other awards that will be presented include the inaugural
Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard trophy, given to the top goal scorer
(Selanne with 47); for the second year in a row, Jagr will collect
the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's top point scorer (127); Dallas
netminders Ed Belfour and Roman Turek (since traded to St. Louis)
will be given the William M. Jennings Trophy for allowing the
fewest goals during the regular season (168). The Bill Masterton
Trophy for perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey
will also be presented as will the King Clancy Trophy for
leadership and humanitarian contribution to his community.

<P>
   ARLINGTON HEIGHTS, Ill. _ Hoisting a bat that looked huge on a
10-year-old, Benjamin Gold stood nervously at the plate under his
floppy orange Orioles cap.
</P>
<P>
   His parents watched from lawn chairs behind the backstop. His
tutor studied the play from behind the first-base line, pointing a
video camera at Benji for a post-game critique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's moving around too much in the box _ and dropping his
hands,'' the tutor, Mark Venditti, had noticed during Benji's first
at-bat. Between innings, he had talked to the boy about making an
adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   Benji took a mighty swing and tapped the ball toward the
pitcher's mound, then scampered toward first base. It was good
enough for an infield hit. And the runner on third base made it
home, so Benji was credited with a crucial run batted in, an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that American childhood has become a serious
venture, parents like Loren and Debbie Gold are paying $70 an hour,
sometimes more, to private coaches to sharpen the skills of their
Little League ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Golds, who harbor no illusions about athletic
scholarships or big money in the professional leagues, hiring a
tutor seemed a logical way to help a child whose heart was broken
into pieces with every strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for his self-esteem,'' said Mrs. Gold, a 43-year-old
employee recruiter. ``He was getting to the point where he just
wanted to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard last year,'' Benji agreed. ``When you strike out,
you know, and people say you should be off the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents find themselves in a spot these days. The increasingly
competitive nature of childhood makes parents feel practically
obligated to give their children every possible edge in academics
and athletics. And yet, the rigors of self-improvement for children
_ preschoolers now go to foreign language camps _ can take an
exacting toll on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message used to be, `Be the best you can be,'' said
Cynthia Kowa-Basler, a middle-school counselor in Dixon, Ill. ``Now
the message is simply, `Be the best.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kowa-Basler said one eighth-grade student sat and wept in
the counselor's office because he did not believe he could live up
to his parents' expectations. The counselor scheduled a meeting
with the parents to deliver her professional advice in the bluntest
of terms: ``Back off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golds, who have two children, share the ambivalence of many
parents. On one hand, they want to encourage Benji and their
daughter, Samantha, to take piano lessons, play sports and
participate in social activities. But they fear an overload.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, who is 11, has talked about feeling ``stressed out''
by all of her activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an 11-year-old starts talking about being too stressed,''
Mrs. Gold said, ``it makes you stop and wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Beck, a sociologist at Northwestern University, said
child rearing has taken a more management-style approach,
especially among parents who are well-educated and successful. In
some ways, he said, children have come to be seen a bit like growth
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an earlier generation, parents were younger, going at life
without much of a plan, a little courageous and a little foolhardy,
a kind of what-the-heck attitude,'' Beck said. ``But many of
today's parents are more serious. They put off having children for
a career. And having had success in their careers, they use the
same goal-oriented principles when it comes to raising their kids.
They study what's needed for success. They look at the competition.
It's all a very rational, very market-oriented approach.''
</P>
<P>
   In his novel ``Wobegon Boy,'' Garrison Keillor suggested that
parents of an earlier time seemed to have better things to do than
obsess about their children. ``They did not read books about
parenting, and when they gathered with other adults, at Lutheran
church suppers or family get-togethers, they didn't talk about
schools or about the prevailing theories of child development,'' he
wrote. ``They did not weave their lives around yours. They had
their own lives, which were mysterious to you.''

   In part, parents have become more intimately involved in the
activities of their children because they now must act as
chauffeurs, carting their children from piano lesson to tennis
court to soccer match, driving minivans to the league games that
have replaced the unchaperoned pickup games of the old
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Today's crop of parents can scarcely take sole blame for the
image of the overzealous Little League parent. Accounts of
bothersome parents ranting from the bleachers go back to the days
before the 60-year-old Little League.
</P>
<P>
   But today's frenetic competition among children, and among the
parents of children, has turned up the pressure to win. It is
perhaps not surprising then, in a service economy where almost
anything can be taught and anyone trained, that Junior's batting
flaws are something to be repaired by a service that advertises in
the Yellow Pages.
</P>
<P>
   When a child goes into a slump, plenty of parents pick up the
telephone and call Grand Slam USA, one of the many places around
the country that now provides baseball instructors to boys and
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday morning, we get the frantic calls from parents,''
said Leland Fisher, an owner of Grand Slam, in suburban Palatine.
``They'll say, `It's an emergency _ the boy struck out twice on
Saturday _ we need help right away.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the average young ballplayer still relies on pals or a
parent, private tutoring has become a familiar part of the social
landscape around the country, said Lance Van Auken, a spokesman for
Little League Baseball Inc., in Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not any doubt that there's a lot more private
instruction out there,'' said Van Auken, who noted that a big
portion of the students were girls, trying to win college
scholarships in softball. ``There are no hard numbers, because it's
privately done by parents. But you hear a lot of anecdotes.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for instruction has also popularized baseball camp. A
handful of such camps a generation ago has grown to a big business,
Van Auken said, with dozens and dozens of camps around the country,
especially in the South.
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Hlavacek, 14, practices batting, he takes tips from
an instructor who works as a professional scout. The help has paid
off. The boy, who just graduated from the eighth grade in the
Chicago suburbs, has a red-hot batting average of over .500.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Allison, who is entering her senior year of high
school, takes lessons for fast-pitch softball. She has also been an
outstanding ballplayer, and hopes to play on a college team.
</P>
<P>
   To their father, Jerry Hlavecek, who pays more than $100 a week
for the lessons, the private instruction has helped their talents
soar.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to play the sport at a higher level, this is the
only way you're going to get there,'' said Hlavacek, a business
executive. ``How do you think Ken Griffey learned to hit? Somebody
taught him, that's how.''
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and children say it works better to have a
professional as coach, rather than a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confrontation that normally happens between a father and
son _ it doesn't happen,'' Hlavacek said.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Michael, agreed. ``You don't really listen to your
dad,'' he said. ``He sometimes yells. And sometimes, he doesn't
know what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiring a coach also helped domestic relations in the McEnerney
home in Mount Prospect, northwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband didn't want to get into any more arguments with my
son,'' said Maureen McEnerney, whose 14-year-old son, Matthew, and
17-year-old daughter, Christie, take private lessons. ``My kids now
love the game even more. Plus they get along better with their
dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McEnerney, a hairdresser, and her husband, William, an
electrician, get the impression that other people think hiring
sports tutors seems excessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's like playing a musical instrument,'' Mrs.
McEnerney said. ``It's a mechanical thing. It's a matter of
studying and learning.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day after his latest ball game, Benji went to the ball park
to train under the eye of Venditti, a 26-year-old software salesman
who played two seasons with the Zanesville (Ohio) Greys in the
independent Frontier League. Venditti tutors four players on
Benji's Orioles team. In all, he works with about 20 players, from
age 8 through high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atta boy, Benji,'' Venditti called out, as Benji swatted a
line drive. ``You're doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gold and her husband, Loren, watched the practice from
their lawn chairs, praising their son afterward _ ``Nice lesson,
Benji,'' they said. Gold, a 45-year-old electrical engineer, said
he worked long hours and could not spare much time to play with
Benji himself.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he had time, Gold would not be much help. ``I was no
ballplayer,'' he said smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Not all fathers bow out like Loren Gold. Around the batting
cages of the league are fathers who strut like Babe Ruth, sounding
as if they know everything about the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, the owner of Grand Slam in Palatine, says he cringes at
what he sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kid will be crying, `I don't want to play, I don't want to
play,' and the father is pulling him along,'' Fisher said.
``Sometimes, the biggest thing the instructor does is simply build
up the kid's confidence. After all the criticism from the parent,
they need to be told they're all right.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Fisher said, the instructors will turn the tables
and give an overbearing father a taste of his own medicine. The
instructor will ask the father to step into the cage and try his
luck with a bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he's liable to see that it's not so easy, after all,''
Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Or he must face the fact, he added, that the child's lack of
skill was just an inherited trait.

SHIPS DISCOVERED DEEP IN MEDITERRANEAN SAID OLDEST KNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year was about 750 B.C. when the two ships set out from the
Mediterranean port of Tyre, now in Lebanon, on what should have
been a routine voyage, each carrying a cargo of about 10 tons of
wine in ceramic jugs called amphorae. Then suddenly a violent storm
blew in, sinking the two Phoenician ships in more than 1,000 feet
of water.
</P>
<P>
   There they lay, unknown and undisturbed in the sand and muck,
until less than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   That's when they were finally located, photographed and sampled
by famed oceanographer Robert Ballard, discoverer of the Titanic,
and a team of archeologists and engineers from Harvard University,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution, and others. The ships are the oldest ever found in
deep water anywhere in the world, Ballard said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient ships are remarkably well preserved, Ballard said,
because they have remained in such deep water. ``The great depths
that exist in the oceans, the absence of sunlight, the great
pressures, seem to preserve history far more than we thought,''
said Ballard, director of the Institute for Exploration in Mystic,
Conn., at a press conference Wednesday in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ballard and other researchers, with the help of a
US Navy nuclear submarine, found _ while searching for the wreck of
an Israeli sub _ several ancient Roman ships in the central
Mediterranean off Sicily, and it was during that expedition that
the submarine also located other possible wrecks off the Israeli
coast. But it was not until this month that the scientists were
able to return to check out these other finds close-up using
cameras on a deep-diving robotic craft called Jason developed by
Woods Hold Oceanographic Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear from this discovery, as well as that off Sicily in
1997, that the deep ocean holds great promise to the field of
archeology,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the recent development of sophisticated deep-diving craft
like Jason, most shipwrecks had been found only close to shore and
in shallow water. The oldest ship ever found anywhere was a trading
ship dating to 1300 B.C., close to the Turkish coast. Only two
other wrecks older than the new finds have ever been discovered;
all three of the older wrecks were in water shallower than 200
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Using Jason's remote-controlled arm, the team was able to
recover 15 of the amphorae from the two ships, whose exact location
they will not divulge because of fears that treasure hunters might
plunder the archeologically valuable wrecks. The team will not
attempt to raise the ships themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amphorae were intact, the wine within had long ago
seeped out and been replaced by sand.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University archeologist Lawrence Stager said he was able
to determine the age of the wrecks because of the distinctive shape
of the amphorae, which were the universal, standardized shipping
containers of antiquity. ``We were able to actually date the ship
by looking at the amphora style, and it came out to a period about
750 to 700 B.C.,'' he said Wednesday. This was about the time that
Homer, a little further west in Greece, was starting to compose his
famous epic poems.
</P>
<P>
   The amphorae had distinctive mushroom-shaped lips that were
typical of Phoenician containers, Stager said. The ships were
probably headed for ports in northern Africa, most likely either in
Egypt, or Carthage, a Phoenician colony near present-day Tunis.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenicians were the leading seafaring people of their time,
which lasted from 1200 to 146 B.C., but little has been known about
the specifics of their trading routes, the amount and types of
cargoes they carried, and who their trading partners were. The
discovery of these ships could help to open up a whole new chapter
in the research on this ancient maritime culture, the researchers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The ships, one about 58 feet long and the other about 48 feet,
were found between 1,000 and 3,000 feet deep, 30 miles off the
coast. The larger of the two is now the biggest pre-classical ship
ever found, the team said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the ships, the team found heavy stone anchors,
crockery for food preparation, a wine decanter, and an incense
stand. The items all point to an origin in Phoenicia, which was
located in present-day Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard said that ``more important discoveries should come in
the near future that could significantly alter our present
understanding of ancient maritime trade.'' Already, the earlier
find off Sicily of Roman ships dating from 100 B.C. to A.D. 400
proved a once-controversial theory that the Romans navigated long,
deep-water trade routes, rather than staying close to shore as some
scholars had believed.
</P>
<P>
   These ancient finds should provide a kind of reality check when
compared with the descriptions in literature and art from that
period, the researchers said.

   THOMPSON-COLUMN_FT:UNDATED _ You know what's amazing about
politicians?
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, a lot of things are amazing about politicians: their
breathtaking proclivity for deceit, their mind-boggling penchant
for manipulation, their shocking propensity for greed and
self-indulgence, their limitless capacity for trampling the
interests of the people they are elected to serve ... But the
amazing trait of which I speak is the politicians' infuriating
habit of reacting to problems by proposing solutions that have
nothing to do with the problems they propose to solve. 920 Bill
Thompson. &QL;

AIR FORCE EASES MUST-STAY ORDER FOR DEPARTING PERSONNEL 
</HEADLINE>

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force said Wednesday it had partially
lifted orders that had prevented thousands of officers and
enlistees from retiring or leaving the service during the Yugoslav
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called stop-loss order, a rarely used provision that kept
key personnel in uniform past their separation and retirement
dates, will allow them to leave the Air Force as previously
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force spokeswoman T'Jae Gibson said a small percentage of
European-based personnel supporting Operation Allied Force, the
recently ended air war against Yugoslavia, will remain affected by
stop-loss for now. Almost 18,000 Air Force personnel remain
deployed in Kosovo support roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the end of hostilities, withdrawal of Yugoslav troops
from Kosovo and the redeployment of forces home, it is appropriate
to begin releasing our people from stop-loss,'' said Col. Lynn
Pratt, chief of the Air Force's military personnel policy division.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end stop-loss, which was last ordered in 1990 as
the Persian Gulf War loomed, had been in the works. Defense
Secretary William Cohen this week said an end of stop-loss order
was expected as U.S. forces return to their home bases.
</P>
<P>
   Two airmen at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, who were
among the 6,000 personnel previously cleared to leave the service
before being ordered to stay, agreed the stop-loss policy wasn't a
fix for an Air Force ravaged by a loss of pilots and others in
critical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody kind of believes it is a short-term solution
to a lot of long-term problems that have existed for many years
prior to this action,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Pickett, an instructor
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Band-Aid,'' said Sgt. Vibol Ros, a computer network
administrator at Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Stop-loss only can be imposed in time of war, national emergency
or when reservists are ordered to duty, as they were when President
Clinton mobilized 33,102 men and women in April during the height
of the NATO-led air campaign against Yugoslavia.

SOUTH AFRICAN PROVINCIAL PREMIER STIRS FUROR OVER POLITICAL
ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: this replaces SAFRICA-RARE-LION, which has been held) 
(bl) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The new governor of a South African
province, whose scandals he promised to clean up, came under fire
Wednesday for saying that he felt it was acceptable for politicians
to lie to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The new premier of Mpumalanga province, Ndaweni Mahlangu, cited
President Clinton as an example. Lying ``wasn't the end of Bill
Clinton's life, and I personally don't find it to be a very bad
thing,'' Mahlangu said. He was defending his reappointment of a
finance officer whom he said had admitted lying about signing
promissory notes in what may have been a fraud scheme.
</P>
<P>
   As opposition parties and religious figures attacked him
Wednesday, Mahlangu apologized and said he had made the remark in
jest. But reporters who heard the remarks Tuesday said that
Mahlangu seemed perfectly serious.
</P>
<P>
   The African National Congress at first gingerly defended
Mahlangu, saying he might have been quoted out of context and had
been asked for a written explanation of what he meant. But if he
was correctly quoted, said ANC spokesman Smuts Ngonyama, the remark
was ``inappropriate, unfortunate and totally unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying politicians ought to lie ``goes against long-held moral
values of the ANC,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is particularly sensitive, because the ANC is
experiencing an internal over corruption. Because corruption is so
endemic in many African governments, the ANC is eager to appear
squeaky clean. But after having played down the problem for years
and pointing out that the old government had several corruption
scandals, Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, who succeeded Mandela as
president this month, scheduled an anti-corruption conference for
this year and conceded that some party leaders, particularly in
local government, appeared to be enriching themselves. Mandela and
Mbeki condemned those figures as traitors to the struggle for black
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy around Mahlangu arose because he appointed to
his Cabinet two men under investigation by the Heath Special
Investigation Unit, a national anti-corruption team headed by Judge
Willem Heath. Wednesday, a court invalidated some of the $170
million of promissory notes that provincial officials have issued.
The collateral was control of some of the most precious assets of
the province, its stunning mountain and river-canyon parks.
</P>
<P>
   The case has embarrassed the province. Besides mortgaging the
parks, officials are accused of having awarded themselves contracts
to provide helicopter, lodging and other services.
</P>
<P>
   One reappointed former Cabinet member who was just named the
chief financial officer, Jacques Modipane, is accused of having
signed $57 million worth of the illegal notes. He denied that and
accused staff members of having forged his signature. But Mahlangu
said Modipane later privately admitted having signed the notes.
</P>
<P>
   The premier defended that, saying, ``This was not a grievous
enough mistake to send anyone to the guillotine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, he said: ``It is nothing new. Many
politicians publicly deny they did certain things but then later
admit to them. It is accepted, and it not unusual anywhere in the
world. It wasn't the end of Bill Clinton's life and I personally
don't find it to be a very bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Heath said Wednesday that he was personally surprised that
Modipane had been reappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The citation of Clinton amused South Africans. The national
radio network, SAFM, opened a short segment on political lying with
a tape of Clinton's saying, ``I did not have sexual relations with
that woman.''

KURDISH REBEL LINKS REVOLT TO REPRESSION BY TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Speaking in his own defense at his treason
trial, Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan said Wednesday that
repressive measures imposed by the Turkish government had driven
him and his followers to take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan said restrictions on the use of the Kurdish language had
led him and many other Kurds to conclude that they had to fight to
preserve their culture and heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of laws give birth to rebellion and anarchy,'' he
told judges at the prison island of Imrali, where he has been the
only inmate since his capture in February. ``Even the smallest
obstacle is enough to spark an uprising. The most important of
these is the language ban. It provokes this revolt.
</P>
<P>
   The way to resolve this problem is to develop Kurdish as a
normal language for private conversation and broadcasting.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's court session, Ocalan spent about 30 minutes
reading from a statement. He said he was not pleading for his life,
but warned that if he is hanged, ``a lot of blood will flow in
Turkey, and this could lead to a military coup.''
</P>
<P>
   The war that Ocalan has waged has cost more than 30,000 lives
and made him the object of intense hatred. It has also made him a
heroic figure to many Kurds who live in Turkey's southeast.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, as is universally expected, the law requires
that he be sentenced to death. On the first day of his trial he
accepted the charges against him, admitting that fighters under his
command had carried out all the attacks attributed to them by
prosecutors, in addition to ``many more you haven't mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   A verdict is expected quickly. ``If the defense is completed
Friday, the verdict may be announced on Tuesday or Wednesday,''
said presiding judge Turgut Okyay on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain whether the expected death sentence will be
carried out. On the opening day of his trial in May, Ocalan said
that if he is allowed to live, he will try to persuade his fighters
to lay down their arms. In exchange, he said, the Turkish
government should allow them to ``enter the political system.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ocalan's fighters began their armed campaign in 1984, Kurds
in southeastern provinces were subject to arrest if they were heard
speaking their language in public. Kurdish music was banned, and
schoolchildren were beaten if they spoke Kurdish rather than
Turkish.
</P>
<P>
   Those restrictions have been eased, and Kurdish conversation is
now heard throughout southeastern Turkey. Cassettes of Kurdish
music are easily available. But there are still no Kurdish-language
schools, and even classes for adults who wish to learn the language
are banned. Nor does the Turkish government permit television
programming in Kurdish.
</P>
<P>
   The government maintains a ``unitary state,'' and officials have
repeatedly asserted that encouraging the Kurdish language would
increase ethnic consciousness and lead to other demands that could
ultimately split the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of Ocalan's appeal for reconciliation, the
near-hysteria that accompanied his capture and return to Turkey
appears to have calmed. Newspapers and television commentators that
had spent weeks competing to denounce him in ever-more lurid terms
have turned their attention elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no lack of news to divert their attention.
National elections in April led to the formation of an odd
coalition government between two parties, some of whose members had
spent years shooting and bombing each other. A woman who was
elected to Parliament scandalized the country by trying to take her
oath of office while wearing a Muslim head scarf. In recent days
debate has been raging about the leader of a religious sect who,
depending on one's point of view, is either providing good
education to thousands of needy students or secretly plotting to
overthrow the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
   In this climate, it may be easier for civilian and political
leaders to decide not to push for Ocalan's quick execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are saying that maybe the best thing would be to
let this case just hang in the wind, if I can put it that way,''
said a foreign diplomat who has been closely following the trial.
``Convict the guy, sentence him to death and then don't do anything
else. There are more than 100 other people in Turkish prisons who
have been under death sentences for years. Ocalan might simply be
added to that list.''

<P>
   ALDEBURGH, England _ When the sun beats the rain, as it did over
the weekend, and the wind does not chill your bones but rushes
cloud patterns of navy blue and ocher across the North Sea, this
little town on the Suffolk Coast can seem one of the best places on
earth to be in early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Its cultural weather, too, is inviting. Aldeburgh was never
overwhelmed by the presence of Benjamin Britten, who lived here for
more than 30 years, and it has not been overwhelmed by the music
festival that has continued for almost a quarter century since his
death. The place has strong literary associations.
</P>
<P>
   Its beach is lined with fishing boats and with tar-painted huts
where the morning's catch can be bought. It has kept, almost
intact, its Victorian architecture of brown and garnet brick. It
has a robust and substantial character of its own into which the
annual festival fits.
</P>
<P>
   And that festival has a character of its own. This year composer
Thomas Ades begins his stint as its artistic director, and while
the programming is suitably marked by his fascinations (with
Couperin and musical machines, for instance), the essence remains
what it was when Britten was alive _ and not for sentimental
reasons, but because this is a mix that works.
</P>
<P>
   The festival brings great music and great performers to a place
a hundred miles from anywhere _ a place that happens to have, in
the Snape Maltings, one of the world's great concert halls. Other
local buildings, especially the 15th-century churches, house music
appropriate to them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a special thrill this year to hear the magnificent
light-washed church at Blythburgh filled with the intricate and
sensuous polyphony that was new when it was being built: the music
of John Dunstable and his immediate predecessors, sung by the four
men of the Orlando Consort with beautiful tone and companionate
phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   But new music is just as important at Aldeburgh as the venerable
or venerated, and Ades' appointment is a strong signal that the
festival is determined to stay lively. This year's events started
with a new production of his opera ``Powder Her Face,'' and during
this second weekend he conducted the BBC Symphony in a program that
included his own ``Asyla'' and ``Tributes'' for strings by the
Danish composer Per Norgard, whose music was featured also in a
chamber recital.
</P>
<P>
   Norgard is a composer who probably works at his best on a big
scale, for ``Tributes,'' with homages to Bartok, Lutoslawski and
Sibelius, was far more impressive than his smaller pieces. It
helped that the BBC musicians were playing so well for Ades in what
was only his second concert with a big orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   As a conductor, Ades is the same kind of musician he is when
composing or playing the piano: completely assured, incapable of
ugliness and adept at presenting ideas with the maximum force and
freshness. Norgard's music typically has a gangling sort of motion,
with layers and elements moving at different speeds and the harmony
held together with a fair dash of hope and luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tributes'' was like that, but it also had gestures that came
across as vivid surprises: a whisk of upward-vanishing glissando in
the first section, and later some brilliant textures of harmonics.
It was let down only by a program note not up to Aldeburgh's usual
high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Ades and the orchestra were also in top form in two rare works
from early in the century _ Janacek's ``Fiddler's Child'' and
Sibelius' incidental music for Hofmannsthal's play ``Everyman'' _
where again Ades' strong grasp of gesture was a big plus. The
Sibelius score includes one haunting song and some dark slow
movements, including one for string orchestra that, in this
performance, kept repeating its same searing strokes with resolute
strength and accuracy until the strings were eventually smothered
by gong crashes.
</P>
<P>
   In his own music, Ades, aided by his players and the superb
Maltings acoustics, had one hearing so much magic with exceptional
clarity. In the sprinkled fantasies of the first and last movements
of ``Asyla,'' he seemed to be stirring up stars, and the third
movement had, alongside oddity and power, humor. Aldeburgh should
try to keep him.

WIDOWER SEEKS EXTRADITION OF SUSPECTED KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Florida, New Jersey, Texas)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The husband of a woman who was brutally slain in
her Florida home with her four young children nearby urged Congress
Wednesday to pressure Mexico to return the suspected killer, who
remains in a Mexican jail as he fights extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say Jose Luis Del Toro Jr. fled to Mexico after
allegedly shooting Sheila Bellush on Nov. 7, 1997, with a
.45-caliber pistol and slashing her throat with a kitchen knife in
the laundry room of her Sarasota, Fla., home.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's 2-year-old quadruplets were found near their
mother's body when the police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush, who was 35, was killed six weeks after the Bellush
family moved to Sarasota from San Antonio. Bellush had two other
children from a previous marriage, and her oldest daughter found
the body the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   With his voice cracking and choking back tears, Jamie Bellush,
who has since moved his family to his parents' home in Newton,
N.J., pleaded with lawmakers to change the U.S. extradition treaty
with Mexico and withhold financial aid from it and other countries
that ``interfere in our criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop playing patsy politics with Mexico,''
Bellush, who turned 37 Wednesday, told the House Government Reform
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite 18 months of requests to return him to the United States
for trial, Del Toro remains jailed in a Mexico, where he has filed
numerous appeals to fight extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accuse him of being the triggerman in a
murder-for-hire conspiracy. Bellush's former husband, Allen
Blackthorne, a San Antonio businessman, has been a suspect in an
alleged conspiracy, but has never been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne's former golfing partner, Daniel Rocha, is serving a
life sentence in Florida for his role in the killing. Samuel
Gonzales, who is Rocha's friend and Del Toro's cousin, admitted
involvement in the killing and has agreed to cooperate with the
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1980 treaty, Mexico has the right to refuse extradition,
if the defendant faces capital punishment in the United States.
Mexico has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sarasota prosecutor Earl Moreland wanted Del Toro to
face trial in Florida, he agreed to waive the death penalty in
exchange for Del Toro's return. However, Moreland said at the
congressional hearing, Bellush was killed in ``such a cold,
calculated manner'' that it is ``undoubtedly a case where the death
penalty was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John L. Mica, R-Fla., who chaired the hearing of the
subcommittee on Criminal Justice, Drug Policy and Human Resources,
said the Del Toro case was not an isolated one. Mexico has refused
more than 275 extradition requests by the United States over the
past decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cases include murder and illegal narcotics
trafficking,'' Mica said. ``I am concerned that Mexico has become a
haven for murderers and drug lords.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Bellush as ``one of the most compelling witnesses
I've ever heard in my 10 years in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really am appalled that Mexico, as a neighbor and an ally,
can allow such injustice,'' he said, adding he is appalled that the
U.S. government continues to provide money to foreign governments
``when they continue to flout our laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows me away the way we just stand there and allow people
to trample all over our judicial system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who testified beside Bellush at the
hearing, said when U.S. citizens are accused of a crime in the
United States, Mexico should have nothing to do with the
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller slammed the Clinton administration for not renegotiating
the extradition treaty with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Timothy McVeigh had fled to Mexico?'' Miller asked,
referring to the man sentenced to death for his role in the bombing
of the Oklahoma City federal building in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sort of high-profile murder will it take before the
administration realizes that closing this escape route from justice
should be a priority?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved a resolution asking the president to
renegotiate the extradition treaty with Mexico. However, the
administration has resisted, saying that it would lead to many more
renegotiations of treaties around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee Warren, a deputy assistant U.S. attorney general, said
Del Toro's extradition case is now before an appellate judge in
Mexico, but that the system there ``is painfully slow and prone to
corruptive influences.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warren said that although the delays ``have been frustrating
... justice will prevail.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren also said officials at the Justice Department have
requested an investigation into who is financing Del Toro's legal
challenges.

DRUG SHOWS PROMISE IN FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Officials at SafeScience Inc., a Boston biotechnology
company, are reporting promising results in initial human tests of
a new type of cancer drug designed to block the disease and appears
to have few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known as GBC-590, was given to men with incurable
prostate cancer whose blood contained rising amounts of PSA, or
prostate-specific antigen, a substance associated with worsening
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After the drug was injected, PSA levels stopped rising in 14 of
22 patients and dropped ``modestly'' in four others, said Dr. Clark
Springgate, chief medical officer for SafeScience, in an interview
Wednesday. GBC-590 drug was given for up to four weeks, and
following withdrawal of the drug, the PSA levels began to rise
again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Phase I trial to test the safety of the drug was
carried out at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston under the
leadership of Dr. Christopher Logothetis, a renowned prostate
cancer specialist. He was unavailable Wednesday but was quoted in a
company statement as saying the drug was well-tolerated, and that
``we observed interesting qualitative changes'' in PSA levels,
including the fact that the levels increased after the drug was
stopped. ``We look forward to participating in the Phase II trial
for GBC-590,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently no effective treatment for prostate cancer
that has metastasized, or spread, beyond the prostate gland.
Springgate and senior vice president Richard Salter said that the
encouraging results have prompted a quick move ahead to larger
Phase II trials in patients with less-advanced prostate cancer in
which the efficacy of the drug would be tested.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is one of a new category of cancer drugs called
``lectin inhibitors'' because they interfere with cell-to-cell
signals transmitted by proteins called lectins and corresponding
lectin receptors. Springgate said that GBC-590 disrupts the ability
of metastatic cancer cells to recognize each other, which blocks
the further spread of the cells.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the drug might have to be given for long periods of
time to keep cancer in check, because it is not designed to kill
cancer cells. But that may be possible, said Springgate, because
the drugs caused ``no serious or even moderate adverse effects at
the doses that were tested.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Oh, a prostate cancer specialist at Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, said it was difficult to comment on the results
because they are not yet available as a scientific paper. He said
he would be ``cautiously optimistic'' about a drug like GBC-590
that shows some effects in Phase I trialis.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that it's not clear that a drug that stabilizes
PSA levels is necessarily halting the cancer _ particularly when
the patients were studied for only two months, as in this case.
``It may be affecting PSA levels independent of the cancer cells,''
said Oh.
</P>
<P>
   The SafeScience officials said that GBC-590 has also showed
promise in initial tests on other cancers. They said that it will
be tested at Beth Israel Deaconess in Phase I trials against
advanced pancreatic cancer, another type of cancer for which there
is currently no good treatment.

700 FROM ONE TOWN STILL MISSING, FAMILIES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ Hundreds of faces of the missing were
spread out Wednesday on a Formica table at the headquarters of the
Kosovo Liberation Army _ snapshots of teenagers with awkward smiles
and proud fathers holding children.
</P>
<P>
   They are among the 700 ethnic Albanian men family members and
human rights workers say are still unaccounted for after they were
held in makeshift prisons here in the basement of a winery and in
factory warehouses by Serb forces who picked them up in a sweep of
this ravaged town in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only hope that they are still alive somewhere, probably
in prison in Serbia,'' said Abdulla Guta, 34, who was eventually
released by the Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   While explaining that his two brothers and four uncles have
never been seen since, Guta broke down in tears, saying, ``We have
no idea where they are. They are in the hands of criminals, they
are in the hands of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Guta said he and some 1,200 other men, women and children were
picked up by Serb forces in a three-day sweep that began on May 9.
Serb forces known as the MUPs, or special police, went through the
streets and to the bus station rounding up families who had
mustered courage to try to escape for the hills that lead to the
border of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men were told that they would only be held briefly
to conduct parafin tests to establish if they had been in contact
with gunpowder, and so those who knew they were not fighters, such
as Guta and his family, obeyed the orders with great fear and some
hope that they would be reunited with their families in less than
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   They were taken in covered army trucks, he said, to the basement
of the Ereniku Winery on the industrial outskirts of this town.
There, they were beaten and denied food while the Serb soldiers
drank through the supplies of wine and, based on the discarded
syringes that littered the dark hallways, may have been shooting
heroin. He said he was beaten with the butt of a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Selected detainees, but not all, were given the parafin tests.
Women and children were taken to a large motor assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   After six days he was released along with about 500 others,
including what appears to be all of the women and children. But the
other 700 have never been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Guta was at the front of a demonstration along with
hundreds of families of the missing who marched through the center
of town holding pictures of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   The march circled through town and ended at the KLA headquarters
in a converted theater. The families handed over pictures of their
loved ones and KLA officials began compilings lists of all those
missing. The picture of just how many are still missing has only
emerged in the last few days as the towns ethnic Albanians have
finally been able to talk and compare stories.
</P>
<P>
   People were desperate for information and asking those who were
held and released if they had seen their brothers and sons inside
the detention centers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Miller, a human rights investigator for Amnesty
International, said there were certainly hundreds of detainees
still being held inside Serbia and that the Serbian Justice
Ministry has begun to hand over lists of those imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The detainees fall into many different categories, including
political prisoners, KLA soldiers who were apprehended, and
apparently civilians who were arbitrarily arrested and never
released.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said Serb forces have used the parafin tests before in
sweeps of ethnic Albanian men dating back to last fall, in the
mounting tension in Kosovo before the Serbs unleashed their full
campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that the parafin tests are notoriously inaccurate,
and cited an FBI report from the 1950s that establishes this. Even
if evidence of residue is found it can come from a host of other
sources, such as fertilizers and even kitchen matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of great concern to us,'' he said. ``The fate
of these people is unknown, and the prisoners of conscience and
especially the innocent civilians still held will be a priority in
our efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   But human rights workers' efforts may be complicated by the fact
that NATO negotiators who made the peace deal with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic failed to include a clause
guaranteeing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to
all prisons to ensure that Kosovo Albanians didn't disappear into
Serbian jails.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross is now in negotiations with officials in Belgrade
and hopes to get permission soon to help search for the missing.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Djakovica, a warren of stucco homes on cobbled
streets, was ravaged in the ethnic cleansing. Now there is block
after block of houses burned to the ground and left in rubble by
Serb forces and masked paramilitaries who went house to house in
perhaps the most horrific evidence of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman named Xhulana hid in her home with her husband and two
sons throughout the ethnic cleansing rampage which took place in
several waves of intensity. On May 10, thinking that perhaps things
had quieted down, her son, Labinot, 24, took the risk of walking
300 yards down a cobble-stone lane to check on his ailing and
elderly uncle.
</P>
<P>
   He never came home.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say they saw him get picked up by the Serb forces.
Wednesday a family friend, Avni Zhubi, 70, told Xhulana, who asked
that her last name not be used, that he had seen her son in the
basement of the winery. He was alive but had been badly beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Labinot was a medical student at Pristina University before the
war broke out, his mother says, and every time she sees his medical
texts piled on his desk she weeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only want to see him again,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nexhat Musa, a spokesman for the KLA, said based on information
they have been able to gather from those who were held and
released, the approximately 700 missing men were to be transferred
to Pec, a city on the northern border of Kosovo near Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Recent information is that they may have been taken to the
Leskovac prison in Serbia after Serb troops withdrew from Kosovo
last week.

BOSTON EDISON, COMMONWEALTH ELECTRIC MERGER EXPECTED TO BE OK'D 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Shareholders of the parent companies of Boston Edison
and Commonwealth Electric are expected to approve a $4.4 billion
merger Thursday, but consumer and business advocates fear it will
be a bad deal for 1.3 million eastern Massachusetts energy
customers.
</P>
<P>
   At separate meetings, owners of BEC Energy and Commonwealth
Energy System are expected to support combining the holding
companies into a new business called NStar. Federal approvals are
expected soon, and because it involves holding companies, the
combination is not subject to state approval.
</P>
<P>
   However, BEC and ComEnergy operating units still face a grueling
rate-setting proceeding before the state Department of
Telecommunications and Energy. The proceeding turns on how they
will recoup a $502 million merger premium being distributed to
shareholders and another $450 million for meshing the companies, a
bill they want to be largely paid by customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We oppose this merger unless there are substantial changes,''
said Judy Silvia, vice president for energy programs with the
5,200-member Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the state's
leading business lobby. ``To ask for close to $1 billion from
customers and not guarantee savings, that's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Edison and ComEnergy have offered to freeze their customers'
electric distribution rates for four years. They assert that over
40 years, customers will save more on their monthly bills than they
would pay shareholders for the merger premium.
</P>
<P>
   ComEnergy spokesman Peter A. Dimond said Wednesday the merger
will allow the combined companies to ``invest in the kinds of
technology needed to provide the highest levels of public service
for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics call the proposed four-year rate freeze a sham. Late
last month, Attorney General Thomas Reilly argued that ``no
assurances are present that harm will not be visited on customers .
. . The rate freeze deprives customers of rate decreases, to the
enrichment of shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have proposed charging customers $20.6 million a
year for 40 years for the acquisition premium plus interest, and
$13.5 million for 10 years for merger-related costs such as
integrating computer systems. Those figures compare to projected
net operating savings of $532 million during the first 10 years of
the merger, according to Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   And critics contend that while they want state promises they can
recoup costs from customers, the utilities are offering no
comparable guarantee they will pass on the expected savings.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sargent, energy program director for the Massachusetts
Public Interest Research Group, said he fears that based on what he
called their recent anticonsumer record, state utility regulators
will ``be happy to let them pass on the cost of the merger premium
and keep all the savings for shareholders. It's a `heads, the
utility wins; tails, the consumer loses' approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said they could not comment because the
matter is under review.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company's Boston Edison, ComElectric, ComGas, and
Cambridge Electric units would continue to exist as operating
companies, identified on trucks and bills as NStar subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Edison serves 633,000 customers in Boston and 39 other
communities, and through an unregulated joint venture with RCN
Communications has begun offering cable, Internet, and telephone
service locally.
</P>
<P>
   ComEnergy has 373,000 electric customers in areas including
Cambridge, Cape Cod, New Bedford, and Plymouth, and 239,000 ComGas
customers in 51 eastern Massachusetts communities.
</P>
<P>
   Through attrition and leaving vacancies unfilled, the companies
expect to trim about 300 of their current 3,900 jobs, or about 7
percent. Edison chairman Thomas J. May will be chairman and chief
executive of NStar, with ComEnergy chief Russell D. Wright taking
the president and chief operating officer positions and a seat on
the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   May has said he wants to grow the combined company to 2 million
customers by the end of next year, but recent New England utility
combinations lead some analysts to think the new NStar is more
likely to be a takeover candidate than acquirer.
</P>
<P>
   ComEnergy's executive offices will move to the Prudential
Center, freeing up 100,000 square feet of premium office space at
their current headquarters in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Merger terms call for Edison shareholders to get NStar stock on
a 1-for-1 basis. ComEnergy shareholders will get 1.05 NStar shares
for each 1 CES chare. Owners of both companies can choose to get
$44.10 a share in cash, up to $300 million total. The new stock is
intended to be distributed on a tax-free basis.
</P>
<P>
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, BEC stock closed
unchanged at 42 15/16, down nearly 10 percent from a 52-week high
of 44 15/16. ComEnergy was down 3/16 at 42 3/4, close to its
52-week high of 43 1/4.

 &HT;    MARINES KILL ONE, INJURE TWO AT KOSOVO CHECKPOINT AS ETHNIC
TENSIONS REMAIN
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-PRISONERS-0624.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Coming under fire, U.S. Marines killed one
gunmen and wounded two others in southern Kosovo Wednesday in the
latest incident illustrating the dangers facing NATO troops as they
try to keep the peace and construct some semblance of authority.
</P>
<P>
   No Marines were injured in the incident and an investigation was
underway late Wednesday to determine the identity and ethnicity of
the gunmen, according to Marine officials. There were earlier
reports that two assailants had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfight came as four foreign ministers from European
countries visited the war-shattered province and as NATO troops
were straining to bridle the ethnic tensions that have continued
between the majority ethnic Albanian population in Kosovo and the
minority Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was the 11th day since NATO troops entered to oversee
the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces and Serb paramilitary and police
who had been terrorizing Kosovar Albanians during the 78-day NATO
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 NATO troops are now in the province and they are
being joined by a steady flow of returning ethnic Albanian
refugees. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,
about 206,000 of the estimated 860,000 refugees who fled the
province have returned to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is now in formal control over the province
and U.N. spokesman Kevin Kennedy said Wednesday that committees
will soon be formed to recommend how to build the institutions
Kosovo is sorely lacking, from police to courts to healthcare
systems.
</P>
<P>
   But most observers agree that work will be nearly impossible if
tensions in the province are not eased. The foreign ministers of
Germany, France, Great Britain and Italy urged returning refugees
-- as did U.S. President Bill Clinton while visiting refugees in
Macedonia Tuesday -- not to seek revenge against Serb civilians
staying in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook toured a site of a mass
execution and graves of ethnic Albanians, stressing that Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic be brought to justice. Milosevic is
under indictment for war crimes perpetrated against ethnic
Albanians during the NATO air war by a tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Other ministers echoed Cook's call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace cannot be built on revenge, but it must be built on
justice,'' said German Foreign Minister Joshka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers were met in Pristina, the provincial
capital, by dozens of ethnic Albanians clapping and cheering
``NATO!''
</P>
<P>
   But, there was less harmony around the province as ethnic
tensions continued to surface and NATO troops were forced into
becoming increasingly aggressive in their work.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern city of Mitrovica, where French peacekeepers
have been trying to keep a lid on tensions between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, French Defense Minister Alain Richard defended the
actions of his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians there have complained that the French were
giving preferential treatment to the Serbs. French peacekeepers
looked on Tuesday as Serbs menaced some people wanting to cross a
bridge to a side of town with the main hospital, many ethnic
Albanian homes and almost the only open food shops.
</P>
<P>
   The French soldiers were simply trying to permit all Kosovo
residents ``to live in safety,'' Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in Mitrovica, NATO announced that Tuesday night a Serb
gunman broke into an ethnic Albanian home. The Albanian family fled
and, after the gunman opened fire on French troops, he was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   British troops in Pristina, just about 100 yards from the
meeting of the foreign ministers, searched an apartment belonging
to a Serb family and confiscated what one soldier called a ``small
armory'' of machine guns and shotguns. The apartment belongs to the
relatives of two Serb soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, their ethnic Albanian neighbors had
placed a note on the door telling the family they had 24 hours to
flee.
</P>
<P>
   But, the hottest spot of the day was in the farming village of
Zegra in southeastern Kosovo, where the Marines were manning a
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A BBC report said the Marines fired after a man left a social
club, fired his Soviet-made Kalishnikov rifle in the air and then
toward the Marines. Capt. Gabrielle Chapin, public affairs officer
for the Marines in Kosovo, said that one man was killed and then
civilians nearby showed the Marines where other wounded gunmen were
hiding.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines apparently convinced them to surrender and took
three into custody. Two of them were injured and flown to a Marine
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin said the area is populated by both Serbs and Albanians
and it was not clear who opened fire or who intervened to help. The
gunmen were not in uniform, which could indicate they were not
members of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, the only uniformed
military presence in Kosovo besides NATO and Russian peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Zegra is also where Marines had a standoff with about 100 armed
KLA members last week, which ended with the rebels being forcibly
disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The first and only NATO fatalities so far in Kosovo occurred
Monday when two British demolitions experts died trying to remove
unexploded NATO cluster bombs from a school yard.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the European Union said Wednesday it will spend
$500-$700 million over three years and hopes to raise an equal
amount at two donor conferences later this year and from the World
Bank to fund efforts to undermine Milosevic's rule, and help
Yugoslavia recover from bombing damage once he's out of power.
</P>
<P>
   EU Commissioner Hans van den Broek said the 15-nation EU will
subsidize free press and pro-democracy projects in Serbia, where
Milosevic has muzzled the media and made it a propaganda tool of
his government and in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which helped broker the peace accord, had wanted the
West to pay for all war damage to Serbia as well as its Kosovo
province. But the United States and NATO allies have refused give
any money to rebuild Yugoslavia while Milosevic is in power. Serbia
is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which also includes
Montenegro.

CMGI SHARES FALL AMID ALTAVISTA RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares in CMGI Inc. have fallen as much as 12 percent this week
on rumors the Andover, Mass. Internet-ventures company might buy
Compaq Computer Corp.'s AltaVista search service, a move some fear
might interrupt what has been CMGI's hot track record in the
on-line sector.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI shares fell to as low as 91 Wednesday in Nasdaq trading
before recovering to close at 98 15/16, down from 103 on Monday.
Some analysts attributed the declines to concerns a purchase of
AltaVista would move CMGI in an unfamiliar direction. The company
has traditionally made small investments in flourishing Internet
start-ups such as Lycos Inc. As an established Internet brand,
AltaVista would probably command a far higher price.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CMGI nor Compaq would comment on whether they are in
talks, adding to the uncertainty that seemed to spook the market,
said Forrester Research analyst Paul Hagen. ``I start wondering if
maybe it's a change of business for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has indicated in recent months it may make investments in
larger companies. But the stock decline is an ironic reminder of
how shareholders might regard a major financial commitment by CMGI
chief executive David Wetherell. In February he withdrew his
support for a proposed merger between Lycos Inc. and elements of
USA Networks after other Lycos investors expressed little patience
for the proposed long-term benefits of that arrangement and drove
down Lycos shares. (The proposal ultimately collapsed.)
</P>
<P>
   For AltaVista, however, analysts said a deal with CMGI might
provide a clean outcome. The San Fransisco-based search service has
seemed adrift since Compaq acquired it as part of its larger
purchase of Digital Equipment Corp. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Digital set up AltaVista to show off the speed of its Alpha
processors, but Compaq has given the devices a less-than-prominent
position in its strategy. Compaq also said in January it was
considering selling public shares in AltaVista.
</P>
<P>
   But Compaq has yet to clarify its intentions and now its
attention is devoted to finding a new chief executive to succeed
Eckhard Pfeiffer, who was dismissed in April amid disappointing
sales of Compaq's hardware products.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, AltaVista is falling behind competitors. The service
received 9.49 million individual visits in May, according to the
Media Metrix Inc. rating service in New York, compared with 31.8
million visits for Yahoo Inc. and 15.1 million visits for
Excite.com.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq doesn't disclose AltaVista's revenue, but analysts
believe the service and others owned by Compaq _ Zip2.com and the
Shopping.com Web site _ together have revenue of about $250
million.
</P>
<P>
   A standard selling price of 10 times that revenue would be $2.5
billion, a figure the Wall Street Journal Wednesday reported was
the midpoint of prices under discussion for the service, citing
sources it didn't name. On Tuesday, Internet columnist Dan Dorfman
also reported the companies were in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Some CMGI shareholders found the possibility of a purchase
intriguing. Alex Cheung of the Monument Internet fund in Bethesda,
Md., suggested a deal ``might not be a bad move for CMGI'' because
it could be packaged with services offered through Lycos, in which
CMGI holds roughly a 20 percent stake. But he called himself
``neutral'' on the prospects, noting it would be a major commitment
for CMGI, whose total market capitalization is about $9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But others said they would be surprised if Compaq executed such
a strategic deal now, rather than leave the decision to the new
chief executive it will eventually hire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a key strategic decision for the company and one I'd
prefer they allow the new person'' to make, said Phil Rueppel,
analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq shares fell 3/8 Wednesday to close at 23 7/16 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

JAPANESE DEFENSE CONTRACTING RIFE WITH CRONYISM, PROTECTIONISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHERYL WuDUNN    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Salesmen on the fourth floor of the Marubeni Corp.
building were hunched over their desks late one night earlier this
year, blearily working on a deal to sell foreign aircraft to Japan.
Suddenly, there was a bang, and the only trace was a perfect
bullet-like hole in a window.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly happened may never be known because police have
declined to investigate. But many people involved in the episode
believe that they were fired at.
</P>
<P>
   Drive-by shootings are unheard of in Japan, and so some think
the point was to send a crude message: don't peddle foreign
airplanes to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The episode underscores how protectionism and crony capitalism
still prevail even in Japanese markets _ like the $16 billion
defense industry _ that in theory have been partly opened to
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, whatever it was that pierced the window that
night _ some suggest soothingly that it may have been nothing more
than a pebble _ was probably unnecessary. Analysts say that
throughout Japan's military contracting industry, whatever the
theatrics of opening up the markets, the odds are heavily stacked
in favor of local companies
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very symbolic, representative case,'' said Kazuhisa
Ogawa, a leading military analyst in Tokyo. ``The Japanese defense
industry operates in an unfair environment, and the unfairness
operates in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Every country has its own version of a $1,000 jet-fighter coffee
maker or a $900 toilet seat. But in these hard economic times, a
couple of contracts can mean the life or death of the weapons
division of a Japanese company, so the stakes now are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, prices run especially high in Japan, and the
government is often saddled with costs for unusual practices.
Partly to keep jobs in the aircraft maintenance industry, for
instance, the government pays for workers to repeatedly disassemble
entire engines and clean the parts every few years during the life
of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   This can raise the cost of a weapons purchase by 40 percent, at
a time when the government's debt burden has skyrocketed and its
money matters are a mess.
</P>
<P>
   Marubeni is representing a Swiss company, Pilatus Aircraft Ltd.,
which exports around the world, in a bid to make 50 fighter-trainer
aircraft for the Japanese Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government opened the tender process for the
trainers to foreigners but in the end, it gave the $315 million
contract to Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd., a longtime
aircraft manufacturer that made kamikaze planes during World War II
under the name of Nakajima Aircraft. Then in December, Fuji was
banned from doing business with the government for one year after
Fuji got caught bribing an influential Parliament member in
exchange for securing a separate contract to make sea rescue
aircraft for Japan's military.
</P>
<P>
   Yojiro Nakajima, the Parliament member, happens to be a former
Defense Agency official, and he belongs to the family that founded
the Nakajima Aircraft company. He was arrested last year.
</P>
<P>
   That scandal, along with other incidents last year of
overcharging on defense contracts, provoked an effort to reform the
contracting process at the Defense Agency, but some politicians are
still dissatisfied and want to make the defense business more open
and competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Defense Agency is a department of the nation, and if this
public tender is not honest, then the country is lying to the
world,'' said Yukihisa Fujita, a politician in the Democratic Party
of Japan, who has raised the issue recently in Parliament. ``This
can be a very dangerous thing for the state of Japan _ for its
credibility and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Japan's Defense Agency has nullified the previous award and
is starting the bidding again. The process seems likely to drag on
until the end of the year, when Fuji's suspension ends. Thus
politicians and military experts say that the award will probably
go to Fuji.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese defense manufacturers are forbidden by law to export
weapons abroad, so in return, they have been given special
consideration in the domestic weapons business, and the government
has happily obliged.
</P>
<P>
   When it wanted new submarines, the government split the order,
which began last year, between two Japanese contractors who each
make one submarine a year. At the end of 17 years, as has been done
for decades, a new cycle of contracts will begin.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale is the same as the reason the government is
expected to choose Fuji: Tokyo wants to preserve some of its
military industry in case its allies abandon it and it must rely on
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the taxpayer's point of view, the lowest cost is the best
choice,'' said Kensuke Ebata, a prominent military analyst for
Jane's Defense Weekly. ``The question is are we willing to pay a
high price because we want to keep our own defense development
capability?''
</P>
<P>
   Fuji, which referred questions to the Defense Agency, notes that
in the case of the fighter-trainers, it offered a lower price than
Pilatus. But even this has stirred controversy, for a few years
earlier Fuji had made a precursor aircraft and sold it to the naval
forces for double the price.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some politicians are accusing Fuji of either overcharging
in the previous case (where there was no rival bidder) or
undercharging now. In military contracts, companies are not allowed
to charge less than their cost.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Agency is widely viewed as being a watchdog with
neither bark nor bite. One reason is that agency bureaucrats
typically retire in their mid-50's and then go to work for military
contractors, in a practice called amakudari.
</P>
<P>
   In a hierarchical society, it is awkward for defense agency
officials to ask tough questions of their former seniors who are
now in the private sector. And those still in the agency are also
cautious because they do not wish to offend their likely future
employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amakudari is for high-ranking officials but lower ranking Self
Defense Force members need to secure new jobs, too,'' said Kohki
Ishii, a Parliament member for the Democratic Party. ``They're
finding jobs by using taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Agency officials deny this and insist that they are
embarking on reform. Hideo Matsui, a director in the procurement
office of the Defense Agency, said that the agency hopes to ``shift
to a competitive environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just so happens,'' he said, ``that Japanese companies have
been the best at coming up with what we need.''

FREEZE PLACED ON ANY FUNDS IN SWITZERLAND HELD BY MILOSEVIC, 4
OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss authorities Wednesday froze any funds in
Switzerland belonging to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and
four high-ranking associates who were indicted along with him by
the international war crimes tribunal last month.
</P>
<P>
   The federal police office, in the Swiss capital of Bern, took
the action in response to the request of the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on May 28, a day after it
indicted Milosevic for atrocities allegedly committed by Serbian
forces in Kosovo. Along with arrest warrants, the tribunal issued
an order to member countries of the United Nations to freeze assets
belonging to Milosevic and the other men. However, since
Switzerland is not a member country of the United Nations, the
tribunal had to request Swiss assistance separately.
</P>
<P>
   Government authorities do not specifically know of any deposits
or assets lodged with Swiss financial institutions by any of the
five men, according to a spokesman, Folco Galli. U.S. and European
officials have indicated that Milosevic had hidden assets in
Greece, Switzerland, Russia, Cyprus and Lebanon. Cyprus said in May
that it had looked unsuccessfully for assets belonging to
Milosevic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in Bern, the Swiss authorities said: ``As
a provisional measure, the Federal Police Office today ordered that
the assets of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, and four
other people charged be frozen.''
</P>
<P>
   The order means that banks, lawyers and others handling funds in
Switzerland must not transfer or otherwise dispose of any money or
assets of the five men, and report ``without delay'' to federal
authorities the existence and details of any such holdings. Failure
to do so incurs criminal penalties or fines under Swiss law.
</P>
<P>
   However, Galli acknowledged that Swiss authorities could not
track movement of funds, but, instead, depended on the cooperation
of financial institutions to keep tabs on such money. In a sign of
Swiss determination to shed its image as a haven for ill-gotten
wealth, the decision to move against Milosevic was the first time
that Switzerland has blocked the assets of an acting head of state,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Switzerland's formidable bank secrecy has long made it
a refuge for money of the rich and powerful, officials have
increasingly tightened the rules in the light of unfavorable
publicity over deposits of corrupt rulers. A decade of legal
wrangling over some $500 million secreted in Switzerland by the
former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos produced requirements
that banks ascertain ownership of funds before accepting them for
deposit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, authorities have tracked funds attributed to
former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her husband to
deposed Zaire ruler Mobutu Sese Seko and to Raul Salinas, brother
of former Mexican president Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Milosevic, the four men named in Wednesday's
order were Serbian President Milan Milutinovic; Yugoslav Deputy
Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic; Serbian Internal Affairs Minister
Vlajko Stojiljkovic; and Dragoljub Ojdanic, chief of the Yugoslav
armed forces. Swiss authorities in May issued arrest warrants for
the five at the request of the international tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   In April, France asked for Switzerland's help in tracking down
assets of a Yugoslav banker, Miodrag Zeceyic, who is reported to
have financial ties to Milosevic. Zurich authorities furnished bank
documents to Paris officials, and Zeceyic's accounts were blocked
in Zurich, according to the Swiss federal police. However, no
details about the amounts involved were made public.

COURIER BACK IN HIS ELEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ As it turned out the sentence was for six years. Six
years in exile from a place he cherished.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been time off for good behavior, except, as Jim
Courier is saying, ``When you're a first-round loser around here
for three straight years they don't invite you into the big show. I
haven't been very good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, when the 28-year-old exile returned to ``the
show,'' as he calls it, that verdant isle where every tennis player
in the world longs to hang out _ Wimbledon's Centre Court _ Jim
Courier was very good. He had to be because one of his successors
as a French Open champion, No. 10 ranked Carlos Moya, was playing
as though he had no idea that Spaniards are supposed to regard
grass as poison ivy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I did everything right,'' sighs the rugged, handsome
young Mallorcan whose shoulders have probably popped a few door
frames. ``I serve and volley good. I run down balls. But Jim beat
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not by much. ``Charlie did do everything right,'' applauds
Courier. ``I'm amazed at how fast this clay-court guy has picked up
the grass game. He has the idea, and doesn't want to be typecast as
a one-surface player. I kept thinking eventually he'd break down.
But no. So at the end I had to go into an extra gear _ I'm glad I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2-2 in the stretch-run fifth set, Courier kicked himself in
as though he had spurs on his sneakers. He could hide his fiery
hair beneath a white cap, but not his flaming shotmaking.
Zip-flap-whang-crunch-flutter-smack-whir . . .
</P>
<P>
   It was two-legged overdrive, and his No. 61 ranking looked
suspicious, fraudulent, like the computer had print-out thrombosis.
This was the old No. 1 stuff. Putting together four games as
forcefully and finely tuned as you'll see _ seizing 16 of the last
19 points _ Courier won driving, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-1), 3-6, 6-2, and
was in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Not much of an elevation, a pimple to such as Pete Sampras, but
Himalayan to Courier, the way he'd been groping around here since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   That's the last time the local nabobs asked him into Centre, and
he was very good then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great occasion, the final, and I had a good shot,''
Courier remembers, with a sniffle. Not a sentimental choking up,
but ``a cold, that's all. I've got a cold. Maybe I should keep it,
the way I played today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tight '93 final (7-6, 7-6, 3-6, 6-3), the first of
Sampras's five championships. And if Pete hadn't rescued a critical
set point in the second with a desperate swan dive volley, Courier
might have departed as champion, adding Wimbledon to his two French
and two Australian crowns that nevertheless assure him a future
niche in the Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of those scarce birds who've flitted in all four major
finals, having lost the 1991 US Open to Stefan Edberg. And, like
Andre Agassi, he is picking up the pieces of a brilliant career
that seemed smithereened, and pasting them together again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man Courier has inspired all of us,'' says Agassi. Andre
happened to be occupying a front-row box as Jim crashed a monster
forehand return to conclude the victory with a knockdown, leaving a
lunging Moya sprawled on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Courier smiles at the memory. ``Yeah, I knew Andre was there,
cheering for me. I love it. He's done some inspiring, too, with
that great French Open performance. I'm ecstatic for him. You know,
this has been a year of the American guys coming together. We're
starting to feed off each other. It started up the road in
Birmingham with me and Todd (Martin.)''
</P>
<P>
   That was their unlikely April Davis Cup triumph, 3-2, over
Britain in the persons of Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Pete (Sampras) is back on the team for Boston. That's what
he and US tennis needs,'' Courier says. ``It's the right message.
And I haven't given up on Andre. The door's open for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all grown up,'' says Courier of the finest
other-than-Australian male tennis generation, the Americans of the
'90s: Agassi, Courier, Michael Chang, Martin, Sampras, MaliVai
Washington, accounting for 20 major singles titles. ``We've gotten
over our past jealousies and envy. We're not finished yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier, obviously the leader, has grown the most even though
his ranking has plummeted from No. 1 to the deceptive 61. ``I think
I became Jim Courier again last fall when my longtime physical
problems were over, my right biceps fully healed.'' He'll never be
quite the guy who won those majors in 1991-92, terrorizing foes
with his backside boogie, a quick shuffle to the left to deliver a
paralyzing inside-out forehand.
</P>
<P>
   But in the five-set Davis Cup victories over Henman and
Rusedski, where heart and cool mattered most, he was the man of
presence and the winning touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting ready for my Boston summer,'' he laughs,
knowing the reporter is from that neighborhood. ``Davis Cup against
the Aussies, and the US Pro in August.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis Cup has been Jim's Grand Slam,'' says Agassi. ``It means
the most to him. It means a lot to me, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi said he would never play again when the US Tennis
Association obtusely, rudely fired his friend, Dr. George Fareed,
the team physician of many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was poorly handled and could be rectified,'' says Courier.
Agassi says, ``I would reconsider playing if . . .''
</P>
<P>
   If USTA president Julia Levering did the right thing by
apologizing publicly and returning Fareed to the team staff?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that would have to happen,'' Agassi says.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for Courier: Sjeng Schalken, the Dutchman who won the US
Pro two years ago and will return this summer. ``With a little
luck,'' Courier smiles, ``I could get a rematch with Henman.''
</P>
<P>
   That would earn the exile another visit to ``the show.'' ``I'd
like that,'' Courier says. ``It was exciting to be back. I did
everything right except the bow'' _ toward the Royal Box, on
entering. ``I did a lousy bow.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can find a bowing coach.

GRETZKY, AS EXPECTED, TAKES FAST SKATE INTO HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official: Wayne Gretzky is taking the express lane into the
Hockey Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The voting took place early Wednesday afternoon, and the result
was announced not long afterward in Gretzky's native city _ Toronto
_ that the selection committee unanimously voted to make the Great
One the 10th player to bypass the three-year waiting period for
induction.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent player prior to Gretzky to have the waiting
period waived was center Mario Lemieux, who retired from the
Pittsburgh Penguins after the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, 38, was the only player chosen for induction. The two
others selected were former referee Andy van Hellemond and Scotty
Morrison in the builders category.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when it became clear the New York Rangers would end
their season without making the playoffs, Gretzky revealed what had
been speculated for weeks _ that he would retire after 20
remarkable seasons. He holds 61 records, many of which are never
expected to be equaled, and left pro hockey as its career scoring
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gretzky's retirement, the Hall of Fame's selection
committee, of which Bruins president/general manager Harry Sinden
is a member, unanimously voted to waive the waiting period for the
NHL's most prolific scorer. That decision was later supported by
the Hall's board of directors, paving the way for Gretzky to be
inducted this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky tallied 894 goals and 1,963 assists in 1,487
regular-season games. He played on four Stanley Cup teams while a
member of the Edmonton Oilers, and in 208 career playoff games
registered 122 goals and 260 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his prolific production, Gretzky was a dynamic
and classy ambassador off the ice. He is credited with the rise of
hockey's popularity in the Sunbelt, which began when Gretzky left
Edmonton and was traded to the Los Angeles Kings on Aug. 9, 1988.
Since then, teams have sprouted up in such warm-weather locales as
Anaheim, San Jose, Tampa, and South Florida, and Minnesota moved
its franchise to the toastier climes of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he knew the day was coming, Gretzky was very
gracious in showing his appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty special day for all of us,'' he said. ``As
Scotty said, we're all overwhelmed.''

AIR FORCE EASES MUST-STAY ORDER FOR DEPARTING PERSONNEL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The Air Force said Wednesday it had partially
lifted orders that had prevented thousands of officers and
enlistees from retiring or leaving the service during the Yugoslav
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Easing the so-called stop-loss order, a rarely used provision
that kept key personnel in uniform past their separation and
retirement dates, will allow them to leave the Air Force as
previously planned.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force spokeswoman T'Jae Gibson said a small percentage of
European-based personnel supporting Operation Allied Force, the
recently ended air war against Yugoslavia, will remain affected by
stop-loss for now. Almost 18,000 Air Force personnel remain
deployed in Kosovo support roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the end of hostilities, withdrawal of Yugoslav troops
from Kosovo and the redeployment of forces home, it is appropriate
to begin releasing our people from stop-loss,'' said Col. Lynn
Pratt, chief of the Air Force's military personnel policy division.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to end stop-loss, which was last ordered in 1990 as
the Persian Gulf War loomed, had been in the works. Defense
Secretary William Cohen this week said an end of stop-loss order
was expected as U.S. forces return to their home bases.
</P>
<P>
   Two airmen at Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio, who were
among the 6,000 personnel previously cleared to leave the service
before being ordered to stay, agreed the stop-loss policy wasn't a
fix for an Air Force ravaged by a loss of pilots and others in
critical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody kind of believes it is a short-term solution
to a lot of long-term problems that have existed for many years
prior to this action,'' said Lt. Col. Gary Pickett, an instructor
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Band-Aid,'' said Sgt. Vibol Ros, a computer network
administrator at Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Stop-loss only can be imposed in time of war, national emergency
or when reservists are ordered to duty, as they were when President
Clinton mobilized 33,102 men and women in April during the height
of the NATO-led air campaign against Yugoslavia.

OZAWA SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH VIENNA STATE OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN LARSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Seiji Ozawa made it official Wednesday at a Vienna
press conference that he's stepping down from the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in the fall of 2002 to become music director of the
Vienna State Opera, the classical music world reacted to the news
and began speculating on Ozawa's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, 63, who flew to Vienna from Germany for the announcement,
said, ``I think I will enjoy the last directorship of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the (Vienna) opera house has a wonderful orchestra, a
wonderful chorus and very good music staff and very good singers,
... and that is a very happy thing for a conductor.'' He fills a
position that has been vacant since 1991 when the only previous
music director of the opera, Claudio Abbado, retired. Ozawa's
contract is for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The BSO said it will form a committee this summer to begin a
search
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's replacement; since several other major orchestras are
also seeking music directors (including the New York Philharmonic
and the Philadelphia Orchestra) competition will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   Names of possible Ozawa successors in the rumor-mill initially
included the 44-year-old Brittsh conductor Sir Simon Rattle, but
Wednesday he accepted the podium of the Berlin Philharmonic. Others
who were the focus of speculation include James Levine of the
Metropolitan Opera, Christoph Eschenbach, a frequent guest with the
BSO, and the young American conductor Robert Spano. Meanwhile,
Ozawa's colleagues and fans are recovering from the shock and
preparing to feel bereft; while others are feeling -- well, not so
bereft:
</P>
<P>
   --John Williams, Boston Pops Conductor Emeritus: ``It's a great
loss to have Seiji leave, particularly at a time when his genius is
flourishing. The good news is we'll have him for another three
years. I know the BSO so intimately, I've conducted it for 20
years; Seiji has revitalized it. His stewardship has had
outstanding results; the new young players are superb.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ellen Highstein, newly appointed director of the Tanglewood
Music Center: ``It's not as if I have to start crying right now, I
have four more years with him at TMC. Seiji is a remarkable
educator and thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   --Richard Ortner (who resigned as director of the Tanglewood
Music Center last year, and who is now president of Boston
Conservatory of Music): ``It had to come, it's the natural course
of things. Ozawa's stepping down presents some truly exciting
opportunities for the BSO. The conductors from whom the orchestra
may choose a replacement are very interesting.'' He declined to
name names.
</P>
<P>
   --Joseph Hearne, BSO bass player: ``I'm a big fan of Seiji's.
``I'll miss him but I get the feeling he'll be often in Boston.
There is no apparent successor, but when Fiedler died they said
they'd never replace him. Then John Williams came. I'm hopeful
there'll be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   -- LLoyd Schwartz, Boston Phoenix music critic: ``The saddest
thing about Seiji leaving is that he never fulfilled the promise I
had hoped for when he first came. He was a burst of fresh air, and
then kind of got stale awfully quickly. I wish him well. My fantasy
is that (Pierre) Boulez would replace him. I'd be happy to see a
young conductor like Bob Spano take over and grow into the
orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   --Leon Kirchner, composer: ``Nowadays conductors become leaders
before they have really matured. When they are leaders the
give-and-take and the critical relationships stop, and their
development stops and they don't grow. I think so highly of Seiji.
He has a great memory and intellect and strength of mind. He thinks
with his whole body. He was enormously gifted when I first met him
at Tanglewood and he won the prize. I feel he never developed his
full potential. If it were possible to get Levine - he's so
extroardinary in the classical and romantic repertoire. David
Zinman, or Asa-Pekka Salonen are good with new music.''
</P>
<P>
   --Peter Gelb, president of Sony Classics, former assistant
manager of the Boston Symphony: ``The Vienna State Opera, along
with the Met and La Scala, are the most important opera companies
in the world; it makes sense for him to go there. To lose Seiji to
Vienna is an indication of how successful an orchestra the BSO is.
But he will not be an easy act to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jerome Rosen, violinist who played under Ozawa in the BSO:
``I'm so happy for the younger players in the orchestra, because
they will have the chance to look at something different.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gunther Schuller, conductor, author, composer: ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Spano, conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra
who had just received the news of the maestro's departure: ``uh, no
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   --Harry Ellis Dickson, conductor and former BSO player: It would
be nice if we had an American conductor for a change. No matter who
comes, the BSO will continue to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   --Harry Shapiro, retired BSO hornist, now manager of the TMC
Orchestra: ``I was sad to hear it. Seiji has been a terrific friend
to me. On the other hand he loves opera, he talks about it all the
time. He wanted to bring opera to Tanglewood, but, you know, budget
problems and all. You know, they say Seiji doesn't show the
emotion, but he has his own way of showing emotion, that's right
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keith Lockhart, conductor of Boston Pops: ``People are are
lining up asking me is it a good thing, a bad thing, is it tragic?
I tell them, this transition has gains as well as losses. It's
certainly good for Seiji. Any other step in the music world would
be a lateral step for him. As far as the BSO is concerned, there
are always elements in turning the soil over and starting over
again that are good for an organization. But you lose this
relationship it took a quarter of a century to build. But I know
he'll continue to be a resource to the orchestra for years,
especially at Tanglewood. So we'll have our cake and eat it, too.''

COMMENTARY: CRIMINAL JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush put his vaunted compassion on hold Sunday night
and vetoed a bill that would have modestly improved the abysmal
quality of legal representation available to indigent defendants in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has only been governor for four and a half years, so
perhaps he hasn't noticed that the criminal justice system in Texas
is a joke. If more Americans were aware of what is going on there,
Texas would be a laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Ellis knows. He's the State senator from Houston who
sponsored the bill, which was so mild it unanimously passed both
the Republican-controlled Senate and the Democratic-controlled
House. There was nothing to legitimately object to. The bill would
have required, for example, that indigent defendants be assigned a
lawyer within 20 days after an arrest. In most jurisdictions in the
U.S., a lawyer is assigned within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ellis: ``I don't think the governor's folks put a lot of
time into looking at Texas and comparing it to the rest of the
nation, because when you do, it's pretty embarrassing. If we're
going to lead the nation in incarcerations and executions, then we
should at least make sure the defendants get effective legal
representation.''
</P>
<P>
   How clownish is the justice system in Texas? Listen to Stephen
Bright, the director of the Southern Center for Human Rights, an
Atlanta-based organization that has provided extensive help to
defendants in capital cases:
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has upheld
death sentences in at least three cases in which the defense
lawyers slept during trial. The trial judge in one case reasoned
that while the Constitution requires that a defendant be
represented by a lawyer, it `doesn't say the lawyer has to be
awake.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for indigent defendants in Texas to remain in
jail for months before they ever see a lawyer. Some see their
lawyers for the first time on the day their trials begin, which
makes it kind of difficult to mount a defense.
</P>
<P>
   Expert witnesses? Investigators? Jerome Wesevich, a lawyer who
worked for several years with indigent defendants in Texas, noted
in a paper he prepared in January that ``some counties never spend
a dime'' on experts or investigators for poor defendants.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Others, including Potter and Montgomery, impose an
arbitrary $500 limit on all expenses in non-capital felony cases.
In some counties, when defense counsel seek to develop psychiatric
evidence, courts require them to rely on the prosecution's
psychiatric expert, and many do so without objection.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, who asked that his identity not be disclosed,
complained to authorities in April that all defendants referred to
his office had spent at least a month in jail before being assigned
a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My most recent client,'' he said, ``was in jail for 79 days
before I was appointed to represent him. He is accused of four
counts of theft by check for amounts under $500.''
</P>
<P>
   And if he's found innocent after spending a few months in jail?
Well, too bad.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of justice dispensed in Texas is routinely poor,
whether the alleged offense is a bounced check or murder. This is
one of the reasons Texas is so efficient at marching convicts into
its execution chamber. There is not much concern over whether the
accused is really guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bright: ``At least four people _ Randall Dale Adams,
Clarence Earl Bradley, Ricardo Aldape Guerra and Frederico
Martinez-Macia _ were released from death row in Texas after
journalists or volunteer lawyers conducted exhaustive
investigations which established their innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago I did a series of columns on a 38-year-old Texas
convict named David Wayne Spence who was executed despite the fact
that he almost certainly was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is on a merry ride that he hopes will end at the
White House. Poor people accused of crimes in Texas are not part of
that quest. They are no help to him. And if you talk to the real
movers and shakers in Texas about justice for the poor, you are
most likely to be met with the insider's knowing chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Which is only appropriate. Because justice in Texas is a joke.  &QL;

TEXAS LOTTERY OFFICIALS HOPE NEW SCRATCH-OFF GAMES BOOST LAGGING
SALES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Armed with a new state law, Texas Lottery
officials Wednesday announced new scratch-off games that will
improve players' chances of winning and, they hope, boost lagging
ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also is negotiating for possible participation later this
year in a multistate, on-line game that would offer a mega-jackpot,
lottery Executive Director Linda Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said she was optimistic the lottery will see an increase
in revenue, with Gov. George W. Bush's signature of a new law that
eases a two-year-old cap on total prize payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery sales dropped by more than 17 percent in fiscal 1998,
the first decline suffered by the game since its inception in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials put much of the blame on a cap imposed by the
Legislature in 1997 that limited prize payouts to 52 percent of
gross lottery revenue. Before then, prizes had averaged about 60
percent for scratch-off games.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 844 by Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, which was signed
by Bush over the weekend, allows as much as 57 percent of lottery
revenues to be spent on prizes. Prize payouts for some scratch-off
games will actually be higher _ as much as 65 percent _ offset by
payouts for on-line Lotto jackpots that will remain at 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have an opportunity now to put up or shut up,''
Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that ``Bingo,'' a scratch-off game with a 65 percent
prize payout, was introduced last week. Eight other scratch-off
games with similar, higher payouts will be launched between now and
the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this means is that our players will win more in prizes,
and they'll win more often, like they did prior to the reduction in
the payout.'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to restore payout levels to where we were
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lottery Commission doesn't plan to change the
payout for on-line Lotto jackpots, Cloud said officials are
considering increasing prizes for lower-level winners _ those
players who match three, four or five of the six Lotto numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud said Texas Lottery officials also were negotiating to join
a multistate, on-line game called ``The Game of the Century,''
which would run from October through December.
</P>
<P>
   If details are worked out, it would be Texas' first
participation in such a multistate offering. The final jackpot for
such a game could easily surpass the highest yet recorded in Texas
Lotto _ $75 million, which was shared by five winning tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not a done deal yet,'' Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have other lotteries participating with each other,
you have a lot of meeting of the minds and state regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The lottery director said the cap on prize payouts wasn't the
only reason lottery sales dropped from more than $3.7 billion in
fiscal 1997 to less that $3.1 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She said cuts in lottery advertising, new casinos on Texas
Indian reservations and in nearby states and unfavorable publicity
from an administrative scandal that rocked the Lottery Commission
in 1996 and 1997 also could share the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a combination of factors,'' she said. ``I
think we've overcome most of the other factors, and now the prize
payout will be a telling story here, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the drop in revenue, the lottery still contributed $1
billion to the state budget last year, Cloud added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very profitable game for Texas and will continue to
be,'' she said.

DRUG SHOWS PROMISE IN FIGHT AGAINST PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD SALTUS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Officials at SafeScience Inc., a Boston biotechnology
company, are reporting promising results in initial human tests of
a new type of cancer drug designed to block the disease and appears
to have few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known as GBC-590, was given to men with incurable
prostate cancer whose blood contained rising amounts of PSA, or
prostate-specific antigen, a substance associated with worsening
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After the drug was injected, PSA levels stopped rising in 14 of
22 patients and dropped ``modestly'' in four others, said Dr. Clark
Springgate, chief medical officer for SafeScience, in an interview
Wednesday. GBC-590 drug was given for up to four weeks, and
following withdrawal of the drug, the PSA levels began to rise
again, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Phase I trial to test the safety of the drug was
carried out at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston under the
leadership of Dr. Christopher Logothetis, a renowned prostate
cancer specialist. He was unavailable Wednesday but was quoted in a
company statement as saying the drug was well-tolerated, and that
``we observed interesting qualitative changes'' in PSA levels,
including the fact that the levels increased after the drug was
stopped. ``We look forward to participating in the Phase II trial
for GBC-590,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently no effective treatment for prostate cancer
that has metastasized, or spread, beyond the prostate gland.
Springgate and senior vice president Richard Salter said that the
encouraging results have prompted a quick move ahead to larger
Phase II trials in patients with less-advanced prostate cancer in
which the efficacy of the drug would be tested.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is one of a new category of cancer drugs called
``lectin inhibitors'' because they interfere with cell-to-cell
signals transmitted by proteins called lectins and corresponding
lectin receptors. Springgate said that GBC-590 disrupts the ability
of metastatic cancer cells to recognize each other, which blocks
the further spread of the cells.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the drug might have to be given for long periods of
time to keep cancer in check, because it is not designed to kill
cancer cells. But that may be possible, said Springgate, because
the drugs caused ``no serious or even moderate adverse effects at
the doses that were tested.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Oh, a prostate cancer specialist at Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, said it was difficult to comment on the results
because they are not yet available as a scientific paper. He said
he would be ``cautiously optimistic'' about a drug like GBC-590
that shows some effects in Phase I trialis.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that it's not clear that a drug that stabilizes
PSA levels is necessarily halting the cancer _ particularly when
the patients were studied for only two months, as in this case.
``It may be affecting PSA levels independent of the cancer cells,''
said Oh.
</P>
<P>
   The SafeScience officials said that GBC-590 has also showed
promise in initial tests on other cancers. They said that it will
be tested at Beth Israel Deaconess in Phase I trials against
advanced pancreatic cancer, another type of cancer for which there
is currently no good treatment.

OZAWA SIGNS AGREEMENT WITH VIENNA STATE OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN LARSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As Seiji Ozawa made it official Wednesday at a Vienna
press conference that he's stepping down from the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in the fall of 2002 to become music director of the
Vienna State Opera, the classical music world reacted to the news
and began speculating on Ozawa's successor.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, 63, who flew to Vienna from Germany for the announcement,
said, ``I think I will enjoy the last directorship of my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the (Vienna) opera house has a wonderful orchestra, a
wonderful chorus and very good music staff and very good singers,
... and that is a very happy thing for a conductor.'' He fills a
position that has been vacant since 1991 when the only previous
music director of the opera, Claudio Abbado, retired. Ozawa's
contract is for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The BSO said it will form a committee this summer to begin a
search
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's replacement; since several other major orchestras are
also seeking music directors (including the New York Philharmonic
and the Philadelphia Orchestra) competition will be intense.
</P>
<P>
   Names of possible Ozawa successors in the rumor-mill initially
included the 44-year-old Brittsh conductor Sir Simon Rattle, but
Wednesday he accepted the podium of the Berlin Philharmonic. Others
who were the focus of speculation include James Levine of the
Metropolitan Opera, Christoph Eschenbach, a frequent guest with the
BSO, and the young American conductor Robert Spano. Meanwhile,
Ozawa's colleagues and fans are recovering from the shock and
preparing to feel bereft; while others are feeling -- well, not so
bereft:
</P>
<P>
   --John Williams, Boston Pops Conductor Emeritus: ``It's a great
loss to have Seiji leave, particularly at a time when his genius is
flourishing. The good news is we'll have him for another three
years. I know the BSO so intimately, I've conducted it for 20
years; Seiji has revitalized it. His stewardship has had
outstanding results; the new young players are superb.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ellen Highstein, newly appointed director of the Tanglewood
Music Center: ``It's not as if I have to start crying right now, I
have four more years with him at TMC. Seiji is a remarkable
educator and thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   --Richard Ortner (who resigned as director of the Tanglewood
Music Center last year, and who is now president of Boston
Conservatory of Music): ``It had to come, it's the natural course
of things. Ozawa's stepping down presents some truly exciting
opportunities for the BSO. The conductors from whom the orchestra
may choose a replacement are very interesting.'' He declined to
name names.
</P>
<P>
   --Joseph Hearne, BSO bass player: ``I'm a big fan of Seiji's.
``I'll miss him but I get the feeling he'll be often in Boston.
There is no apparent successor, but when Fiedler died they said
they'd never replace him. Then John Williams came. I'm hopeful
there'll be somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   -- LLoyd Schwartz, Boston Phoenix music critic: ``The saddest
thing about Seiji leaving is that he never fulfilled the promise I
had hoped for when he first came. He was a burst of fresh air, and
then kind of got stale awfully quickly. I wish him well. My fantasy
is that (Pierre) Boulez would replace him. I'd be happy to see a
young conductor like Bob Spano take over and grow into the
orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   --Leon Kirchner, composer: ``Nowadays conductors become leaders
before they have really matured. When they are leaders the
give-and-take and the critical relationships stop, and their
development stops and they don't grow. I think so highly of Seiji.
He has a great memory and intellect and strength of mind. He thinks
with his whole body. He was enormously gifted when I first met him
at Tanglewood and he won the prize. I feel he never developed his
full potential. If it were possible to get Levine - he's so
extroardinary in the classical and romantic repertoire. David
Zinman, or Asa-Pekka Salonen are good with new music.''
</P>
<P>
   --Peter Gelb, president of Sony Classics, former assistant
manager of the Boston Symphony: ``The Vienna State Opera, along
with the Met and La Scala, are the most important opera companies
in the world; it makes sense for him to go there. To lose Seiji to
Vienna is an indication of how successful an orchestra the BSO is.
But he will not be an easy act to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   --Jerome Rosen, violinist who played under Ozawa in the BSO:
``I'm so happy for the younger players in the orchestra, because
they will have the chance to look at something different.''
</P>
<P>
   --Gunther Schuller, conductor, author, composer: ``no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Spano, conductor of the Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra
who had just received the news of the maestro's departure: ``uh, no
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   --Harry Ellis Dickson, conductor and former BSO player: It would
be nice if we had an American conductor for a change. No matter who
comes, the BSO will continue to be great.''
</P>
<P>
   --Harry Shapiro, retired BSO hornist, now manager of the TMC
Orchestra: ``I was sad to hear it. Seiji has been a terrific friend
to me. On the other hand he loves opera, he talks about it all the
time. He wanted to bring opera to Tanglewood, but, you know, budget
problems and all. You know, they say Seiji doesn't show the
emotion, but he has his own way of showing emotion, that's right
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   --Keith Lockhart, conductor of Boston Pops: ``People are are
lining up asking me is it a good thing, a bad thing, is it tragic?
I tell them, this transition has gains as well as losses. It's
certainly good for Seiji. Any other step in the music world would
be a lateral step for him. As far as the BSO is concerned, there
are always elements in turning the soil over and starting over
again that are good for an organization. But you lose this
relationship it took a quarter of a century to build. But I know
he'll continue to be a resource to the orchestra for years,
especially at Tanglewood. So we'll have our cake and eat it, too.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thrusting the doctrine of state sovereignty well
beyond existing boundaries, the Supreme Court on Wednesday placed
sharp new curbs on the ability of Congress to make federal law
binding on the states.
</P>
<P>
   In three cases, all decided by identical 5-4 votes, the court
made states immune from suits by state employees for violations of
federal labor law; by patent owners for infringement of their
patents by state universities and agencies; and by people bringing
unfair competition suits over states' activities in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the labor case, in particular, the court had already ruled
that a state's sovereign immunity meant that it could not be sued
in federal court. The court's decision Wednesday closed the only
other avenue for employees to try to force a state to comply with
federal law: bringing a lawsuit in state court. The ruling, then,
leaves enforcement to individual federal agencies, like the Labor
Department, but government lawyers argued that the department does
not have the resources to sue every time there is a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   While each decision will have similar substantial impact, the
whole of the court's actions Wednesday, the final day of the
1998-99 term, was greater than the sum of its parts. It was the
most powerful indication yet of a narrow majority's determination
to reconfigure the balance between state and federal authority in
favor of the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has vast power but not all power,'' Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy declared in one of the decisions, a case from Maine
holding that state employees cannot bring suits for violations of
federal labor law. ``When Congress legislates in matters affecting
the states,'' Kennedy continued, ``it may not treat these sovereign
entities as meer prefectures or corporations. Congress must accord
states the esteem due to them as joint participants in a federal
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The three decisions were announced from the bench in a scene of
extraordinary drama. As the author of each majority opinion _
Kennedy, Justice Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist _ summarized his reasoning and conclusion, a different
one of the four dissenters spoke in rebuttal. The rhetorical
volleys, with Justices David H. Souter, Stephen G. Breyer and John
Paul Stevens speaking in dissent, consumed some 45 minutes and held
the audience of tourists and government lawyers spellbound.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, using pungent language that did not appear in written
dissent, accused the majority of constructing a doctrine of
sovereign immunity ``much like a mindless dragon that
indiscriminately chews gaping holes in federal statutes.'' He said
the court was returning to ``brief period of confusion and crisis
when our new nation was governed by the Articles of
Confederation.''
</P>
<P>
   The other justices in the five-member majority were Sandra Day
O'Connor and Clarence Thomas. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the
fourth dissenter.
</P>
<P>
   When the court's work was over, two federal laws had been
declared unconstitutional, one 35-year-old precedent was explicitly
overturned and one 15-year-old precedent was effectively dead.
</P>
<P>
   And it was also strikingly apparent that the fault line that
runs through the current court as an all but unbridgable gulf has
to do not with the higher-profile issues of race, religion,
abortion or due process, but federalism. It was clear both from the
courtroom scene and from the 185 pages of often impassioned prose
the court produced in the three cases that for these justices, the
question of the proper allocation of authority within the American
system is not abstract or theoretical but urgent and fundamental,
with the two sides holding irreconcilable visions of what the
Constitution's framers had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With more than a dozen other federalism cases pending, the court
has already accepted two for decision in its next term, and is
likely to accept several others. One in particular may be affected
by the decisions Wednesday, a case from Florida that raises the
question of whether state employees may sue a state for violating
the federal law against age discrimination (Kimel vs. Florida Board
of Regents, No. 98-791, to be argued in October.) Other cases
awaiting the court's action involve suits against states for
violations of the Equal Pay Act and the Americans With Disabilities
Act.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the debate was the meaning of the 11th
Amendment, which stripped the federal courts of authority to hear
suits against one state by a citizen of another. The court has long
interpreted the amendment as also barring suits by people against
their own state. The court had also viewed Congress as having the
power to abrogate the states' immunity from particular types of
lawsuits, if it did so explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in Seminole Tribe vs. Florida, the court
overturned one of its precedents by the same 5-to-4 vote as in the
decisions Wednesday. It ruled that Congress did not have the power
to force states to defend themselves in federal court under laws
enacted under the authority of Article I of the Constitution,
including laws that regulate interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   One such law was the Fair Labor Standards Act, a basic federal
labor law that established minimum wages and hours and that
Congress had extended in 1974 to cover millions of people employed
by states. In an early taste of the current federalism battle, the
Supreme Court declared that extension unconstitutional in 1976,
only to reverse itself in 1985, in a hotly disputed 5-to-4 ruling
called Garcia vs. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority. Chief
Rehnquist, then an associate justice, declared in dissent in the
Garcia case that he would work to have the court reverse itself
again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, 65 state probation officers and juvenile caseworkers in
Maine had sued the state in federal court for violating the Fair
Labor Standards Act by not giving them premium pay for overtime.
The case was still pending when the Supreme Court issued the
Seminole Tribe decision, which clearly required the dismissal of
the state workers' suit.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress had also provided that employees could bring
Fair Labor Standards Act cases in state court, the workers refiled
their case in the Maine courts. But the Maine Supreme Court ruled
last year that the state enjoyed sovereign immunity in its own
courts similar to its 11th Amendment immunity in federal court, and
dismissed the lawsuit. The question in one case the court decided
Wednesday, Alden vs. Maine, No. 98-436, was whether closing the
state courthouse doors to a suit based on a federally protected
right was a proper application of state sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the early 1990s, the federal courts had begun to dismiss
patent and trademark suits that people were bringing against state
agencies, on the ground that Congress had not met the Supreme
Court's standards for explicitly abrogating the states' 11th
Amendment immunity from suits of this type. In response, Congress
passed two laws in 1992, the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act and
the Patent Remedy Clarification Act, explicitly permitting these
kinds of suits against states in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the College Savings Bank, based in Princeton,
N.J., sued the state of Florida under both the new laws. The
College Savings Bank sells a certificate of deposit tailored for
parents saving for college tuition. When Florida entered the same
market through a new state agency, the Florida Prepaid
Postsecondary Education Expense Board, the College Savings Bank
alleged that the state was infringing its patent on its investment
method and was engaging in false advertising and unfair competition
in violation of the Federal Lanham Act, which protects trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   These lawsuits were also pending when the Supreme Court decided
the Seminole Tribe case. As a result, the trademark case was
dismissed, on the ground that the trademark law had been enacted as
an exercise of Congress' power to regulate commerce. But the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit refused Florida's request
to dismiss the patent suit, reasoning that patent cases were not
governed by the Seminole Tribe decision because patents were a type
of property. The appeals court held that Congress had the power to
prevent the deprivation of property without due process under its
power to enforce the due process guarantee of the 14th amendment, a
power the Supreme Court had not limited in the Seminole Tribe case.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides appealed to the Supreme Court. The trademark case was
College Savings Bank vs. Florida, No. 98-149, and the patent case
was Florida v. College Savings Bank, No. 98-531.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion upholding the Maine Supreme Court's decision that
the state was immune from suit in its own courts, Kennedy
acknowledged that the 11th Amendment did not directly answer the
question, because it limits only the jurisdiction of the federal
courts. But he said the principle of state immunity ``is demarcated
not by the text of the amendment alone but by fundamental
postulates implicit in the constitutional design.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kennedy said, for Congress to be able to authorize
suits in a state's own courts ``would be even more offensive to
state sovereignty than a power to authorize the suits in a federal
forum.'' He added: ``A power to press a state's own courts into
federal service is the power first to turn the state against itself
and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the
state against its will and at the behest of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Souter said the majority opinion was
based on a ``demonstrably mistaken'' view of history. He said:
``There is much irony in the court's profession that it grounds its
opinion on a deeply rooted historical tradition of sovereign
immunity, when the court abandons a principle nearly as inveterate,
and much closer to the hearts of the Framers: that where there is a
right, there must be a remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that some 4.7 million state workers were now foreclosed
from suing their employer in either state or federal court. The
federal government itself can still sue in state court, but
government lawyers told the court that the Department of Labor was
not equipped to do that, with enforcement always having depended on
private lawsuits. While the court did not overrule the Garcia
decision, which upheld the extension of federal labor law to the
states, that was likely to be its practical effect.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the College Savings Bank's
trademark case. He rejected a theory the Clinton administration, on
the bank's behalf, had offered as a way of getting around the
Seminole Tribe obstacle: that because Florida had made itself a
player in the commercial marketplace, it had implicitly waived its
immunity from suit for its activities in that marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   That argument was based on a 1964 Supreme Court precedent,
Parden v. Terminal Railway, which had permitted a suit against
Alabama on such a theory. Scalia, calling the Parden decision an
``ill-conceived experiment,'' declared that it was now overruled.
He also chided the dissenters for insisting on their position ``in
a degree of repetitive detail that has despoiled our northern
woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting in this case, Breyer said the court was undercutting
the very federalism that it purported to serve, by making it ``more
difficult for Congress to decentralize governmental decisionmaking
and to provide individual citizens, or local communities, with a
variety of enforcement powers.'' He accused the majority of
elevating a vision of sovereignty ``more akin to the thought of
James I than of James Madison.''
</P>
<P>
   In the patent case, Rehnquist wrote for the majority that the
appeals court had been mistaken to view the patent law as a valid
exercise of Congress' authority to enforce the 14th Amendment. He
said Congress had failed to find, when it passed the 1992 law, that
there was a constitutional problem requiring a 14th Amendment-based
solution.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He cited a decision two years ago, in which the court struck
down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on the ground that
Congress had exceeded its 14th Amendment authority.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting in this case, Stevens accused the majority of the
judicial activism its members often deplore. He said the court had
endorsed a version of sovereign immunity ``defined only by the
present majority's perception of constitutional penumbras rather
than constitutional text.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The invalidation of the two 1992 laws is likely to have the
direct effect of curbing copyright suits against states as well.
Briefs had been filed by publishers, the movie industry, and others
interested in intellectual property, warning the court that states
would have an unfair advantage over the private sector in
biotechnology, publishing and other ventures if they were immune
from suit.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the court's term Wednesday left undecided one
case that was argued this term, a voting rights case from Bossier
Parish, La. The court did not announce whether it would reargue the
case in the fall or dispose of it in some other way. With only 75
decisions this year, the end of the term came early. Not since 1969
had the court ended its term as early as June 23.

SCHOOL NURSES TO DISCUSS EARLIER TEACHING ABOUT MENSTRUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With research showing the onset of puberty occurring in some
girls as early as eight, playground teasing once reserved for the
early endowed 11-year-old is being aimed at girls as young as
third- and fourth-grade, school officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday _ in an effort to teach young girls about puberty
before they go through it _ the National Association of School
Nurses will convene a group of national school health experts in
Providence, R.I. to consider teaching girls about menstruation
earlier in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   There are complex emotions that come with having a body that is
mature, but a mind that is not, the group said. And with a recent
US Supreme Court ruling making schools liable for not intervening
when students are sexually harassed, educators say there is a
heightened urgency to teach all students respect for body
development early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most school nurses are aware of girls having their first
menses earlier,'' said Dr. Judith Robinson, executive director of
the National Association of School Nurses. She and educators in
Massachusetts said most girls are taught about menstruation around
fifth-grade in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to teach them earlier. And if you teach them about the
respiratory and circulatory system and then the reproductive
system, it can work,'' Robinson said. ``We don't want these girls
to be frightened by the changes their bodies are going through.''
</P>
<P>
   For mothers who grew up learning about sexuality in embarrassing
parent-daughter nights in seventh- or eighth-grade, teaching girls
about the birds and bees when they are still hoarding Beanie Babies
is a jarring thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I was in fourth-grade when it happened and I was
ten and that seemed so young,'' said Linda Thomson, a parent of a
kindergarten girl. ``Then you say it could even happen younger and
I can't imagine it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her community has some of the most progressive and early
reproductive lessons for girls and boys: a voluntary lesson as
early as third-grade that includes parents.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 30 years puberty's onset was believed to usually
start between 9 and 12, according to the National Association of
School Nurses. Historically, it began even later, although exact
ranges or ages are not available.
</P>
<P>
   But a 1997 study from the American Association of Pediatrics
suggests puberty's onset is now occuring as early as age 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a definite answer as to why,'' said Dr. Marc R.
Laufer, chief of gynecology at Children's Hospital in Boston. He
said the leading theory is that menstruation can be triggered by a
certain amount and type of body fat. For many reasons, children's
body fat can appear earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More striking, the study notes how much earlier African American
girls develop compared to Caucasian girls. The survey of 17,077
girls between 3 and 12 showed that between ages 7 and 8, 15 percent
of Caucasian girls and 48 percent of African American girls had
some breast development, pubic hair, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Laufer say the reason for the disparity is also uknown.
</P>
<P>
   He was so concerned with the number of young women saw who
didn't know how to deal with their body development, Laufer
co-opened the Center for Young Women's Health at Children's
Hospital this month _ specificially designed to help young women
deal with their changing bodies.
</P>
<P>
   School staff and parents say they want children to understand
the changes their bodies are going through, but worry talking about
sexuality with immature youth can lead to experimentation many
children are not ready for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stick the formality of reproduction in fifth-grade, and I
think it is in a good grade, it shouldn't go younger,'' said Diana
LeBlanc, assistant wellness director for Lynn, Mass. public
schools. LeBlanc says her district's school nurses look out for
girls who are showing breast development early and counsel them
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a continuum. There is always a few starting earlier and
some starting later. We try to teach to the middle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some regular teachers who are pressed to teach about
sexuality may have trouble talking about the subject to any grade,
much less younger students.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to consider most teachers didn't have health
education,'' said Nancy Strunk, HIV/Sexuality education program
coordinator for Boston Public Schools. ``They learned what they
know from their mothers who didn't have health education either. It
can be uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   She tries to encourage reproductive discussions in fourth-grade,
but most of it takes place in fifth and sixth grades.
</P>
<P>
   In response to lack of expertise by some teachers, Strunk and
health coordinators in other districts are increasingly hiring
outside groups to give weeklong body development lessons to girls
and boys, usually with parental permission or involvement. They
stress they are not teaching sex education _ but about sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are teaching them about sexuality and skills so they don't
get pregnant, so they resist peer pressure,'' Strunk said. ``Just
because you are able to bear a child doesn't mean you
should...that's what we teach.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some parents say they may be able to handle the academic
talk on sex earlier _ as long as they are part of the conversation
or asked about it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is so aware today of different areas of
sexuality,'' said Cheryl Sydorko, whose eight-year-old daughter was
in a combined second and third grade class this past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising is out there and she has observed so much. I'd
rather see her educated than be frightened with no facts.''

ADVOCATES FOR DISABLED ARE STUNNED, EMPLOYERS RELIEVED, BY RULING

Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advocates for the disabled, declaring that a
majority of the Supreme Court fundamentally misunderstood the
purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act, began Wednesday to
scramble for legal and political strategies to counter the court's
ruling this week that limited the law's protections.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, was one of the chief sponsors of the
1990 law, raised the possibility of seeking ``some kind of
legislative remedy'' to override the court's holding, but added:
``It's unclear where we go from here. I think this will send a
shock wave through the disability community.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, business groups heaved a collective sigh of relief.
``The great fear was a dramatic expansion in lawsuits, with a lot
of people without clearly defined disabilities clearly empowered to
seek legal relief,'' said Stephan Bokat, general counsel for the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``That was very, very scary for
employers.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a set of three employment-related decisions in
which the court held that people who could function normally when
they wore glasses or took medication could not generally be
considered disabled, despite their physical impairments, and thus
did not fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act's
protections against employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates asserted that the ruling created a bizarre catch-22,
in which those who managed to correct and cope with their
disability would lose protection against discrimination because of
it. ``Really, what they're not getting is that this isn't the old
model of disability where you're supposed to be so unable that you
get some kind of government dole,'' said Arlene Mayerson, directing
attorney of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, an
advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it's about is a whole new image of disabled people being
independent and able and wanting to participate and work,'' Ms.
Mayerson added. ``It's just so completely contrary to that notion
that if someone takes something that mitigates the disabling
effects of their impairment, which enables them to participate
more, that they're then cut out of protection under the Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkin said he feared that people with conditions like
controlled diabetes or epilepsy would now be subject to employment
discrimination, perhaps by employers fearing the added health
insurance costs of having people with those conditions on the
payroll. ``I don't know how many people with disabilities are going
to be denied jobs before people recognize the wrongness of this
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Bell, a former associate legal counsel for
disability cases at the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission
and a partner with the law firm of Jackson Lewis, which represents
employers, asserted that the court's ruling was a reasoned
response. ``The Supreme Court, in whacking back the definition of
disability, may have saved the ADA, like whacking back a bush will
help it grow,'' he said. ``It could have trivialized disability,
entitling half of America to accommodation, but there would have
been a political backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell added that employers should not read too much into the
decision. ``Employers need to be careful not to leap to the
conclusion that anyone taking medication is no longer covered,'' he
said. ``This raises the bar for disability coverage, but it really
only means that truly disabled people can make a claim.''
</P>
<P>
   The employment decisions that were handed down this week
overshadowed another ADA-related decision that was considered a
major victory for disability rights groups. That decision, in a
case brought against the state of Georgia by two women with mental
impairments, held that isolating disabled people in large
institutions when there was no medical reason for their confinement
was a violation of the federal disabilities law.
</P>
<P>
   As advocates for the disabled met in Washington on Wednesday,
that decision, known as the Olmstead case, was a reason for
celebration. ``Olmstead is huge,'' said Christine Griffin,
executive director of the Disability Law Center in Massachusetts.
``The court has said that unjust isolation equals prohibited
discrimination under the ADA, and we couldn't be happier about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the employment decisions clearly rankled those who were
instrumental in pushing through the disabilities act. ``Where it
leaves the ADA is with a huge gaping hole right at its heart,''
asserted Professor Chai Feldblum of Georgetown Law School, who
helped draft the original law.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers for the disabled said it would take time, and
substantially more litigation, before the full impact of the
court's ruling was clear. ``I would not characterize it as a good
news, bad news decision,'' said Catherine Hanssens, director of the
Aids Project of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``I
would characterize it as a bad news, but doors still open
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for business hailed the ruling as providing a
much-needed degree of clarity in a difficult area of law. ``It
provides a greater certainty for business people,'' said Thomas
Hungar, a partner with Gibson Dunn and Crutcher, the
Washington-based law firm that represented United Parcel Service,
one of the parties in the three cases that prompted the court's
ruling. ``It resolves the inconsistency in lower court rulings on
this issue of threshold, which frankly is in everyone's interest.
And it allows everyone to bring the focus back to the truly
disabled.''

GRAF BELATEDLY MANAGES TO SOLVE DE SWARDT'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When Martina Hingis earned an unwelcome opportunity to
spend some quality time with Mom, it was supposed to greatly
enhance Steffi Graf's chances to cuddle with the Wimbledon ladies'
singles trophy for the eighth time in her incandescent and recently
revived career.
</P>
<P>
   But the No. 2 seed briefly _ and shockingly _ found herself
staring at a spot in the abyss alongside her immediate superior
Wednesday. While a Centre Court crowd sat benumbed, Graf dropped
five of the first six games to 38th-ranked Mariaan de Swardt.
Though she did not recover in time to salvage the first set, she
asserted the form that has carried her to 22 Grand Slam crowns,
dispatching de Swardt, 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, in 1 hour 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Graf advanced to the third round and avoided the
cataclysmic fate that befell top seed Hingis in her opening match
Tuesday. Playing without her imperious mother, Melanie Molitor, on
the premises for the first time, Hingis was jolted by qualifier
Jelena Dokic, 6-2, 6-0. Later that night, she withdrew from the
doubles with what was officially and vaguely described as a
recurring medical problem _ most likely a bruised ego _ and
immediately departed the All England Club, perhaps to rejoin her
mother, mend a reported rift, and figure out what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Though this doesn't leave a clear patch of grass for Graf _ not
with the likes of Lindsay Davenport, Monica Seles, defender Jana
Novotna, and Venus Williams still on the prowl _ she wasn't
expected to encounter such resistance from de Swardt, with whom she
had split two career meetings, losing the most recent in 1995. But,
fresh from her galvanizing upset of Hingis in the French Open
final, her first major title since 1996, Graf inexplicably found de
Swardt to be a mystery in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she was serving,'' said Graf, ``there was not very
much I could do. I started serving pretty poorly, and she was going
for her shots. I felt a little under pressure on my serve. Instead
of concentrating on what I wanted to do, I was worrying about what
she was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Graf, who entered the land of tennis fossils last week when
she turned 30, showed that she isn't ancient history just yet,
making the first set competitive, if not successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it started at 5-1 when I came back to make it 5-4,''
she said. ``That is when I personally felt much better, and I think
that made it turn around for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She was never threatened thereafter, but that doesn't mean she's
taking crown No. 8 for granted, even with Tuesday's upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, that is funny,'' she said. ``You always ask me
about the finals, and I just won my second round. You know, I'm not
having an easy road here.''
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Hingis, at least she's still on it.
</P>
<P>
   The other prime women contenders in action Wednesday experienced
no such perils. Fourth seed Seles blitzed Marlene Weingartner, 6-0,
6-0; No. 6 Williams handled Elena Tatarkova, 6-3, 6-4; and No. 8
Nathalie Tauziat dispatched Amanda Hopmans, 6-3, 6-4. The most
notable casualty was erstwhile child prodigy Jennifer Capriati,
whose recent victory at Strasbourg _ her first title in six years _
signaled her return from the teenage wasteland that had derailed
her career. She was bounced by Seda Noorlander, 6-1, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, the suspense was minimal as Pete Sampras
solidified his stature as the Green Monster. The top seed and
defending champion again proved that grass is his elixir, disposing
of Sebastien Lareau, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, in a tidy 1:21.
</P>
<P>
   After a desultory start to his year _ punctuated by his
bypassing the Australian Open to work on his celebrity golf game
and his second-round ouster from the French Open _ Sampras won the
Queen's Club Wimbledon warmup on God's sod. Now he's on course for
his sixth Wimbledon, which would enable him to tie Roy Emerson's
all-time men's standard of 12 Grand Slam singles titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm where I want to be right now in the tournament,'' said
Sampras, ``and I must admit that winning Queen's was what I needed.
I'm where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Where he doesn't want to be is in a state of obsession over
Emerson's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about it playing, you know, I'm really not,''
said Sampras. ``Just to be put in this position is an effort in
itself, but I'm not consumed with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras did acknowledge that he found some inspiration in
watching his once and future US Davis Cup teammate, gritty veteran
Jim Courier, outlast 12th seed Carlos Moya, the former French king,
in a five-set survival test on Centre Court, 6-3, 3-6, 7-6, 3-6,
6-2. And speaking of Boston-bound Davis Cuppers, the runner-up
prize for most arduous male victory of the day went to seventh seed
Mark Philippoussis, who outlasted Australian teammate Mark
Woodforde, 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 6-4. Presumably, they'll be back on
speaking terms by next month's Cup quarterfinal against the
Americans at Longwood.
</P>
<P>
   Third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov also struggled a bit, beating
qualifier Paradorm Srichaphan, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 6-4. The only other
Top 10 seed to complete his match, No. 9 Greg Rusedski, gave his
hometown crowd nothing to fret about, eliminating qualifier Arvind
Parmar, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   And making Sampras's day a little sunnier, his French conqueror,
Andrei Medvedev, the runner-up in Paris, displayed no staying power
on grass, falling to Daniel Nestor, 6-1, 7-5, 6-3.

 &HT;    JUDGE SAYS TAPES BY EX-MISTRESS COULD BE USED AGAINST CISNEROS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge said Wednesday that secretly-made
tapes could be used against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros
if they demonstrate that he was being blackmailed by his
ex-mistress when he certified to FBI officials that he was not.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-trial jousting, U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin
warned that he would not allow into evidence all 34 tapes recorded
by Cisneros's ex-mistress, Linda Jones, and offered by the
prosecution. But he indicated he might take some tapes from
prosecutors ``if they can show that the (taped material) itself was
an extortion document.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is scheduled to go on trial in September on charges
brought by independent counsel David Barrett that he lied to the
FBI and concealed more than $250,000 in ``hush money'' to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's encouragement to the prosecutors came after the
defense team appeared to be making headway in their drive to
whittle away at Jones's credibility. Jones backtracked Wednesday on
her denials a day earlier that she had planned to seek a book deal
to cash in on her seven-year relationship with Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I did remember a conversation with (Lubbock, Texas,
lawyer) Bruce Magness that he would like to go to New York'' to
inquire about a book contract, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that ``I still didn't recall'' writing several
chapters of a book that defense lawyers have entered into evidence.
But she acknowledged that her lawyers were seeking to sell film
rights to her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with my knowledge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, known also by her married name of Medlar, is serving a 3
1/2 year prison term in Carswell, Texas, for bank fraud arising out
of her financial dealings in her hometown of Lubbock. And in her
third day of testimony, Cisneros's legal team bore down on her
record of lying, including admissions that she misled federal
officials at 11 meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``From 1994, in every way , shape and form, the witness has
committed perjury and obstruction of justice, and lied repeatedly
to the FBI and is in jail for lying,'' attorney Barry Simon told
the judge at day's end. ``And the government offers us this
witness!''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has admitted to concealing the fact that she duplicated
her tape recordings of Cisneros, used a Radio Shack ``boom box'' to
delete portions that she considered to be harmful to herself, and
put all of the originals in a dumpster.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Simon argued that all the tapes should be tossed
out. ``They are copied and they have been massively played with,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor countered that if the voice could be traced
to Cisneros, the evidence was valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each and every one of these tapes is a non-hearsay
statement,'' said prosecutor Mark Jackowski. He cited admissions
``out of the defendant's own mouth'' that Cisneros made payments to
Jones that far exceeded the $10,000 a year that he reported to FBI
agents when he was under consideration to become housing secretary
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, the former mayor of San Antonio where Jones worked as
his political fund-raiser, served in the federal housing post until
his indictment in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin, who is not expected to rule on the tapes until next
week at the earliest, opened the door to allowing at least some of
the recordings into the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prosecution has a problem,'' he said. ``They have to take
the evidence where they found it. They didn't invent Medlar
(Jones).''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, three days of hearing Jones admit repeatedly
to lying brought this comment from the judge:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, I'm astounded when I sit here and listen
to what happened in this case. I guess there are people who don't
know how to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he must now determine whether Jones was telling the
truth now.
</P>
<P>
   To that, Simon answered: ``We're going to bring in witnesses to
say she's lying today from the witness stand.''

   GERMANY: ECONOMIC PACKAGE APPROVED
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to galvanize a slowing economy, fight unemployment
and stabilize the euro, the Cabinet approved an economic reform
package that would cut billions from the budget in the next four
years. The package combines reductions in social spending and
subsidies with tax cuts for businesses and an increase in fuel
taxes. The plan is expected to be voted on by Parliament in the

   Prime Minister Tony Blair postponed a planned trip to Belfast
until next week and warned that his push for resolving a dispute
over paramilitary disarmament by next Wednesday represented the
``last chance'' to avoid a return to bloodshed in Northern Ireland.
Blair said he was staying in London to attend the funeral on Friday

   France's highest court confirmed the life sentence being served
by Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, 50, the international terrorist who calls
himself Carlos the Jackal, for the murder of two French police
agents and a Lebanese informant in Paris in 1975. He was convicted
in December 1997 and has been in French prisons since his capture
in 1994. Austria wants to extradite him to be tried for the 1975
kidnapping of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna, in which three people
died.

   SPAIN: VOW ON BASQUE PEACE
</P>
<P>
   In the annual State of the Nation debate in Parliament, Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar vowed to press for a lasting peace in the
Basque region, where the rebel group ETA has observed a cease-fire
since September, halting 30 years of separatist violence. Aznar
promised a ``flexible'' policy for the 439 convicted or suspected
Basque rebels in Spanish jails. Some 134 Basques have been released
since the cease-fire began.

   The death toll has climbed to at least 68 after two days of

mountainous northern region. government forces have suffered the
bulk of the losses in the combat, which began when the country's

   The senior environmental officials of Latin America's largest
cities, with a total population of 68 million, acknowledged in a
statement issued in Mexico City that their residents ``suffer a
threat to their personal health'' because of air pollution. They
called on their own local and national governments to improve air

COURIER UPSETS MOYA AS AGASSI PROVIDES SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ For starters, Jim Courier, whose habitual
first-round departures from Wimbledon in the past three years had
been made in obscurity on the hintercourts, had to remember how to
make his bow to the Royal Box as he marched onto Center Court.
</P>
<P>
   That pleasantry conquered, he turned his attention to turning
back a gallant serve-and-volley fusillade sent his way by
12th-seeded Carlos Moya. Moya, the 1998 French Open champion,
briefly held the No. 1 ranking this spring and briefly floored
Courier Wednesday by defying a tradition of Spanish baselining and
sprinting to the net like Fred Perry.
</P>
<P>
   But the 61st-ranked Courier, who had not reached the third round
here since his run to the Wimbledon final in 1993, got there
Wednesday by fending off Moya for 3 hours 3 minutes. The 6-3, 3-6,
7-6 (7-1), 3-6, 6-2 upset was, Courier felt, in doubt until the end
of the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He served and volleyed every point except for three in the
match,'' said Courier, who countered the Spaniard's aggression with
a string of perfect returns, all of them wrought as much from
desperation as good intentions. ``I kind of had to. I don't know if
I can return much better than I returned in that match, and he just
kept coming up with great volleys all the time, and I was thinking,
`OK, he's not a natural serve-and-volleyer, eventually he's going
to break down, and he never did.'''
</P>
<P>
   With a crisp crosscourt forehand pass at match point, Courier,
who has not won a Grand Slam title since 1993 and last summer
skipped the U.S. Open while debating early retirement, gained
Wimbledon's third round for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Courier, a hero in the first round of Davis Cup this April in
Birmingham, England _ where he beat Tim Henman in the first match
and outlasted Greg Rusedski, 8-6, in the fifth set in the fifth and
deciding bout _ finally seems to be translating his patriotic team
fervor to the individual tour events.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Agassi, who cited Courier's Davis Cup theatrics as
inspirational to his own first French Open title run earlier this
month, sat in the Center Court stands as a gesture of solidarity
Wednesday. And Pete Sampras, who rejoined the Davis Cup team for
the second round after watching Courier, joked about the new
camaraderie the veteran threesome share.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of love in the air, huh?'' said Sampras, who
zipped into the third round Wednesday with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-3
dissection of 100th-ranked Sebastien Lareau of Canada that was
equal parts magic and mechanics. The five-time champion now faces
595th-ranked Danny Sapsford of Britain, a realist who remarked that
there is probably a far better chance of a second coming during the
third round than a victory against Sampras, now 41-1 over the past
six years here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is not to be overconfident,'' said Sampras, now
five victories from tying Roy Emerson's career record of 12 Grand
Slam titles. ``I'm where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Paul Goldstein of Rockville, Md., the 112th-ranked
Wimbledon first-timer who disposed of another seeded Spaniard, No.
16 Felix Mantilla, 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-2. Goldstein's next
challenge is 87th-ranked Daniel Nestor of Canada, who Wednesday
ousted Andrei Medvedev, the French Open runner-up to Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   At this time last year, Goldstein was busy graduating from
Stanford, where he rubbed elbows with Tiger Woods and Chelsea
Clinton and obtained a degree in human biology. ``The area of
concentration is socio-economics of race, whatever that is,'' said
Goldstein, who admitted there is no obvious link between his field
of study and his field of play. ``It just means that when guys
figure out how to beat me and I'm losing first round every week, I
might be able to go out and get a job somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   While Courier used his return to reach the third round,
seventh-seeded Mark Philippoussis and ninth-seeded Greg Rusedski
relied on their serves. Philippoussis used 38 aces to thwart his
33-year-old Davis Cup teammate, Mark Woodforde, 6-7 (4-7), 7-6
(8-6), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, and remain on track for a fourth-round
serve-fest with Rusedski, who needed only 17 aces to subdue
455th-ranked Arvind Parmar, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3). &QL;

TEARFUL MCNEELEY REKINDLES THE DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ His voice cracked first. Then the rest of Peter
McNeeley went with it.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional display that left a pre-fight press conference
crowd at first agape and then applauding wildly, the Medfield,
Mass., heavyweight and reforming (if not quite reformed) crack
addict stood at a podium in Las Vegas for the first time since the
night he was knocked loopy by Mike Tyson and wept.
</P>
<P>
   He wept for dreams long shattered. He wept for his
long-suffering family and loyal manager, Vinny Vecchione. And he
wept for himself. By the time he was finished, a room full of
cold-hearted boxing types wept with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been four long years since . . . I've been . . . here,''
McNeeley began after being introduced by promoter Bob Arum as the B
side of an odd but soon to become fascinating four-round super
heavyweight fight with fistic cult hero Butterbean Esch Saturday
night on the undercard of the Johnny Tapia-Paulie Ayala World
Boxing Association bantamweight title bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life took a lot of twists and turns . . . trials and
tribulations,'' McNeeley continued, his face contorted and his
cheeks wet as he fought to hold himself together long enough to
finish what he had to say. Not another sound could be heard in the
Club Room at Mandalay Bay's Event Center. Everyone was waiting like
they did four years ago when he became a 15-minute celebrity with
Tyson, waiting to see how things would end.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year after I fought Mike Tyson I was sitting in a crack
house digging for rocks that weren't there. I was peeking out of
windows at demons that weren't there. I was lost. I dropped out of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family and Vinny were looking for me. It was like a game of
hot and cold and they were getting warmer. I looked out the window
one day and I seen his car drive by. I couldn't take it any more. I
called a friend to come get me. My mom and my dad stayed by me. The
only people who stayed and believed in me were my mom and dad . . .
and Vinny Vecchione. They loved me.''
</P>
<P>
   At that the tears came again and this time so did the applause,
swelling as McNeeley's shoulders shook and his head hung to his
chest. And then he looked up at Las Vegas, the town where he'd lost
his dream like so many others before him, and he was a fighter
again, not some broken-down crackhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now . . . today . . . I love me, too,'' McNeeley said. ``I'm a
warrior. I'm walking out of here a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, applause began anew and tears came with it, and now
they weren't coming only from Peter McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most dramatic speeches I ever heard,''
Arum said as McNeeley sat with head bowed, his hands covering his
face. ``That crack is horrible, horrible stuff. To get yourself
back takes more courage than anything that will happen in the
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Tapia, himself a former drug abuser who nearly blew his
career because of it, was at the podium, but before he could speak
of his own fight he turned to McNeeley and tapped his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in my heart, man,'' Tapia said. ``We're all in there
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   At that, McNeeley, who bet $1,000 on himself at 7-1 as soon as
he got into town and as of Wednesday knew it was the only money
down on him, looked up and tapped his own chest back. Then he
turned to Vecchione and tried to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been hard on him,'' Vecchione said. ``I've told him this is
it. This is a pretty serious time for him. He knows he needs
something or it's over.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he sat down he was pretty emotional. He just told me it
was like he had a flashback to four years ago and everything that's
happened since. He said he had to get it out of his system. I said
`good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And so he did and now there is only Saturday night left and a
four-round fight that was briefly taken off the board after
Wednesday's emotional display. It returned with McNeeley an 8-1
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   For Butterbean it will be a fight for a mythical four-round,
super heavyweight championship. For Peter McNeeley, it will be a
fight for his life.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mexico's Cemex has thrived on the sort of tumult facing
companies in Latin America this year. CEO Lorenzo Zambrano
considers market downturns more than a fact of life in an
increasingly global economy _ he sees them as buying opportunities.
In less than 15 years, he built a mid-sized company into the
world's third-largest cement maker by moving fast when speed
counted most. ``There is no magic solution (to volatility),'' he
says. ``Once you go in and things go sour, then you have to turn it
around very, very, quickly.''
 &HT;    The numbers emerging out of this year's Latin Trade 100 of top
publicly traded companies show that not everyone has Zambrano's
Midas touch.
 &HT;    The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the
Caribbean predicts that regional economic growth will be a paltry 1
percent in 1999. That doesn't bode well for companies in the
region: last year the regional economic output expanded by 2.3
percent, but sales for the top 100 firms dropped 6 percent to
US$233 billion and profits plunged by a third to $18.3 billion.
 &HT;    While companies in Mexico are now emerging from the Tequila
economic maelstrom that started five years ago, firms across South
America are entering what promises to be a challenging year of
Samba-nomics. The Brazilian currency may have stabilized, but the
largest market in Latin America is expected to enter a deep
recession, taking many of its neighbors with it. Faced with the
deadly duo of a sudden spike in financing costs and a severe
recession, many wanna-be global players from the region and inbound
multinationals have had no option but to restructure and retreat.
 &HT;    Whatever happens in Brazil, the wild swings in sales and profits
will continue. Last year, almost half of the largest publicly
traded companies in Latin America reported double-digit changes in
revenues and a remarkable eight out of ten firms posted similar
movement in profits. ``You get used to volatility,'' says Zambrano.
``For Cemex (1999 Rank: 8), volatility is just another part of
doing business and we have learned how to profit from it.'' As the
Latin Trade 100 shows, companies are getting used to volatility.
Time will tell whether they learn from it.
 &HT;    Some highlights from this year's ranking:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 &HT;    Carlos Slim, the principal behind Mexican holding Grupo Carso
(17) and Telefonos de Mexico (2), is thoroughly enjoying
deregulation. Not only has he managed to fend off invaders AT&AMP;T and
MCI, but the phone mogul is aggressively promoting convergence with
stakes in Internet access provider Prodigy Communications Corp.,
media conglomerate Grupo Televisa and online music seller CDNow
Inc.
 &HT;    Telmex advanced from fourth place to second in the ranking, with
sales increasing a modest 5.3 percent and profits rising 4.3
percent over the previous year. Luiz Carvalho, a Latin American
telecommunications analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
predicts Telmex revenues will grow at least 22 percent this year.
``The company should benefit from good telephone line growth and a
strong cellular business,'' he says in projecting that the number
of cellular subscribers will increase 50 percent this year; nearly
28 percent in 2000.
 &HT;    ``Telmex is a cash machine with a strong balance sheet,'' says
JP Morgan Latin American telecommunications analyst Simon Flannery.
Most analysts, however, do believe that Telmex will receive
pressure from the Mexican government to spend more money installing
more telephone lines to raise the country's phone density. Today,
Mexico has only 10.7 lines per 100 people, a ratio less than that
of Argentina, Chile and Venezuela.
 &HT;    The privatization and breakup of Telebras, the massive Brazilian
telephone company, caused that company to disappear from the
ranking. The firm had held second place for years behind another
perennial, Petrobras (1). But the 12 new companies that emerged
from the $19 billion privatization in July 1998 are not exactly
tiny; fie made the Latin Trade 100 list.
 &HT;    Take, for example, Tele Norte Leste Participaces (9), the
largest of the lot, controlled by a consortium led by Andrade
Gutierrez, a major Brazilian construction company. Tele Norte
Leste's market is massive, made up of 86 million people, more than
half the Brazilian population. JP Morgan's Flannery says he expects
earnings to grow and calls the company ``a dark horse'' among the
12 new companies born following the breakup of Telebras. But he
cautions that competition and the company's inexperience _ the
consortium does not include a telecom operator _ could be a
problem.
 &HT;    All eyes are on Telefonica de Espana's hottest new property
Telesp Participaces (13). The Sao Paulo phone company's 6.4 million
telephone lines represent 36 percent of all existing lines in
Brazil. Flannery calls it the ``blue chip'' of the Brazilian
telecom sector. ``It has the virtue of being the largest company
operating in the most attractive market with the most experienced
management team,'' he says.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RETAIL
 &HT;    Mammoth U.S. retailer Wal-Mart is now taking lessons at the
school of hard knocks. A couple of years ago, it took a majority
stake in former joint venture partner Cifra (6), Mexico's largest
chain of stores. Cifra's sales are rising nicely, but now profits _
down by a third last year _ are under serious pressure. Further
south in Brazil, Wal-Mart ditched its joint venture with Lojas
Americanas (72), as the Brazilian retailer went into a tailspin,
generating profits only after selling a fifth of its 110 stores to
France's Carrefour.
 &HT;    Dutch supermarket chain Royal Ahold continues to grow in the
region, with first quarter sales doubling to $715 million compared
to the same period a year ago. The company is co-owner of Brazil's
Bompreco (48), which dominates northeastern Brazil with 91 stores,
and is an equal partner with an Argentine investment company that
owns Disco (53) and Chilean retailer Santa Isabel. In Argentina,
revenues are expected to grow even higher this year because
Disco-Ahold acquired Supamer and Gonzalez, two Argentine food
retailers with 75 stores.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ELECTRICITY
 &HT;    Chilean businessman Jose Yuraszeck's bid to build Enersis (21)
into a multinational power company was cut short not by flagging
results but rather lack of financial firepower. Spain's Endesa took
over with a $1.4 billion bid and then proceeded to lock up the grid
with a highly controversial takeover _ worth $2.1 billion _ of
Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, a power generation company with
assets in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. Competitors
cried foul because the deal would give the Spaniards near monopoly
control over the power sector in Chile.
 &HT;    Like the Telebras privatization, the breakup of federally run
electricity holding Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (3), more
commonly known as Eletrobras, promises to spawn a host of new large
publicly listed companies. This year, Eletrobras was expected to
sell three electricity generators, but may delay the sale of at
least two until next year, according to published reports. That may
give time to improve the company's performance, which included a
strong 24 percent surge in sales and a dismal 45 percent drop in
profits largely due to losses at a power generating subsidiary and
increased tax payments.
 &HT;    Among the other Brazilian electricity companies falling from
grace were state-run Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (34) (Cesp),
whose sales and profits dropped by more than a third. The results
reflect the July 1998 sale of its distribution unit, Elektro
Electricidade Servicios, to U.S.-based Enron. The unit generated
nearly half Cesp's annual revenues. The company was scheduled to
sell three of its generating units in the second quarter.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STEEL
 &HT;    Benjamin Steinbruch, the dynamic Brazilian businessman who took
over steel maker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (36) (CSN) and
later mining giant Compania Vale do Rio Doce (10) (CVRD), is
clearly looking to cash out on his investments. Rumors continue to
circulate about the sale of all or some of his holdings in CVRD.
CSN has launched a major restructuring that will involve the sale
of non-steel related assets. The company is said to be looking at
an international expansion into the United States, not unlike
compatriot Gerdau's foray into steel production outside of Brazil.
 &HT;    Steelmakers, like Brazil's Usiminas (28) and Altos Hornos de
Mexico (66), continue to struggle with depressed demand, high
interest rates and lackluster prices. Altos Hornos was probably the
hardest hit, posting a $177 million loss last year that has
prompted the hiring of investment bank JP Morgan to find a
strategic partner.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    OIL/GAS
 &HT;    Roberto Monti, another high-flying Latin American entrepreneur
and head of Argentine oil concern YPF (5), pushed growth as fast as
he could but not fast enough. YPF has been investing $1.5 billion a
year and yet, last April, Spain's Repsol launched a $13 billion
takeover bid, effectively ending Monti's hope of building an
independent multinational oil conglomerate.
 &HT;    For the oil companies that dominate the upper echelons of Latin
America's largest publicly traded companies, depressed oil prices
are making a difficult year worse. Petrobras, the Brazilian
state-run oil giant with $15 billion in sales, is facing tough
times. Last year, sales and profit fell about 15 percent. This
year, says JP Morgan energy analyst Mary Bourque, does not look
promising. She forecasts a net loss of $1.3 billion, due mainly to
the devaluation of the Brazilian real.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NEWCOMERS
 &HT;    Brazilian power companies Light (12) and Electropaulo
Metropolitana (26) jumped high into the rankings once privatization
made them eligible for the list, as did the former units of
Telebras. Other entrants new to or back on the Latin Trade 100
include Brazilian electricity distributor EBE (61); Mexican cement
maker Tolmex (67); Argentine steel firm Siderar (85), as well as
bus manufacturer Grupo Dina (88) and retailer El Puerto de
Liverpool (97), both from Mexico.

 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Cemex, de Mexico, ha prosperado en el torbellino que enfrentan
este ano las companias en America Latina. El presidente ejecutivo,
Lorenzo Zambrano, considera que las caidas del mercado son algo mas
que consecuencias logicas de la globalizacion economica: para el
son oportunidades de compra. En menos de 15 anos convirtio una
compania mediana en el tercer fabricante de cemento del mundo. ``No
hay una solucion magica (para la volatilidad,'' dice. ``Cuando las
cosas empeoran, hay que cambiarlo todo muy rapidamente.''
 &HT;    Las cifras de la lista de las 100 mayores companias cotizadas en
bolsa de Latin Trade de este ano indican que no todo el mundo tiene
el toque de Midas de Zambrano.
 &HT;    La CEPAL pronostica que el crecimiento economico de la region
sera de un magro 1 por ciento en 1999, un augurio nada bueno. En
1998 la produccion crecio un 2,3 por ciento, pro las ventas de las
100 mayores empresas cotizadas en bolsa bajaron el 6 por ciento, a
US$233.000 millones, y las ganancias se redujeron una tercera
parte, a US$18.300 millones.
 &HT;    Mientras las empresas en Mexico emergen de un torbellino
economico que duro cinco anos, las de Sudamerica entran en lo que
promete ser un ano dificil debido al efecto samba. La moneda
brasilena se ha estabilizado, pero el mayor mercado de
Latinoamerica entrara en recesion, arrastrando a muchos vecinos en
su caida. Frente a la subita alza del costo de financiacion y una
grave recesion, muchas empresas de la region que aspiraban a entrar
en los mercados mundiales, y muchas multinacionales con presencia
en America Latina, no han tenido mas remedio que reestructurarse y
retirarse.
 &HT;    Pase lo que pase en Brasil, perduraran los bruscos cambios en
las ventas y las ganancias. El ano pasado, casi la mitad de las
mayores companias latinoamericanas cotizadas en bolsa informaron
cambios por encima del 10 por ciento en los ingresos, y una notable
proporcion de ocho de cada diez firmas registraron movimientos
similares en las ganancias.
 &HT;    ``Uno se habitua a la volatilidad,'' senala Zambrano. ``Para
Cemex (lugar en 1999: 8), la volatilidad es parte de la actividad
de negocios y hemos aprendido a sacarle provecho.'' Como muestra la
lista de las 100 mayores empresas de Latin Trade, las companias se
habituan a la volatilidad. El tiempo dira si han aprendido la
leccion.
 &HT;    En la clasificacion de este ano se destacan estos aspectos:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TELECOMUNICACIONES
 &HT;    Carlos Slim, la figura principal del holding mexicano Grupo
Carso (17) y Telefonos de Mexico (2), disfruta la desregulacion a
plenitud. No solo ha logrado rechazar la invasion de AT&AMP;T y MCI,
sino que es un decidido promotor de la convergencia: tiene
participaciones en Prodigy Communications Corp., proveedor de
Internet; en el conglomerado de medios Grupo Televisa y en la firma
de venta de musica en linea CDNow, Inc.
 &HT;    Telmex avanzo del cuarto al segundo lugar en la clasificacion
con un modesto aumento del 5,3 por ciento en las ventas y del 4,3
por ciento en las ganancias con respecto al ano anterior. Luiz
Carvalho, analista de telecomunicaciones en Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, pronostica que los ingresos de Telmex creceran al menos 22
por ciento este ano. ``La compania debe beneficiarse de un buen
crecimiento de las lineas telefonicas y de la telefonia celular,''
dice. Calcula que la cantidad de suscriptores de telefonos
celulares crecera el 50 por ciento este ano y casi el 28 por ciento
en el 2000.
 &HT;    ``Telmex es una maquina de hacer dinero,'' dice Simon Flannery,
analista de telecomunicaciones de JP Morgan. Pero la mayoria de los
analistas piensan que el gobierno mexicano presionara a Telmex para
que invierta mas en la instalacion de lineas telefonicas. Mexico
tiene 10,7 lineas por cada 100 personas, menos que Argentina, Chile
y Venezuela.
 &HT;    La privatizacion y escision del gigante telefonico brasileno
Telebras hizo que quedara fuera de la clasificacion. La firma ocupo
durante varios anos el segundo lugar, detras de Petrobras (1). De
las 12 firmas nacidas de la privatizacion, ocurrida en 1998 a un
valor de US$19.000 millones, cinco integraron la lista de Latin
Trade.
 &HT;    Una es Tele Norte Leste Participaces (9), la mayor del grupo,
controlada por un consorcio dirigido por Andrade Gutierrez, una
importante compania constructora de Brasil. El mercado de Tele
Norte Leste es enorme: 86 millones de personas, mas de la mitad de
la poblacion brasilena. Flannery, de JP Morgan, dice que espera que
los ingresos crezcan y apunta que la compania es una inesperada
ganadora entre las 12 firmas nacidas de la escision de Telebras.
Pero advierte que la competencia y la inexperiencia de la firma
podrian ser un problema.
 &HT;    Todas las miradas se vuelven hacia la nueva propiedad de
Telefonica de Espana, Telesp Participaces (13). Los 6,4 millones de
lineas de la telefonica de Sao Paulo representan el 36 por ciento
del total del Brasil. Flannery la llama la carta de triunfo del
sector brasileno de las telecomunicaciones. ``Es la mayor empresa
en el mercado mas atractivo con el equipo gerencial mas
experimentado,'' afirma.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    COMERCIO MINORISTA
 &HT;    El gigante norteamericano Wal-Mart aprende de los golpes. Hace
un par de anos adquirio una participacion mayoritaria en su ex
socio de empresa conjunta Cifra (6), la mayor cadena mexicana de
tiendas. Las ventas de Cifra suben pero ahora las ganancias (que
bajaron una tercera parte el ano pasado) estan amenazadas. Mas al
sur, en Brasil, Wal-Mart establecio una empresa conjunta con Lojas
Americanas (72), cuando el detallista brasileno estuvo al borde de
la ruina, y solo genero ganancias despues de vender la quinta parte
de sus 110 establecimientos a la francesa Carrefour.
 &HT;    La megacadena holandesa de supermercados Royal Ahold sigue
creciendo en la region. Sus ventas en el primer trimestre
aumentaron el doble, a US$715 millones, en comparacion con el mismo
periodo del ano anterior. La compania es copropietaria de Bompreco
(48), que domina el nordeste de Brasil con 91 establecimientos, y
esta asociada al 50 por ciento con una compania argentina de
inversion, propietaria de Disco (53) y del minorista chileno Santa
Isabel. En Argentina, se espera que los ingresos crezcan mas este
ano debido a que Disco-Ahold adquirio Supamer y Gonzalez, dos
minoristas argentinos con 75 supermercados.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ELECTRICIDAD
 &HT;    El plan del empresario chileno Jose Yuraszeck de convertir a
Enersis (21) en una empresa electrica multinacional se quedo corto,
no por malos resultados sino mas bien por falta de poder
financiero. La espanola Endesa adquirio Enersis con una oferta de
US$1.400 millones y trato de completar la red con una polemica
maniobra de absorcion cuyo valor se calculo en unos US$2.100
millones, de la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, una
electrogeneradora con activos en Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia
y Peru. Los competidores denunciaron la maniobra porque le habria
dado a los espanoles un control casi monopolico del sector
energetico de Chile.
 &HT;    Al igual que la privatizacion de Telebras, la division del
holding estatal Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras (3), mas conocido
como Eletrobras, promete generar una legion de grandes empresas
cotizadas en bolsa. Muchos esperaban que este ano Eletrobras
vendiera tres generadoras, pero es muy posible que la venta se
aplace por lo menos hasta el 2000. Esto podria dar tiempo para
mejorar el rendimiento de la compania, cuyas ventas crecieron un
vigoroso 24 por ciento, pero que sufrio una angustiosa perdida del
24 por ciento en las ganancias debido mayormente a las perdidas en
una filial generadora y a un aumento de los impuestos.
 &HT;    Entre las otras empresas electricas brasilenas que van cuesta
abajo estan la estatal Companhia Energetica de Sao Paulo (34)
(Cesp), cuyas ventas y ganancias bajaron mas de la tercera parte.
Los resultados reflejan la venta en julio de 1998 de su unidad de
distribucion, Elektro Electricidade Servicios, a Enron, de EU. La
unidad generaba casi la mitadde los ingresos anuales de Cesp. La
compania debia vender tres generadoras en el segundo trimestre.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ACERO
 &HT;    Benjamin Steinbruch, el empresario brasileno que adquirio la
Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (36) (CSN) y mas tarde la Companhia
Vale do Rio Doce (10) (CVRD), claramente busca sacar provecho a sus
inversiones. Aun se rumora que vendera sus intereses en CVRD. CSN
ha iniciado una gran reestructuracion en la cual se venderan
activos no relacionados con el acero. Se afirma que la compania
busca una expansion hacia Estados Unidos, no muy distinta de la
incursion de su compatriota Gerdau en la produccion de acero fuera
de Brasil.
 &HT;    Los fabricantes de acero como Usiminas (28), de Brasil, y Altos
Hornos de Mexico (66), aun sufren de la baja en la demanda, las
altas tasas de interes y los bajos precios. Altos Hornos fue quiza
la mas afectada: el ano pasado perdio US$177 millones, lo que la
llevo a a JP Morgan para buscar un socio estrategico.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    PETROLEO/GAS
 &HT;    Roberto Monti, otro destacado empresario latinoamericano al
frente de la empresa petrolera argentina YPF (5), incremento el
crecimiento con toda la rapidez de que fue capaz. Pero no fue
suficiente. YPF estaba invirtiendo US$1.500 millones al ano, pero
en abril pasado la espanola Repsol presento una oferta de
adquisicion de US$13.000 millones, lo que puso fin al sueno de
Monti de crear una multinacional petrolera independiente.
 &HT;    Para las petroleras que estan entre las mayores companias
latinoamericanas cotizadas en bolsa, la baja de los precios del
crudo indica un mal ano. Petrobras, el gigante estatal brasileno,
con US$15.000 millones en ventas, enfrenta tiempos dificiles. El
ano pasado, las ventas y las ganancias bajaron alrededor del 15 por
ciento. Este ano no parece prometedor, dice Mary Bourque, analista
del sector energetico en JP Morgan, quien pronostica una perdida
neta de US$1.300 millones, debido a la devaluacion del real.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RECIEN LLEGADOS
 &HT;    Las empresas electricas brasilenas Light (12) y Eletropaulo
Metropolitana (26) ocuparon altos lugares en la clasificacion
debido a la privatizacion, como ocurrio con las empresas escindidas
de Telebras. Otras empresas que entran por primera vez o que
regresan a la lista de las 100 de Latin Trade son: la distribuidora
electrica brasilena EBE (61), el fabricante mexicano de cemento
Tolmex (67), la firma acerera argentina Siderar (85), el fabricante
de autobuses Grupo Dina (88) y el minorista Puerto de Liverpool
(97), ambos de Mexico.

FRUSTRATED BY MANAGED CARE, MEDICAL ASSOCIATION WILL UNIONIZE
DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Medical Association, whose members viewed
themselves for decades as elite professionals who did not need a
union, voted Wednesday to form a union for doctors in what it
called an effort to level the playing field with powerful managed
care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At a delegates meeting in Chicago, the 290,000-member
association jettisoned its anti-unionization stance because so many
doctors complain of feeling powerless in their dealings with health
maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Several health industry experts said the decision by the AMA,
long a pillar of conservatism, underlined how sweeping the changes
have been in the health-care industry and how frustrated and angry
thousands of doctors have become.
</P>
<P>
   The 152-year-old medical association, which represents 34
percent of the nation's doctors, down from 45 percent a decade ago,
also felt pressure to act because several of the nation's most
powerful unions were already aggressively seeking to unionize
doctors in moves that eroded the AMA's base and made it seem timid
and behind the times in fighting for its members.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the AMA voted to set up a branch that will work to
unionize two groups of doctors _ salaried employees and medical
residents _ which together represent about one-third of the
nation's 620,000 practicing physicians. The association also said
it would work to unionize some of the nation's 325,000
self-employed doctors, but to do that it needs to persuade Congress
to give these doctors the right to bargain collectively.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to reassure patients that the AMA was not forsaking the
Hippocratic oath, the association's leaders insisted Wednesday that
an AMA doctor's union would never strike if it were to jeopardize
patient care. AMA leaders said repeatedly that a major reason for
favoring unionization was to pressure HMP's and hospitals to
improve patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective here is to give America's physicians the
leverage they now lack to guarantee that patient care is not
compromised or neglected for the sake of profits,'' said Dr.
Randolph D. Smoak Jr. chairman of the association's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA envisions trying to set up dozens of union locals for
doctors around the country over the next five years. Industry
experts estimate that nearly 40,000 doctors now belong to unions,
and the AMA is expected to work to significantly increase the
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a major step for an organization that had been
slipping,'' said Dr. Barry Liebowitz, president of the Doctor's
Council, a New York-based union of 2,500 doctors that is the
nation's oldest union of attending physicians. ``The endorsement of
a doctors union by the AMA gives an enormous psychological boost to
the movement to unionize doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   The association approved the unionization measure in a tense and
close vote by show of hands. Association officials said no formal
count was conducted. The debate was so fierce that while the
association's board had recommended against forming a union
affiliate, the association's 494-member House of Delegates rejected
the board's advice in reaction to pro-union rumblings across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   An AMA survey found that 88 percent of doctors favored salaried
physicians organizing to negotiate with hospitals and managed
care-organization.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors in private practice are not allowed to unionize because
federal labor law permits only people described as employees to
unionize. Indeed, when self-employed doctors have sought to
unionize, they faced the threat of antitrust charges of conspiring
in restraint of trade.
</P>
<P>
   In its resolution Wednesday, the AMA vowed to lobby for a
federal antitrust exemption that would enable self-employed doctors
to engage in collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Troy M. Tippett, a delegate from Pensacola, Fla. who voted
against the unionization resolution, said unionization was
inappropriate for professional groups and would only help the
minority of doctors who are considered employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A union is not the answer for medicine,'' said Tippett. ``The
union can do noting to deal with the payers, like insurance
companies. Unions can do something for you only if you're an
employed physician.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, officials
with the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission testified
against granting an antitrust exemption to self-employed doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission continues to believe that such an exemption
would be bad medicine for consumers,'' Robert Pitofsky, the trade
commission's chairman. He argued that with such an exemption,
health-care costs would jump, and consumers would face higher
co-payments and insurance premiums
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission continues to believe that competition among
health care providers and among health plans is an important tool
for controlling costs, providing consumer choice and promoting
innovation and high quality,'' Pitofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The association's president, Nancy W. Dickey, disagreed,
insisting that an AMA-backed union would focus on improving patient
care. Many doctors have complained that managed care organizations
dictate treatment decisions, overload them with paperwork and force
them to see a set number of patients per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients should feel good that the doctors now have another
tool to try to influence insurers and managed-care companies that
have become so large and aggressive that their contracts with
doctors often don't allow doctors to practice the best quality of
medicine,'' Dr. Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   But many health-care experts questioned whether the unionization
move was as altruistic as the doctors suggested. ``I don't really
believe this is being done for patients,'' said Howard Berliner, a
professor of health policy at the New School for Social Research in
New York. ``This is happening because doctors' incomes, doctors'
sense of autonomy are getting killed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   AMA officials took pains to assert that they would be different
from other unions. They said doctors in an AMA union would never
strike _ a vow not taken by most other doctors' unions. And they
also said that unlike traditional unions, an AMA unions would not
focus on mundane matters like pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Several association members said the group was steering a middle
course between conservative older doctors who opposed unionization
and more activist younger doctors, many of whom are salaried.
Forgoing strikes pleases more conservative doctors, as does the
association's talk that it will not drum up support for unions, but
will instead provide unionization help to any members who ask.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, officials at other unions vowed to compete
with the AMA's efforts, asserting, for example, that the AMA would
not be as effective in bargaining because it was taking its biggest
weapon _ striking _ off the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to form an ersatz, quasi labor union that will
not use all the tools available, such as the possibility of
strikes,'' said Robert L. Weinmann, president of the Union of
American Physicians and Dentists, which recently organized 800
doctors working for Los Angeles County.

BILL WOULD LIMIT ACCESS TO CHILDREN'S PERSONAL DATA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Seeking to limit the private collection of personal
data, the Cellucci administration has proposed sweeping legislation
to protect children and give Massachusetts residents greater
control over the distribution of information about them.
</P>
<P>
   Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, who announced details of the
package Wednesday, called the initiative one of the most ambitious
in the country to regulate the ``mind-boggling'' proliferation of
information that businesses clandestinely catalog about consumers
and then sell it to others.
</P>
<P>
   The primary focus of the legislation, Swift said, is
safeguarding the privacy of children. ``We can all do a better job
protecting our children from the threat presented by this powerful
information- and misinformation-gathering technology,'' the
lieutenant governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require data-collection agencies to obtain the
consent of a parent or guardian before obtaining or distributing
information about a child. The agencies also would be required to
provide parents or guardians with copies of the information and the
name of the person to whom the report was sent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal received enthusiastic support from Marc Klass,
whose 12-year-old daughter Polly was abducted and murdered in 1993
in California by a man who obtained her address from a marketing
firm. ``This information is for sale to almost anyone who wants
it,'' Klass said. To obtain the names, addresses, and phone numbers
of ``all blond, blue-eyed girls in a certain ZIP code'' costs only
about $100, Klass cited as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should purge children's names from databases. It's as
simple as that,'' Klass said.
</P>
<P>
   After his daughter's death, a reporter using the name of her
killer was able to obtain a computer printout with the identities,
ages, and addresses of children living in 5,500 households in
Pasadena, Calif. The transaction was conducted over the telephone
and cost the reporter $277.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very frustrated,'' said state consumer affairs
director Daniel A. Grabauskas. ``They're looking for an electronic
version of the `Do Not Disturb' sign.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the child-privacy proposals, the legislation
includes provisions to:
</P>
<P>
   --Provide individuals with access to data about them and require
collectors to notify those people when the information is sold.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit retailers or credit-card companies from collecting or
selling personal information without consent. Consumers also would
have easier opportunities to ``opt out'' of lists held by direct
marketers.
</P>
<P>
   --Restrict the sale or distribution of viewing records by
cable-television companies.
</P>
<P>
   --Prohibit Internet providers from selling or sharing their
customers' personal information or browsing records without
consent.
</P>
<P>
   --Require the posting of company surveillance policies, such as
the specific locations for videotaping employees, monitoring their
phone calls, and recording the number of keyboard strokes per
minute.
</P>
<P>
   --Bar the hiring of inmates by information-collection agencies
for data processing. People on the sex-offender registry also would
be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   --Enact into law the current policy of the Registry of Motor
Vehicles not to sell personal information.
</P>
<P>
   --Bolster the identity-theft law and protect victims by not
allowing unpaid bills resulting from identity theft to appear on
their credit reports.

HIGH COURT VOIDS $1.5 BILLION ASBESTOS SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (see also SCOTUS-STATES-RIGHTS, SCOTUS-DISABILITY-REAX) 
(bl) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court on Wednesday set aside a $1.5
billion landmark settlement that was to have resolved the claims of
as many as 186,000 victims of asbestos poisoning against Fibreboard
Corp., one of the leading makers of products using the
fire-retardant substance.
</P>
<P>
   The justices concluded that the claimants' lawyers had a
possible conflict of interest between getting the most for their
clients and striking a quick deal that would garner huge legal
fees. They also found that the lower court that approved the
agreement that would have sharply limited any other lawsuits
brought against Fibreboard had failed to consider that there was
almost certainly more money available for the claims, particularly
since Fibreboard was only contributing $500,000. (Fibreboard was
sold to Owens Corning two years ago for $515 million.)
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision clarified the standards for class-action
lawsuits and raised the barriers for corporations to turn to the
courts to resolve large and complex product-liability complaints in
issues like tobacco, breast implants and handguns.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, companies in cases involving such products as
cigarettes, orthopedic bone screws, diet pills and pesticides have
tried to limit their liability by striking settlements that
prohibit any current or future claimants from dropping out of the
cases to file their own suits. But Wednesday's decision will make
it far more difficult for defendants to reach such settlements
without either paying top dollar or resorting to bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was also a repudiation of a small group of
plaintiffs' lawyers who had tried to settle the cases facing
Fibreboard, which had managed through skillful negotiation and
legal tactics to structure a deal in which its insurers would have
paid all but $500,000 of the proposed settlement. The $1.535
billion deal at the center of Wednesday's decision was struck in
August 1993, on the eve of an important appeals court hearing, in a
coffee shop in Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both the majority opinion Wednesday by Justice David H. Souter,
and concurring and dissenting opinions by other members of the
court, called upon Congress to find a solution to ``the elephantine
mass of asbestos cases'' and expressed deep frustration with the
procedural rules that have limited the ability of judges to resolve
the asbestos crisis facing state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The final toll of asbestos-related health problems remains
unknown, in large part because illnesses often occur many years
after exposure, although one judicial study concluded that there
may be as many as 265,000 deaths by the year 2015 and many millions
more health problems from exposure to asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The court cases, which have so far been sharply limited in their
ability to resolve hundreds of thousands of cases, have nonetheless
taken many millions of dollars from the companies to pay for
lawyers, money that would otherwise have been used to help victims.
Indeed, the study described in Wednesday's opinions noted that 61
cents of every dollar that would otherwise be available for victims
of asbestos exposure is now going to lawyers and for other
transactional costs.
</P>
<P>
   While the House Judiciary Committee is set to hold hearings next
week on new legislation that would set up an administrative agency
to resolve asbestos claims, opposition from trial lawyers, the
AFL-CIO and some asbestos manufacturers have in the past blocked
the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision, Ortiz vs. Fibreboard Corp., No. 97-1704,
was the second time in two years that the High Court had analyzed
the class-action rules embodied in Rule 23 of the federal Rules of
Civil Procedure to strike down a major asbestos settlement. In
1997, the justices threw out a $1.3 billion class action settlement
that had been reached by 20 large asbestos makers.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Amchem Products vs. Windsor, the court concluded
that the asbestos victims had interests that were too diverse to be
represented in a single class-action lawsuit. The justices also
found a serious conflict in the way the settlement treated current
asbestos victims and those whose exposure to asbestos had not yet
manifested serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after handing down the Amchem decision, the justices
asked a federal appeals court in Texas to apply its principles in
reconsidering the $1.5 billion settlement in the Fibreboard case.
In contrast to the Amchem settlement, the Fibreboard settlement was
binding on all current and future claimants against the company on
the theory that there was a highly limited amount of money that was
available to Fibreboard.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of these differences, the appeals court appeared
to make short shrift of the Supreme Court's decision in the Amchem
case, affirming the Fibreboard settlement in a five paragraph
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But in asking the High Court to reverse the appeals court,
Professor Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School began his brief with
the rather unorthodox style. ``Some people just can't take a
hint,'' he wrote of the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, which
had appeared to largely ignore the 1997 case.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the majority of the Supreme Court agreed. Souter's
opinion was laced with criticisms of the reasoning of the appeals
court and district court that had approved the settlement. The
justices faulted the lower courts for failing to undertake an
independent evaluation of the potential insurance funds available,
simply accepting the settlement terms at face value. While a
proposed settlement might ordinarily be good evidence of the amount
of money available for claims, the court said, the potentially huge
fees for the plaintiffs' lawyers may have unfairly tainted the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a strictly rational world, plaintiffs' counsel would always
press for the limit of what the defense would pay,'' the court
wrote. ``But with an already enormous fee within counsel's grasp,
zeal for the client may relax sooner than it would in a case
brought on behalf of one claimant.''
</P>
<P>
   The court concluded that the proposed settlement's distribution
scheme was unfair and that it had unfairly excluded too many
asbestos victims. The Justices also said that by only giving up
$500,000, Fibreboard had failed to supply enough money to justify
the requirement that no claimants may opt-out of the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by
Justice John Paul Stevens, maintained that the court should have
given more latitude to district courts to find remedies to resolve
the explosion of asbestos litigation. Breyer also concluded that
the settlement would have made far more money available to the
claimants than they might otherwise get as long as Congress fails
to address the issue.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In the sports shop at the Torrey Pines Gliderport,
on a wind-swept bluff above the Pacific, a stack of curious signs
hang for sale above the racks of brochures on hang-gliding and
parasailing, with the cheery exhortation: ``Buy Me, $19.95.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs are reproductions of a local cultural artifact:
``Swimsuits Optional Beyond This Point. San Diego Muni. Code
56.53.'' When a young tourist bought one with a sheepish grin this
afternoon, he asked for directions to the slender strip of sand
hundreds of feet below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's right down those stairs,'' the clerk said, pointing
toward the ocean. ``But it's not nude anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For as long as anyone can remember, that strip of shoreline,
Black's Beach, has been one of the most famous of the nude beaches
that dot the California coast, drawing free-spirited sun worshipers
from San Diego and around the world to its isolated stretch of hot
black sand and cold, roiling surf. But it has not been a legal nude
beach since 1977, when a local voter referendum narrowly revoked
the landmark 1974 ``clothing optional'' ordinance memorialized in
the souvenir sign. And after this week, if the authorities have
their way, much of it will not be a nude beach in practice, either.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of genial non-enforcement, local officials
decided to crack down on the bare skin in response to recent
complaints about lewd behavior and semipublic sex on some parts of
the 1,200-foot-long city beach, and signs announcing the ban are
going up this week. When a two-week grace period ends, bathers
caught lounging in the buff will be subject to a $135 misdemeanor
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was happening was that grandma and grandpa would be out
tide-pooling with Johnny from Wisconsin, and the kid would look up
and say, ``Oh, Granny!'' said Scott Tillson, chief of staff to City
Councilman Harry Mathis, who represents the La Jolla district and
took the lead in the decision to enforce the existing ban on nudity
after receiving complaints this spring. One complaint had it that a
topless woman was asleep on the beach and woke up to find a man
standing over her fondling himself.
</P>
<P>
   A series of meetings ensued, Tillson said, and officials decided
that the decades-long assumption of ``no harm, no foul'' no longer
prevailed and that tougher enforcement was needed, especially since
nude bathers had begun encroaching into the more populated strip of
beach closest to civilization.
</P>
<P>
   But dedicated nudists will not be entirely out of luck. Black's
Beach is the informal name for what is actually two parks: Torrey
Pines City Beach, on the south end near the Scripps Pier, and
Torrey Pines State Beach, stretching north below the renowned
Torrey Pines Golf Course. Though nudity is not legal on the state
beach, either, it is the most isolated stretch and local officials
say the state lifeguards have told them they have no intention of
changing their longstanding practice of simply looking the other
way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``For years, there have been periodic attempts to enforce the
ban,'' said Lieut. Brant D. Bass of the San Diego City Lifeguard
Service, as he patrolled Black's Beach in his bright orange pickup
truck under a brilliant sky Wednesday. ``But people would blow a
whistle when they saw a state ranger coming, and cover up.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, getting to Black's Beach is no easy feat. There are
gentler descents available at the north and south ends, but the
heart of the beach is accessible only over a rickety path of old
wooden stairs and slats dug into the hillside below the gliderport,
or an even more vertiginous plunge known as the ``goat trail.''
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, unsuspecting hikers mistake one worn ribbon of
dirt or another for a trail, and wind up having to be rescued by
lifeguards and paramedics from a crag along the way. It is a bit of
a thrill, and more than a bit of a workout, to scramble down the
trail, with hang-gliders casting shadows that seem at first like
some leftover pterodactyl on the wing, and even at the base of the
bluff yellow and black signs warn: ``Unstable Cliffs Stay Back!''
</P>
<P>
   Lance Johnson, 28, an aspiring actor, and Darleen Pestana, 25, a
student at San Diego State University, have lived in San Diego most
of their lives, but came to Black's for the first time only last
week. Wednesday, on their second visit, they lay placidly on their
backs in the altogether on a bright blue blanket whose
black-and-gold-flecked mica chips absorb every ray of the broiling
sun. They rolled over discreetly as a reporter approached with pen
and notepad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would just really be too bad if people didn't have a place
like this to go,'' said Johnson, whose perch on the city-controlled
section of the beach will soon be officially off limits. ``It's a
long beach, and most of it is regulated.''
</P>
<P>
   Tillson, the City Council staff member, said that lifeguards
reported fewer problems with disorderly conduct at Black's than at
almost any other San Diego beach, and that nudity had been accepted
at Black's since well before it was officially sanctioned, and then
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, it's been a nonproblem,'' he said, ``and we
expect it will become a nonproblem again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Black's regular, a fit, 40-something man who was wearing
only surfer sunglasses as he strolled along the waterline with a
bucket stretched above his head, declined to give his name or
occupation. But he said he had been coming from his home in
downtown San Diego for seven years, and he acknowledged that there
had been some problems lately with people ``abusing the privilege''
of walking around naked.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added in his best Thoreauvian spirit: ``No doubt about
it, it's a wonderful place. A person who can't get naked and get in
touch with nature can't get in touch with himself.''

   FAME-CONCEPT (Undated) _ Has the concept of fame shifted in the
past decade? Has Andy Warhol's ``everyone will be famous for 15
minutes'' become a cultural cliche? Today the Warholian trajectory
of fame has been reversed: instead of the ordinary becoming famous,
the famous seem to become more ordinary, more like us. In
entertainment, politics and social mores, the high and mighty are
tumbling all around us, or so true celebrities would have us think.

   ORFEU-FILM (Rio De Janeiro, Brazil) _ Even before he emerged as
a torchbearer of the Cinema Novo movement here in the 1960s, the
director Carlos ``Caca'' Diegues yearned to film the myth of
Orpheus and Eurydice. Over the years, he admits, as he was working
on the 13 movies on his resume, including ``Bye-Bye Brazil'' and
``Xica da Silva,'' images of what a Brazilian version of the myth
would look and sound like constantly filled his imagination. Now,
after more than 40 years of dreams, delays and dashed hopes, his
persistence has paid off: ``Orfeu'' is showing in Brazilian
theaters and may be released later by Warner Bros. in the United
States. By Larry Rohter. (Moved). &QL;

   HAUNTING-FILM (Nicasio, Calif.) _ ``The Haunting,'' directed by
Jan De Bont, is the second film adaptation of Shirley Jackson's
novel ``The Haunting of Hill House''(Robert Wise directed a 1963
version), and once again Hill House is meant to sound as
frightening as it looks. From its eerie opening scenes, ``The
Haunting,'' set to open on July 23, is layered with the sounds of
inhuman conversations _ between wood and air, between stone and
glass, and between an evil entity and its tormented victims. By

Angeles. Brecht's drama, a parable about the rise of the Nazis,
thinly disguised as Mafiosi and gang members (the characters Giri

successful 1995 production by the company's director Heiner Muller
who died that same year. By Anne Midgette. (Moved). &QL;

<P>
   SEX-THEATER (Undated) _ Sex may mean a great deal in our lives.
But somehow it doesn't count for very much in our drama. No, I have
not forgotten about the stacks and stacks of plays whose plots turn
on romance, or on adultery or incest, or the newer ones that work
gay or feminist changes on these well-worn themes. Western theater
is peopled with distinctly sexual characters: Oedipus, Gertrude,
Camille, Willy Loman. But the plays they appear in are not
primarily about sex. Plays _ serious mainstream works by serious
writers that shed light on the role of sex in the human drama _ are
actually few and far between. By Sylviane Gold. (Moved). Photo.

Company. His partnership with Jones produced the paradigmatic
post-modern repertory of the 1980s, but after his death from AIDS
in 1988 and the notoriety of Jones's subsequent career, Zane faded
into a shadow legend, invoked less as artistic innovator than
tragic hero. Paradoxically, it is an exhibition of Zane's
photography _ a solo pursuit predating his entry into dance via
Jones _ that promises to revive Zane the choreographer. By Ann

thought of himself as a Ukrainian, and who spent most of his life
trying to forget he ever saw the place. Bortniansky wrote
``Alcide'' to an Italian text by the great librettist Pietro
Metastasio during his apprentice years in Bologna, where he was
studying at the expense of the German-born, French-speaking Russian
Empress Catherine the Great. Performed in Venice (once only) in
1778, when the composer was 27, the score now rests in the British

LEUKOSITE ACQUIRES PROSCRIPT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LeukoSite Inc., seeking to expand its pipeline of promising
drugs, Wednesday said it acquired ProScript Inc., a privately held
biotechnology company with an anticancer compound in early clinical
trials, for $2.3 million in LeukoSite stock plus $430,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase comes nearly 4 1/2 months after LeukoSite completed
the $14.5 million cash purchase of CytoMed Inc., a struggling
biotechnology company with two drugs in clinical trials. All three
firms are based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``With ProScript, we are getting a group of first-rate
scientists along with two late-stage compounds and great drug
discovery platform for future drugs all at a bargain price,'' said
Augustine Lawlor, LeukoSite chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ProScript, a 7-year-old company, has struggled in recent years
with a spate of top management changes and difficulty raising
additional funding for human clinical testing of its drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has also downsized its operations from 42
people earlier this year to about 25, has a research collaboration
with Hoechst Marion Roussel Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that this acquisition offers significant scientific
and business synergies for the future,'' said Dan Burns, president
of ProScript, who is leaving the company.
</P>
<P>
   For LeukoSite, which last week announced positive results from
its pivotal 93-patient clinical trial for an injectable drug,
called Campath, to treat the most prevalent form of adult leukemia,
the ProScript acquisition will enable the company to expand its
cancer-fighting drug treatments. ProScript's proposed drug, called
PS-341, is a new class of antitumor chemotherapeutic agents.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, LeukoSite said it will raise $14.4 million in a
private placement of 1.5 million unregistered shares of LeukoSite
common stock with HealthCare Ventures LLC, already the company's
largest shareholder and Perseus Capital LLC, a recent investor.
With the sale of the new shares, HealthCare will own 20 percent of
Leukosite while Perseus will have a 7 percent ownership, said
Lawlor. Both transactions, which the company self-managed, are
expected to close in July.
</P>
<P>
   LeukoSite shares closed at 11 1/2, up 1/2.

HINGIS RUNS HOME TO TAKE A BREAK FROM HER `GREAT LIFE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Home is where her mother is, so that's
where a despondent Martina Hingis flew Wednesday, a day after
becoming just the third top-seeded woman ever to dissolve in
Wimbledon's opening round. And where the 18-year-old Swiss star
went, soap opera-ish rumors followed:
</P>
<P>
   Are she and her mother, Melanie Molitor, on the outs because
Hingis has put her dalliance with Swiss player Ivo Heuberger ahead
of her practice regimen? Or because Molitor has expressed an
interest in opening a coaching stable and making Jelena Dokic, the
129th-ranked qualifier who trounced her daughter here, her first
nonfamily client?
</P>
<P>
   Has Hingis, a player who made all the right moves on the court
and off, and earned three Grand Slam titles and the No. 1 ranking
at age 16, reached the end of her idyll at 18? Have her family ties
frazzled and has her multimillion dollar shoe-and-clothing deal
with Tacchini dissolved without a replacement in sight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to take a break and recover again; it has been a great
life so far, but I just probably need a break,'' Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the teen-ager blamed a heel injury for her abrupt
withdrawal from doubles with Anna Kournikova, the player she had
hand-picked to replace Jana Novotna after dismissing Novotna,
Wimbledon's defending singles and doubles champion, as too old and
slow. But against Dokic on Tuesday, it was Hingis who looked
sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after behaving like a brat and self-destructing to a
chorus of Gallic boos in her French Open final against Steffi Graf,
Hingis seemed to wear a straitjacket during her 6-2, 6-0 loss to
the 16-year-old Dokic, a Grand Slam debutante. Their meeting had an
eerie symmetry: Dokic was the youngest player in the draw and
patterned her game on that of Hingis, who at 16 became the
century's youngest Wimbledon champion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid to alienate the crowd the way she had in Paris, Hingis
accepted her defeat here passively, and later disclosed this was
probably the loneliest loss of her career because it came on the
heels of her decision to take a breather from her omnipresent
mother. A desire for mutual independence, Hingis said, was the
reason for their split, which she termed a private-life issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dokic, who practiced with Hingis at her home in Trubbach,
Switzerland, before the French Open and had been invited by Molitor
to train at their new home at the Saddlebrook resort near Tampa,
Fla., said she blocked any feelings of sympathy for Hingis. ``I try
not to think about that,'' Dokic said.
</P>
<P>
   But several other players, including Kournikova, sounded in on
Hingis' miseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got to do what she's got to do,'' said Kournikova, who
reached the third round with a 7-5, 6-4 defeat of Maria Vento
Wednesday. ``There's a lot of everything on us, and when you lose,
especially in the first round of a Grand Slam, you feel like you
lost everything. But I'm sure she'll come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Capriati, disheartened by a 6-1, 6-3 loss to
126th-ranked Seda Noorlander, said onlookers shouldn't be so quick
to turn Hingis' troubles into tragedies. ``It's like when they're
on top and everything's great, it's great,'' said Capriati, who was
a Grand Slam semifinalist at 15 and on the ropes at 18. ``But as
soon as there's one little thing that shows a little imperfection,
the vultures can't wait to knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, a longtime Saddlebrook resident who practiced there
with Hingis this spring, added, ``My advice would be to block out
all the press and negativity and not let that control the way she
feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hingis and her mother are contractually committed to
their move to Saddlebrook, where the player purchased a $500,000
home, there has been no arrangement made yet with the Dokic family.
Kevin O'Connor, the resort's marketing director, said any
invitation to Dokic would very likely exclude her father, Damir,
who was expelled from the Edgbaston tournament two weeks ago for
verbally abusing line judges and being arrested on a drunk and
disorderly charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the agreement between Martina, her mother, and Jelena Dokic
is still in place, then I would expect to see her at Saddlebrook,
but after what happened here, I'm not sure what the plans are,''
said O'Connor, who maintained that the split between Hingis and
Molitor is more rite-of-passage than rift. ``They made that
decision outside of tennis, and made it knowing what the
consequences might be here. The mother is completely willing to let
Martina try new scenarios if that's what she wants to do; that's
the kind of confidence she has in her. They know there'll be other
Wimbledons.'' &QL;

U.S. AND NORTH KOREA MEET ON SUSPECTED NUCLEAR ARMS SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ An American envoy met with high-level North Korean
officials here Wednesday to report on the United States' recent
inspection of a suspected nuclear-weapons complex in North Korea
and to lay the ground for more talks later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection, which occurred in May, found no evidence that
the site was being used to produce weapons.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials here stressed that the talks between the
American envoy, Charles Kartman, and Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye
Gwan were unrelated to the increasing tension between North and
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   A skirmish in the Yellow Sea last week resulted in the sinking
of a North Korean torpedo boat and the deaths of at least 20 North
Korean sailors.
</P>
<P>
   That battle has overshadowed and perhaps scuttled talks between
North and South Korea that started in Beijing this week. The two
sides met for just 90 minutes on Tuesday before the talks broke
down, with North Korea demanding an apology for the skirmish. Both
sides insist that the other fired first.
</P>
<P>
   No talks between the Koreas took place Wednesday, and South
Korean delegates said they were waiting for a phone call from the
North on when the talks could resume.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the U.S.-North Korean meeting seemed positively
cordial. While the American delegation did not comment, Kim told
reporters that he was ``ready to talk about any issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The American inspection team's conclusion that the North Korean
complex at Kumchangri was not making nuclear weapons has cleared a
significant obstacle to improving relations with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a 1994 agreement, a consortium of nations is
providing the impoverished country with fuel and power plants in
exchange for its pledge to freeze its nuclear programs.
</P>
<P>
   That as well as a host of other issues relating to a peace
settlement for the Korean peninsula will be up for discussion at
talks involving the two Koreas, China and the United States,
scheduled to be held in Geneva, probably later this year.  &QL;

WITH WAR OVER, CLINTON RENEWS FIGHT FOR HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Washington Memo) 
(rm) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the conflict in Kosovo more or less behind him
and impeachment a fading memory, President Clinton is eager to
reassert himself in the familiar realms of domestic policy and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides described the president, who returned from a
weeklong trip to Europe early Wednesday, as eager to shed the
unaccustomed mantle of wartime commander and to devote his full
energies over the next several weeks to what he truly loves:
verbally punishing Republicans over domestic policy matters like
gun control and health care.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of war and scandal, Clinton has had
little space lately in which to exercise his powers of public
persuasion on domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   But starting on Friday with an address to a group of
presidential scholars, Clinton hopes to focus public attention on a
long list of pent-up proposals, from an increase in the minimum
wage to tax credits for poor neighborhoods. As his tenure in office
winds down, the president is returning to more traditional
Democratic themes that he had until now largely muted in an effort
to fashion a third way between the orthodoxies of the dominant
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, the decks are clear for
resetting the agenda and defining the universe of the possible,''
said Joel Johnson, the newly appointed senior adviser to the
president for policy and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three weeks, Clinton plans to unveil a Medicare
proposal with a popular new prescription drug benefit and to travel
the country recycling a number of tax-cut proposals and spending
initiatives from his State of the Union message in January.
Presidential aides expressed hope that the Republican-run Congress
will enact some of Clinton's proposals, but they seem perfectly
content to use legislative gridlock as a weapon of partisan
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also be trying to advance the political ambitions
of his wife and his vice president, as well as raising millions of
dollars to help Democrats regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant initiatives that the president will push in
coming weeks are a plan to try to ensure the long-term solvency of
Medicare and proposals to bring private sector investment to the
nation's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between promotion of those policies will be several
fund-raising forays, visits with leaders from South Korea, Egypt
and Israel, announcement of the removal of the bald eagle from the
list of threatened species and an undetermined number of photo
opportunities to attack Republicans for quashing a gun-control bill
in the House and for bottling up new regulations governing health
maintenance organizations in the Senate. The White House sees those
as hanging curve balls that Clinton intends to swat out of the
political park _ repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton proposed setting
aside 15 percent of anticipated federal budget surpluses over the
next decade to shore up Medicare, the government health plan for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has delayed release of its plan as it
struggles to reconcile competing political and financial interests
behind one of the most popular programs of guaranteed benefits to
all who qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is set to release his plan next Tuesday, meeting his
self-imposed deadline of the end of June by one day. Aides were
stingy with details, saying the president had not yet approved the
final provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a universal, affordable benefit that will ask
Medicare beneficiaries to pay a modest premium for benefits that
are substantially better,'' John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The ``modest premium'' is a monthly cost that Medicare
beneficiaries will be asked to pay for prescription drug coverage,
expected to fall somewhere between $20 and $90 a month, with a
partial subsidy for the poorest recipients. But Podesta would not
be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit seems popular with the elderly and abhorred by
the pharmaceutical industry, which sees it as a wedge for
government price controls. It is certain to set off a ferocious
fight on Capitol Hill that will almost certainly continue well into
the 2000 campaigns for Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, eyeing his legacy, will spend four days in early July
touring depressed regions of the country, traveling from eastern
Kentucky to the Mississippi Delta to a South Dakota Indian
reservation to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. The trip
comes late in his second term because Clinton has not been willing
before now to draw attention to the pockets of poverty that belie
the nation's general prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the president's anti-poverty plan is to inspire
private businesses to increase investment in what the president
likes to call ``untapped markets'' within the borders of the United
States. He has proposed a set of tax initiatives to help companies
open businesses in depressed areas and bring the fruits of the
economic expansion to the regions it passed by.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A subtext of those visits is the nation's continuing racial
friction and the uneven economic performance of minorities in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real reflection of how the president looks at the
world,'' Podesta said. ``He wants to use the mechanism of
government to encourage partnership with the private sector to
spread the benefits of the great economy we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said these programs, modeled on federal programs to spur
private investment in less-developed nations overseas, attract
bipartisan support and have a chance to win passage in the current
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Podesta also said that the president intended in coming weeks to
redeem some promises from the State of the Union and other
policy-setting speeches. Among them are a planned lawsuit against
tobacco companies to recover billions of dollars in federal health
care costs related to smoking, proposed tax credits for child care
and medical costs arising from long-term illnesses and a $5 billion
program to finance school construction.

gaffe under stress or lose his voice or suffer an unexpected
malady. The smug linearists may be panicked by a grass-roots
emergence of a Fresh Face. Lovers of real contests will focus on
erosion of Gorebush leads and on exciting gains by John McBradley.
</P>
<P>
   But let us assume, arguendo, that conventional wisdom takes us
right through the conventions. This assumes that the old saying of
jockeys at a muddy track is true, and ``front-runners stay clean.''
</P>
<P>
   How would these non-races within each party affect our party
politics and our near-term governance?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Gorebush Era. Back when primary campaigns decided
nominations, the adage was: Lean toward the party partisans in the
primaries, then swing back toward the middle in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that differences between liberals and conservatives
were front and center until the nominees emerged. The dedicated
dominated, and the far left and far right got in their licks _
extracting promises that, when broken, at least caused
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   But during Gorebush, the race is to the swiftest to the center.
Gore is untroubled by the whining of the lefties who want to bust
the budget, and Bush is serene at the yammering of the righties who
wave litmus paper in his face. This is good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   What is good is that it frees the nominees from having to make
deals with extremists. What's bad is that it fuzzes up legitimate
debate about ideology and leaves the electorate with a choice
between personalities and campaign styles.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Michigan, we see a state that will not decide either
party's nomination but is one of the battleground states that could
decide the election. Bush is here Thursday and Gore will be here
(third time in a month) Friday. They're raising money, but the
strategy of both is to treat this as a swing state in the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is wooing the auto industry with assurances that emission
control is good for jobs. Bush is wooing Hispanics by speaking
Spanish to them, and I don't know what he's promising. Gov. John
Engler may be behind Bob Dole, John McCain and Colin Powell on the
Bush V.P. list, but can taste White House chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the emphasis is on the endgame nearly 18 months
from now, not so much the primary election here next February. The
-media's question is not ``Who will win the Michigan primary?'' but
this self-hating prophecy: ``Which of the likely primary winners
will win bigger than the other, auguring victory in the general
election?''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the significance of the Gore-bush Era, stretching from
now all the way to Jan. 20, 2001, and what it will do to
governance, the favorite word of political scientists, except for
``polity'':
</P>
<P>
   _It marks the unofficial end of the Clinton Era. (Eras, in my
neat world, cannot overlap.) Pictures of the Clintons in full
battle gear talking to troops and commiserating with refugees in
Kosovo mark the beginning of their New York campaign. That makes
sense for them, because the torch has just been passed to
Gore-bush, the 18-month successor.
</P>
<P>
   _Anything Bill Clinton does now is seen as a function of how it
helps or hurts Gore. Anything the First Candidate, Hillary Clinton,
does in New York will be seen in the light of how it subtracts
money and attention from Gore and helps Bush. Together they are now
running a major state campaign, not a major nation.
</P>
<P>
   _That makes Gorebush the effective president. Congress knows it,
deferring to the new, dual loci of power. The ambassadors to
Washington and the foreign press corps know it, abandoning Samuel
Berger for Gore's Leon Fuerth and Bush's Condoleezza Rice, or
Fuerthrice.
</P>
<P>
   Is this interminable interregnum a good thing for our polity?
(Got it in.) I'm not comfortable with the temporary coalition. I'd
rather see an elected president stick to his last, and watch a
couple of good prelims before the Main Event.

MCHALE TAKES HALL NOMINATION IN STRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kevin McHale wanted Wednesday's sessions with reporters delayed
until late afternoon. He had a tee time, after all, and, as he put
it, ``a guy has to have some fun in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   McHale never lost sight of that philosophy in his 12 years as a
Celtic, a career which was recognized Wednesday with the
announcement of his election to the basketball Hall of Fame. He
constantly looked for the fun in the game and generally found it,
winning three titles in Boston and earning a reputation as one of
the premier power forwards in NBA history.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost feel embarrassed being honored for something you
enjoyed doing so much,'' he told reporters in a conference call.
``You want to thank them. You want to say, `Thank you for allowing
me to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   McHale was one of five announced Wednesday as members of the
Hall's Class of '99. Joining him will be John Thompson, Wayne
Embry, the late Fred Zollner, and Billie Moore. Thompson and Embry
both played briefly in Boston as Bill Russell's backups while
Zollner was an early owner of the Pistons and Moore a successful
women's coach at UCLA and Cal. St.-Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   They will be inducted Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Missing again, for the third time, was McHale's Boston teammate
Dennis Johnson, who said from his home in Florida, ``I just didn't
make it. People don't make it. I'm one of those people. Would it
have been an honor? Sure. But it's not going to stop me in my
quest. I'll just sit and wait until the next time.'' Added McHale,
who frequently praised his Boston teammates for his success, ``It
would have been special to go in with DJ. I think he'll get in. I
wish it was this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Among others coming up short were Maurice Cheeks, Sidney
Moncrief, Jo Jo White, and Chet Walker.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, now the basketball operations chief of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, knew of his selection earlier in the week; it was
hardly a shock. But Wednesday was the only day he could do a
conference call and he asked the Timberwolves to delay two sessions
with reporters until late in the day because of a golf date with
Minnesota assistant coach Jerry Sichting. He is scheduled Friday to
go away with the coaching staff on a ``draft retreat.'' The
Timberwolves have two first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   McHale said he had not decided whom he would choose to present
him at the induction ceremony; an inductee gets to name two
presenters, one of whom must be in the Hall of Fame. He also said,
unconvincingly, that he hadn't really given the Hall of Fame all
that much thought, even though he was a lock to make it and had
been named as one of the top 50 players of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more special to me because it's reflective of the teams I
played on and the players I played with,'' he said. ``I was a
product of being allowed to play with other tremendous players. The
success we had as a team is the reason I was elected to the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics won a title in McHale's rookie season, 1980-81.
Boston acquired him with the third pick of the 1980 draft after the
Golden State Warriors took Joe Barry Carroll and the Utah Jazz
selected Darrell Griffith. The Celtics also got Robert Parish in a
trade the day before the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, that's as much fun as I ever had playing
basketball,'' he said, mentioning teammates Tiny Archibald, Larry
Bird, M.L. Carr, and Chris Ford. ``Those guys were phenomenal. . .
. This is as much for my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, of course, made his professional name as the head
coach at Georgetown, but he backed up Russell for 74 games over two
seasons in the mid-1960s. Embry, an executive with the Cavaliers,
backed up Russell for the 1969 season, during which Johnny Most
gave him the nickname, ``Wayne the Wall.'' That makes 28 members of
the Hall of Fame with ties to the Celtics, although some (Pete
Maravich, Dave Bing) are fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   McHale was anything but. He spent his entire, 12-year career in
Boston, often played for less than the going wage because he
enjoyed it there, and was often lost in Bird's considerable shadow.
He said Wednesday that was never a problem with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the better basketball player,'' McHale said of Bird.
``Everyone knew Larry was the leader. I didn't think I was taking a
back seat to him. We were teammates. He did things to help me. I
did things to help him.''

SCRIPTING ALTERNATE SCENARIOS ON THE FUTURE OF BIOTECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mass., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Whether he is writing books, lecturing at
universities or lobbying regulators and politicians, Jeremy Rifkin
never misses a chance to argue that the biotechnology industry is
leading the world toward environmental and social disaster. If he
thinks it will help slow the industry down, he is quick to file
lawsuits and promote boycotts or moratoriums.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the activist who was once described by critics as
the ``abominable no-man'' took on another role. Intrigued by an
invitation to an industry meeting at one of biotechnology's inner
sanctums, he happily trekked to the headquarters of Monsanto Co.
here to offer up his vision of the future. ``I've never been to a
meeting like this in the 23 years I've been talking about these
issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not Monsanto's idea to seek his input, as the company was
quick to tell anyone who asked. The 54-year-old Rifkin was called
in by Ulrich Goluke, a consultant hired by Monsanto and 13 members
of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, to help
them paint a portrait of the biotechnology landscape of the year
2030 and how it evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, known as story building or more formally as
scenario creation, is a specialized form of crystal-ball gazing
that big corporations in the United States and abroad are
increasingly turning to as an early warning system for how their
strategies could go astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every child knows you get the really big issues across with
stories,'' Goluke said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to more common corporate planning tools like
forecasting, story building typically results in two to four
contrasting visions of the future. Each turns on assumptions about
public reactions to political surprises, industrial accidents or
social disruptions that never show up in today's spreadsheets and
five-year business plans. Outside participants like Rifkin, who was
reimbursed for his expenses but received no compensation, are known
as provocateurs by those designing the projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our aim is to think the unthinkable and speak the unspeakable,
not to say what we think will or should happen,'' said Patricia
Solaro, a public affairs executive from Hoechst AG of Germany, who
attended the four-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Scenario creation was originally developed for the federal
government in 1950s at the Rand Corp. to study how nuclear wars
might start. It was popularized as a business tool by Shell Oil in
the 1970s. Shell's planners, armed with descriptions of how
consumers and countries might react to oil shortages, for example,
were better equipped than many of their competitors to deal with
the shock of the oil crisis of 1973 and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology companies see plenty of reason to worry about
unpredictable setbacks these days. While genetically engineered
crops like soybeans and corn and a number of drugs have been
commercial hits, critics are stepping up their efforts to portray
the advances as fraught with threats to human health and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, they seized on a report suggesting that the
monarch butterfly caterpillars and some beneficial insects might be
much more vulnerable to a natural pesticide produced by genetically
engineered corn than the industry had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   And food scares in Europe over ``mad cow's disease,'' dioxin and
Coke, though unrelated to biotechnology, have fanned consumer
worries about food purity and given a boost to the organic-food
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a crisis of confidence in the industry. The
companies still believe in the promise of the technology but now
wonder whether they will be able to convince regulators and the
public that the benefits outweigh the risks.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting here was a follow-up to a session in April at
Hoechst's headquarters in Frankfurt. Participants included not just
biotechnology giants like Monsanto, DuPont and Novartis, but also
newcomers like International Paper and Norsk Hydro, as well as
Zurich Financial Group and Swiss Re from the insurance sector and
the consumer products heavyweights Procter &AMP; Gamble and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios being developed will not be finished before the
end of this summer. The job of polishing them into compelling
narratives of about two pages has been handed to Betty S. Flowers,
a University of Texas poetry and literature professor.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Flowers, who studied with Joseph Campbell, the noted
authority on myths and stories, is highly sought after in scenario
circles for her ability to shape the jargon of engineers and
executives into crisp, easy-to-recall narratives that highlight
turning points in each vision.
</P>
<P>
   The companies meeting here turned down a reporter's request to
sit in on the discussions, but Goluke, Mrs. Flowers and several
other participants shared some of their impressions afterward.
Three basic stories are being developed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the first, none of the critics' warnings about health and
environmental hazards prove warranted and biotechnology products
gain widespread acceptance. It is not a happily-ever-after story
for the companies, though, because success brings wide-ranging
consequences and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario may include examples of the social and political
impact of large numbers of people living past the age of 100, like
pressures to divert public spending and product development to the
needs of the elderly. Some biotechnology products in the story
might become unprofitable because they become so widespread that
they turn into low-margin commodities.
</P>
<P>
   A second scenario is likely to reflect chaos theory, which holds
that complex systems can be changed radically by tiny disruptions
that have dramatic ripple effects. This story might turn on an
event like publication of a small research report attributing an
environmental setback to genetically engineered crops. This in turn
could kick off a string of public reactions leading to drastic
regulations that stifle many biotechnology applications. A
presidential candidate who is courting environmentalists could be
cast as the leader of the anti-biotech charge.
</P>
<P>
   One plot twist to this story proposed in last week's conference
was to make the perceived threat to the environment the result of
faulty research. The lesson for the industry: the same science that
serves you so well can trip you up in the hands of critics.
</P>
<P>
   In the third story, which might be summarized as ``thanks but no
thanks,'' consumers and financial markets decide that most
biotechnology applications simply are not as appealing as the
alternatives. Insurers balk at liability risks and investors flee
the industry's meager returns. Agricultural biotechnology markets
shrink as farmers and consumers embrace organic food. Biotechnology
becomes a tool to improve breeding techniques rather than to move
genes among different species.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, health care companies conclude there is
limited profit in engineering new drugs and in harvesting organs
for transplants in humans from genetically engineered animals.
Instead, they use their expertise to analyze people's vulnerability
to certain diseases and then reap profits from advising people how
to avoid getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   The practical value of creating such stories is hard to prove.
Skeptics say it is so speculative as to be almost meaningless. Some
say scenarios are most useful if they focus on near-in challenges,
such as what happens if a big contract goes to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that they become a core part of the internal
decision-making process, which tends to end up looking at things
like return on investment,'' said Kevin Coyne, a consultant at
McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents argue that, unlike forecasts, well-designed
stories of the future can alert business and political leaders to
warning signs they might otherwise miss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are working on things that take 10 to 15 years to
develop, you want to think about what the public policy environment
will be when those investments are supposed to pay off,'' said
Thomas Jorling, a senior policy executive at International Paper
Co. who attended the Monsanto talks.
</P>
<P>
   The World Business Council, the Geneva-based coalition of 125
multinationals that organized the Monsanto conference, is a major
forum for corporate story-building. It currently has other scenario
groups looking at energy and electronics. General Motors Corp. is
leading 25 companies in a council project focused on sustainable
growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other consulting firms are marketing similar projects. Global
Business Network, a scenario specialist based in Emeryville,
Calif., and the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young are currently
recruiting participants for a biotechnology scenario project
looking out just 10 years. Monsanto, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. and Cargill
Inc. are among the early sponsors, according to Peter Schwartz, the
chairman of Global Business.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Consulting in Boston specializes in scenario work for
information-technology companies. Cambridge Energy Research
Associates in Cambridge, Mass., is known for energy and political
scenarios, like its look at Russia in 2010. The Institute for the
Future, based in Menlo Park, Calif., pioneered such work for
nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin said he found the process fascinating but was unsure what
to make of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say I was really impressed by the ability of the
people here to put aside their assumptions,'' he said. But he did
not expect it to signal the end of his battles with the industry or
bury their mutual scorn.
</P>
<P>
   As he headed off to Washington, where he is president of the
Foundation on Economic Trends, Rifkin predicted that the ``thanks
but no thanks'' story of biotechnology's decline was closest to the
mark and that most of the biotechnology giants in the group that
met here would fail to adapt in time to avoid being pushed aside by
nimble upstarts.

 &HT;    Web still big news in mainline magazines
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet has spawned a host of specialized
business publications, but still, the Web continues to dominate the
covers of traditional magazines. The latest batch is a case in
point, with cover stories on ``Internet anxiety'' in Business Week
(June 28), ``a 300 year plan for the Internet'' in Forbes (July 5),
and ``I got my job online and soon you will too,'' in Fortune (July
5).
</P>
<P>
   Business Week explores the way traditional corporations are
responding to ``a radically new business model'' based on the
computer and finds that reactions are ``part envy, part fear and
part resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like this: ``You're Merrill Lynch when Schwab.com comes
along. You're Barnes &AMP; Noble when Amazon.com hits big. You're Toys
``R'' Us when eToys shows up.''
</P>
<P>
   With these upstarts building huge war chests of capital in
record time, Business Week says old-line rivals ``are furiously
mapping out survival strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, venture capitalist Masayoshi Son, 41-year-old founder
and president of Softbank Corp., has not only created an Internet
empire, ``he's just getting started on what he calls a 300-year
business plan,'' says Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the long view characteristic of his culture, he told
Forbes the Internet will eventually expand its reach ``and Web
stocks will go only one direction _ up.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes, Son's deal-making has carved out a bigger
chunk of the Internet economy than Bill Gates of Microsoft or Jerry
Yang of Yahoo!, having invested $1.7 billion in more than 100
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>

   Most people invest in stocks via mutual funds, which spread the

   Mutual Funds (July) magazine discusses strategies and funds it
says ``could yield a 100 percent return on your investment in five

</P>

   Among the strategies are using sector funds, which invest in one
industry group, such as health care; focus funds, which limit
holdings to a small number of high-growth stocks; and chameleon

   Individual Investor (July) says it's time to rethink some of the

<P>
   Everybody is told, for example, that past performance is no

investing, ``past performance predicts a lot more than we ever
suspected,'' the magazine says.

SPLIT HIGH COURT ENHANCES STATES' RIGHTS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bitterly divided Supreme Court on Wednesday shut
the courthouse door on most people and companies seeking to recover
money from states they believe have violated their federally
protected rights.
</P>
<P>
   In three 5-4 decisions, the high court struck down federal laws
that give individuals and businesses the right to sue states for
money damages.
</P>
<P>
   Splitting sharply along ideological lines, the court said the
Constitution's 11th Amendment grants states ``sovereign immunity''
from facing such lawsuits in state and federal courts. The only
exception to this legal protection occurs in the limited number of
cases when states waive their right to immunity or are being sued
for denying an individual or a company ``equal protection'' or
``due process'' under the law, rights the 14th Amendment reserves
to individuals and businesses, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices assailed the majority for misreading the
Constitution and said the ruling will allow states to thwart
congressional efforts to protect people and businesses from
governmental abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Police Organizations, echoing the
dissenters, expressed concern that the decisions will allow states
to circumvent federal laws, such as those that protect the rights
of civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the court's decisions Wednesday, the justices held
that Maine probation officers could not sue the state in federal or
local court to recover overtime pay guaranteed under the federal
Fair Labor Standards Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the Supreme Court is willing to sacrifice the officers'
rights on the altar of a glorified and exalted version of state's
rights,'' said Robert Scully, NAPO's executive director. ``The
ability of states to nullify federal laws by refusing to enforce
them, an issue prior to the Civil War and during desegregation in
the 1950s and 1960s, is once again at the forefront.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor and Clarence Thomas formed
the slim majority in the three cases. They said the protection of
states from lawsuits in federal and local courts is deeply rooted
in the American system of federalism, which calls for a central,
national government and 50 semi-autonomous state governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the court's liberal wing dissented, accusing the majority of
validating the outdated and constitutionally suspect doctrine of
sovereign immunity that was designed to protect kings, not states,
from being sued in their own courts.
</P>
<P>
   The majority's steadfast preservation of the immunity means that
many people and companies with valid federal claims for monetary
relief from states now have nowhere to turn, said dissenting
Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Stephen G. Breyer and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kennedy, writing for the majority in the Maine case,
said congressional efforts to allow citizens to hold states
accountable for violations of most federally protected rights are
unconstitutional and undermine the separation between federal
authority and state sovereignty that the Constitution's framers
carefully crafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Congress legislates in matters affecting the states, it
may not treat these sovereign entities as mere prefectures or
corporations,'' Kennedy wrote. ``Congress must accord states the
esteem due them as joint participants in a federal system, one
beginning with the premise of sovereignty in both the central
government and the separate states. Congress has ample means to
ensure compliance with valid federal laws, but it must respect the
sovereignty of the states.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the Supreme Court blocked a bank's effort to
bring a federal false-advertising claim against a state-run board
in Florida that administers an advance college payment plan. In the
third case, the same bank, College Savings Bank, sued the Florida
board for patent infringement.
</P>
<P>
   College Savings Bank, which provides similar services on a
national basis, had argued in vain that Florida had waived its
sovereign immunity by abandoning its governing role and engaging in
the federally regulated business of collecting and dispensing funds
to college students.
</P>
<P>
   In the third case, College Savings also argued that the Florida
Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board had violated the 14th
Amendment's due process clause by copying the bank's patented
CollegeSure CD, essentially an annuity contract for financing
college tuitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia, writing for the majority in the false-advertising
case, said a state does not forfeit its constitutional right of
immunity when it chooses to engage in a business, even one heavily
regulated by the federal government. Rehnquist, in a separate
majority opinion, rejected the 14th Amendment claim, saying the
constitutional provision does not apply to patents.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenters Souter, Breyer and Stevens each took the
extraordinary step of reading significant portions of their
objections from the bench, a gesture the justices reserve for
themselves when they have deep philosophical disagreements with the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Souter assailed the court for holding fast to an antiquated
legal safeguard that protects states from having to comply with
federal law. Referring to sovereign immunity, he added that ``it
would be hard to imagine anything more inimical to the republican
conception, which rests on the understanding of its citizens
precisely that the government is not above them, but of them, its
actions being governed by law just like their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, dissenting in the false-advertising case, said a state
waives its sovereign immunity when it engages in a business, as
Florida did by essentially becoming a bank for future collegians.
Echoing Souter, Breyer called the sovereign-immunity doctrine
outdated and ``more akin to the thought of (British King) James I
than James Madison,'' a leading framer of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, dissenting in the patent-infringement case, assailed
the court's rigid adherence to sovereign immunity despite the harm
its enforcement can do to citizens' rights. ``Today, this court
once again demonstrates itself to be the champion of states'
rights,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In handing down the three decisions, the high court completed
the last public day of its 1998-1999 session. The court will meet
again in public Oct. 4, the first day of its 1999-2000 term.

 &HT;    Rivals' move hurts CheckFree shares
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three major banks said Wednesday they were forming a
company that will compete with CheckFree by electronically
delivering bills to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The news that Chase Manhattan, First Union and Wells Fargo would
form a company called the Exchange, and that the banks planned to
start presenting electronic bills to consumers by fall, gouged 23.7
percent out of CheckFree's stock price. Shares of the Atlanta-area
based electronic payment processor closed at $28.75, down $8.93
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   More than 16 million shares were traded, better than 20 times
its daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Chase Manhattan, First Union and Wells Fargo are all CheckFree
customers, representing 20 percent of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, CheckFree and existing shareholders, including Chairman
and Chief Executive Pete Kight, sold 3.8 million shares at $39.
Kight's 658,122 shares brought $25.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Wednesday, Kight said the timing was
coincidental. Kight said the Exchange is not a threat to CheckFree
and might help it. He said the banks' interest in electronic
billing will increase attention on the industry, which ultimately
will benefit CheckFree.
</P>
<P>
   ``No informed person should view this announcement as anything
other than the emergence of yet one more group trying to find a
meaningful role in what everyone regards as a very attractive
market,'' Kight said in a statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bolen, an analyst with J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co., is recommending
investors buy shares of CheckFree. Bolen said he does not think
investors overreacted. He said the Exchange will do nothing more
than present bills, which would only cut into part of CheckFree's
business.
</P>
<P>
   But for the online bill-paying and bill-presenting industry, a
kind of race has begun. Few question that more and more people will
get and pay bills online. The question is where _ at a high-traffic
Web portal or at a bank Web site?
</P>
<P>
   Banks were slow to adopt and market the service, which pushed
CheckFree to try to strike distribution deals with Internet
portals. CheckFree announced a deal with one Internet portal,
reported to be Yahoo!. The feature is expected to be available by
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Gartner Group research shows people who pay bills online
prefer do it at their bank's Web site instead of a portal, by a
factor of 8 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Avivah Litan, an analyst with Gartner Group, said the Exchange
deal is a big deal to investors because it means CheckFree has more
competition. Litan said she thinks the banks will eventually add
bill-paying functions to the bill-presenting feature they plan to
offer in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ``signals that more banks will get going and build
their own service,'' she said. ``But can the banks execute quicker
than CheckFree and the portals? Our research shows that consumers
prefer banks over portals. The question is will the lead (time)
mean a lot in terms of consumer share?

 &HT;    Lawyers face off in tobacco class-action case
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Maybe it's because they've been dueling every day in
court for nine months, or because there are billions of dollars at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, tempers flared Wednesday as the first
phase of a landmark class action lawsuit against the tobacco
industry drew to a close, with opposing lawyers shouting each other
down before they were halted by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of emotion and a little bit of that came
out,'' Miami-Dade County Circuit Court Judge Robert Kaye told
jurors, whom he had ordered out of the courtroom while tempers
cooled. ``Please disregard that.''
</P>
<P>
   The dust-up came between Stanley Rosenblatt, who brought the
first-ever class action lawsuit against the industry, and Philip
Morris attorney Robert Heim.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing remarks, Heim tried to argue that the case boils
down to the choices made by individuals to smoke despite the known
health risks.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt flew to his feet to object, saying Heim was violating
a ruling by Judge Kaye that the issue of smokers' choices should
not be considered during the trial's first phase.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye agreed, and appeared to gently scold and calm the lawyers
during a lengthy sidebar conference.
</P>
<P>
   But venom between the two sides still crept into the lawyers'
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In two days of closing arguments, Rosenblatt repeatedly
portrayed cigarette companies as deceitful, scheming, profit-hungry
giants who ignored and even tried to cover up the dangers of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shameless purveyors of an unhealthy product have done
everything they could to hook people,'' Rosenblatt argued, citing
internal industry memos that discussed ways to increase market
share among smokers called ``young adults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They called them young adults but those were code words for
teen-agers,'' Rosenblatt said. ``That's where the money is and they
know that better than anybody. If you hook a 14-year-old, look at
all the years he'll be smoking. By the time he gets to be 60, at
two packs a day, that's profit, pure profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt accused the companies of ignoring the health risks of
smoking and keeping vital research from the public, all the while
manipulating nicotine levels to make their product even more
addictive. His complaint charges them with fraud and conspiracy, as
well as negligence in making a defective, dangerous product.
</P>
<P>
   The six jurors have sat in the ornate but dilapidated downtown
Miami courtroom since October. Also watching from the gallery at
times have been stock market analysts, who know an adverse verdict
could cripple the already-battered industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the most dedicated spectators have been a dozen or so sick
smokers, some of whom bear surgical scars and can talk only with
the aide of buzzing, hand-held amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
   They will appear before jurors if Rosenblatt wins the trial's
first round.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding has been divided into three phases. In the first
part, now ending, jurors will be asked to decide whether the
tobacco industry is responsible for the smokers' illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If so, a second phase will begin with individual representatives
of the class presenting their cases, and jurors asked to rule on
how much in damages they should receive.
</P>
<P>
   The trial's third phase would involve damages for the entire
class, both compensatory and punitive.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple setbacks in jury trials in the past few years,
tobacco companies have recently won several cases, with juries
generally agreeing with their long-held argument that the dangers
of smoking have been widely known for decades and that smokers are
responsible for choosing the habit.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry has also agreed to pay hundreds of billions of
dollars over the coming decades to settle lawsuits with dozens of
state governments that wanted reimbursement for treating sick
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt's class-action suit has the potential for adding more
billions _ some observers estimate up to $200 billion _ to the
industry's bill.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's blue-chip team of lawyers has focused its defense
on the issue of public awareness and claims that some 50 million
smokers have successfully quit the habit. In his closing arguments,
Heim showed jurors a giant chart labeled ``Mountain of Awareness,''
which he said was a huge obstacle to accepting the plaintiffs'
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 33 years there have been warnings on cigarette packages,''
he said. ``If somebody started smoking a pack a day in 1966, they
would've had the opportunity to see those warnings 200,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Heim also downplayed the significance of numerous industry
documents, introduced by Rosenblatt, which the plaintiffs said
showed the industry's conspiracy and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were millions and millions of documents over the course
of 50 years,'' Heim said. ``It's not fair to take documents out of
context. If you read only the negative articles in the newspaper
about (Miami Dolphins quarterback) Dan Marino, you might think he
was a terrible quarterback. But you've got to read all of the
articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Heim also labeled as ``vicious'' Rosenblatt's assertion that the
industry targeted teens, hoping to hook them for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a reprehensible charge and it hasn't been proven in
this courtroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry lawyers were expected to complete their closing
arguments today, with the case going to the jury Friday after a
short rebuttal argument by Rosenblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the jury room, the six-person panel will have thousands
of documents to consider, along with a 40,000-page trial
transcript.

 &HT;    Healtheon, WebMD continue Net deals
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Still a couple months shy of their high-stakes merger,
Healtheon Corp. and WebMD Inc. continue to forge deals aimed at
boosting visibility _ one is with an Internet star, the other with
an icon of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon announced Wednesday that its name and information, as
well as links to its own site, will be carried on Yahoo!, the Net's
leading search service. Atlanta-based WebMD, which is slated to
merge with Healtheon in September, has similar deals with CNN's Web
site, Excite and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an agreement with WebMD was announced by Reader's
Digest, which made its name decades ago as a publisher of magazines
and shortened books aimed at Middle America. Reader's Digest has
invested $13 million in WebMD and will have its own site advertised
on the sites of WebMD's investors. The announcements gave Healtheon
stock a healthy bump, apparently on the notion that the company has
taken another step toward leadership of the potentially lucrative
health care sector of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   However, visibility apparently comes at a price. Although
Healtheon and Yahoo! did not release financial details, the
agreement calls for Healtheon to sponsor several features on
Yahoo!, including a poll offered to visitors and a health-chat
area. That implies that Healtheon is paying Yahoo! for the right to
appear on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's arrangement does not yet represent the largest
health care presence on Yahoo!. Atlanta-based Adam.com supplies
about 10,000 pages of health care information to Yahoo! on all
manner of diseases and conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Adam and Yahoo! have also not released details of the
arrangement except to say that Adam does not pay for its presence.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangements reflect the growing power of Yahoo in serving
``communities of interest'' on the Net, said Ford Cavallari,
executive vice president for the Internet practice of the
Renaissance Group, Boston-based consultants. ``They have so much
power they can get people to pay them.''
</P>
<P>
   WebMD's founder, Jeffrey Arnold, has been named the most
effective start-up chief executive by the editors of The Standard,
a printed and Internet magazine that covers the Net economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among other awardees were Alan Greenspan as most influential
thinker and Bill Gates of Microsoft as most influential investor.
Microsoft is investing $250 million in the Healtheon-WebMD merger.

<P>
   &UR; Ernest Hemingway &LR; 's granddaughter  &UR; Lorian &LR;  vents her anger in
the July issue of GQ about the publication of Hemingway's fictional
memoir, ``True at First Light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are his,'' she writes of the forthcoming Scribner's
book, which she says was not ready for publication, ``but they fall
hollow and are without the grace and purpose and ultimate
redemption that might have been brought to this rambling, flawed
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In an excerpt quoted in the New York Post, Hemingway accuses her
father,  &UR; Gregory &LR; , and his two brothers,  &UR; Jack &LR;  and  &UR; Patrick &LR; , of
being mercenary. The three ``are delighted to roll out a magic
carpet of a manuscript every decade or so just to remain on the
high end of solvency.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers and publisher are ``simply in the business of
peddling Hemingway as if he were a QVC home-shopping network
item.'' She says they are ``confusing legacy with the benefits of
early retirement.''

white civic center, he insisted on giving one in the black ghetto,
refusing a fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mothers brought their babies, old and young sat spellbound and
a garland was placed over his shoulders. Thanking his audience for
the musical traditions of Africa and India, he told them, `My

<P>
   Among the care packages was one from the nearby Lewiston Public
Library, which had been the beneficiary of a gift from the Stephen

about baseball (because the title of his last book, ``The Girl Who

   &UR; Ernest Hemingway &LR; 's granddaughter  &UR; Lorian &LR;  vents her anger in
the July issue of GQ about the publication of Hemingway's fictional
memoir, ``True at First Light.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The words are his,'' she writes of the forthcoming Scribner's
book, which she says was not ready for publication, ``but they fall
hollow and are without the grace and purpose and ultimate
redemption that might have been brought to this rambling, flawed
memory.''
</P>
<P>
   In an excerpt quoted in the New York Post, Hemingway accuses her
father,  &UR; Gregory &LR; , and his two brothers,  &UR; Jack &LR;  and  &UR; Patrick &LR; , of
being mercenary. The three ``are delighted to roll out a magic
carpet of a manuscript every decade or so just to remain on the
high end of solvency.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers and publisher are ``simply in the business of
peddling Hemingway as if he were a QVC home-shopping network
item.'' She says they are ``confusing legacy with the benefits of
early retirement.''

   ``Mothers brought their babies, old and young sat spellbound and

   Among the care packages was one from the nearby Lewiston Public

OFFICIALS FEAR GUN MAKERS WILL SEEK BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first sign of the impact of the growing number of
municipal lawsuits against the gun industry, a well-known
manufacturer of handguns has filed for bankruptcy protection,
raising concern among city officials across the country that other
firearms companies may also use bankruptcy to try to avoid the
suits.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filer, Davis Industries, one of a group of
companies in suburban Los Angeles that are controlled by a single
family and its friends, produces Saturday night specials, cheap
handguns favored by criminals. Davis is one of the 10 largest
makers of handguns, and studies have found that its products tend
to be characterized by a short ``time to crime'' _ that is, a
remarkably brief period between sale and the point at which they
show up as weapons used in criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of the pressure created by the municipal
lawsuits, Bob Delfay, president of the gun industry's largest trade
association, says he plans to propose an unusual conference with
senior law-enforcement officials, representatives of the National
Rifle Association and executives of gun companies to discuss how
the industry and government might curb trafficking by people who
buy firearms on behalf of criminals and juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear precisely what measures Delfay, of the National
Shooting Sports Foundation, has in mind to stop these so-called
straw purchases. But any proposals by the gun companies for greater
government regulation or industry self-policing of sales and
marketing practices would be a substantial departure from the
manufacturers' insistence that they are already sufficiently
regulated by thousands of laws.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, Delfay's group took over a more conciliatory
gun-industry organization, the American Shooting Sports Council,
which had been trying to open negotiations with lawyers for some of
the cities suing the firearms makers. In an interview, Delfay
insisted that his idea for a conference was not intended to open
the way for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 22 counties and cities, including Chicago, Los Angeles
and Detroit, have sued the gun makers, accusing them of failing to
include enough safety devices or negligently marketing their guns
in ways that enable criminals and juveniles to buy them. The suits
seek damages for extra police and hospital costs resulting from gun
violence, but more important, city officials say, they want to
force the gun companies to accept greater regulation of the way
they design, manufacture and distribute their products.
</P>
<P>
   More cities are expected to file suit soon, and lawyers familiar
with the issue say New York is close to becoming the first state to
bring such a suit. ``If New York comes into this, and there are
more suits, at some point soon a critical mass will be reached
where the costs alone of defending these suits are going to eat up
the gun companies,'' said John Coale, a lawyer in Washington who is
representing New Orleans and several other cities that have sued.
</P>
<P>
   Coale, one of the Castano Group of lawyers who were active in
suing the tobacco industry _ the group is named for a friend of
several of them who died of a tobacco-related disease _ estimated
that the cigarette companies had spent $600 million a year
defending themselves against the states. ``The gun companies simply
can't afford it,'' he said, since they are so much smaller and
sales of guns have been flat or declining for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if you get too many cities and states suing,'' Coale said,
``the manufacturers will go into bankruptcy protection. And the day
that happens, the suits stop and it is lose-lose for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Industries, of Chino, Calif., filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in the federal bankruptcy court in nearby Riverside
on May 27, said Alan Stomel, a lawyer who represented creditors in
the unrelated 1996 bankruptcy of Lorcin Engineering, another of the
gun makers controlled by the same owners as Davis Industries and
known as the Ring of Fire companies (because their locations form a
ring around Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool,'' Stomel said,
``and predictably the more suits that are filed, the more these gun
companies are going to file for bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis Industries, who declined to give his name,
confirmed that the company had filed for bankruptcy. ``We do what
we got to do'' in response to the suits, the spokesman said. ``I'm
sure other companies will do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stomel said Davis Industries faced several problems: the
municipal lawsuits, wrongful-death and personal-injury suits by
individuals, a messy argument between the two owners, Jim and Gail
Davis, who were recently divorced, and a bill that is expected to
pass the California Legislature that would bar the manufacture of
cheap handguns.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun makers said
bankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain'' because it will require
much more time and expense for the cities, limit the amount of
damages they may collect and, perhaps most important, put the
litigation in federal bankruptcy court. Bankruptcy judges, the
lawyer said, are more likely to act favorably to the gun companies
than urban juries in state courts.
</P>
<P>
   But Paul Januzzo, general counsel for Glock Inc., one of the
largest handgun makers, said it was unlikely that the older, more
established, mostly eastern firearms companies would turn to
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident we can win the suits, if we have a number of
companies litigating together,'' Januzzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits, he added, are nothing new to the industry. ``It would
be an unusual gun company that doesn't have a dozen lawsuits a year
against it,'' he said. ``This is America.''

MARINES KILL ATTACKER IN KOSOVO FIREFIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ For the second time in as many days, US
Marines exchanged gunfire with armed attackers inside Kosovo,
killing one man and injuring at least two others after a lengthy
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials were unsure Wednesday night whether the
gunmen, dressed in civilian clothes, were Albanians or Serbs. But a
Pentagon spokesman said the assailants were clearly to blame for
the exchange, opening fire on the Marines near the farming town of
Zegra. No US soldiers were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the second such incident involving US troops
dispatched to keep the peace in Kosovo, and came as military
officials from the five NATO countries guarding the province
struggled to calm tensions between ethnic Albanians flooding back
into their towns and the few Serb civilians who still remained.
</P>
<P>
   In villages across Kosovo, houses were seen burning Wednesday,
the result of naked vengeance on the part of ethnic Albanians,
officials said. The sharp increase in retaliatory attacks coincided
with a flood of new refugees returning home, as well as with the
further discovery of what were believed to be mass grave sites,
including one in northern Kosovo that contained as many as 180
dead.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials pleaded with aggressors on both sides for peace.
But even British Foreign Minister Robin Cook was moved to demand
further action against Yugoslav leaders after a firsthand glimpse
of the devastation. During a visit Wednesday to the town of Velika
Krusa, one of the seven crime scenes cited in the war crimes
indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and the site
where 105 men and boys were believed killed, Cook said he felt
``rising indignation against the people who had ordered these
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had any doubts about the justice of the campaign we were
waging to liberate Kosovo from this terror, they have been
banished,'' Cook said after visiting the town, where human remains
lay scattered, and where a courtyard was filled with body bags.
Cook said he felt ``increasing distress and pity for these people
who were herded into two rooms and shot through the windows and
through the doors. They must have known they were going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the amassing of physical remains, a group of
independent analysts Wednesday assessed the economic damage of the
11-week NATO bombing campaign, putting the cost of rebuilding
Yugoslavia alone at more than $29 billion. However, the price of
reconstructing Kosovo was not included in the analysis performed by
economists from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
_ and it was far lower than the $100 billion reconstruction
estimate made by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Western officials remained insistent that no aid to
Yugoslavia would come while Milosevic retained power. Although
European nations are widely expected to help rebuild Kosovo _ a
cost that the European Commission said Wednesday would be roughly
$1.03 billion a year for three years _ the European Union's
External Relations Commissioner said Wednesday it was ``out of the
question'' that Serbia would get its share under the current
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Cook repeated his pledge to have Milosevic brought to trial,
saying: ``We are not going to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, meanwhile, were preparing to join the NATO
peacekeeping force, and could arrive in Kosovo as soon as Friday,
assuming a parliamentary vote approves the mission. Their
deployment comes after an initial squabble between Russian and NATO
leaders over what role Russia would play, and whether Russian
soldiers would be required to report to NATO leaders.
</P>
<P>
   That earlier dispute was solved last week. But questions over
Russian involvement took a new twist Wednesday, as US officials
admitted they believed Russian mercenaries had been involved in the
Serb army itself, fighting against the Kosovo Liberation Army
during the 78-day war.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon, describing the Russians as
``soldiers of fortune,'' said the information was based on reports
from members of the KLA. He also said they were ``not in any
official capacity and did not represent the Russian government in
any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bacon said, the Pentagon had reason to believe there was
``a relatively small number of Russians there operating on their
own as volunteers, possibly as mercenaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could almost describe them as soldiers of fortune
and in our world today such individuals are frequently found in
areas of conflict around the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Albanians, meanwhile, poured into the region again
Wednesday, alarming aid workers and draining food and water
supplies. Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees said as many as 207,000 refugees had
streamed back inside Kosovo in the last eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a phenomenal rate _ absolutely staggering,'' Colville
said.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived in towns looted and black with soot, their homes in
many cases burned to the ground or emptied of all possessions. In
turn, many openly sacked the homes of Serb neighbors who had fled _
or Serbs themselves _ causing near panic among NATO soldiers and
underscoring what many believe is the need for more peacekeeping
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, US soldiers engaged in a gun battle with a group
of four men they found firing shots into the air in a small town in
central Kosovo, according to Brigadier General John Craddock, the
commander of Task Force Falcon. No one was killed. Three of the men
were arrested. Two of them were wearing uniform shirts, but could
not be identified as Albanians or Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in the incident in Zegra, US Marines were called to a
report of a disturbance in a home at approximately 5:30 p.m.
Several men carrying AK-47 machine guns began firing on them,
Pentagon officials said. The Marines fired back, killing one,
injuring at least two, and taking one into custody. The injured
attackers were flown by helicopter to a military hospital.

   ``I would tell you that in the last 48 hours, for the first
time, we have become the target of violent acts,'' Craddock said,
speaking from Prizren in a conference call with reporters at the
Pentagon. ``Again, no US forces injured or hurt at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   US Major Trey Cate, a spokesman for the multinational Kosovo
Force (KFOR), said early Thursday that officials did not know
whether the attackers were Serbs or Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it was Serbs or Albanians, we would respond
even-handedly in any case,'' he said. He also added that the
violent outburst ``underscores the danger of the mission. But it
also shows that the KFOR forces will do everything under the robust
rules of engagement to preserve a safe environment, and that is
exactly what these Marines did.''

NICKELODEON CELEBRATES 20 YEARS

<P>
   Like its young viewers, Nickelodeon has been growing up before
our eyes, though it's hard to believe the cable network that
changed the face of children's programming is ready to celebrate
its 20th birthday this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the story of the youth-oriented cable network that
slimed its way to popularity. Sliming, for those unfamiliar with
the world of Nickelodeon, is the dumping or throwing of a
lime-green goopy glop on contestants on ``You Can't Do That on
Television.'' Their offense? Uttering the words, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon actually started April 1, 1979, with a magazine-type
series for pre-schoolers called ``Pinwheel.'' It could be seen only
by cable customers in Buffalo, N.Y., and Columbus, Ohio. Now, 20
years later, the network is available in 75 million homes, and a
lot of them must be tuning in at least at some point each day. It
has been the No. 1-rated cable network for three straight years.
</P>
<P>
   It has achieved that success partially by smartly targeting
different audiences at different times of the day. Midday is
marketed for the youngest viewers and is dubbed Nick Jr., while
late afternoon is for slightly older kids after they get home from
school. Early evenings are earmarked for the family, with shows
like ``Kenan &AMP; Kel,'' ``Doug'' and ``Rugrats,'' the network's most
popular series.
</P>
<P>
   To mark the anniversary, Nickelodeon will show favorite episodes
and series that have aired since its birth. The look back airs from
6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and 1 to 4 p.m. Sunday. Saturday's
offerings will include five hours of first episodes of every
original Nick animated series, a collection of game shows, specials
and live action series. Special episodes featuring celebrities
before they were stars will be shown Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Nickelodeon's growth came after it became part of the
MTV Networks (MTV and VH1) in 1984, and got the kind of financial
support it needed for program expansion and all-important
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Nickelodeon reached an entirely different audience
by turning over its prime-time and overnight schedule to reruns of
old prime-time hits, like ``Donna Reed'' and ``Dennis the Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doesn't believe in the power of marketing only has to
look at Nick at Nite. This was a lineup of reruns that had long ago
lost their novelty. But packaged as event programming that helped
us recapture our still longed-for past, Nick at Nite quickly
grabbed attention. It also spawned the creation of the spinoff
network, ``TV Land,'' on which viewers can see classic TV shows 24
hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has had a simple philosophy nearly since the
beginning, when network officials credit interviews with young
viewers for setting them straight. In focus groups, the kids told
network executives that they just wanted to be kids because they
were scared about growing up.
</P>
<P>
   So, in 1985, according to the network's printed history, ``Nick
was re-launched with a new identity, focused on giving kids what
they wanted, not what grown-ups thought was good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Herb Scannell, president of the various Nickelodeon franchises,
said the original network has led to many changes in kids' TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``We debunked a lot of the myths of kids' television _ that boys
wouldn't watch shows starring girls, that you couldn't make scary
shows without delving into a lot of violence _ and we did it in a
consistent manner by knowing our audience and putting kids first,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Family Channel is taking a different approach to
reaching the young audience. In October, it is launching two new
gender-specific channels, boyzChannel and girlzChannel.
</P>
<P>
   Though the networks are still months away, there was much
criticism in education circles when they were announced because of
concern that the two channels will play to stereotypes of trucks
and guns for boys and dolls for girls.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's original programming philosophy might not have set well
with the crowd that had long supported the more education-oriented
programming on PBS, but the channel has served its own teaching
function. Its programs are certainly better than most of the
toy-inspired junk that passes for after-school syndicated
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon has the most popular kids' programs on the air, led
by ``Rugrats,'' which began in 1994 and has grown so popular that
it inspired a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   The network also has perhaps one of the best kids' shows on any
television network _ ``Nick News,'' in which host Linda Ellerbee
treats young viewers with intelligence in reporting the news from
around the world. Ellerbee has just the right touch in treating
kids as if they're smarter than most other broadcasters give them
credit for.
</P>
<P>
   While the broadcast networks (NBC, CBS, ABC) once ruled Saturday
morning television with kids' shows, Nickelodeon has bumped them
aside. Each of the big three has tried different approaches, with
NBC turning over time for ``Saturday Today'' and going after an
older teen-age audience with its ``Teen NBC'' lineup of such shows
as ``Saved by the Bell'' and ``Hang Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon also has been good for Florida and jobs. More than
1,800 episodes of its programs have been taped or filmed at the
Nickelodeon Studios based at Universal Studios Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And Nick is the home to ``Blue's Clues,'' the prize of Nick Jr.
In this season, preschool viewers are asked to help Steve solve
puzzles presented by his puppy, Blue. Forget all those scary and
sad rumors you may have heard. Actor Steven Burns is very much
alive, just like Nickelodeon itself.
</P>
<P>
   Happy 20th birthday!'

MARINES AND SERBS EXCHANGE FIRE IN SOUTHEASTERN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZEGRA, Yugoslavia _ Local Serbs in civilian clothes opened fired
Wednesday night on a checkpoint manned by U.S. Marines here,
provoking a firefight that killed one Serb and wounded two others,
one severely, American officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth Serb was arrested after the Marines, backed by armored
vehicles and helicopter gunships, ended an hour-long standoff by
storming a house where the Serbs had retreated, the commander of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Col. Kenneth Glueck, said. No
Marines were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The firefight erupted just after 6 p.m. in this village in
southeastern Kosovo that has been roiled by tensions between Serbs
and Albanians. The gunfire underscored the ongoing volatility of
NATO's operation in Kosovo, 12 days after the first peacekeepers
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time American troops came under direct fire.
On Monday night, soldiers from the 82d Airborne Division were fired
on near the city of Urosevac, though they did not return fire and
no one was injured. Three people were detained in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Zegra is a small, remote village south of Gnjilane, where,
unlike other cities and villages, many Serbs have remained after
the withdrawal of Yugoslavia's Serb-dominated army and police
units. Marines have manned checkpoints there for more than a week.
Last Thursday they disarmed a company of fighters from the Kosovo
Liberation Army in the village, seizing scores of weapons and
arresting six KLA leaders after they paraded through in a show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of a hot spot between the two factions,''
Glueck said at the Marines' headquarters on a hilltop near the
village of Cernica.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the streets were dark and deserted, but
gunshots could still be heard in the distance. ``They're firing
like crazy tonight,'' one Marine said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the Serbs opened fire on the checkpoint,
which was on the main road through Zegra. There were some two dozen
Marines in the area, near a schoolhouse they have turned into a
field headquarters, but there had been no apparent signs of new
tensions. A firefight raged for several minutes, until the Serbs,
already wounded, fell back into a house not far from the road.
</P>
<P>
   When reinforcements arrived, including the armored fighting
vehicles, the Marines surrounded the house, while Cobra helicopters
hovered overhead. Serbian translators, using megaphones, tried to
defuse the situation by telling those inside to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave them an opportunity to surrender,'' Glueck said.
After nearly an hour, the Marines stormed the building. The two
wounded Serbs were taken by helicopter to the Army's field hospital
near Urosevac, some 15 miles away. Colonel Glueck said he believed
that one or two more Serbs had escaped. ``They faded into the
crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Yugoslavia's army and special police have withdrawn
from Kosovo, NATO has been trying to impose order on the province.
On Tuesday, NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said that
the allies needed to move more quickly to build up their forces.
NATO now has 20,000 troops, but officials said it could take until
late July before the entire contingent of more than 50,000 arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the American sector, Brig. Gen. John Craddock,
said Wednesday that the United States now had 4,500 of its
contribution of 7,000 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops have by and large been welcomed by Kosovo's Albanian
majority, but their biggest challenge has been defusing
confrontations between Serbs and the Albanians who are returning
home in droves after fleeing President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown this spring. Rarely have NATO troops faced direct
military challenges to their authority, but military commanders
here say there is little they can do to disarm the entire country,
making incidents like the one Wednesday a lingering threat.
</P>
<P>
   Glueck said military police would investigate the incident, but
he ruled out aggressive action to root out weapons in Zegra or
elsewhere. ``If we know where the guns are, we'll go after them,''
he said, ``but we're not going to go house to house.''

 &HT;    Free speech out of reach, Moyers fears
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Bill Moyers, frequently dubbed the Conscience of
TV News, is worried.
</P>
<P>
   He worries about a lot of things _ racism, violence, corruption,
drugs, moral values. But lately he's been pondering the sorry state
of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been chewing over this for a long time,'' Moyers said in
his soft Texas twang during a phone interview from New York. ``I've
been following this story of money and politics and the changing
character of the media for years, and I've been concerned about
what's happening to our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   What's happening, Moyers concludes in his PBS special ``Free
Speech For Sale,'' is that free speech is guaranteed only to those
who can afford it. Often that means wealthy corporations, which
saturate the media with political advertising or buy companies that
cover the news, effectively smothering other voices.
</P>
<P>
   As he says in the introduction, the First Amendment was intended
to guarantee that ordinary citizens could ``get our two cents'
worth into the public debate, but what the framers of our
government didn't reckon with is that two cents doesn't buy much
these days. You can say what you want, but if you really want to be
heard, we're talking big money.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyers' program cites three cases that should cause concern.
</P>
<P>
   First up is a state legislator in North Carolina, a feisty woman
who sought to force the powerful hog industry into dealing with
waste-disposal problems. A consortium of hog industry leaders,
calling themselves Farmers for Fairness, waged a massive
advertising campaign against Republican Cindy Watson. She had no
money to buy ads to counter the group's negative charges, and she
was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised that people assumed the best about this
group in North Carolina,'' Moyers said. ``Apparently nobody had any
insight into what we call a `front group.' I would have thought
somebody would have exposed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up is the $40 million ad campaign waged by the tobacco
industry to defeat the McCain Tobacco Bill. Although the popular
bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain, (R-Ariz.), seemed a shoo-in
when it left committee, it died in the Senate after a media blitz
shifted the debate from health issues to big government and big
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Moyers takes on the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which received bipartisan support and was championed as positive
for the public because it included regulations about labeling
offensive program content on television and adding more educational
shows for children.
</P>
<P>
   What the act also did, however, was give $70 billion worth of
new channel space, owned by the public, to the broadcast networks
as part of the transition to all-digital broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no public debate because the media did not want to
discuss what it was doing,'' says Charles Lewis, director of the
Center for Public Integrity, in the program. ``They're all going to
make billions of dollars over the next several years, and the last
thing they want to do is have a discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The three network newscasts paid scant attention to the
Telecommunications Act and even less coverage of the channel space
giveaway, according to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Moyers says he wasn't surprised that TV news kept the story
under its corporate hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's intrinsic in human nature to serve your own interests,''
he said. ``That's a real danger. ABC probably wouldn't do a story
on the effect of merchandizing Disney movies either.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, of course, is owned by Disney. NBC is owned by General
Electric, and CBS has an interest in several other media outlets.
It's this concentration of media ownership that makes truly
objective network news coverage all the more difficult, Moyers
says.
</P>
<P>
   For much of his 25 years in journalism, Moyers has worried about
the effect of money and the media on politics. His latest
investigation did nothing to ease his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's alarming and disturbing that my grandchildren may
grow up in a society where their political worth is determined by
their net worth,'' he said. ``Money has always been a force but now
it's the force. It's the combination of direct advertising and a
media that's devoted to the bottom line that squeezes out
information people need as citizens. The marketplace of ideas
continues to shrink.''
</P>
<P>
   What can we do about it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think critically and analytically,'' Moyers said. ``If you see
a show, ask who's doing it and what are they trying to say?''

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is about as simple as science gets: Spread
10,000 bushels of ancient oyster shells on the bottom of New York
Harbor near the Statue of Liberty, and see if drifting oyster
larvae settle there and grow.
</P>
<P>
   But if the experiment planned for Thursday works, it could
portend a revival of a long-missing link in the ecology and marine
commerce of the waters around New York City. Before the harbor
became choked with pollution, oysters were abundant: the islands
now known as Liberty and Ellis were known to the Dutch as the
Oester, or Oyster, Islands. At the turn of the century, more than 1
million bushels of oysters were harvested each year around the
harbor, from Raritan Bay to the East River.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the oyster restoration project, its designers
say, is simply to reestablish the mollusks so they can help consume
algae, which can deplete oxygen and suffocate fish, and create a
reef, where oyster colonies and fish can find shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists also say they hope that oysters from New
York Harbor will eventually end up on the plates of restaurant
diners. Once mature, the oysters could be transplanted to cleaner
waters and then flushed of any lingering bacteria in tanks, as is
now commonly done with clams, said Benjamin Longstreth, the project
manager and New York City coordinator for Baykeeper, a private
environmental group in Sandy Hook, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Grand Central Oyster Bar, Michael
Garvey, when informed of the project, said he was hopeful, but
cautious. ``If the oysters are able to grow that means the system
as a whole is getting much better,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time, however, before New York City oysters
are listed along with the Cotuits and Chincoteagues on the Oyster
Bar's daily shellfish list, he said. ``It's a great idea,'' he
said. ``But for now, it's a noble experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment has only become possible in recent years. Oysters
largely vanished in city waters early this century, ravaged by
overfishing, suffocated by plumes of raw sewage and buried by silt
washing down the Hudson River from upstate farms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the raw sewage is mostly gone, farming is fading and there
is no oyster harvest at all between Long Island and Delaware Bay,
according to fisheries biologists. The result is that the harbor,
which is seeing a revival of all manner of marine creatures, is
probably hospitable to oysters, Longstreth said.
</P>
<P>
   They just lack good homes _ for oysters, that means hard
surfaces full of nooks and crannies where the tiny larvae can
settle, out of reach of crabs and fish.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they need heaps of submerged oyster shells.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, a scattering of oysters has been seen
around the harbor and up the Hudson in Yonkers on piers, anchor
chains, even submerged grocery carts _ enough to provide a few
larvae, Longstreth said. But without a broad bed of shells, it is
unlikely that a large colony can be established, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mature oysters produce clouds of microscopic larvae that drift
on the tide until they find a hard surface. Those that settle in
the open are almost all eaten by predators. Those that make their
way into a tight space can survive and eventually reproduce, said
Dr. Mark Luckenbach, a marine ecologist at the Virginia Institute
of Marine Science in eastern Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Luckenbach, who was consulted by the Baykeeper group last
winter, has been overseeing the building of artificial oyster reefs
around the Chesapeake Bay, in hopes of reestablishing vast natural
reefs that were completely destroyed by fishing over the past
century. The new reefs will be kept off limits to harvesting,
acting as a reservoir of larvae that can disperse around the bay,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Bureau of Aquaculture has been building shell
reefs to encourage the establishment of wild oyster colonies for 12
years, said John Volk, the bureau director. And oyster farmers have
used the technique to bolster their cultivated underwater beds for
generations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the restoration work around the country has taken
place in the center of a bustling urban harbor surrounded by
millions of people, Longstreth said. ``We're trying to give nature
a kick start,'' he said. The $35,000 project is being financed with
grants from the Pew Charitable Trusts, the Victoria Foundation and
New Jersey Sea Grant, Longstreth said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Longstreth oversaw final preparations, as a towering
crane on the waterfront in Elizabeth, N.J., deposited thousands
upon thousands of oyster shells onto a barge. The shells had been
dug from Maryland beds more than 1,000 years old and trucked to the
pier.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they are scheduled to be towed to a spot in New Jersey
waters near the Statue of Liberty. A New York City Fire Department
fire boat will wash the heaps of shells from the barge into the
harbor with water cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Longstreth said the dumping was timed to precede the first burst
of spawning by the few resident oysters around the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is a matter of waiting for the tides to carry the larvae
to the right spot. Divers will inspect the shells several times
late this summer and in the early fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If no oysters settle naturally, the next step will be to add
some imported live oysters to the bed of shells to seed the area
with larvae, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Waldman, a biologist for the Hudson River Foundation, a
private group that is not involved in the project, said the time is
right for the oyster's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important part of the local fauna and it's been
kind of forgotten,'' he said. ``Finally, water quality is clean
enough where it's probably a good bet to help these things along.''

STOCKS END MIXED AFTER LATE BUYING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks ended mixed Wednesday after some late buying
lifted the main gauges from their daily lows while long-term
interest rates continued to climb.
</P>
<P>
   With Federal Reserve policy-makers expected to decide next
Wednesday to raise the rate on overnight loans between banks by
one-quarter point, investors and traders debated the growing
possibility that one such increase might not be enough to head off
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weight on equities,'' said John Manley, equity
strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, referring to competition from
bonds for investors' cash. ``We actually think there may be three
increases before it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks bore much of the brunt of the uncertainty over
rates in a week with little other economic news and with companies
not due to report second-quarter profits until next month.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, down 4 3/8, to 130 5/8, and American Express, down
2 1/8, to 122 5/8, were the two biggest factors in the 54.77-point
loss suffered by the Dow Jones industrial average, which finished
at 10,666.86, down five-tenths of a percent. At midday, the Dow's
slump was nearly 105 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
fell 2.82 points, or two-tenths of a percent, to 1,333.06.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the NASDAQ composite index pushed into
positive territory, finishing with a gain of 17.86 points, or
seven-tenths of a percent, to 2,598.12.
</P>
<P>
   This reflected strength in high-technology issues, which have
regained some investor favor despite the runup in interest rates.
Cisco climbed 2 3/8, to 61 7/8, and Altera rose 4 5/8, to 40 5/16,
after an analyst raised the semiconductor company's target price.
Beyond.com jumped 7 1/4, to 32 7/8, on speculation that it will be
bought by Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   3Com warned of lower revenue in coming quarters and slumped 4
3/8, to 27 1/8, apparently benefiting the shares of larger rival
Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   With little else besides the uncertainty over the Fed's action
and corporate profit warnings to focus on, analysts said it was not
surprising that markets tended to be defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of an upside surprise are low relative to the
chances of a bigger correction,'' said Al Kugel, senior investment
strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; &AMP; Farnham in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Another company warning of lower profits was Crown Cork &AMP; Seal,
which cited weak European economies in lowering expectations for
the second time in nine months. The stock skidded 3 1/2, to 28
15/16. Goldman Sachs reported earnings that far surpassed
expectations, but the stock fell 3, to 65, in a mixed brokerage
group.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks advanced with crude prices after inventories fell
unexpectedly. Chevron, recommended by Banc of America Securities,
climbed 2 1/2, to 92 5/8, while Mobil and Exxon gained 1 1/2 and 1
1/8, respectively. Drug issues were mostly lower.
</P>
<P>
   Vulcan Materials, one of three stocks to be added to the S&AMP;P
500, jumped 4 1/4, to 46 15/16. Network Appliance rose 3 1/2, to 48
5/16, and Best Buy was up 2 9/16, to 63 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume grew to a still-moderate
731.8 million shares, with declining issues surpassing advancing
ones by 1,760 to 1,259. New Lows outnumbered new 52-week highs by
67 to 50.

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army's new chief of staff on Wednesday vowed to
redouble the Army's efforts to become a more agile yet powerful
force, acknowledging that the service was ill-prepared to move 24
Apache helicopter gunships and artillery into Albania in the early
stages of the Balkans air war.
</P>
<P>
   On his second day as the Army's 34th chief of staff, Gen. Eric
Shinseki said the Army was organized and equipped to have an
armored brigade of soldiers and tanks battle-ready in 96 hours in a
potential hot spot like Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But a place like Tirana, Albania, with poor rail connections, a
shallow port and a limited airfield, proved a logistical nightmare
for Army commanders, who jockeyed to bring in military equipment
alongside relief supplies bound for refugees pouring out of nearby
Kosovo. Even after their long-delayed and costly arrival, the
Apaches never flew a combat mission in the 78-day air war.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon, said he had
ordered the outlines of a plan be drawn up within six months to
make the Army's heavy forces more mobile and its lighter forces
more lethal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're asked to go to a place like Tirana, we accept a
certain amount of challenge with that,'' said Shinseki. ``But we're
looking at using that as a case study to say, OK, how would we do
that better in the next Tirana or in the next Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges of operating in the Balkans are no surprise to
Shinseki, who served two years as the top Army general in Europe
and commander of NATO peacekeeping forces in Bosnia before he
became vice chief of staff last November.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his experience with Russian peacekeepers in Bosnia,
Shinseki played down the latest dispute over Moscow's decision to
send 200 Russian soldiers into Pristina ahead of the NATO vanguard,
and said Russian forces in Kosovo would work well with NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience in Bosnia was that when given the proper
directions, they complied with them,'' the general said.
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki, an armored officer who served two tours in Vietnam and
was seriously wounded twice, predicted that landmines and
``radicals,'' both disaffected Serbs and rebel Albanians, posed a
much a greater threat to NATO troops as they begin the process of
rebuilding Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard work is about to start,'' he said. ``The conditions
we'll face in Kosovo are not much different than what I faced in
Bosnia.``
</P>
<P>
   Shinseki said U.S. and NATO forces could expect to stay in
Kosovo ``at least four years, if our experience in Bosnia is any
lesson.'' NATO peacekeepers have been in Bosnia since December
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is contributing 7,000 U.S. troops to the NATO
operation in Kosovo and nearly that many in Bosnia. With the
Clinton administration committed to sending much larger forces in
the Persian Gulf and Korean peninsula, if crises erupt there,
Shinseki warned that the 480,000-soldier Army ``may not be enough''
for the far-flung missions.
</P>
<P>
   As the Army's role in NATO's peacekeeping force begins to take
hold, the Air Force announced Wednesday it is phasing out a
suspension on retirements imposed to retain pilots and others
deemed critical to the air war against Yugoslavia.

CISNEROS' EX-LOVER ADMITS REPEATED LYING TO SAVE CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Linda Jones testified Wednesday that her repeated
lies drove a federal investigation into the ``hush money'' former
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros allegedly paid her following the
collapse of their extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 50, said her lies under oath about the authenticity of
her secretly recorded telephone conversations with Cisneros also
kept a skeptical state judge from dismissing her civil lawsuit
against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case with severe legal problems and in danger of
being thrown out unless you did something drastic?'' Brendan
Sullivan, a lawyer for Cisneros, asked as he quizzed her about her
motives in lying in the civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were desperate for money, weren't you?'' Sullivan asked as
he continued to hammer at Jones's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' came her reply.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had claimed the tapes were original, but she admitted
earlier this week all were copies and some of the recordings had
been edited to delete her threats to expose Cisneros' payments, if
he quit sending her money.
</P>
<P>
   She admitted under cross-examination Wednesday she lied to the
state court, the FBI and Independent Counsel David Barrett. It was
her third day of testimony in a hearing that appeared likely to
last through the week and possibly have to be resumed later.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's investigation of Cisneros, 52, led to a 21-count
indictment charging him with conspiring with Jones and two of his
aides to conceal $250,000 he paid her following the explosive
public disclosure of their affair in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Mark Jackowski said Cisneros tried to conceal the
``hush money'' to protect his nomination in 1993 by President
Clinton to be secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to introduce 34 tapes of telephone
conversations between Jones and Cisneros at his trial, which is
scheduled to open Sept. 7. The tapes are key to the government's
case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski said the tapes are an admission ``out of his own
mouth'' that Cisneros was paying her in excess of $10,000 per year
and to underscore ``his intent and his motives'' to hide the scheme
to protect his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones, a former San Antonio fund-raiser who also was known
by her married name, Linda Medlar, admitted this week that none of
the tapes is original, and five have been altered.
</P>
<P>
   She repeatedly said she lied about the authenticity of the
tapes, once to resurrect her civil lawsuit against Cisneros that
was later settled out of court for $49,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pleaded guilty to 28 criminal charges as a result of
Barrett's investigation into Cisneros in Texas. She is serving a
42-month prison sentence and agreed to testify in exchange for a
reduction in her jail term.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Simon, another attorney representing Cisneros, joined the
effort to discredit her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every way shape or form, the witness has committed perjury,
obstruction of justice, lied repeatedly to the FBI, lied repeatedly
to the IRS, and is in jail for lying,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the government offers this witness?'' he asked U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he would rule when the hearing concludes on
whether the government can introduce the tapes during the trial,
and he noted that the government often has the right to use
evidence it uncovers.
</P>
<P>
   But he also hinted that the government's case has a problem,
most notably Jones's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm astounded when I sit here and listen to what happened in
this case,'' Sporkin said after Jones was excused from the witness
stand for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are people in this country who don't know how to
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was San Antonio's mayor when he admitted affair,
setting off a swirl of publicity that Jones said ruined her ability
to stay employed and sent her to a hospital to be treated for
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros served as Clinton's housing secretary from 1993 to
1996. He is president of the Los Angeles-based, Spanish-language
television network Univision.

 &HT;    Chairman vows to buy everybody a Coke
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Now the real work begins for the Real Thing.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola must restore consumer trust in Belgium, France and the
rest of Europe where its drinks created a health scare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the company is keenly aware that these circumstances
surrounding product quality go to the heart and soul of its
brands,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst with Goldman Sachs.
``They must do everything possible to re-establish and secure
consumer confidence in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts spoke with one voice Wednesday after
Belgium told the company it could begin producing its beverages and
selling them in stores again _ after meeting several conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear need to be in the consumer's face saying,
'We're still a product you can trust,''' said Deutsche Bank analyst
Scott Wilkins. ``This is not an issue about money. It's more
important than that. It's an issue about the long-term health of
the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   At a bare minimum, Wilkins said, the company needs to double its
traditional marketing expenditures in most of continental Europe,
even though it will affect the bottom line in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The near-term emphasis has to be this is an old, quality name
you can trust,'' Wilkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Chairman M. Douglas Ivester knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is relevant to us is making sure we do everything
possible to reassure the Belgian consumers that they can completely
trust our products and the health and safety of our products,''
Ivester said Wednesday in Brussels at his first news conference
since the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will spend whatever is required from a marketing standpoint
to ensure that Belgian consumers can once again enjoy Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's top executive also was featured in TV commercials
aired Wednesday evening in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all the Belgian people who drink our products, I want to
say that I'm personally very sorry for any discomfort or
inconvenience,'' Ivester said in the 90-second TV spot. ``I thank
you for your patience with this situation. Most of all, I want you
to know that all of us at Coca-Cola are committed to working very,
very hard to earn your trust again.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ivester said the company will try to get
a Coca-Cola in the hands of every Belgian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the first things I'll do is buy everybody in
Belgium a Coke,'' he said. ``We have a process in place that we
think can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with an aggressive, multimedia advertising and marketing
campaign, analysts did not know how long it would take for
Coca-Cola to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't have here is a precedent, so we don't know how
quickly the product will rebound,'' Wilkins said. ``They have to
get the product on the shelves and watch the reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 113 years as an Atlanta institution, Coca-Cola has never
had a bigger recall and ban of its products. In fact, it has had a
reputation for a high degree of quality that it will likely exploit
in its marketing efforts, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the positive news in Belgium, Coca-Cola closed down 87
1/2 cents Wednesday at $61.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottler that owns the
two plants at the center of the crisis, dropped 25 cents to $32.37
1/2.

SETTLEMENT NEAR IN SEC INVESTIGATION OF BEAR STEARNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Securities and Exchange Commission and Bear
Stearns Cos. are closing in on a settlement that would end a
two-year investigation into the brokerage firm's
securities-clearing business.
</P>
<P>
   Although the terms are still being worked out and a settlement
is days away, any agreement would probably allege a type of
securities fraud on the part of Bear Stearns in its role as the
clearing firm for A.R. Baron, a brokerage concern that failed in
July 1996. Most likely, the allegations would be of aiding and
abetting securities fraud, along with record-keeping violations,
which allowed Baron to operate outside of net capital rules.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to the investigation, a settlement
would probably require Bear Stearns to make a payment of
substantially more than the $10 million it recently offered.
Earlier in the negotiations, the firm had floated the possibility
of a $1 million settlement. With securities regulators preparing to
file suit, Bear Stearns has raised the offer in an attempt to avoid
litigation. The payment would probably consist of both a penalty
and a restitution fund for investors who lost money with Baron.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement would not necessarily end separate criminal
investigations nor would a restitution fund automatically cover all
claims against Bear Stearns that have been privately brought in the
Baron matter.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also may not address the future of Richard
Harriton, the man who has run Bear Stearns Clearing Corp. since
1979. Harriton, 64, is represented by his own lawyer and his
settlement talks with the SEC are being conducted separately.
Harriton's lawyer, Howard Wilson of Rosenman &AMP; Colin, did not
return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A senior managing director of the firm, Harriton turned the
clearing business into a giant moneymaker for Bear Stearns,
accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the company's profits in
recent years. Along the way, Bear Stearns provided clearing
services to a number of small brokerage firms that came under
intense scrutiny by securities regulators for their hard-sell
tactics peddling obscure stocks to unsuspecting individual
investors. This in turn brought regulatory scrutiny to Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC launched its investigation into Bear Stearns in 1997
after the failure of Baron, a brokerage firm that prosecutors say
stole $75 million from investors. As clearing firm for Baron, Bear
Stearns processed the trades for Baron's customers and supplied the
small firm with the capital needed to underwrite stock offerings
and conduct other securities operations. After Baron failed,
investors who had lost money with the firm filed suit against Bear
Stearns, alleging that the larger firm had ignored signs of
malfeasance and fraud at Baron and that without the backing of Bear
Stearns, Baron would never have been able to persuade investors to
entrust the firm with their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns executives have maintained that their firm did
nothing wrong and that as a clearing firm, it had no responsibility
to the customers of Baron or other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns provided clearing services for many of the small
brokerage firms that sprang up in the late 1980s and early 1990s
that ran afoul of regulators. The clearing customers of Bear
Stearns have included Stratton Oakmont, a firm closed by regulators
in 1996, and Sterling Foster, which was indicted by a grand jury
for securities fraud in a case brought by the U.S. attorney for
Manhattan last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bear Stearns also cleared trades for Rooney Pace, a brokerage
firm that was shut down by regulators in 1987. Randolph Pace, a
principal of Rooney Pace, who has also been indicted in the
Sterling Foster case, is a close friend of Harriton, according to
people who know them.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal is struck with regulators, Bear Stearns would neither
admit nor deny culpability in the Baron case. The commission would
likely say in the settlement papers that Bear Stearns committed
securities fraud by aiding Baron in its fraud. The settlement may
also charge that Bear Stearns enabled the firm to continue
operating even when Baron's capital fell below regulatory
requirements. Moreover, Bear Stearns may not have maintained proper
records in connection with its clearing of Baron's trades.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, Bear Stearns would likely agree to
hire an outside consultant to help it improve its clearing
procedures and to supervise changes made to its operations.
</P>
<P>
   While Bear Stearns refused to comment on the settlement talks,
the company has steadfastly maintained that Harriton has done
nothing wrong as the head of clearing and that his job at the
brokerage firm remains secure. In recent days, however, that
staunch support appears to be fading, according to a person close
to the firm.
</P>
<P>
   If Bear Stearns reaches a settlement with the SEC, the firm will
not be out of the woods completely. It is the subject of several
criminal investigations for its clearing operations for various
defunct brokerage firms. Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, is investigating Bear Stearns in connection with the
Baron mess.
</P>
<P>
   According to a person close to that investigation, Morgenthau
has not yet decided whether to agree to end his office's
investigation of the firm as part of an SEC settlement agreement.
Morgenthau won 13 convictions of Baron executives and brokers last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for Manhattan is also investigating Bear
Stearns in its capacity as the clearing firm for Sterling Foster.
Prosecutors in that case say that Sterling Foster manipulated six
small stocks that it underwrote and that it was secretly controlled
by Pace, who had been barred from the securities industry. An SEC
settlement would not affect this investigation. A spokesman for the
U.S. attorney declined to comment on the matter.

HINDU PRIEST GETS PROBATION IN SEXUAL ASSAULT OF ARKANSAS WOMAN 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Jurors gave probation Wednesday to a Hindu priest
convicted of sexual assault, but he did not avoid the wrath of the
judge, who called him an embarrassment to people of all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though your conduct is more that of a snake-oil
salesman than a Hindu holy man,'' state District Judge Ted Poe told
Bhogeshwernand Sharma, 37, after imposing the 10 years probation
and $10,000 fine for the sexual assault a 21-year-old Little Rock,
Ark., college student who had sought Sharma's spiritual guidance.
</P>
<P>
   Poe gave Sharma 180 days in the county jail and imposed many
conditions on his probation. He must not act as a priest, except
for his own family, and must also pay the victim's counseling
bills, plus restitution in an amount to be determined later.
</P>
<P>
   He must also register as a sex offender, not leave the county
without Poe's permission, take sex-offender counseling and post a
public notice about his crime in a yet-to-be-determined publication
or public venue.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, prosecutor Kelly Siegler told Poe that a new sexual
assault charge had just been filed against Sharma.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma, who had earlier mouthed a silent `thank you' to the
jurors who had given him probation, shook his head as Siegler
talked about the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready right now,'' Siegler said afterward. ``I can get
it indicted tomorrow, and we'll go to trial next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors deliberated Sharma's punishment for about three hours.
Earlier, they sent Poe a note saying they were deadlocked 11-1 in
favor of probation. Jurors declined comment as they left.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma was convicted of sexually assaulting the 21-year-old
woman on or about April 3, 1998, at his home in Harris County,which
includes most of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; She says Sharma told her he needed to cleanse her womb with
his ``holy sperm.''
</P>
<P>
   She says Sharma bullied her and said the sex merely was part of
a sacred ritual to fight ``evil spirits.'' She also says he told
her she would become barren, get sick and possibly die if she
talked of the ``ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, her mother and her mother's sister all sought
Sharma's help with various medical problems when he was in Arkansas
in September 1997 for a prayer service, according to testimony. The
mother and aunt say during that visit Sharma coerced them into sex
at separate times, always using the same pretext of blessings and
rituals mixed with odd prophecies and threats.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma returned to Arkansas in October 1997 to ``convert'' the
mother and daughter to Hinduism and they visited him and his family
in Houston in April 1998. That's when the daughter says Sharma
assaulted her.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma has not been charged in Arkansas with the alleged
encounters with the mother and aunt. But they were allowed to
testify in this trial.
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old Hindu woman who came forward during the trial says
that on Jan. 6 _ days before he was charged _ Sharma had sex with
her, impregnated her and she had an abortion, Siegler said. The
woman's father subsequently called Sharma and his family, and
shortly after that the defendant was seen at a Houston passport
office.
</P>
<P>
   Because he had already been charged at that time, his bail was
revoked for the charge on the April 1998 case, Siegler said. The
20-year-old and her relatives say that in February Sharma's family
talked them out of going public. They didn't call the prosecutor
until this week.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler said the 20-year-old woman was in court Wednesday and
agreed to cooperate with authorities after it became clear that
Sharma was going to get probation.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Siegler said, another local woman came forward to
say she had also been assaulted by Sharma the same way as the
Arkansas women. It was unclear whether charges would be filed in
her case, but Siegler said she would testify in other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler was disappointed with the sentence but said she would
file new charges against Sharma as long as they come in.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old and her mother said they were also disappointed
by the jury's verdict and urged others to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't come out, it's going to harm them for the rest
of their lives,'' the young woman said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Katherine Scardino said jurors were right to
give Sharma probation. She added that she knew nothing about the
new case and didn't know if she would continue to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Scardino had presented testimony from Sharma's family and
friends who said he had never been alone with the three Arkansas
women. She also accused them of lying.
</P>
<P>
   But Siegler scoffed at that, saying the women had no reason to
lie, and the alibi witnesses were nothing more than
``co-conspirators.''
</P>
<P>
   That, among other things, angered Scardino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of (Siegler's) antics in the courtroom have been
pretty absurd and bizarre. ... Enough is enough. We have murderers
who don't get this kind of bad treatment,'' Scardino said later.
</P>
<P>
   Siegler responded, ``The trial is not about Katherine Scardino
and me. The trial is about a man who is raping women right and
left, and that's all it should stay about.''

 By TODD ACKERMAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Astros manager Larry Dierker checked out of Methodist Hospital on
Wednesday, seemingly as mischievous and wry as ever but also a bit
humbled.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eight days after successful brain surgery to remove a
life-threatening mass of tangled blood vessels, Dierker indulged in
his usual tongue-in-cheek humor while reflecting on life's
unpredictable nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``After successive days of looking out my window and seeing only
dark clouds, today was the first time I saw the sun,'' Dierker, 52,
said at a hospital news conference. ``I took that as a symbol of my
new freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, wearing an Astros cap on his shaved, scarred head, said
he was deeply touched by fans' outpouring of affection and the
Astros' hanging his jersey above his usual dugout seat. ``You might
think it would make you feel like a big shot,'' he said, ``but it
had the opposite effect on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, Dierker feigned a near fall off the podium,
as if still unstable from surgery. He broke into a grin as a few
people gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker suffered a grand mal seizure in the eighth inning of a
June 13 game in the Astrodome against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure, which resulted in suspension of the game with the
Astros leading 4-1, was diagnosed the next day as having resulted
from a condition known as arteriovenous malformation (AVM), the
second-leading cause of fatal brain hemorrhaging..
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rob Parrish, Dierker's surgeon, said Wednesday that an
electroencephalogram showed the ``seizure focus'' was removed in
the surgery. He said Dierker may be taken off anticonvulsive
medicine after the season, though he could have to take it
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish downplayed Dierker's next stage of recovery, saying his
wife, Judy, will have the toughest job.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has a lot of work ahead, ``staying at home and
helping Larry be a couch potato,'' and Dierker said he plans to
listen to a lot of music, write thank-you notes to get-well cards
and see his son's baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish said Dierker should be able to return to managing after
the mid-July All-Star break _ ``certainly not before'' _ although
he will continue to be evaluated ``a day at a time, a week at a
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, noting that he is having no trouble finding the right
word in conversation or doing crossword puzzles, marveled at the
surgery's apparent lack of negative effects. Indeed, he noted, he
is coming out of the hospital with ``a slimmer waist, a forehead
tuck and, hopefully, brighter.''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept returning to how moved he was by the reaction to his
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been a little concerned this year that perhaps my
poker-face style _ I don't hug players or slam things or charge
umpires much _ left players unsure how much I care,'' said Dierker.
``But after seeing their reaction to this, the way they hang up my
jersey _ even when they're on the road, for instance _ I no longer
have that concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found out a lot from this, and most of it makes me feel
better, not worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he plans to watch games from the press box during
the homestand that starts tonight and hopes to stay involved in
team decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor's orders to keep away from extended periods of
difficult work during my recovery doesn't mean I have to stop
thinking,'' he said.

NOTEBOOK: WHO'S CONDUCTING WHICH ORCHESTRA? AND WHY?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Ind., Mass., N.Y., Ohio, Pa., Texas)  (rk) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the announcement on Tuesday that, come 2002, Sir Simon
Rattle will be the next music director of the esteemed Berlin
Philharmonic, at least one seat has been grabbed in the game of
musical chairs among conductors vying for music directorships of
some eight or so important orchestras. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another seat opened on Tuesday when the Boston Orchestra
announced that Seiji Ozawa, now in his 25th season as its music
director, would step down, also in 2002, to take charge of the
Vienna State Opera. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is probably just coincidence that so many posts are opening
up simultaneously. Now that the Berlin vacancy has been filled ,
the orchestras in New York, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Houston,
Indianapolis and Cincinnati as well as Boston will all need new
music directors in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pressures of being the music director of a major urban
orchestra today must be a contributing factor to the current
restlessness. All aspects of the job are under question: has the
subscription-concert format served its purpose? How does a
conductor find the right balance between serving older repertory
and fostering the creation of new works? How do you entice young
people accustomed to amplified music to symphony concerts? Will
emerging technologies in instruments and recording soon make
musicians in formal wear playing centuries-old music on
centuries-old instruments seem hopelessly dated? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is notoriously hard to find out the real story behind the
courtship of conductors: who wants what post and who is wanted?
Judging from the secrecy of their deliberations, you would think
orchestras were dealing with international security.
</P>
<P>
   There has long been speculation that Rattle coveted the post in
Boston, where he has been an acclaimed guest conductor, and that he
therefore demurred when the Philadelphia Orchestra dangled its
directorship before him. Perhaps, convinced that Ozawa was in
Boston to stay, he took Berlin, a position many in the music world
believe Ozawa once wanted for himself. So on virtually the same day
that Sir Simon takes Berlin, Ozawa gives up Boston, which came as a
surprise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the field of classical music could do itself
a lot of good by giving up the horse-race aspect of the story and
looking at the larger questions. What is Ozawa's legacy? Why did
Berlin go for Rattle? What are the lessons to be learned from it
all?
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's record in Boston has always been hard to assess, for you
get different takes depending upon whom you ask. Just 38 when he
accepted the music directorship in 1973, he brought vitality and
undeniable talent to the job. His memory is astonishing. His
technical skills are often incomparable. He can pull together a
gargantuan piece like the Berlioz Requiem with stunning efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, on its best nights _ for example, an arresting
concert performance of Strauss' ``Elektra'' at Boston's Symphony
Hall in 1988 _ the orchestra could sound incandescent.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the chemistry has long been off, as many critics have
felt and said, quite bluntly. Ozawa ``continues to pilot the Boston
Symphony toward mediocrity,'' the New Yorker critic Alex Ross wrote
recently. At best, as a conductor Ozawa's work in the last decade
has been uneven.
</P>
<P>
   But there is even more to question in Ozawa's handling of other
aspects of the job. A music director must be not only a strong
conductor and orchestra builder, but also a leader of the cultural
community, someone with ties to composers, especially local
composers; someone who can reach out to other cultural and
educational institutions. Ozawa, who reared his family in Japan
during his tenure in Boston and still lacks fluency in English,
never convincingly filled that role.
</P>
<P>
   I was a critic in Boston in 1993, the year of Ozawa's 20th
anniversary with the orchestra, when something telling happened:
for the first time, he walked across the street from Symphony Hall
to the New England Conservatory and conducted the student orchestra
in Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The young musicians were thrilled, Ozawa was inspired, the
performance was fabulous and the good will generated was salutary.
Why, you wonder, did it take him 20 years? Another music director
might have done it annually.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, the upheaval that Ozawa instigated during the
summers of 1997 and 1998 at the Tanglewood Music Center, the
respected training institute for young musicians at the summer home
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in western Massachusetts, seems to
have been an attempt to create a lasting legacy any way possible.
</P>
<P>
   He essentially forced out the longtime directors of the program
and assumed creative leadership himself. Whether this was warranted
can be fairly debated. But Ozawa never satisfactorily delineated
exactly what the problems were that this painful shake-up was meant
to rectify. To many of the faculty who resigned in protest, it
seemed like the impulsive act of a frustrated man still yearning
for artistic respect.
</P>
<P>
   Tanglewood will recover. And for Ozawa, Vienna could be an
invigorating move. Meanwhile, even his biggest champions in Boston
may feel that the time has come for change at the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   It is well known that Daniel Barenboim, the music director of
the Chicago Symphony and the German State Opera in Berlin, was the
other finalist for the Berlin post, and wanted it badly. Barenboim,
56, was the establishment choice. He is a dedicated and utterly
honest musician and a resourceful technician. His performances have
rectitude and insight. For Chicago, he has probably been a healthy
antidote to the hyperkinetic Sir Georg Solti, who was there for 22
exciting years.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin has gone with the younger man, Rattle, 44, a conductor
about as far removed as anyone could be in temperament and
repertory from the tyrannical, traditional Herbert von Karajan, who
ruled the Berlin like Wotan. Rattle has eclectic and interesting
tastes in repertory and a genuine connection to contemporary music.
He is approachable, affable and well-liked by musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Given his impressive 18-year commitment to the City of
Birmingham Symphony Orchestra, during which he turned a provincial
ensemble in an industrial English city into a vibrant orchestra of
international significance, he is a role model of a music director
as a cultural leader. In choosing him, Berlin is clearly hoping for
Rattle to rejuvenate a great orchestra that sometimes seems
encrusted in tradition. More power to him.
</P>
<P>
   I have always felt that American orchestras, in particular, are
too quick to turn to great eminences who are more often than not
European. This is not to suggest that youth is always best. German
maestro Christoph von Dohnanyi was nearly 56 when he become the
music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, and few people contest
that this was an inspired choice. His music-making is at once
distinguished and exciting. He is an uncanny orchestra leader,
revered by his players. He is also an exceptional case.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His recently announced successor will be the Austrian Franz
Welser-Moest, and the wisdom of this choice will have to be proved
over time. Welser-Moest has youth (38) and dedication.
</P>
<P>
   From the performances I have heard him conduct, especially as a
guest with the Philadelphia Orchestra in New York, he seems a good,
solid, intelligent but not notably inspiring musician, and he has
not, at least in this country, been a significant advocate of
living composers. But the Cleveland may be the best in the country
right now, so you have to assume that its administrators know what
they are doing.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing Kurt Masur to the New York Philharmonic, the
orchestra also went for a senior, proven conductor and musician.
Masur's reverence for the standard Germanic repertory and his
sometimes aggressive interpretive approach has opened him to fair
criticism. But he was brought in to restore excellence and
confidence to the Philharmonic and this he has done.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Masur, whose outspoken defense of political freedom in
East Germany made him a hero there, has also tried to be a cultural
leader in New York, reaching out to local ensembles like the Harlem
Boys Choir and collaborating with the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   When he conducts a work like Bernstein's Dance Suite from ``West
Side Story'' you have to say, however stiff his rhythm, his heart
is in the right place. Overall, his tenure will probably be seen as
a strong one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the time has now come for some rejuvenation there as well.
Masur's contract runs through 2002. Will the orchestra board have
the daring to take a chance on a fresh candidate?
</P>
<P>
   When Leonard Bernstein was selected as music director in 1957,
he was no eminence, but a 39-year-old dynamo, not to mention the
first American-born music director of a major American orchestra.
And that worked out pretty well, most would say.
</P>
<P>
   Right now in town there is a young conductor doing remarkable
work with the Brooklyn Philharmonic, Robert Spano. Would the
Philharmonic be willing to go with a musician like him? Not likely,
if history is a guide. But with the remarkable number of vacancies,
the Philharmonic and other orchestras may be forced into taking
some chances. And that could be for the good.

EXILED IN MAINE, THE CREATOR AND PRISONER OF `LOVE'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)

 Scott Sutherland writes on art and culture from Portland, Maine  
 By SCOTT SUTHERLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VINALHAVEN, Maine _ It is typical of the contradictions that
define Robert Indiana that he fled New York for an out-of-the-way,
fog-drenched Maine island, only to buy the biggest, brashest house
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's home is a former Odd Fellows Hall called the Star of
Hope, an immense and aggressively Victorian structure that dwarfs
the small brick post office next door. The Star of Hope is the
grandest and most peculiar building in the village of Vinalhaven, a
lobstering hamlet on Vinalhaven Island, once famed for its granite
quarries and an hour by ferry from the midcoast port of Rockland.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's conspicuous home, not surprisingly, along with his
reputation as a famous, gay, eccentric artist, has made him a
tempting target for generations of local youths looking to prove
their mettle. The house took such a beating on Halloweens _
clapboards splattered with eggs, windows broken by rocks _ that two
years ago Indiana had the top two stories temporarily wrapped in
heavy plastic, a la Christo, to protect it from Halloween high
jinks.
</P>
<P>
   The Star of Hope, battered though it may be, has been Indiana's
refuge for more than 20 years, ever since he left New York in 1978
after weathering almost a decade of critical derision. He had
created a sensation in 1966 with a showing of his ``Love''
paintings at the Stable Gallery and was hailed as a central figure
in the Pop movement that included Lichtenstein, Rosenquist and
Warhol.
</P>
<P>
   But his ``Love'' success was also his undoing. Indiana had
failed to copyright the image, which dovetailed prophetically with
the Zeitgeist of the late 1960s; the love generation, the summer of
love and ``All You Need Is Love'' helped propel Indiana's ``Love''
into the mainstream with astounding velocity, and the artist,
despite repeated attempts, was powerless to control his creation as
it popped up on T-shirts, key rings, coffee mugs and paperweights.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana himself contributed to the ``Love'' saturation in a
variety of ways, including editions of unsigned prints,
18-karat-gold rings and 330 million 8-cent postage stamps. ``Love''
was as ubiquitous as the American flag, and, for a while at least,
arguably more popular.
</P>
<P>
   But as the culture embraced the image, the art world, convinced
it smelled a sellout, attacked Indiana; John Canaday, an art critic
for The New York Times, suggested that Indiana make ``Money'' his
next popular image. He mounted later shows in an attempt to reclaim
the ``Love'' image as an artistic creation, but his efforts were
too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   By 1978, feeling cut off from the New York art world he'd been a
part of since 1954 _ and having lost the lease on his five-story
Bowery studio _ Indiana packed up his voluminous belongings and
relocated to the Star of Hope, which he had used as a seasonal
studio since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The demands of the laborious move _ which Indiana calls
``hellish'' _ and of transforming the derelict Star of Hope from a
studio into a home seriously curtailed his art production. He
showed only sporadically throughout the 1980s and didn't emerge
with a significant new body of work until 1994, when his ``Hartley
Elegies,'' a series of large, dynamic oil paintings dedicated to
the Maine painter Marsden Hartley _ who, like Indiana, was
tormented by Vinalhaven youths during a summer visit to the island
in 1938 _ were first shown in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's output continues, in the form of paintings, prints and
sculpture. His art is still characterized by the words, numbers,
colors and hard-edge geometries that defined his work in the '60s
and '70s _ ``I am still a painter of signs,'' he likes to say _ and
refers directly to significant moments in his life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his work, though, is inspired by the nightly news; the
Monica Lewinsky scandal and the death of Joe DiMaggio prompted
Indiana to begin a new series of Marilyn Monroe ``sex goddess''
paintings, one of his favorite subjects in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   And he is getting shows. A current retrospective at the Portland
Museum of Art, ``Love and the American Dream: The Art of Robert
Indiana,'' which runs through Oct. 17, is the second major show of
his work in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Musee d'Art Moderne et d'Art Contemporain in
Nice, France, mounted an Indiana retrospective, the first major
showing of his work since 1991. Another major show is tentatively
planned for Tokyo next year. Could it be that, at age 70, Indiana
and his meticulously painted signs are on the verge of finding a
new millennial audience?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any show helps attract and educate people,'' Indiana said in a
recent interview. Then, as if by reflex, he added, ``But it's what
the press has to say about it that makes it or breaks it.''
</P>
<P>
   His prickly relationship with the news media _ craving the
attention, yet wasting little time in blasting an assortment of
critics and publications _ is just one of the contradictions of
Indiana's life on Vinalhaven.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely leaves the island and almost never answers his phone,
yet he clearly relishes social contact. He lives an exile's life in
Maine while keeping close tabs on the New York art scene he left
behind.
</P>
<P>
   His place in American art history is assured, but he continues
to fight for respect from an art establishment that he believes
undervalues him. And despite the recent shows of his work, he
laments that they didn't happen in New York.
</P>

   ``The irony is that the Museum of Modern Art has never been
interested in a retrospective of my work,'' said Indiana, as he
puffed a cigar in the Star of Hope's comfortable, purple-walled
living room. He was dressed casually in jeans and a baseball cap,
sported large round glasses and a mostly gray beard, and wore a
``Love'' wristwatch. ``It's not a matter of whether people
understand my work; it's a matter of whether it's ever seen, which
it hardly is, and it's hardly ever appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum appreciates one of Indiana's large ``Love''
paintings enough to include it in the second part of its ``American
Century'' show, opening in September. Karl Willers, an associate
curator of the show, points to the cyclical nature of art fashion
as a way of suggesting that Indiana may yet get his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is always up for re-examination,'' Willers said.
```Love' has been a blessing and a curse for him, in the sense of
how people might approach his larger body of work. But he's
produced an astounding body of work over his lifetime, work that is
immediately recognizable and stands up to that of any of his Pop
contemporaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But that Pop label has also been a problem for Indiana, mostly
because he was never really Pop to begin with. It's a common
misperception that Indiana looked to culture to create ``Love,''
when in fact it was ``Love'' that helped create the culture that
produced Woodstock. ``Nobody includes him in the core of Pop
artists anymore,'' said Aprile Gallant, who organized the Portland
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't detached from his subject matter, he handpaints
everything and there's a lot of personal content in his work. But
the art world likes movements, and that's been part of Bob's
problem. No one knows where to put him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gallant said she hadn't seen enough of Indiana's recent
output to say how it might shape his reputation _ or whether it,
too, would be eclipsed by the long shadow cast by ``Love.'' But she
added that many of his new projects seem concerned with reflection
and trying to square the past with the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work now is an awful lot about trying to assess his
career,'' Ms. Gallant said. ``He's held on to many of his works for
years, like a diary, and he's returning to those.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a sunny former sail loft across the street from the
Star of Hope, Indiana is putting the finishing touches on six
sculptures, created from sections of old ship masts, that he began
in the early 1960s. One piece lists place names that essentially
chart his life, starting with New Castle, the Indiana town where he
was born Robert Clark in 1928. (He changed his name to Indiana in
1958 after he moved to New York.).
</P>
<P>
   The list continues with Indianapolis, Chicago, Skowhegan,
Edinburgh, Coenties Slip, the Bowery, Vinalhaven. ``Why wouldn't
I?'' he replied, when asked why he would dig out old, unfinished
work. ``Things need to be taken care of. My regret is that they
weren't done a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana insists that he doesn't regret his move to Vinalhaven,
which he admits ``has not made for many happy years.'' A low point
came in 1990, when he was arrested and charged with hiring a young
island man for sex, but a jury cleared him in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the controversy only reinforced Indiana's outsider status
among the clannish islanders. ``The match of lobstermen and artists
is not exactly made in heaven,'' he said. ``But this is a very good
place to get work done.'' He does so with the help of a bevy of
assistants, whom he refers to as ``my boys,'' and peppers his
art-making with breaks to tend a menagerie of pets, including a
gaggle of geese he fondly calls ``my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana is in exile, but it seems to suit him. In the Star of
Hope's purple living room, a ``Love'' wall hanging dominating one
end, Indiana gestured around himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a prisoner of this building _ the dogs, the pipes in the
winter, the geese, the plants; there's too much to worry about to
leave,'' he said. ``But it's not all that different than when I was
in New York. I never entered into the scene the way Warhol did. I
was never very comfortable uptown. I was usually in my studio
downtown, painting signs _ charting the course, as I put it a long
time ago. That's what I'm still doing.''

FBI FORENSIC TEAM TRIES TO IDENTIFY VICTIMS OF KOSOVO WAR CRIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A team of FBI forensic investigators began the
grisly task of investigating two sites in western Kosovo on
Wednesday in an effort to identify victims of two mass killings
cited in the war crimes indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The sites are in the vicinity of Djakovica, a town in a sector
of Kosovo under the jurisdiction of Italian troops. One is a house
in which war crimes prosecutors have said that 20 Albanians were
gathered in April and shot dead by Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   A second site outside Djakovica is believed to contain the
bodies of about a half-dozen Albanian men killed in March by
Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said initial surveys at the sites suggested that
someone had tried to cover up the killings, in some instances
moving bodies to avoid identification of victims.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday announcing the opening of the
inquiry, FBI Director Louis Freeh said it was not yet clear whether
U.S. investigators would examine other sites of reported
atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The province of Kosovo is now one of the largest crime scenes
in history,'' Freeh said.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-member team of agents sent there include forensic
scientists who will try to determine who died at the two sites. The
agents will seek to retrieve blood samples, clothing, spent
cartridges and other evidence including DNA samples that will be
shipped back to the FBI lab in Washington for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law enforcement personnel are part of an international war
crimes investigation that is being conducted under the authority of
the International War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in
The Hague. Other investigators from countries like Britain, France
and Canada are already in the province or are expected to arrive
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The barbarous killings at the house in Djakovica have been the
subject of numerous accounts from refugees who fled the region as
Serbian troops stormed through the area after the NATO bombing
began in March.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who escaped said Serbs had pulled women and children
from their homes and herded them into a basement where soldiers
executed them. Afterward, the house was burned, allegedly to
conceal the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against Milosevic, which was returned in May by
the war crimes tribunal, said: ``On or about the early morning
hours of 2 April 1999, Serb police launched an operation against
the Qerim district of Djakovica. Over a period of several hours,
Serb police forcibly entered houses of Kosovo Albanians in the
Qerim district, killing occupants and then setting fire to the
buildings. In the basement of a house on Millosh Gilic Street, the
Serb police shot the 20 occupants and set the house on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment added that 19 of the 20 victims were believed to
have been women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of people believed to have been killed at both
locations are listed in the indictment against Milosevic and four
other Yugoslav and Serbian leaders. The FBI will try to identify
the bodies at the sites to match them with the victims listed in
the indictment.

WOMEN'S TASTE IN MEN DEPEND ON STAGES OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE,
SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The face of Mr. Right may change from week to week, according to
a new study that tracked women's preferences for male features at
different stages of the menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
   When women are more likely to conceive, they are more receptive
to men with more rugged, ``masculine features.'' a team of Scottish
and Japanese researchers concluded in a paper to be published
Thursday in the journal Nature. During the other three weeks of the
month, when the odds of getting pregnant are lower, including
during the menstrual period, women choose faces that are smoother
and more ``feminine,'' the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Perrett, a psychologist at the University of St.
Andrews in Scotland, said the research was meant ``to reconcile
some of the contradictions in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the biological point of view, masculinity is great,''
Perrett said. ``That's what females of other species go for, things
like big horns or bright feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier research had indicated the opposite in humans.
``When you asked women what they wanted, they went for men who were
more feminine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists had posited an evolutionary explanation. Human
children take longer to raise than most animals. That might make
``good genes,'' linked in animals to more pronounced masculine
features, less important than characteristics like stability and
supportiveness more associated with feminine qualities, they had
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   In the first stage of the recent experiment, researchers showed
39 Japanese women composite photos of men that had been blended to
represent more masculine features, jutting chin, prominent
eyebrows, or more feminine ones.
</P>
<P>
   The women's responses were compared with their stage in the
menstrual cycle. When the chances of conception were low, women
preferred faces that were 15 percent to 20 percent more feminine, a
gap that fell to 8 percent more feminine just before and after
ovulation, the peak period of fertility.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a control group of women who were taking
contraceptive pills, which control the hormonal cycle, stuck to
whatever preference they had without variation over the course of a
month. They, too, preferred more feminine men.
</P>
<P>
   In a second study, researchers created a computer composite male
face that women could manipulate to make more or less masculine and
asked 65 British women to alter a composite face to one they would
find most attractive for a short-term sexual relationship, and to
one they would prefer for the long run. The quiz was repeated
weekly for a month.
</P>
<P>
   When women were asked to think about a fling, the gap between
high and low fertility times remained wide. On the other hand,
women's picks for a mate for the long haul were consistent
throughout the menstrual cycle, and tended to be moderately
feminine.
</P>
<P>
   In their paper, the researchers conceded that one implication of
their findings was likely to be controversial: that evolution
favors females who follow ``a mixed mating strategy,'' choosing ``a
partner whose appearance signals cooperation in parental care while
occasionally pursuing short-term relationships (when conception is
most likely) with a male whose appearance indicates good genes.''

SUCCESS OF `HARRY POTTER' BOOKS HAS BUYERS, AND BOOKSELLERS,
SCRAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Just three weeks after ``Harry Potter and the Chamber
of Secrets'' hit American bookstores, young readers already are
placing advance orders for the third installment of J.K. Rowling's
phenomenal fantasy series.
</P>
<P>
   Look for ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' in U.S.
bookstores on Sept. 8, a week earlier than the original release
date.
</P>
<P>
   September originally was chosen for the U.S. publication of
``Chamber of Secrets,'' the second Harry Potter book. Instead,
``Chamber'' showed up in American bookstores on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved it up because of customer demand,'' said a
spokesperson for Scholastic Inc., which has U.S. rights to the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers say Scholastic decided to move fast after impatient
fans began buying the British version of the series, published
months earlier by Bloomsbury Children's Books and available in that
country as well as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some early birds got ``Chamber of Secrets'' through
Amazon.co.UK, the British version of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with competitive pressure from the giant Internet
bookseller, some Seattle bookstores stocked the British ``Chamber
of Secrets'' earlier this year until Scholastic pressured them to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic's stance put booksellers in a tough spot. In terms of
buzz, ``Harry Potter'' is to children's books what ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace'' is to movies, and everyone wants a
piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep `Harry Potter' on the shelf,'' said Chauni
Haslet, owner of All for Kids Books &AMP; Music in Seattle. ``It's the
first magical page-turner we've had in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Targeted at kids 8 to 12 years old, the series captivates
readers of all ages. ``It has been the book for families to read
together,'' Haslet said.
</P>
<P>
   She stopped selling the British ``Chamber of Secrets'' in late
January at Scholastic's request because, she said, ``we feel it's
important to play the game honestly.''
</P>
<P>
   Christy McDanold, owner of the Secret Garden Children's
Bookshop, in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood, said, ``I don't know
what's legal, but I don't see any reason to thumb noses at
Scholastic.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she added, ``Many, many of my customers got the British
version.''
</P>
<P>
   McDanold said she had to promise Scholastic in writing that she
would not sell ``Prisoner of Azkaban'' before the official U.S.
release date.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the British version of ``Azkaban'' comes out July 8,
two months before Scholastic's U.S. edition. You can get it then
through Amazon.co.UK.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle-based Amazon.com says Scholastic's concerns about the
British edition are overblown. Spokesman Paul Capelli said
Amazon.com sold fewer than 2,000 copies of the British ``Chamber of
Secrets'' in the United States _ a figure that calls into question
how much competitive pressure the Internet seller really created.
</P>
<P>
   Capelli said Scholastic, despite its protests, may have
benefited from early circulation of the British edition because of
the word-of-mouth excitement it generated.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, back-door maneuvers soon will become unnecessary as
Scholastic moves to close the gap between British and American
publication dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the fourth book comes out, they'll be
simultaneously published, to stop all this,'' said Patricia
Johnson, children's book buyer at University Book Store in Seattle,
which continued selling the British ``Chamber of Secrets'' after
other stores pulled it.
</P>
<P>
   J.K. Rowlings was a single mother on public assistance when she
created ``Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,'' writing at a
cafe while her baby daughter napped. The book went on to become the
British Book Awards Children's Book of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The American edition, ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''
appeared a year later.
</P>
<P>
   As fast-paced as a Nimbus Two Thousand flying broom, the series
unfurls the magical adventures of a boy named Harry, who (shades of
Roald Dahl) suffers life with loathsome, mean-spirited relatives
who don't appreciate him.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually he finds sanctuary, and his true calling _ at the
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, which has all the
stuffy conventions and petty rivalries of a typical British
boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Star Wars,'' the books explore the tension between good
and evil, but in a kid-size, happy-ending kind of way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter'' caused little stir at first, and Rowling's
first American tour last fall went largely unnoticed. Then National
Public Radio featured the book in late November, setting off a
buying frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a line at the counter within five minutes,'' said
Secret Garden's McDanold. ``We had people calling in on their cell
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the race was on to get the second book into the
hands of customers, many of whom were willing to pay $6 or $7 more
for the less handsome British edition.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Warner Bros. has optioned the film rights to the
first two books of what, ultimately, will be a seven-book series.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, Amazon.co.UK has posted a brief plot summary for
the upcoming ``Prisoner of Azkaban.'' Here's the scoop:
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is now in his third year at Hogwarts. The
atmosphere is tense as the sinister prison guards of Azkaban are
called in to guard the school. Harry and his friends Ron and
Hermione soon discover why wizards live in fear of Azkaban.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers can't think of any book in recent memory that has
caused such excitement. Philip Pullman's unfinished ``Dark
Materials'' trilogy (``The Golden Compass'' and ``The Subtle
Knife'') is the only work that comes close.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Pullman's books _ which are darker and more complex than
``Harry Potter'' _ already have placed advance orders for the
concluding volume, ``The Amber Spyglass,'' which originally was due
out this October from Alfred A. Knopf.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, they'll have to wait until May 2000. Pullman, who spent a
lot of time on promotional tours, reportedly needs more time to
polish the manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, we'll just have to be wild about ``Harry.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ French troops are barely keeping the lid
on violence here, in the main city of their sector of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The French on Wednesday deployed armored vehicles and foot
patrols down the narrow streets of the Gypsy quarter, to stop
Albanian looters, who ransacked houses and set fire to two of them.
</P>
<P>
   And earlier Wednesday, the French came under fire from a Serb
gunman, who had forced his way into an Albanian house. They
returned the fire and quickly apprehended the gunman, without
injury, but the incident added to the tense atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   With only 2,400 troops so far in their zone in northern Kosovo,
the French soldiers admit that they do not have the manpower to
guarantee safety on every street. ``I cannot position a soldier
every few yards,'' explained one officer.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians were the ones looting and burning this time, acting
out grudges against Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Young men and boys ran away across wasteland from the Gypsy
quarter. One was carrying a rolled-up carpet on his head, another
was weighed down with bulging bags. Behind them a house was
smoldering still from a blaze that had taken hold an hour before.
</P>
<P>
   French troops blocked the streets and checked the houses, but
their action was late. The houses spilled open with abandoned
goods, furniture, cookers and fridges. Clothes were strewn across
courtyards and into the street, broken glass from smashed windows
littered the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been going on for two days here,'' a French officer said
of the looting. ``They are largely Gypsy homes and it is Albanians
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy community seemed to have left the area. One old man
was fetching his dog and talking to the French soldiers, but
otherwise the district was abandoned. Serbs, too, were pulling out
of town, their belongings packed into cars and trailers.
</P>
<P>
   There are some 5,000 Serbs still in Mitrovica, and they are
making an aggressive bid to retain control of one section of the
town and turn it into a Serb-dominated quarter. Over the last few
days they have prevented Albanians from entering the area and are
providing living space to Serbs who have fled from elsewhere in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' anger is palpable. They accuse Albanians of trying to
penetrate their part of town and threatening them or forcing them
to leave Kosovo. They have for several days gathered in numbers at
the main bridge to stop any Albanians they do not know, and most
Albanian men, from crossing over.
</P>
<P>
   They are scared, and with some reason. The previous day two
Serbs were killed and one was wounded in a shooting on one of the
bridges, French troops confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Serbs feel threatened, and they are rejecting the
Albanians more and more,'' said a French marine, Capt. Jean-Michel
Huet. ``They say they are standing there because they are scared
and need to defend themselves. But there is a lot of paranoia.''
</P>
<P>
   The French are allowing the effective division of the town into
ethnic districts, figuring that offers the easiest way to protect
one ethnic group from another. ``We do not advise anyone to leave,
but if someone leaves, we try to help,'' Huet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is easier to protect a block of people, rather than family
by family,'' Huet said. ``We cannot accompany everybody.'' The
French have come in for criticism that they are encouraging ethnic
divisions, but Huet insisted they were trying to be neutral. He
said other NATO forces were allowing the Serbs to be pushed out
because that made keeping the peace easier, but he did not want to
allow that.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica remains in a strange state of limbo. The French are
the only force in town. There has been no police force since the
Serb police pulled out at the weekend. The Albanian guerrilla
force, the Kosovo Liberation Army, does not appear to be present,
except for a lone man wearing the KLA insignia on his sleeve
chatting to friends on the street.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb mayor is still working in his office, and is guarded by
big, forceful plainclothesmen on the door. The French said they
expect him to leave soon and to be replaced by an Albanian, but it
is not clear when and how.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the job of the United Nations to form a police force
and to run everything from refuse collection to prisons. But for
the moment. the French troops are to keep the order by themselves.
But since they have no prisons, courts and police, when they
rounded up a group of looters Wednesday, they searched them for
weapons and let them go.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage the Serbs and Albanians, and the hapless Gypsies,
to live together will take a long time, maybe decades, Huet said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the balance is still changing. As more Albanians
return home, they will vastly outnumber the Serbs here. Their
growing presence is unnerving the remaining Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Branko Barovic, 47, a Serb, said that 20 years ago, the Serb
community numbered 33,000 in Mitrovica, a town of 120,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Now it had dwindled to 5,000 and is falling further. Despite
their efforts to form a Serb quarter, it does not seem to be
holding.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be Albanian schools, Albanian language, Albanian
shops, complete ``Albanisation,'' Barovic said. ``There will be
eight Albanians for one Serb in the administration. Everyone will
go for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was speaking, shots rang out behind some high rise
apartment buildings. ``Someone is revolted. They are leaving and
are shooting in the air. They are angry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians across the river were also anxious. One family was
washing obscene Serb graffiti off their living room walls. They
said they had a Serb policeman still living in an apartment below
theirs. He was now wearing civilian clothes, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could live with Serbs who did not commit any massacres.
Like one Serb friend we have who did nothing bad. But this man
downstairs, I cannot stand him,'' said Raif Cuna, 33, an Albanian
who owns a jewelry store.

   SHALIKASHVILI-ESSAY (Seattle) _ The mystery over the fake
Shalikashvili essay has been solved _ sort of. A 2,000-word essay
harshly critical of the Clinton administration's handling of the
Kosovo crisis was erroneously attributed to former Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili. George Friedman, a defense
analyst and author from Austin, Texas, has stepped forward to claim
ownership of the article.

BRECHT'S COMPANY FINALLY FOLLOWS HIM TO AMERICA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 27)

<P>
   A naked man crouches atop a glass case containing a whirring
engine. His bare torso is painted white; his red tongue extends in
a bestial snarl. Schubert's song ``Erlkonig'' plays in the
background, replacing the recited polemics of Adolf Hitler that had
filled the auditorium before the curtain rose.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler quotes and Nazi salutes may seem like strong stuff to
American audiences, but in Germany, the critics complained that the
production wasn't radical enough.
</P>
<P>
   American theatergoers will be able to see for themselves when,
next month, the renowned German troupe Berliner Ensemble brings
this production of Bertolt Brecht's ``The Resistible Rise of Arturo
Ui'' to Berkeley and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Brecht's drama, a parable about the rise of the Nazis, thinly
disguised as Mafiosi and gang members (the characters Giri and
Givola are Goering and Goebbels), will be presented in a successful
1995 production by the company's director Heiner Muller, who died
that same year.
</P>
<P>
   It is appropriate that ``Arturo Ui'' should be presented in the
United States. When Brecht wrote the work in 1941, while in exile
in Finland, American performances _ a Broadway run _ were what he
had in mind. For all of its references to Nazi Germany, the play is
also clearly set in gangster-era Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain aspects of the play take on the significance Brecht
wanted when it's performed in the United States,'' says the actor
Martin Wuttke, whose performance in the title role has been lauded
as outstanding both in Berlin and on tour throughout Europe and
South America.
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading troupes in Berlin, the Berliner Ensemble is
sometimes known as ``Brecht's theater.'' It was founded by him when
he returned to East Germany in 1949, and for long years in that
country, his theater remained a place of pilgrimage for Brecht
enthusiasts. A few minutes away, where he lived, the Brecht House,
a dark pub-like restaurant, is crowded with Brecht memorabilia, and
the tables are illuminated by ancient stage lights from original
Brecht productions.
</P>
<P>
   The performances at the University of California at Berkeley on
Thursday and Friday and at the University of California at Los
Angeles on July 7-11 mark the Berliner Ensemble's first _ and, the
presenters proclaim, last _ appearance in the States.
</P>
<P>
   The company, in their rather theatrical depiction, is being
disbanded and then ``reconstituted'' in the fall under a new
director, Claus Peymann. This is like saying that the Chicago Opera
has disbanded because it has got a new artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Since German reunification, the Berliner Ensemble has undergone
a series of artistic and administrative upheavals, some of which
have severely tested the company's link to Brecht's legacy.
Peymann, who has reigned at Vienna's leading Burgtheater for 13
years, is a star in the world of German-language theater. He holds
the promise of renewal and artistic vitality to an organization
that is, after all, not a museum but the guardian and presenter of
a living art.
</P>
<P>
   In the former East Germany, the company was more museumlike than
innovative, dedicated primarily to keeping the Brecht flame
burning. After reunification, in 1990, Berlin's Cultural Officer,
Ulrich Roloff-Momin, sought to implement a new theater
administration befitting the Berliner Ensemble's special status.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a five-man team of some of Germany's most eminent
men of theater _ among them Heiner Muller, Peter Zadek and Matthias
Langhoff _ was installed as joint directors. In practice, this
noble idea proved a disaster. None of these men had reached the
peak of their profession through teamwork and compromise, and they
weren't ready to start developing their skills in those areas now.
The working climate rapidly degenerated into one of open conflict.
</P>
<P>
   When the smoke cleared, most of the directors had decamped,
leaving Muller alone at the top. The successful premiere of
``Arturo Ui'' seemed to augur well for Muller's tenure. While he
directed the play, Muller was also writing his own ``Germania 3,''
which deals with Stalin and Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in ``Arturo Ui'' was therefore historical, which
meant his approach was fairly straightforward, at least by the
standards of contemporary German theater: he focused more on the
Nazi past than on reinterpreting the play in terms of the present.
Some German critics who view stage directing as a creative act in
its own right found it too much by the book, too unquestioning in
its presentation of Brecht's tale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the daily newspaper Stuttgarter Zeitung noted, it
``got the strongest applause that's been heard in the Berliner
Ensemble for a long time,'' and some took this as a sign that the
company was entering a new era. This era, however, proved
short-lived. Muller's ``Germania 3'' had its premiere a few months
later, but posthumously; he had died of cancer at the age of 66.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even under Muller, ``Arturo Ui'' was one of only three Brecht
plays actually in repertory at ``Brecht's theater.''
</P>
<P>
   And Muller's successor, for all of his big dreams, wasn't able
to change this. ``I wanted to usher in a new Brecht era,'' says
Martin Wuttke, who took over as artistic director at the age of 33.
``What interests me about Brecht are his tools, in the figurative
sense; his techniques. Heiner Mueller once said, `To use Brecht
without criticizing him is a betrayal.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wuttke may have carried Muller's artistic torch, but the young
actor lacked administrative or directing experience. ``I tried out
in a lot of new jobs that year that I didn't know at all,'' he
says. And, he adds, ``I had problems with Brecht's heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Brecht family still owns the performance rights to
Brecht's plays, Wuttke explains, they have an indirect say in what
the Berliner Ensemble performs: ``You have to apply to Barbara
Brecht-Schall personally, with your wish list of the pieces you
want, the cast you propose, and the director. Her wishes and mine
were too divergent; I got almost nothing. The only piece I got was
`Ozeanflug''' _ ``Ocean Flight'' _ ``directed by Robert Wilson, and
I think that was only because Wilson sent her a bouquet of flowers
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wuttke gave up, embittered, in November 1996, and while an
interim administration took over, the cultural authorities began
casting around for someone with the appropriate stature to fill his
vacated position.
</P>
<P>
   This spring the Berliner Ensemble shut its doors for an
eight-month course of renovations of the aging building: a kind of
artificial coma to help the institution recover from its struggles.
When it reopens in December, it will be under the leadership of
Peymann.
</P>
<P>
   As he wraps up his last season at the Burgtheater, Peymann is
reluctant to comment on his plans for the Berliner Ensemble. In
Berlin, some of the old guard fear that Peymann's new broom may
sweep the Ensemble all too clean. He is known for promoting the
work of contemporary living playwrights like the controversial
Austrian Elfriede Jelinek. But commitment to the new is not
necessarily a turning away from the theater's tradition. Brecht
himself, after all, was an innovator.
</P>
<P>
   Peymann's arrival, furthermore, has caused officials to raise
the theater's annual budget by some $2.6 million, at a time when
most German institutions are tightening their belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly any other director in Germany would have had the clout
to get so much money out of politicians and sponsors,'' Wuttke says
admiringly. ``The Berliner Ensemble used to be a relatively poor
theater; now, it's one of the best-subsidized in Germany. I see
this as very positive. Money is, after all, a force in making
art.''
</P>
<P>
   While Muller's ``Arturo Ui'' production could leave the Berliner
Ensemble's repertory after it plays in California, Wuttke may well
appear in future Berliner Ensemble productions. Peymann, after all,
was his former acting teacher.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Wuttke himself is open to change and new
influences, particularly those he gathers in California. The Goethe
Institute, devoted to promoting German culture worldwide, which is
partly financing the current tour, has approached him about
directing a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately after the tour, I'll start casting, talking to
camera teams,'' Wuttke says, ready to try out yet another new role.
``I hope to have raised the money by this winter.'' After making
such a dramatic entrance _ literally _ onto the California scene,
making movies may be a logical next step.

STARR COULD CALL HILLARY CLINTON AS WITNESS IN HUBBELL TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, may call
Hillary Rodham Clinton as a witness in the criminal trial this
summer of her former law partner, Webster Hubbell, a lawyer
familiar with the case said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision by Starr on whether to seek testimony from the
first lady in the Hubbell trial, scheduled to begin in August in
federal court in Washington has not been reached, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   But the trial will certainly deal with Mrs. Clinton's role as a
lawyer in Little Rock, Ark., in connection with a land deal
criticized as a sham by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   For Mrs. Clinton, the trial could come at an awkward moment,
just weeks after she is expected to announce her candidacy for the
Senate from New York. In addition, Starr and his aides are
considering producing a report on the investigation into the
Whitewater real estate venture and other controversies in which the
First Lady has become embroiled.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell has pleaded not guilty to charges that he sought to
conceal from Federal regulators the role he and Mrs. Clinton played
in a complicated land transaction in Arkansas that helped lead to
the collapse of a savings and loan institution.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, a former chief justice of the State of Arkansas and
once the No. 3 official in the Clinton Justice Department, was
charged with 15 counts of fraud, making false statements and trying
to impede two federal regulatory agencies and with perjury before a
Congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment concerns a real estate development known as
Castle Grande, for which Mrs. Clinton did legal work. The
indictment does not mention Mrs. Clinton by name but refers more
than 30 times to the ``1985-86 billing partner'' on the Castle
Grande account, a description of Mrs. Clinton's role in the
transaction.

PEARCE READY IF INJURED SOBRERO CAN'T GO IN NIGERIA GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When a faxed invitation arrived from the women's
national soccer team, Christie Pearce thought it was a joke. That
was December 1996, and basketball was her primary sport at Monmouth
University in West Long Branch, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer was something she did for fun. Monmouth's women's soccer
team drew about 30 spectators a game, mostly parents, and until her
senior season it did not have its own locker room. If players
wanted their uniforms washed, they did it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce's flight to San Diego to try out for the national team
was only her third plane trip. Not realizing that equipment
managers would handle her gear, she took her own detergent and
fabric softener. When one of her roommates turned out to be Mia
Hamm, she almost panicked. In Pearce's first workout, she nearly
fainted from exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very intimidating, like being a freshman in college all
over again,'' Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   Her teammates knocked her around in practice, testing her, and
they kept asking with puzzled looks where Monmouth was located. Is
it Division III? they wondered. Division I, Pearce kept telling
them. She quickly proved to be one of the fastest and most athletic
players in camp. And on Thursday, on her 24th birthday, her
athleticism may be called upon to defend against frenetic Nigeria
in a Women's World Cup match at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the U.S. lineup may be necessitated by an ankle
injury that central defender Kate Sobrero suffered in practice
Wednesday. Sobrero is fast and combative, and she made an
impressive sliding tackle last Saturday to prevent a goal against
Denmark in the United States' opening 3-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The ankle injury is not serious, team officials said, but a
limping Sobrero might be ineffective against the warp-speed
Nigerian attack in the Americans' second game of the tournament. So
coach Tony DiCicco was forced to consider alternate plans, which
could include Pearce, who has a 30-inch vertical leap, the
experience of having started 30 matches the past two seasons, the
creativity that comes from being a one-time forward and the
one-on-one defensive skills that come from years of playing guard
in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel badly if Kate is not able to play,'' DiCicco said. ``I
don't want to change the defense if we don't have to. But Christie
is very solid. She's one of our fastest players.''
</P>
<P>
   On the advice of a coaching friend, DiCicco scouted one of
Pearce's college matches in the fall of 1996. In basketball, Pearce
set a school record with 79 steals one season. In soccer, she
scored 79 goals in 80 career matches. Unlike millions of other
female soccer players, however, her sporting hero was Patrick
Ewing, not Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce was co-captain of the Monmouth basketball team during the
1996-97 season, which was two months old when DiCicco sent a fax
inviting her to try out with the national team. She had an
immediate and difficult decision to make. Should she stay and
attempt to lead the Hawks to their first post-season tournament
bid? Or should she take a chance on soccer?
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA had yet to tip off, and no one could predict its
stability, so Pearce decided that her future was kicking a ball
instead of dribbling it. In February 1997, she left her basketball
team and accompanied the national soccer team on a trip to
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' said Pearce, who is from Point
Pleasant, N.J. ``I spoke to my whole team. Some understood, some
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   After flying 15 hours home from Australia, Pearce jumped in a
car with her father and drove six hours to play with Monmouth in
the finals of the Northeast Conference basketball tournament. The
Hawks lost, but the immediate disappointment of basketball was
buffered by the World Cup and professional possibilities of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any sport where I was going to go further, it was
going to be soccer,'' Pearce said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday, Pearce walked into Giants Stadium, which was
filled with 78,972 spectators, and ``everywhere I looked, I saw
someone from high school or college.'' One of her former basketball
teammates forwarded a note, wishing her good luck.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, before a sold-out crowd of 65,000 at Soldier Field,
Pearce could find herself playing instead of watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been training for six months,'' she said. ``I'm ready and
I'm excited to play.''

 &HT;    Here's an entertaining thought: Party on the cheap
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Blow off those mavens of style who insist that
you must have champagne and caviar to entertain with flair. Not
true in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where creative spirits run high, you do not have to
have a lot of money to have a lot of style. Look at the many
practioners around you _ the thousands of musicians and 100,000
college students, not to mention all the other folks who do not
have high-dollar, high-tech jobs.
</P>
<P>
   While their funds may be limited, their sense of fun is
boundless. They maximize their strengths, swap their talents and
seek unusual opportunities to entertain smoothly and smartly on a
shoestring.
</P>
<P>
   Even local party pros, when put to the test, can create magic
with a minimum of moolah. It's a matter of rethinking the dollar,
the dinner, the drinks. It's a matter of entertaining Austin-style.
</P>
<P>
   Angelica Bautista and Omar Hernandez, who are among the 12,000
graduate students at the University of Texas, opt to go native _
entertaining with foods from their homelands. Bautista, an
anthropology Ph.D. candidate from Mexico, stirs up chicken mole,
enchiladas called entomatadas, guacamole and rice. Hernandez, a
communications Ph.D. candidate from Venezuela, makes arepas, a
stuffed corn cake resembling a gordita.
</P>
<P>
   Married to Hernandez (they met at Robert Mueller airport more
than five years ago), Bautista says graduate students ``have no
money at all for parties or anything.'' So they either have
potlucks, especially with large groups of 20 to 30, or they cook
the meal and let guests bring drinks.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, Argentine reggae played in their married
student apartment as the couple put together an informal dinner
party for nine for less than $50. Hernandez gave guests a lesson in
arepas, a Venezuelan corn cake made from masa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bag of meal costs $1.59, and you can make a lot of arepas
for that,'' he said as he shaped half-cup balls of dough into
patties for baking either in a skillet or an Oster electric arepa
maker his family gave him.
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, arepas are sold at areperas, cafes that specialize
in these corn sandwiches from breakfast to late night. You can get
them with all kinds of fillings _ beef, cheese, pork, tuna,
chicken, beans _ and it's not uncommon to go for arepas at 5 a.m.
after a night on the town.
</P>
<P>
   This is good comfort food: warm corn cake, crispy on the
outside, soft inside. It is split, buttered and filled with cheese
or a flavorful tuna mixture, spiked with a picante habanero oil for
those who dare.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bautista has dipped corn tortillas in a tomato-sour
cream sauce and filled them with cheese and poblano strips for rosy
enchiladas called entomatadas, which she garnished with chopped
lettuce, sliced radishes and salsa verde.
</P>
<P>
   The couple cooks about three times a week, and friends look
forward to their food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to get together and enjoy seeing each
other,'' Bautista says. In addition to good food, they have music
and often dance.
</P>
<P>
   At Jay Nazz's house, music is a given ingredient in
entertaining. The drummer for Reckless Kelly, an award-winning
alternative country band, Nazz can keep a beat in the kitchen, too.
He entertains his fellow band members and friends with stuffed
pasta shells, a thrifty but tasty pasta dish that feeds 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything I buy is a money issue,'' says Nazz. ``I don't have a
whole lot of money to buy a lot of food, but these recipes don't
take a lot of ingredients. They are the right mixture of
ingredients to give the right taste, an expensive taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazz has been cooking a couple of years now, getting lessons
from his mom, whom he visited recently in North Carolina, picking
up her stuffed artichoke recipe. ``She's an old-school Italian
cook,'' he says. Hence, his stuffed shells specialty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps to cook your mom's things because you know what they
are supposed to taste and look like,'' says Nazz, who has yet to
master her sauce, eggplant Parmesan or lasagne. Those are his next
goals, but touring on the road with the band doesn't allow much
kitchen time.
</P>
<P>
   When the band first started out, Nazz says, they often stayed at
people's houses on tour because the price was right. He and Willy
Braun, the lead singer, would repay their hosts' hospitality by
cooking for them. They also do the cooking for their annual
Christmas party.
</P>
<P>
   Nazz figures he entertains a couple of times a month. Of course
that varies with the tour schedule, and the next couple of months
will find them on the road out West.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark overalls _ one of 16 pairs _ Nazz talks
about garlic and the stuffed mushrooms he made the night before as
he fills jumbo pasta shells with ricotta cheese. The aroma is
wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   He cooks to music. Not Reckless Kelly's _ he hears that all the
time. But more to classical or even the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   Nazz loves this newfound cooking hobby. ``It's calming. And it's
nice to smell those smells I used to smell in my house.''
</P>
<P>
   His friends and band members don't mind, either. It's good food.
Makes for a good party. With a little music, of course.
</P>
<P>

ball of the dough and shape in hands into a circle about 4 inches
in diameter and 1/3 inch thick. Repeat with remaining dough. Heat a
nonstick skillet over medium. Place arepas in skillet and cook like
a pancake until light brown and crispy on both sides. Remove from
skillet and place on racks in 350-degree oven and bake for 10-15
minutes until done through. (Dough also can be cooked in an
electric arepa maker.) Keep warm in a covered basket until ready to
eat.

 &HT;    Digging gently into history
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Their bones have been prayed over and dug
for. Still, the five sailors of the Confederate submarine H.L.
Hunley are missing.
</P>
<P>
   But as early as today, just one more shovelful of dirt could
uncover their whereabouts, solving one of the many mysteries
surrounding the Hunley, the first submarine in naval history to
sink an enemy ship.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeological curiosity and a determination by Confederate
heritage groups to provide proper burial for the Hunley's original
crew are driving this week's search for bones beneath The Citadel's
football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Here in South Carolina, where the flying of the Confederate
battle flag atop the Statehouse in Columbia has caused rancor, a
preacher prayed Wednesday that the search for the Hunley's original
crew would turn out differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope as we move toward the future, we will remember the
past so that we will be delivered from pride or prejudice or
racism,'' the Rev. Leon Thompson told the 20 volunteer diggers,
most belonging to the Sons of Confederate Veterans and other
heritage groups.
</P>
<P>
   Though some wore the red-and-blue emblem of the Rebel battle
flag on caps and shirts, the volunteers said they felt compelled to
dig out of reverence for their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get them home properly,'' said 58-year-old
volunteer Jeanne Weil, a member of the South Carolina Ladies
Auxiliary spending long days underneath Johnson-Hagood Stadium, the
suspected burial site.
</P>
<P>
   Old historical documents and recently conducted
ground-penetrating radar suggested the ``men of the torpedo boat''
who drowned in 1863 were buried in Charleston's old Confederate
naval cemetery. Abandoned in the late 1940s when the city built the
massive steel-and-concrete stadium, now home to The Citadel
Bulldogs, the graveyard is partly underneath the bleachers and
partly in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they are there,'' said Randy Burbage, chairman of
Charleston's Confederate Heritage Trust, which organized the search
for the Hunley sailors. ``But we just haven't found them yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery late Tuesday of two possible burial shafts hasn't
yet panned out in a discovery of remains.
</P>
<P>
   Digging resumes today, after Wednesday afternoon's discovery of
a distinct, 2-foot-wide rectangle of dark brown earth. Hemmed in by
concrete footings for the stadium's girders, the spot resembles the
outline of a grave shaft.
</P>
<P>
   The find came after a backhoe had peeled back a 20-by-60-foot
section of asphalt just inside the stadium's cinderblock back wall.
Workers with blunt-nosed shovels dug carefully through two feet of
fill dirt containing scraps of centuries-old glass and metal, rusty
nails and pork rib bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hiram Walker _ I don't think that is from the Civil War,''
joked 43-year-old volunteer John Dangerfield, holding up a liquor
bottle cap.
</P>
<P>
   A skeleton could lie just inches below the possible burial
shaft, heightening excitement among the volunteers digging in muggy
heat. But deputy state archaelogist John Leader said he doubts that
the possible grave shaft discovered Wednesday belongs to one of the
five Hunley crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Leader said, it probably contains another of the
Confederate sailors or marines buried in the old cemetery,
originally a pauper's field for Charleston sailors.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 excavation discovered 13 Confederate graves under the
stadium's parking lot, near where the third day of searching
resumes today.
</P>
<P>
   Leader is looking for evidence of a trench with four or five
burial shafts. Officials believe that at least four of the Hunley's
victims were buried in a mass grave. It is possible, they say, that
relatives of one of the crewmen buried his body elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of those puzzles of history,'' said Leader, a burly,
bearded researcher who drew onlookers whenever he kneeled to scrap
the sandy brown soil with a wooden-handled trowel. ``We have to
figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hunley tale, like the search for its crew, is laced with
intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   The original crew died in the first of three fatal sinkings of
the cramped 40-foot-long submarine, praised as an engineering
marvel and condemned as a casket of steel.
</P>
<P>
   For the war-ravaged Confederacy, it was a secret, last-ditch
weapon to crack the Union's blockade of Charleston's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The first crew died when human error caused the submarine to
dive before its hatches were fastened. Moored in the harbor, it was
hoisted back to the surface and prepared for a second crew of
eight, who died just months later during a practice dive. Those
sailors are buried in Charleston's Magnolia Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1864, the Hunley made history when it sank the USS
Housatonic, a federal blockade ship. It would be another half
century, during World War I, before another submarine would sink an
enemy ship.
</P>
<P>
   In darkness, Union sailors peppered the Hunley will gunfire as
it approached to detonate explosives against the Housatonic's hull.
Just minutes into its retreat, the submarine and its crew of nine
sank in 30 feet of water four miles off Sullivans Island, near
Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   The historic assault is chronicled in a Turner Network
Television movie, ``The Hunley,'' to air July 11. Organizers of an
ambitious, $20 million project to recover, preserve and display the
submarine in the Charleston Museum hope the national premier will
boost fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the Hunley's discovery in 1995, the recovery project
is backed by state and federal agencies, including the U.S. Navy.
The support of heritage groups has not caused rancor, as did the
Confederate flag debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it deals with the Confederate side,'' said South
Carolina Sen. Glenn McConnell (R-Charleston), who is instrumental
in the Hunley project. ``But it is about history and heritage, not
politics. It is a story that anybody can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   If the two missing Hunley crews _ the one believed to be under
the stadium and the one in the sunken submarine _ can be recovered,
they will be buried in Magnolia Cemetery along with the third
Hunley crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the Hunley project is to reunite the boat and
its crews,'' McConnell said. ``We call it completing the journey.

FOR OWNER OF THE MAIDS, SUCCESS STORY ENDS _ SADLY _ IN BUYOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo. _ Four months ago, I wrote a business feature
about Alice Errett, owner of The Maids franchise in Overland Park,
Kan., who went to extraordinary lengths to hire, train and
transport entry-level workers from Wyandotte County to her cleaning
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The account generated uncommon feedback. Errett earned
amazement, praise and new business from people because of her
commitment to employ the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   She also lost a couple of clients because they learned ``those
people'' were cleaning their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Alice doesn't clean here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Maids International, the Omaha, Neb.-based franchise
company, bought her out and began operating the business last week.
The company retained her long-time assistants, Ron Schmidt and
Andrea Matthes, to handle day-to-day management.
</P>
<P>
   Errett and corporate officers of The Maids differ slightly on
why the change occurred, but all agreed she had a successful
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't force me to sell,'' Errett said, ``and they never
said I was getting bought out because I didn't do things their way
... but I think, under it all, I was a problem child.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have individual operators deciding what to put on
their Big Macs. I wasn't standardized like they were. ... I had a
knock-down-drag-out with them at one point about our hiring.''
</P>
<P>
   After the article appeared about Errett's hiring efforts,
someone at headquarters (Errett said she confirmed the source) sent
a copy of it back to her with the words, ``It's too bad it's come
to this'' written across the page.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Hoeffner, director of The Maids' six _ soon to be seven
_ company-owned franchise locations, said there was nothing behind
Errett's buyout except a company plan, begun in April 1998, to
acquire some of its franchises in ``geographically representative''
locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice was a big sister to us when we opened the Wichita
franchise in 1995,'' Hoeffner said. ``I don't know of any negative
feedback about her franchise. It was her business to run, and she
did it well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Whiting, executive vice president at the Omaha headquarters,
agreed that the company wanted to acquire the key Kansas City area
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alice has been very innovative in what she developed, and
she's done some things we were able to communicate to some of our
other franchises about working with social service agencies and
hiring,'' Whiting said. ``Realistically, I think we can carry that
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett is sure they can. The company-owned shop won't have to
pay itself the 7.1 percent royalties on gross sales that she paid
weekly. Already they've given raises to staff and run an employment
ad worth several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, though, Errett left thinking ``they busted my chops'' for
doing things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she got a great buyout price. There are no income worries
this summer while she takes a break and plays with her son. The
best thing about the buyout, she said, is the freedom to try
something new.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she hopes to head for Albania. She thinks a relief
agency might want project managers who can pay their own way and
help out in postwar rebuilding efforts.

MEXICO'S PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS ARE NEW (OR OLD?) BREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ An entire generation of Mexicans has been governed
by presidents who had never won office before and who were chosen
by their predecessors in part because of their Ivy League
credentials and fluent English.
</P>
<P>
   These presidents, foreign-trained economists, have modernized
the economy while impoverishing the country's working class.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a little-remarked but crucial shift, politicians are
taking over politics again in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike President Ernesto Zedillo (Yale, Ph.D., '78) and his two
predecessors, Carlos Salinas (Harvard, Ph.D., '78) and Miguel de la
Madrid (Harvard, master's, '65), none of the four candidates
currently seeking the presidential nomination of the governing
party known as the PRI, are technocrats. In Mexican usage, a
technocrat is a foreign-trained expert, usually an economist, whose
career has been built in the bureaucracy rather than in party ranks
or in elected posts.
</P>
<P>
   Three are from the PRI's old guard, known as the dinosaurs, and
all are professional politicians. And so are the likely nominees of
Mexico's two main opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of government by technocracy, thank
goodness,'' said Agustin Basave Benitez, a former PRI congressman
who heads the political science department at the local campus of
the Monterrey Technical Institute of Higher Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six candidates seeking the presidential nominations from
the three main parties, only Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who appears
to be Zedillo's preferred candidate, has a profile even remotely
similar to that of Mexico's three most recent presidents. Labastida
was trained in Mexico as an economist, but he does not speak
English and was elected to a state governorship.
</P>
<P>
   His most vigorous rival for the PRI nomination, Roberto Madrazo
Pintado, a lawyer who resigned recently as governor of Tabasco
state, is campaigning to arouse popular anger against the
technocrats and their economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the technocrats is not new. In a 1996 party convention,
rank-and-file members rewrote the rules to require previous
election to some government post as a prerequisite for PRI
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PRI simply could not endure one more technocrat,'' said
Enrique Krauze, a leading Mexican historian. ``The technocrats made
a fetish about having studied in Ivy League schools, as though that
guarantees sound political behavior, but this isn't so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They put Mexico in step with the trends of globalization and
the free market,'' he said. ``But they acted with too much haste
and in some cases tolerated corruption. This is a pity, because now
their policies are under attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions between the technocrats and the traditional
politicians first emerged in the late 1970s under President Jose
Lopez Portillo, when the technocrats advocated more long-term
economic planning, while the politicians urged populist spending of
the country's oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez Portillo followed the advice of the politicians until oil
prices crashed in 1981, forcing a peso devaluation. Then, when
choosing his successor under the Mexican tradition known as the
dedazo, or the tapping of the candidate, Lopez Portillo turned to
de la Madrid, his Harvard-trained budget minister.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute within the PRI over economic policies has continued
intermittently through three presidencies, during which the
technocrats have led Mexico into the North American Free Trade
Agreement, sold off state-owned industries, and eliminated many
government regulations. During the same period, the purchasing
power of the country's minimum wage has eroded to its lowest levels
in decades, according to government figures.
</P>
<P>
   The party split has also focused on how forcefully to resist
opposition parties' electoral advances. When de la Madrid took
office in 1982, the PRI controlled the Congress, and every state
governorship and legislature. Over the years since, opposition
parties have taken control of the Congress and the governments of
Mexico City and 10 of the 31 states.
</P>
<P>
   PRI hardliners who have urged a vigorous defense of the party's
long monopoly on power have been nicknamed dinosaurs because of
their apparent allegiance to a bygone era of authoritarian control.
All three technocrat presidents have ceded ground magnanimously to
the opposition early in their terms, but have switched to tougher
tactics later.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in an attempt to resolve the mounting rivalry between the
PRI's two wings, Zedillo earlier this year voluntarily relinquished
his right to select the PRI candidate. The party has scheduled its
first nationwide primary for Nov. 7 to pick the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Four men registered before a deadline expired last week. Three
are from the party's traditionalist wing. All four earned their
basic degrees at Mexico's National University.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, 46, studied law. He was elected to the Senate and
Congress and has held many senior party posts. He gained popularity
among PRI hard-liners by defying opposition leaders who criticized
his 1994 campaign for governor of Tabasco, when he spent tens of
millions of dollars, dozens of times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Bartlett Diaz, 63, received a law degree from the
National University. He also has a Ph.D. from the University of
Victoria in England. He was elected governor of Puebla, a post he
held until January. Opposition parties accuse him of having
presided over a string of election frauds during his tenure as
Secretary of Interior under de la Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Humberto Roque Villanueva, 55, also has a law degree. He has
served as party president and as the head of the PRI's
congressional delegation. In that post he earned a reputation for
hard-line rhetoric, referring to the center-right and center-left
opposition parties, respectively, as ``fascists'' and
``dictators.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida, 56, holds a Bachelor of Arts in economics from the
National University. He was elected governor of Sinaloa in 1986,
and has also served in the appointed posts of secretary of energy,
agriculture and interior. Since February, analysts have been
calling him the president's preferred candidate, although Zedillo
has never formally endorsed him.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say he appears to be an intermediate figure between the
PRI's traditional politicians and the technocrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida is the best bridge between the PRI's two sectors
that Zedillo could find, because he understands the economy, and he
can also handle political questions,'' said Luis Rubio, a political
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Rubio and others said that Labastida emerged as the favorite
partly because three leading technocrats have resigned or fallen
from political favor during Zedillo's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Serra Puche (Yale, Ph. D., '79) resigned as Zedillo's
first finance secretary amid the peso devaluation in 1994. His
successor, Guillermo Ortiz Martinez (Stanford, Ph. D., '77) was
accused by the opposition of mishandling the $65 billion bank
bailout. Zedillo named him to head the central bank. Angel Gurria
Trevino (Harvard, course work, '75), who succeeded Ortiz as finance
minister, lost his temper last year under questioning by
congressional deputies during a hearing.

presidency,'' said Jaime Sanchez Susarrey, a prominent newspaper

KC COMMUNITY LEADERS HOLD TOWN MEETING ON VIOLENCE FOR PBS
CAMERAS

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With five cameras recording their every word
and movement, about 60 community leaders in Kansas City staged a
town hall meeting Tuesday night at the studios of KCPT, Channel 19.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments will air in edited form on a new PBS program this
fall on combating violence and hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeking Solutions,'' which will air in September, is produced
by Hedrick Smith, who served as moderator for the meeting. Smith is
a Pulitzer Prize-winning former correspondent for The New York
Times and author of several books.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are trying to do is show courageous, compelling
examples of people coming up with solutions to violence in their
community,'' Smith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said his researchers conducted interviews throughout
Kansas City, as well as Boston, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth,
Omaha, Neb., and other cities before deciding on the stories that
would be told in ``Seeking Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those stories involves residents of the Blue Hills
neighborhood in Kansas City in their successful effort to shut down
drug houses. Before the taping, the group watched a 10-minute
segment on Blue Hills that was produced for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The segment concluded with Lillian Anderson, a Blue Hills
resident, saying: ``If you want your neighborhood back, you can get
it back. Remember, there is more of us than them.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith then interviewed selected members of the audience,
including councilman Alvin Brooks and Jim Nunnelly, administrator
of Jackson County's anti-drug COMBAT program.
</P>
<P>
   The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation of Kansas City is
underwriting $200,000 of the $1.5 million to produce ``Seeking
Solutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's company has filmed segments in Kansas City for previous
documentaries. The 1994 series ``Challenge to America'' featured
students from Linden West Elementary School and Blue Springs High
School. The company also filmed at the General Motors Fairfax plant
in Kansas City, Kan.

BRIEFCASE CAUSES BOMB SCARE ON A KANSAS CITY BRIDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAWNA A. HAMEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A brown leather briefcase left on a bridge in
Kansas City Wednesday snarled morning rush-hour traffic for almost
90 minutes until a police robot opened it and found only papers.
</P>
<P>
   A motorist traveling southbound on Interstate 35 about 6:15 a.m.
called 911. He told police he had seen a man put down a briefcase
near the bridge's southbound lanes and walk away, said Sgt. Glen
Rumbaugh, supervisor of the Kansas City Police Department bomb and
arson unit.
</P>
<P>
   Police closed both southbound lanes and one northbound lane.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbaugh said that he was not aware of any bomb threats and that
police rarely shut down an entire bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portions of a bridge may be shut down for a person jumping or
an accident,'' he said, ``but not bombs, and not here.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb unit's new $150,000 robot, Bob, checked out the
briefcase and then forced it open with a high-pressure shot of
water. It contained business papers.
</P>
<P>
   A Wichita, Kan., businessman staying at the Station Casino
called police early Wednesday and reported that his briefcase had
been stolen. Police said they thought the thief dropped it on the
bridge when he found nothing of value in it.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbaugh pointed out that bridges and public buildings ``have
become the targets of terrorists lately, and if what was in that
briefcase really was a bomb, it would have disrupted traffic in
Kansas City for months.''
</P>
<P>
   The 400-pound robot, which was bought this year with a federal
public safety grant, has helped police locate and defuse pipe bombs
and suspicious packages. It also can detect and contain hazardous
chemicals or biohazards such as anthrax or hydrochloric acid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was definitely no danger to any of the bomb technicians,
because Bob did all the work today,'' Rumbaugh said. ``But this
very easily, very easily, could have been an explosive device.
Especially now, at this time of year when all the fireworks are
available, who knows what it could have been.''

NEW JERSEY REGULATORS RENEW LICENSES OF TRUMP'S ATLANTIC CITY
CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Jersey casino regulators Wednesday relicensed Donald Trump's
Atlantic City gambling palaces for four more years, despite concern
over the Trump organization's financial stability and staggering
corporate debt of $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gaming Commission agents were watching closely in New
Jersey. They are reviewing the New York real estate tycoon's
surprise bid earlier this year to buy and operate the troubled
Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can say is we're aware of the financial
situation of Trump and continue to investigate it,'' said Mel
Fisher, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Trump officials in New York and Atlantic City did not return
calls late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey casino regulators concluded that Trump's successful
Taj Mahal and Plaza casinos in Atlantic City were propping up his
troubled Marina casino there and just barely provided adequate cash
flow to support an interlocking ownership web of Trump companies.
</P>
<P>
   Any downturn in the gambling business _ always a worry in
Atlantic City _ could deepen cash shortfalls throughout Trump's
casino empire, said James R. Hurley, chairman of the New Jersey
Casino Control Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is uncertain whether the growth achieved in 1997 and 1998
can be improved upon,'' Hurley said in a lengthy statement before
he recommended that the casino licenses be renewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, (publicly traded parent Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino
Resorts Inc.) and its subsidiaries' cash flow appear to be
sufficient in the aggregate to fund their cash needs through
2001,'' Hurley said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey commission spokesman Dan Heneghan said no one
testified against Trump or registered objections to relicensing of
his casino companies.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding in New Jersey also revealed that Trump later this
year will add $25 million in new long-term corporate debt to
finance his purchase and cosmetic makeover of the Flamingo Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey regulators are forecasting a break-even operation in
Kansas City at best. They also said they didn't expect Trump's
Kansas City operation any time soon to contribute positive cash
flow that could assist the parent firm's financial picture.
</P>
<P>
   Despite $5 million in monthly gross revenue, the Flamingo Hilton
in Kansas City operates at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Hilton Hotels Corp. jumped at Trump's $15 million
purchase offer.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hilton agreed to pay the federal government more
than $500,000 in fines and penalties to avoid a criminal trial on
charges that it provided financial rewards to then-Kansas City Port
Authority Chairman Elbert Anderson in exchange for his political
support for the casino to be built on city-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state government investigations led to fears that
Hilton would have been fined, suspended or stripped of its Missouri
license by the Missouri Gaming Commission. If so, other
jurisdictions with Hilton casinos probably would have taken their
own disciplinary actions against the company, jeopardizing the
viability of the billion-dollar, worldwide gambling and hospitality
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Trump offered Hilton an expedient way out, despite the
Flamingo's $100 million construction price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Beverly Hills, Calif., company agreed to voluntarily
surrender its Missouri gambling license when its riverboat is sold
to Trump Hotels &AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. and Trump receives its state
gambling license.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher on Wednesday would not set a timetable on when Missouri
might be ready to open public hearings on Trump's license
application.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Kansas City Port Authority last week approved
assigning the Flamingo's lease to a local firm controlled by Trump.
Under that deal, Trump Kansas City LLC would hold the lease and
operate the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Lease terms include more than $30 million in rent payments owed
to Kansas City through 2006.

BELGIUM ENDS BAN ON COCA-COLA PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The Belgian health authorities ended a
10-day ban Wednesday on products of Coca-Cola Co., permitting it to
resume production in Belgium of sodas that were blamed for 249
cases of vomiting, cramps and other illnesses that shattered
European confidence in the world's best-known brand.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola welcomed the relaxation, promised a Coke giveaway here
in coming days, offered to pay the medical costs of anyone who
became ill and reiterated the company's contention that its sodas
are safe. But in a Continent riven by scares over the safety of
supermarket products ranging from genetically modified soybeans to
contaminated chicken, it remained doubtful that the heavyweight
public relations campaign by the company and its chief executive,
M. Douglas Ivester, had stilled Europe's mistrust. The Belgian
authorities said they still had not determined the exact cause of
the sickness that led to the biggest recall in Coca-Cola's 113-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Coca-Cola's problems appeared to worsen in France.
Belgian officials said a ban on imports of Coca-Cola products from
a plant in Dunkirk, France, would be maintained until the French
authorities had finished their inquiries into contamination there _
including unconfirmed reports that rat poison might have been the
cause. Some 28,000 Coca-Cola product vending-machines in Belgium
were also to remain out of action until checked for impurities.
</P>
<P>
   To end the ban, Coca-Cola agreed to five Belgian conditions
relating to cleanliness and safety standards. Ivester said that
production would resume immediately and that he expected Coca-Cola
products to be back in Belgian stores within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But even as he announced plans to buy everyone in Belgium a Coke
and was photographed drinking from a bottle of Coke at a news
conference, questions persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Van den Bossche, Belgium's interior minister who is also in
charge of public health, said at a news conference that Brussels
did not accept the Atlanta-based company's explanations for what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche also suggested that some people might have been
too quick to assume that Coca-Cola was the cause of their symptoms.
He called it ``an unintentional overreaction on the part of the
exposed persons.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite earlier indications that France might lift its ban on
Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta, the company's best-sellers in both
countries, French officials said the restrictions remained in
force. The outcome of a separate inspection of Coca-Cola plants in
Belgium by the European Union remained unclear, as did the future
of restrictions on Coca-Cola products in Luxembourg and the
Netherlands. Portugal, Italy, Spain and Germany are also conducting
investigations into scares relating to Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In a further twist, Van den Bossche disclosed Wednesday that
Belgium's investigation had been slowed by a previously secret
inquiry into whether the contamination of Coca-Cola products in
Belgium was linked to a murky extortion attempt last May in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The purported blackmailer, the Belgian minister said, threatened
to contaminate Coke if he was not paid ``several million marks.''
But inquiries established that ``there was no link between what
happened in Germany and what happened here,'' Van den Bossche said
at the news briefing, where he spoke from a table festooned with
small bottles of Coke _ a statement of public confidence in public
health marred only by his smoking of several cigarettes in front of
the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche took over the public health portfolio after the
Belgian government collapsed on June 13 in a scandal over the
contamination of animal feeds by the cancer-causing chemical dioxin
that led to the withdrawal of a wide array of poultry and meat.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's crisis began on June 7 when 30 schoolchildren
reported illnesses linked to drinking Coke with what Ivester, in
his first public appearance since the scare began, called an
``off-taste and an off-smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche said that the symptoms of the illnesses included
``stomach ache, dizziness, cramps, vomiting, nausea and in some
cases hyperventilation'' but that there was no clear pattern. Some
who became ill reported having drunk from bottles of Coke and
others from cans of Coke, sugar-free Coke and Fanta. The reports of
illness were spread among the towns of Bornem, Bruges, Harelbeke
and Lochristi.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian official said the company had highlighted two
problems _ contaminated carbon dioxide used at a bottling plant in
Antwerp and the contamination of the outside of cans transported on
wooden pallets. However, he said, there was no ``conclusive
evidence'' of a link between those problems and the symptoms
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most plausible hypothesis for explaining the problems that
have arisen over the past few weeks is the occurrence of an
accident during production or transport,'' Van den Bossche said. He
also said there was only a ``remote chance that the root causes of
these problems will ever occur again if the root causes of the
incident are taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   He listed five conditions for the resumption of Coca Cola
production: the use of fresh raw materials; thorough cleaning of
plants and installations; enhanced safety measures; the
introduction of a monitoring system for production, products and
complaints, and the ``removal and disposal'' of products that may
have been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola plants in Antwerp and Ghent ``may resume production of
all Coca-Cola brands,'' he continued, while imports from the plant
in Dunkirk will remain banned pending French investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, appearing at a separate news conference in Brussels,
surrounded by security staff, translators and executives, reacted
to criticism that Coca-Cola was slow in responding to the crisis.
Asked if he would resign, he said he would not, and he said he had
maintained an initial public silence at the request of the Belgian
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately set about promoting the messages Coca-Cola will
apparently use to restore confidence. ``Nothing is more important
than protecting the public health,'' he said. ``Our products are
completely safe, both in Belgium and worldwide.'' He dismissed the
reports of rat poison in Dunkirk as a rumor and said: ``It is
doubtful to me that that is an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to say how much the European crisis had cost but
said the company had used an ``abundance of caution'' in responding
to it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said customers would be invited to return Coca-Cola
products to retailers for refunds. ``I think one of the first
things I'll do is buy everyone in Belgium a Coke,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those people who got sick will be able to apply to have medical
expenses reimbursed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also gave his first public explanation of the problem,
saying that sulfur used in the production of carbon dioxide _ the
source of the bubbles in sodas _ had not been cleansed as it should
have been. He acknowledged that since the company supplying the
carbon dioxide, Aga Gas of Sweden, had insisted that its supplies
were uncontaminated, ``it could have been something in the
handling'' that caused contamination. And he said wooden pallets
had been contaminated with creosote, contrary to company rules
forbidding its use.
</P>
<P>
   Several large Coca-Cola bottlers said Wednesday that the events
in Europe had had no effect on their business in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think generally people in the United States are not aware of
it,'' said Cookie Rice, a bottler in Springfield, Mo.

GUN SHOP OWNER'S VIEWS MAKE HIM UNPOPULAR...WITH GUN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK and TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The telephone has been ringing nonstop at Bob
Lockett's Overland Park, Kan., gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   One minute it is an invitation from a television network. The
next it's an anonymous threat.
</P>
<P>
   The callers don't want to buy a rifle. They want to quiz Lockett
about his views on the gun industry, views that in some ways sound
as if they are coming from an anti-gun activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another day at the office,'' Lockett said Wednesday
as he put down the receiver from yet another debate over firearms
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Lockett, general manager of a business called
the Second Amendment, may not be well-known to the typical Kansas
Citian. Inside the gun industry, however, he has become famous, and
not real popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the truth as I know it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockett is referring to a column he wrote recently for an
industry publication called Shooting Sports Retailer. In general,
he calls on the gun industry to do some cleaning up and tightening
down.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers should better control the marketing of their
products by establishing formal relationships with dealers and
setting rules for who buys from them, he said. The sale of weapons
to teen-agers at gun shows should stop, added Lockett, who has
written for the magazine before.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the latest column, which has not been published yet,
spread widely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's caused an immediate explosion of conversation
and concern by the industry,'' said Robert Hodgdon, a Johnson
County, Kan., businessman who is an advocate of gun rights and a
former board member of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially, said Hodgdon, Lockett's views could aid the efforts
of cities challenging the gun industry in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Bob probably would not want that result,''
Hodgdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who make and sell weapons are under siege these days, with
lawsuits facing them on the one side and the possibility of tougher
regulation from Congress on the other.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the industry often appears united. Self-criticism,
if any, usually is kept from public view. Lockett's transgression,
in the industry's view, has been to haul the dirty laundry out into
the open.
</P>
<P>
   Some consider him a grandstander, although Lockett says he has
no desire to testify in court and has not been asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Some say his proposals are just plain wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the column, Elizabeth Saunders, president and
chief executive officer of American Derringer Co., said: ``I don't
agree with that at all. I think it's an infringement on our rights,
period. The Bill of Rights is the Bill of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Saunders: ``The problem is with the criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Samuel, show director for Missouri Valley Arms Collectors,
which runs two gun shows a year in Kansas City, said the Columbine
High School killers in Colorado broke many laws.
</P>
<P>
   He asked: Would another law have stopped them?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be politically correct instead of doing
what should be done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel warned that Lockett's proposals would reduce competition
and harm some gun shops and gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   It is argued that if manufacturers severely limited the
distribution of their weapons, higher prices might result and gun
store profits could increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lockett discounts the possibility. He said changes at gun shows
would not enhance his profits. Visitors to gun shows don't go to
gun shops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tight relationships between dealers and gun manufacturers would
not be realistic, said Kevin Jamison, a Kansas City lawyer who
concentrates in weapons and self-defense law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think as a legal and practical matter that it's
possible,'' he said. ``And if it did happen, I don't think it would
do any good. I can't see it ending the problem of criminals having
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockett does not necessarily advocate more laws. He stands far
away from the those who criticize guns.
</P>
<P>
   Second Amendment sells a full range of handguns, rifles and
shotguns. One shotgun crafted with gold inlay and fine wood carries
a price of $36,900.
</P>
<P>
   Lockett strongly supports the right of people to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out, however, that in the past the liquor industry
and the tobacco industry encountered stern public admonishment.
They changed the way they operated.
</P>
<P>
   Society is changing, and so should the gun industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see more professionalism within the ranks of
the industry, from the retailer base through the distributors to
the manufacturers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If manufacturers worked closer with dealers, the underground
sale of weapons could be slowed, he says.
</P>
<P>
   With guns generating so much news lately, Lockett's views of his
industry are in high demand. The Wall Street Journal this week
wrote an article about him. Television networks invited him to go
on various shows. Offers came in to publish his upcoming column on
the World Wide Web. Newspapers telephoned.
</P>
<P>
   One reporter visiting the gun shop was told by a clerk, ``You're
on the list right after `Good Morning America.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Customers, Lockett said, have been supportive.
</P>
<P>
   But an anonymous man, claiming to be on the board of a gun
organization, called with a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said they would get me. I thanked him very much,'' Lockett
said. ``I listened to the guy for 20 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The criticism, he said, will not be a deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job as a retailer, he said, ``to ensure that I'm doing
all that I can to protect the assets of this industry.''

WITH WAR OVER, CLINTON RENEWS FIGHT FOR HIS DOMESTIC AGENDA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the conflict in Kosovo more or less behind him
and impeachment a fading memory, President Clinton is eager to
reassert himself in the familiar realms of domestic policy and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides described the president, who returned from a
weeklong trip to Europe early Wednesday, as eager to shed the
unaccustomed mantle of wartime commander and to devote his full
energies over the next several weeks to what he truly loves:
verbally punishing Republicans over domestic policy matters like
gun control and health care.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of war and scandal, Clinton has had
little space lately in which to exercise his powers of public
persuasion on domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   But starting on Friday with an address to a group of
presidential scholars, Clinton hopes to focus public attention on a
long list of pent-up proposals, from an increase in the minimum
wage to tax credits for poor neighborhoods. As his tenure in office
winds down, the president is returning to more traditional
Democratic themes that he had until now largely muted in an effort
to fashion a third way between the orthodoxies of the dominant
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in a long time, the decks are clear for
resetting the agenda and defining the universe of the possible,''
said Joel Johnson, the newly appointed senior adviser to the
president for policy and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three weeks, Clinton plans to unveil a Medicare
proposal with a popular new prescription drug benefit and to travel
the country recycling a number of tax-cut proposals and spending
initiatives from his State of the Union message in January.
Presidential aides expressed hope that the Republican-run Congress
will enact some of Clinton's proposals, but they seem perfectly
content to use legislative gridlock as a weapon of partisan
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the proposals the president plans to reintroduce, like a
big school-construction tax credit, have already been rejected by
Congress, and there appears little prospect for passage now. But
the White House hopes to salvage a compromise gun-control measure
from two very different bills passed this month by the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to propose their own Medicare plan with less
generous benefits than the president's and also hope to enact a
broader set of tax cuts than the president supports.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also be trying to advance the political ambitions
of his wife and his vice president, as well as raising millions of
dollars to help Democrats regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant initiatives that the president will push in
coming weeks are a plan to try to ensure the long-term solvency of
Medicare and proposals to bring private sector investment to the
nation's poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between promotion of those policies will be several
fund-raising forays, visits with leaders from South Korea, Egypt
and Israel, announcement of the removal of the bald eagle from the
list of threatened species and an undetermined number of photo
opportunities to attack Republicans for quashing a gun-control bill
in the House and for bottling up new regulations governing health
maintenance organizations in the Senate. The White House sees those
as hanging curve balls that Clinton intends to swat out of the
political park _ repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   In his State of the Union address, Clinton proposed setting
aside 15 percent of anticipated federal budget surpluses over the
next decade to shore up Medicare, the government health plan for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has delayed release of its plan as it
struggles to reconcile competing political and financial interests
behind one of the most popular programs of guaranteed benefits to
all who qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is set to release his plan next Tuesday, meeting his
self-imposed deadline of the end of June by one day. Aides were
stingy with details, saying the president had not yet approved the
final provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a universal, affordable benefit that will ask
Medicare beneficiaries to pay a modest premium for benefits that
are substantially better,'' John Podesta, the White House chief of
staff, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The ``modest premium'' is a monthly cost that Medicare
beneficiaries will be asked to pay for prescription drug coverage,
expected to fall somewhere between $20 and $90 a month, with a
partial subsidy for the poorest recipients. But Podesta would not
be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit seems popular with the elderly and abhorred by
the pharmaceutical industry, which sees it as a wedge for
government price controls. It is certain to set off a ferocious
fight on Capitol Hill that will almost certainly continue well into
the 2000 campaigns for Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, eyeing his legacy, will spend four days in early July
touring depressed regions of the country, traveling from eastern
Kentucky to the Mississippi Delta to a South Dakota Indian
reservation to the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. The trip
comes late in his second term because Clinton has not been willing
before now to draw attention to the pockets of poverty that belie
the nation's general prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the president's anti-poverty plan is to inspire
private businesses to increase investment in what the president
likes to call ``untapped markets'' within the borders of the United
States. He has proposed a set of tax initiatives to help companies
open businesses in depressed areas and bring the fruits of the
economic expansion to the regions it passed by.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A subtext of those visits is the nation's continuing racial
friction and the uneven economic performance of minorities in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real reflection of how the president looks at the
world,'' Podesta said. ``He wants to use the mechanism of
government to encourage partnership with the private sector to
spread the benefits of the great economy we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said these programs, modeled on federal programs to spur
private investment in less-developed nations overseas, attract
bipartisan support and have a chance to win passage in the current
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Podesta also said that the president intended in coming weeks to
redeem some promises from the State of the Union and other
policy-setting speeches. Among them are a planned lawsuit against
tobacco companies to recover billions of dollars in federal health
care costs related to smoking, proposed tax credits for child care
and medical costs arising from long-term illnesses and a $5 billion
program to finance school construction.

QWEST TO SWEETEN OFFERS FOR US WEST AND FRONTIER

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Qwest Communications International announced Wednesday that it
would sweeten its unsolicited offers for both US West, the smallest
of the regional Bell telephone companies, and Frontier Corp., one
of the nation's largest long-distance companies, only days after
both companies had spurned its advances.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nacchio, Qwest's chief executive, said he was upping the
unsolicited offers the company made last week in an effort to bring
the already-betrothed companies to the bargaining table. Last
March, Frontier Corp. agreed to be acquired for $10.8 billion by
Global Crossing, Qwest's rival, which is also in the race to expand
telecommunications networks overseas. Global also agreed to merge
with US West last month in a deal valued then at $37 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Both Qwest and Global are communications industry upstarts vying
for old-line phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Nacchio threatened to break up those mergers last week in a
hostile offer valued at $55 billion for the two companies. Qwest's
stock price dove 24 percent on June 14 after investors panned the
offer. In Qwest's revised bid, Nacchio proposed that Frontier
shareholders would get $20 in cash and $48 in Qwest stock if it
agreed to be acquired by Qwest; US West shareholders would get $69
in Qwest stock.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he said he was offering shareholders what the two
boards had hinted at wanting _ downside protection in case Qwest's
stock plummets further. Qwest has guaranteed those offers in stock
or cash as long as shares do not fall below $30.50. But that is not
much protection, given where Qwest's stock is currently trading.
Qwest's shares closed Wednesday at $32.5625, $2.75 less than
Tuesday's closing price but only 6.3 percent above $30.50.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Frontier shareholders would get $63 per share in
Global Crossing stock, and US West shareholders would get about $61
in stock based on Global's stock price Wednesday. That offer, too,
has downside protection in case Global's stock falls. But, unlike
Qwest's shares, Global's stock is currently trading well above the
bottom of that range. It closed Wednesday at $45.875, down $1.5625.
The Frontier deal is also expected to close in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have what Qwest and Global Crossing need to grow
_ cash and customers. The two-year-old Qwest has been around longer
and is further along in its plans to develop a global network than
is Global Crossing, which went public barely a year ago. Most of
Global's plans are still on the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   But because US West and Frontier already have merger agreements
with Global, they are barred from talking to Qwest unless their
boards decide that Qwest's offer is ``superior.'' Both US West and
Frontier said they were in receipt of the revised Qwest proposals
and would review them.
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio sounded highly confident that his bid would win, despite
the criticism he has faced recently from analysts and shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listened to our shareholders,'' he said. ``I think it's time
for their boards to listen. If they've been honest about what their
concerns are, I see no reason why they wouldn't open the door and
let us in.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Nacchio's supporters maintain that the battle between
Qwest and Global is not personal, at times Nacchio sounded almost
defiant, as if he were challenging his upstart rival. When one
reporter asked if Nacchio would be interested in acquiring Global
Crossing for its international assets, for instance, he scoffed.
``Let's face it, all Global Crossing has is one cable under the
sea,'' he said. ``I don't need 200 employees and a couple of vice
chairmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Nacchio admitted Wednesday that when Qwest made the first offer
last week, executives had ``guessed wrong'' about what shareholders
and the board would be willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we been able to have a discussion, we could have crafted
this in a different way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is now unclear is what steps the US West and Frontier
boards will take.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, warned that in a deal
like this, with the stocks so volatile, it could still take many
weeks for a real winner to emerge. ``I think it brings him more to
a level playing field,'' said Burnett. ``But it's not a clear
enough overbid. It does demonstrate how determined Nacchio is and
that he's willing to stick around.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Global Crossing said it would not revise its
offer.

MARINES AND SERBS EXCHANGE FIRE IN SOUTHEASTERN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs grafs 4 thru 6 to add that French forces were fired
on.)

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZEGRA, Yugoslavia _ Local Serbs in civilian clothes opened fired
Wednesday night on a checkpoint manned by U.S. Marines here,
provoking a firefight that killed one Serb and wounded two others,
one severely, American officials here said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth Serb was arrested after the Marines, backed by armored
vehicles and helicopter gunships, ended an hour-long standoff by
storming a house where the Serbs had retreated, the commander of
the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, Col. Kenneth Glueck, said. No
Marines were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The firefight erupted just after 6 p.m. in this village in
southeastern Kosovo that has been roiled by tensions between Serbs
and Albanians. The gunfire underscored the ongoing volatility of
NATO's operation in Kosovo, 12 days after the first peacekeepers
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   French forces, who are still establishing their position in the
north, were fired at Wednesday in the town of Mitrovica, but
escaped injury. A Serb was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the uneasy position of trying to control ethnic
frictions not only between Serbs and Albanians, but also between
Gypsies and the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire in Zegra was the second time American troops came
under direct fire. On Monday night, soldiers from the 82d Airborne
Division were fired on near the city of Urosevac, though they did
not return fire and no one was injured. Three people were detained
in that incident.
</P>
<P>
   Zegra is a small, remote village south of Gnjilane, where,
unlike other cities and villages, many Serbs have remained after
the withdrawal of Yugoslavia's Serb-dominated army and police
units. Marines have manned checkpoints there for more than a week.
Last Thursday they disarmed a company of fighters from the Kosovo
Liberation Army in the village, seizing scores of weapons and
arresting six KLA leaders after they paraded through in a show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of a hot spot between the two factions,''
Glueck said at the Marines' headquarters on a hilltop near the
village of Cernica.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the streets were dark and deserted, but
gunshots could still be heard in the distance. ``They're firing
like crazy tonight,'' one Marine said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why the Serbs opened fire on the checkpoint,
which was on the main road through Zegra. There were some two dozen
Marines in the area, near a schoolhouse they have turned into a
field headquarters, but there had been no apparent signs of new
tensions. A firefight raged for several minutes, until the Serbs,
already wounded, fell back into a house not far from the road.
</P>
<P>
   When reinforcements arrived, including the armored fighting
vehicles, the Marines surrounded the house, while Cobra helicopters
hovered overhead. Serbian translators, using megaphones, tried to
defuse the situation by telling those inside to give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave them an opportunity to surrender,'' Glueck said.
After nearly an hour, the Marines stormed the building. The two
wounded Serbs were taken by helicopter to the Army's field hospital
near Urosevac, some 15 miles away. Colonel Glueck said he believed
that one or two more Serbs had escaped. ``They faded into the
crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Yugoslavia's army and special police have withdrawn
from Kosovo, NATO has been trying to impose order on the province.
On Tuesday, NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said that
the allies needed to move more quickly to build up their forces.
NATO now has 20,000 troops, but officials said it could take until
late July before the entire contingent of more than 50,000 arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The commander of the American sector, Brig. Gen. John Craddock,
said Wednesday that the United States now had 4,500 of its
contribution of 7,000 troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops have by and large been welcomed by Kosovo's Albanian
majority, but their biggest challenge has been defusing
confrontations between Serbs and the Albanians who are returning
home in droves after fleeing President Slobodan Milosevic's
crackdown this spring. Rarely have NATO troops faced direct
military challenges to their authority, but military commanders
here say there is little they can do to disarm the entire country,
making incidents like the one Wednesday a lingering threat.
</P>
<P>
   Glueck said military police would investigate the incident, but
he ruled out aggressive action to root out weapons in Zegra or
elsewhere. ``If we know where the guns are, we'll go after them,''
he said, ``but we're not going to go house to house.''

 &HT;    Waddell: `Things happen for a reason'
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there is no sense of intimidation as the
franchise's two most crucial days approach, it is because Don
Waddell believes that when you're in control, you have no reason to
be fearful. ``You're only afraid when there's things you have no
control over,'' he says, and drafts don't qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Thrashers' success in their inaugural NHL season
will hinge on an expansion draft Friday, and the future will be
tied in part to a selection of amateurs the following day. But
Waddell, the Thrashers' general manager, feels no uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is when your father disappears, leaving your mother to
raise five children alone in a two-bedroom house in an open sore of
a neighborhood in Detroit. Fear is when a race-fueled riot erupts
in your high school, and somebody grabs you and shoves you in a
library safe for protection. Fear is when you have a gun held to
your head _ twice _ while working at a convenience store, or a
stick is jammed in your eye in a summer hockey league and it nearly
blinds you.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL club that won't recall you from the minors even though
you scored 95 points as a defenseman, the torn knee cartilage in a
pre-Olympic tournament that prevents you from playing on the most
famous U.S. hockey team in history _ those are things you can't
control.
</P>
<P>
   Not player drafts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I've had some very high moments and very low
moments,'' Waddell said. ``But things happen for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell was hired as the general manager a year ago. His
unlikely evolution to that position started with a telephone call
in February 1987. He had played what he believed was his final
hockey game for the IHL's Toledo Goaldiggers the previous spring
and had gone into private business.
</P>
<P>
   Portable toilets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're in a start-up business, there's two things you
want to know: 'Can you afford it, and is there a need for it?' ''
Waddell said. The answer to both was yes. Waddell started with 50
units _ the official term _ and five years later the business had
grown to 1,500. He was flush with success.
</P>
<P>
   But everything happens for a reason. The phone call was from a
desperate general manager for the Flint Spirits. ``He says, `I need
you to play. I only have 11 players.' I said, `When's the game.' He
says, `Three o'clock.' Now, it's 11, and I'm two hours away. I hung
up the phone and I asked my wife, `Do you want to go to a hockey
game tonight?' She says, `Sure, where?' I said, `Flint. By the way
I'm playing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell grabbed his skates, which he hadn't worn for 10 months,
drove through for some fast food and headed to Michigan. ``As
they're playing the national anthem, I'm lacing up my skates,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the story goes: Flint convinces Waddell to stay on
for the remainder of the season (10 games), then come back the
following year as player/assistant coach, then stay for two more as
head coach and general manager. A hockey executive is born.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell went on to start an IHL expansion franchise in San Diego
and build a winner, leading to another job with Orlando, leading to
the assistant general manager's job with the Stanley Cup champion
Detroit Red Wings and a year later had his name engraved on the
trophy. It was a nice contrast to his playing days, which included
seven years in the minors, one in Europe and one lone NHL game _
with Los Angeles against the New York Rangers in 1980-81. On his
first shift, he got bumped by a teammate, and Ranger defenseman Ron
Greschner skated around him and scored.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ranger Tom Laidlaw, Waddell's college roommate, said,
``After the goal, Don sat down on the bench, then he went back to
the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell actually hung around with L.A. a few weeks but never
suited up and finally asked to be sent back to Saginaw. The
following year, he was named the IHL's best defenseman, with 26
goals and 69 assists. But the Kings never called.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep thinking you're going to get another chance down the
road,'' Waddell said. ``It probably didn't hit me until I was in my
30s when I thought, `Well, when you open the record books, my name
will be there. There's a lot of zeroes there, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell is thankful today he can read those zeroes. In 1984, he
returned to Detroit for the summer after playing in Germany.
Against his better judgment, he accepted a friend's invitation to
play in a summer hockey league. ``The guy begged me to play because
I was well-known in the area. The problem with those leagues is
there's always some guy who wants to make a name for himself by
taking a shot at somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   First game, first period. Waddell caught the butt-end of a stick
in his left eye. He suffered a fractured orbit, detached retina,
torn muscles and several cuts. He needed two major surgeries and
wore patches on both eyes for 20 days in the hospital. He was told
he would never play again, but was back on the ice five months
later.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if there were any lingering problems today, Waddell
joked, ``Yeah. I can't see the ice more than 100 feet in front of
me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has learned to deal with setbacks. As a player, in addition
to the eye injury, he came within weeks of playing on the 1980 U.S.
gold-medal team. He was a collegiate All-Star twice at Northern
Michigan University but broke a leg as a junior, again as a senior,
made the Olympic team anyway, then injured a knee just before the
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 20 years old, you don't realize what a big part
that would play in U.S. hockey history. I was disappointed. But I
was happy for those players.''
</P>
<P>
   He watched the gold-medal clincher alone in his dorm room. ``I
cried a little, but it was happiness, not bitterness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Waddell, the person, has overcome more than injury. His
father, Tom, was gone most days, laying pipe for the gas company.
When Don, the fourth of five children, was 10, Tom left for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He decided to leave his wife and kids and ran away with
another woman,'' Waddell said. ``Three hours after he leaves, he
gets into a car accident that kills the woman and leaves him
crippled. How's that for a story? You didn't know whether to feel
angry or sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Waddell worked two jobs to keep her children clothed,
fed and in hockey and Catholic school. Tom Waddell was an alcoholic
with permanent spinal damage and rarely had contact with the
family. Don once went five years without seeing him until Tom
surprisingly showed up one day at NMU Marquette.
</P>
<P>
   Some emotional wounds eventually healed, but Tom's health
worsened. Cancer struck in his throat and stomach. Chemotherapy
didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody showed up for dad's funeral,'' Waddell said. ``He
was 40-something years old living in a nursing home. But he looked
like he was 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell paused, then added, ``For all this to happen to me and
to be sitting here doing this, I'm fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Waddell prefers not to say he was poor growing up. But put it
this way: When he was 12, a local hockey coach wanted him to play
for a traveling all-star team. ``He shows up and sees six of us
living in this two-bedroom house,'' Waddell said. ``We didn't have
what you would call upscale furniture. A week later, he sends my
mother a couch.''
</P>
<P>
   That house on Auburn Street is gone. It was torched one New
Year's Eve by rowdy parties, fortunately when nobody was in it.
Waddell: ``I was the happiest guy in the world because it forced
her to get out of the city.'' Everything happens for a reason. The
son helped purchase a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Living in the inner city had its dangers. Cody High School,
which Waddell attended for two years before transferring to Bishop
Borgess, was rife with racial tensions and the scene of a riot his
freshman year. ``I went to pick him up from school,'' Jacqueline
said, ``and there were five or six of us who were put in a safe
until the National Guard came.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline also remembers one time when the Open Pantry, where
Don was working, was held up and a gun was pointed at her son's
head. Waddell said it happened twice. Jacqueline: ``I'm sure he
didn't tell me everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He also didn't tell her about the 10 times a year he hitchhiked
450 miles from the Northern Michigan campus on the Upper Peninsula
to Detroit and back because his car couldn't make it that far.
Despite the transportation problems, Waddell excelled in hockey at
NMU _ he is a member of the school's sports hall of fame _ and
earned a degree in business.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers president Harvey Schiller said he was impressed that
Waddell ``had done everything in hockey from taping ankles to
driving the Zamboni,'' and it's not far from the truth. In San
Diego, he accepted a job as GM and was announced at a news
conference the same day, although he was informed just before
entering the room that the media expected an announcement on an NHL
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he mentioned the IHL at the press conference,'' Cheryl
said, ``you could sort of see everybody's shoulders kind of
slump.''
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the San Diego owner told Waddell that
the team had no offices and left town before ever telling him his
salary. A month passed before Waddell signed a contract. He didn't
hire a coach until a week before training camp. The next year, the
coach was fired in a cost-cutting move, and Waddell named himself
as replacement. But the Gulls did well, winning a record 62 games
in his third season. Waddell was named IHL Executive of the Year,
an achievement he duplicated in Orlando when his first-year Solar
Bears went to the league finals. That was enough for Detroit
general manager Ken Holland, who hired Waddell as his assistant a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he remained in relative obscurity until Schiller selected
him over NHL vice president Brian Burke, Dallas assistant Les
Jackson and others to head the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That didn't bother me,'' Waddell said. ``My background makes
me believe if you do a good job, you'll be rewarded for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiller viewed him as a problem-solver. No wonder. Jacqueline
still remembers the time her car broke down on the way to work and
she called Don, then 16, for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a ride to work and asked Don if he could jump the car
with a friend,'' she said. ``When he showed up at work, he had his
car and my car. Know what he did? He started my car, drove it for
two blocks, got out, drove his car for two blocks, then my car,
then his. He must've done that for 2 1/2 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   It was never a problem. Don Waddell was in control.

 &HT;    Confident Jones sets lofty goals: 5 golds
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ It's not enough that she's been ordained the best
sprinter of her era. It's not enough that her style is so
distinctive that it can be spotted on any track, her torso as erect
as a drill sergeant's, a gold chain bounding from her neck, her
thick thighs concealed under a conservative one-piece lycra outfit
and cycling shorts. It's not enough that she has charisma Michael
Johnson would die for, a stage presence and a smile that Nike will
milk through the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Marion Jones just has to go where no track athlete, man or
woman, has ever gone _ winning five gold medals in an Olympic
Games. To her, it is hardly an impossible dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five gold medals is not just talk,'' Jones said confidently.
``It's possible. If any athlete can do it, it's myself. I was born
with a lot of talent, but I'm also a hard worker. I love to be on
top.''
</P>
<P>
   In the insular world of track and field, Jones' potential has
never been a secret. She was a schoolgirl record-breaker in the 200
before taking leave to play point guard for the North Carolina
basketball team. Then last year, her second full season on the
track circuit, Jones ended with a No. 1 world ranking in the 100
and 200 meters and the long jump. She became the first American to
reign over three events in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Later this summer, she is expected to win gold in all three
individual events, plus gold for a leg on the 400-meter relay, in
the World Championships in Seville, Spain. In Sydney next year, the
grand design calls for her also to run a leg on the 1,600 relay.
</P>
<P>
   Can she go 5-for-5 on the Olympic stage? Perhaps, if she doesn't
stumble in the long jump, where her technique lags considerably
behind her speed.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney is more than a year off. Injuries can flare up. Fresh
stars might rise or old stars reappear.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the rush to coronate a new queen is Gail Devers, 32,
two-time defending Olympic 100-meter champion and a hurdler who is
not about to step aside. She hasn't been heard from lately, sitting
out to nurse a hamstring injury while Jones won 35 of 36 finals
last year and dropped her 100 time to 10.65 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But Devers is back, keenly aware that her new challenger has
raised the level of competition beyond what she faced from Merlene
Ottey and Gwen Torrence in the last two Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not driven by other people's goals,'' said Devers.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, however, would welcome a rival, someone to push her
closer to world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of sad last year because she had the injuries, but
if Gail's in a race, I know I'm going to up my performance and run
faster,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The stars will not collide when the U.S. Track and Field
Championships begin today with heats in the 100 meters. The meet
serves as a qualifier to the World Championships, and Jones has
elected to skip the 100 and accept a pass into the worlds as
defending champion there. This week, she'll look to qualify for the
worlds in the 200 and long jump, while Devers competes in the 100
dash and 100 hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge of amassing five golds in Sydney is immense. Carl
Lewis (1984) and Jesse Owens (1936) never won more than four in a
single Games. Florence Griffith Joyner won three in 1988. Michael
Johnson, the standout in Atlanta, won a pair.
</P>
<P>
   The chance to run for Olympic glory and gold never has been
closer, and Jones is praying she doesn't miss out again: ``My main
goal is to stay healthy and bring home W's.''

 &HT;    Malaise of violence spreads in Brazil
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Where have you gone, Pele?
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's soccer king, taking in the opening weekend of the
Women's World Cup in the United States, missed the raucous finale
to the Paulista league that served as an ugly reminder of the mess
that is domestic soccer in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's former sports minister was castigated by the soccer
establishment for pushing through anti-corruption reforms, but
Pele's worst fears about the state of the game _ those on the
field, anyway _ were borne out in the finals of his home state of
Sao Paulo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A full-fledged brawl between Palmeiras and Corinthians resulted
in the match being abandoned in the second half with the score even
at 2-2. Corinthians, which led 5-2 on aggregate, was awarded the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   The fight was sparked by Corinthians forward Edilson, who scored
the game-tying goal in the 76th minute. A few moments later, he
received a pass and instead of attacking, he tauntingly juggled the
ball with his feet, off his chest and down his back. That prompted
Palmeiras players Junior, Paulo Nunes and Zinho to charge him,
literally kicking and screaming. Both teams rushed the field,
trading punches and kicks, and Edilson soon raced to the dressing
room. In perhaps the most gruesome scene, Palmeiras striker Oseas
was seen fighting with a Corinthians ball boy.
</P>
<P>
   Tostao, Pele's teammate on Brazil's legendary 1970 World Cup
championship team, wrote in a syndicated newspaper column that
soccer in Brazil is ``the most violent in the world.... Players and
coaches disrespect each other on the field, while referees and
their assistants are under enormous pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood between Palmeiras and Corinthians has existed for
years. Palmeiras, which won the South American club championship
last week over Deportivo Cali of Colombia, decided not to contest
the Paulista outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We apologize for everything that has happened,'' Palmeiras
coach Luis Felipe Scolari said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Edilson was dropped from Brazil's Copa America roster
by coach Wanderley Luxemburgo, who said he didn't like the player's
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Brazil, Flamengo defeated Vasco de Gama 1-0 Sunday
to win the Carioca championship, for Rio de Janeiro state, by a 2-1
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   Schmeichel goes to Portugal
</P>
<P>
   Former Manchester United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel, has signed
with Sporting Lisbon after eight years in England. Terms were
undisclosed.... Barcelona unloaded unproductive Brazilian forward
Sonny Anderson to Olympique Lyon for a French record $20 million
and picked up Dani from Mallorca for $15.5 million.... Mallorca,
the Cup Winners' Cup finalists, sold striker Marcelino to Newcastle
in a four-year, $9.32 million deal.... French World Cup captain
Didier Deschamps has signed with Chelsea for $4.77 million over
three years.... Defender Giuseppe Bergomi has been released by
Inter Milan after 22 years with the club.... German libero Lothar
Matthaus said Tuesday he will leave Bayern Munich in March to join
the New York/New Jersey MetroStars of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia: Arkan stashes cash
</P>
<P>
   As the president of Yugoslav first division team FC Obilic,
Zeljko Raznatovic apparently personally pocketed the $2 million the
club received for the transfer of star player Ivan Vukomanovic to
French champion Girondins de Bordeaux. The fact that Raznatovic is
more commonly known as the Serbian Arkan who is under a war crimes
indictment has raised more than a few eyebrows but has resulted in
no action thus far from European soccer authorities. Bosman
backlash?
</P>
<P>
   Responding to concerns about spiraling transfer fees, UEFA
president Gerard Aigner said in a German interview last week that
he supports limits on the number of foreigners in European domestic
leagues. Aigner, speaking to Kicker magazine, agreed with FIFA
president Sepp Blatter that a minimum of six homegrown players
should be fielded in league games. The ceiling is in direct
contrast to the Bosman Ruling of 1995, when the European Court
banished nationality restrictions for players from European Union
countries. Expect more legal wrangling to continue.

 Guy Garcia is a director of programming at AOL Interactive
Properties, a division of America on Line.  
 By GUY GARCIA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The streets of Times Square were slick from a spring
rain as the actress Jennifer Lopez leaned forward in the backseat
of her chauffeured sedan and pointed to a nondescript brick
building in a neighborhood where giant ads for movies, theater and
music vie for attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the studio where I used to go to dance classes,'' she
said. ``I used to take the No. 6 train downtown from the Bronx. I
was about 18. It was about making the transition from this girl in
Castle Hill who could have been a lawyer to dancing, singing and
auditioning, letting the artist in me come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Those memories inspired the title of Ms. Lopez's recently
released debut album, ``On the Six.'' Reflecting the cross-cultural
experience of her formative years, the record presents a polished
urban mix of Latin, rhythm-and-blues and soul-tinged ballads and
dance numbers, with most of the songs in English but a few in
Spanish, like a salsa-flavored duet with her fellow Nuyorican
singer Marc Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez sees the album as a kind of personal soundtrack for a
journey that represents much more than the 40-minute subway ride to
Manhattan. For her, the creative hurly-burly of the city was not
just the doorstep to a new career; it was an affirmation of the
multicultural, multimedia sensibility that would shape her
artistically and ultimately make her a star.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music on the record is directly linked to the person I
am,'' she said. ``It relates back to that first stop _ what my
background is, where I grew up in the Bronx, who my parents were,
where I went to school. It's all because of where I started.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Six'' has also secured Ms. Lopez's place on the rapidly
growing list of Latino artists who can sell millions of records as
well as cause pandemonium whenever they appear in public. Earlier
this month, the album entered the Billboard chart at No. 8, and the
first single, ``If You Had My Love,'' has topped both the pop and
rhythm-and-blues charts.
</P>
<P>
   The album's success follows on the heels of Ricky Martin's
genre-blurring megahit, ``Livin' La Vida Loca.'' Meanwhile, snazzy
new videos from both artists are getting heavy exposure on MTV,
cementing their image as up-and-coming icons.
</P>
<P>
   The ascent of Martin, Ms. Lopez and Anthony, who has already
sold millions of records in Spanish and whose first
English-language album will be released in September, has prompted
the American news media to declare a Latino explosion that heralds
not just a new level of commercial success for Latino-American
singers but the long-awaited acceptance of Latin music into the pop
mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   In magazines from Time to Latina, and on television programs
around the world, the message is repeated like a mantra: Latinos
have arrived, and the whole world is listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been building, but this time it's a wave and it's got a
lot of momentum,'' said Tommy Mottola, the chairman of Sony Music
Entertainment, whose roster includes Ms. Lopez, Martin and Anthony
as well as the Colombian-born pop rocker Shakira and Elvis Crespo,
a New York-born Hispanic singer who melds Dominican merengue with
modern dance beats. ``This craze, this phenomenon is not exactly
new to us; it's just that everybody's catching on to it,
recognizing it and jumping on the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet for some longtime fans of Latino culture _ and many Latinos
themselves _ the breathless announcements that Latinos have finally
``crossed over'' at best evokes an uneasy sense of deja vu. Over
the last several decades, Latin entertainers have more than once
seemed poised to break into the mainstream, only to slip back into
the cultural margins.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1930s _ when anyone of Hispanic ancestry was
euphemistically described as Spanish _ Xavier Cugat, Perez Prado,
Desi Arnaz, Carmen Miranda, Ritchie Valens, Ray Baretto and Carlos
Santana have all scored hits, but their impact proved to be limited
or short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Julio Iglesias, Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada and
the Chicano rock group Los Lobos have made inroads in pop, rock and
dance music. But for the most part Latino pop remained a slumbering
giant, hemmed in by the language barrier and consumer consternation
over a plethora of complex rhythmic styles.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Martin, whose incendiary performance at the 1999
Grammy Awards show proved what many record executives already knew:
Latin pop has global appeal. Suddenly, a number of forces that had
been building for years _ a thriving international market for Latin
music and a fast-growing Hispanic population in the United States,
soon to become the country's largest minority _reached critical
mass, and the mass media followed.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that Martin, Ms. Lopez and Anthony all had
English-language albums in the works, or that the urban rhythms
they embraced had long ago seeped into the pop music vernacular. In
fact, the so-called Latino craze may actually be a misnomer.
</P>
<P>
   What is now being hailed as ``Latino Pop'' is really modern
urban American music, and while the excitement being generated by
performers like Ms. Lopez and Martin may indeed spill over into
more ethnic musical forms, there is no guarantee that lesser-known
performers will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's stage persona may at times evoke Desi Arnaz's
conga-playing Latin lover, but the critical difference this time
around is that to millions of shrieking teen-agers, he is no more
exotic than the boy next door. ``Haven't Jennifer Lopez and Ricky
Martin embodied the future of America in some ways?'' asked Christy
Haubegger, publisher of Latina. ``These bilingual, bicultural kids:
isn't that America? They are amalgams of all kinds of ethnic
influences. They are mirrors. I'm not sure if they are projecting
or reflecting, maybe both.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new Latino stars also share an ability to move between
different mediums, whether they be records, movies, television,
theater or the Internet. Martin, who first tasted fame as a member
of the Latin teen group Menudo, did a stint on the television soap
opera ``General Hospital'' and played Marius in the Broadway
production of ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony has appeared in several movies and starred on Broadway
in Paul Simon's gang-crime musical ``The Capeman.'' And Ms. Lopez,
who was a member of the Fly Girls dance troupe in the television
comedy series ``In Living Color,'' has starred in the films
``Selena,'' ``U-turn'' and ``Out of Sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, who, like Martin and Anthony is in her 20s, credits
her parents with instilling her self-confidence. ``I don't see
boundaries,'' she said. ``I think this generation of Latinos are
more open to all of the possibilities, whereas for our parents it
was more about survival and struggle and moving to a new country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haubegger said she featured Ms. Lopez on the March cover of
Latina because Ms. Lopez embodied the aspirations of Hispanic women
while appealing to a non-Latino audience. ``She really reflects
that dual identity that most of us somehow navigate,'' said Ms.
Haubegger, a Texas-born Latina who was adopted and reared by Anglo
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Haubegger cites another recent Latina cover article about
the model Christy Turlington's return to visit her mother's native
El Salvador. Ms. Haubegger sees the trip as an indication of how
far things have come from the days when Rita Hayworth, born Rita
Carmen Cansino, whose father was Spanish, had to adopt her Irish
mother's maiden name to have a successful career in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a supermodel publicly embracing her Salvadoran
roots, you know there's been a shift,'' Ms. Haubegger said. Still,
some worry that by popularizing a highly commercial style of urban
Latin pop, superstars like Martin and Ms. Lopez might actually make
it harder for more traditional-sounding and ethnic-looking Latin
artists to land a record deal or find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not crossover; it's step-over,'' said the Panamanian
singer and actor Ruben Blades, who shared the title role in ``The
Capeman'' with Anthony. ``I'm really happy for Ricky. I think he's
a really nice guy, and he's worked very hard, but I'm afraid that
what is going to happen now is that the labels are going to create
a whole bunch of clones just to make bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Blades, a three-time Grammy winner who has recorded in both
English and Spanish and has collaborated with Lou Reed, Elvis
Costello and Sting, recently completed an album with Editus, a
Costa Rican combo that fuses tropical beats, Spanish flamenco, jazz
and world-beat rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Blades maintains that the strength of Latin music lies in its
diversity, which is grounded in the indigenous traditions of
different Latin nations and cultures, all of which can borrow and
mix with other styles to create new sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the word `crossover' with a passion because it is a
racist term for people who can't accept the mixture that has
already taken place,'' Blades said.
</P>
<P>
   Another sign of Latin music's vitality is the album ``Buena
Vista Social Club,'' a collaboration between veteran Cuban
musicians and the American guitarist Ry Cooder; the record won a
Grammy last year and was the inspiration for a new documentary
directed by Wim Wenders.
</P>
<P>
   Still another sign is the popularity of ``The Latin Playboys,''
an off-beat off-shoot of Los Lobos that fuses rock and Mexican folk
rhythms with spoken-word and ambient electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Latin elements continue to surface in the music of
everyone from Madonna, who recorded the tech-acoustic duet with
Martin for his new album, to the California rock band Cake, which
recorded an English version of the popular Spanish ballad
``Quizas'' for its album, ``Fashion Nugget.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the little secret in plain view of anyone who has
visited a major American city lately is that American pop culture
has been quietly and steadily mutating for decades, accumulating
influences as ethnically rich and varied as its population. In
other words, the new Latino stars haven't penetrated the American
mainstream; they are the mainstream.

SOUTH CAROLINA GAINS GROUND AS PIVOTAL GOP PRIMARY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ For the next nine months or so, it will not be
safe to sneak off to a barbecue lunch at Maurice's Piggy Park here,
or to enjoy a quiet game of canasta at a neighborhood center for
the elderly in Charleston, or to walk along the sand at Myrtle
Beach. At any moment, the orderly pace of life in South Carolina
could be interrupted by the heavy tread and blinding smile of a
Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   It does not get the advance publicity of Iowa or New Hampshire,
but the presidential primary to be held in South Carolina on Feb.
19 is of no less importance to the Republican field than the
northerly contests, and for some candidates, it is more crucial.
All 11 Republican candidates have now spent time here, and those
who can afford it will be back regularly, hoping this conservative
state can rectify the occasionally quirky outcomes in the other two
states.
</P>
<P>
   Each of them remembers quite well how Bob Dole's campaign
righted itself after a victory here in 1996, making up for the loss
to Patrick Buchanan in New Hampshire. The victories here by Ronald
Reagan and George Bush in 1980 and 1988, respectively, led to
sweeps in the Super Tuesday primaries that locked in the party
nomination. And in the dreamy calculus of a long-shot candidate _
not unlike that of a hardened Lotto player _ anything that happened
once can happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can win here,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., standing
before supportive legislators Tuesday in the capitol rotunda, ``we
will have the bounce that's necessary to carry California and 15
other states who are holding their primaries on March 7. This
campaign will be over on March 7, and that heightens the importance
of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the chairman of McCain's legislative steering
committee, state Rep. Terry Haskins of Greenville, said he believed
his candidate could come in third or fourth in Iowa and New
Hampshire but still capture the nomination if he won in South
Carolina. Similar calculations are also under way in the camps of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, Elizabeth Dole and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, who have also spent time here in the last few
weeks, aware that all of the Republican nominees since 1980 have
won the state primary.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina has a reliably right-of-center electorate with
mainstream tastes, one that has never been particularly comfortable
with edge candidates like Buchanan. Political experts here say it
is more likely to favor centrist choices like Bush, Ms. Dole or
McCain over Quayle or Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tends to winnow out the candidates who are just running to
run,'' said former Gov. Carroll Campbell, who guided the Reagan,
Bush and Dole campaigns in previous years. ``The more extreme
candidates, either liberal or conservative, tend to run behind, and
sometimes they just stop right there.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bush, Dole and McCain campaigns have snapped up
most of the endorsements in the state. Bush has Senator Strom
Thurmond and Lieut. Gov. Bob Peeler; Ms. Dole has Attorney General
Charles Condon; and McCain has Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark
Sanford. Campbell's endorsement remains highly coveted, but he has
yet to bestow it.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also like campaigning in South Carolina for
logistical reasons: it is compact, fairly easy to crisscross, with
three well-defined ``media markets'' in which to buy commercials
and advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Lee Atwater, the Republican political operator from
South Carolina, worked to leverage the state's political advantages
for Vice President George Bush by moving its Republican primary to
the Saturday before Super Tuesday in early March, producing more
attention for the state and creating the sought-after ``bounce''
effect. This year, South Carolina Republicans moved their primary
up to Feb. 19.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, New Hampshire is considering moving its primary up
from Feb. 15 to as early as December 1999, which would then force
Iowa to move its caucuses up as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, South Carolina's Democrats did not want to be
left behind with a March 7 date, so they too have voted to move
their primary to Feb. 19. That violates the Democratic Party's
rules that no state but Iowa or New Hampshire can have a primary or
caucus before the first Tuesday in March. The national party is
unlikely to grant a waiver, but state Democratic chairman Dick
Harpootlian said the local party believed it had no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aren't on the same day as the Republicans,'' Harpootlian
said, ``the uncommitted centrist voter isn't going to wait _ he'll
vote Republican. We've got House races here that we need to win,
and we need to do what's best for our state.'' In South Carolina
voters can choose either party's primary, but cannot vote in both.
</P>
<P>
   State Democrats have long felt ignored by the national party,
and many assume that the two Democratic presidential candidates,
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, will write off
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as Harpootlian noted, no one expected Gov.
Jim Hodges, a Democrat, to win last year.

It forbids pork, for example, but allows consumption of beef, lamb
and goat. The article also referred incorrectly to a Queens street

 &HT;    France officials check reports that rat poison caused Coke
illnesses
 &HT;    By Charles W. Holmes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was supposed to be the day when Coca-Cola's troubles
in France ended.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the health scare over the company's beverages took an
odd twist Wednesday amid reports that rat poison may have caused
some illnesses among consumers who drank Coke products from a plant
in Dunkirk.
</P>
<P>
   French prosecutors confirmed that they have opened a judicial
investigation, following a Le Monde newspaper report that the
government was examining the possibility of another contaminant.
One prosecutor, Francois Muguet, said rat poison was detected on
the outside of one soft-drink can at the Dunkirk plant, but no link
to illnesses had been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola spokesman Jean-Yves Naouri told Reuters that recent
government tests on the company's brands included a look at rat
poison and ``all of those tests came back negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The top executive of Coca-Cola said he was ``very doubtful''
that the substance caused any illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that with any situation that's getting a lot of media
attention, there's a number of rumors that take place,'' Chairman
M. Douglas Ivester said Wednesday while in Brussels, Belgium,
dealing with the soft drink crisis there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work through the government officials on any reported
rumor, and we will chase any of those down. I have not heard that
particular rumor, but certainly if it is reported to us, we will
follow through on it,'' Ivester said. ``It is very doubtful to me
that that's an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has maintained that the source of illnesses linked to
the Dunkirk plant, which is owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Enterprises, was fumes from the outside bottom of cans. The cans
were transported in wooden pallets that had been treated with a
fungicide.
</P>
<P>
   Le Monde quoted French health and food specialists as saying
that similar food-contamination cases occurred at this time last
year, because it's the period when companies routinely step up
their use of pest control for spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the judicial probe, which was opened Monday,
came as French health officials were poised to lift the partial ban
on the sale of Coca-Cola products from the Dunkirk plant.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific tests conducted last weekend on Coke beverages from
the plant found no contamination. But the results were forwarded to
the French Food Safety Agency, which will make a final
determination.
</P>
<P>
   French Health Minister Bernard Kouchner has also said that
health inspectors have found no relation between illnesses and the
Dunkirk products. Like the results of a study commissioned by
Coca-Cola, he suggested the health complaints could be
psychosomatic.

 &HT;    Ban on Coke lifted, but probe continues
 &HT;    By Bert Roughton Jr.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Coca-Cola today begins scrambling to get its
soft drinks back on supermarket shelves here, even as health
officials remain baffled over why nearly 250 people became sick
after drinking the company's brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days after restricting the sale of Coke products, Belgian
officials Wednesday cleared the way for the company to get back in
the marketplace. Coca-Cola estimates it will take two weeks to get
in full swing.
</P>
<P>
   M. Douglas Ivester, the company's chairman and chief executive
officer, wasted no time in seeking to regain the faith of Belgian
consumers, who have been among Europe's most dedicated Coke
drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the calls to Coca-Cola's toll-free hotline in
Brussels have been demands for the return of their favorite soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, we let the people of Belgium down,'' Ivester
told reporters at a news conference at the expansive Palais de
Congress. ``We are sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche announced his decision to
end restrictions on the sale of Coca-Cola's leading brands, he
expressed frustration that scientists have been unable to pinpoint
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Coke products have been tested for 15,000 toxic substances, yet
the government says nothing has been found to explain why first
children and then adults experienced nausea, dizziness and vomiting
after drinking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know with certainty the cause,'' Van den Bossche told
reporters. ``We're taking a risk, that's true, but not a big
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize this risk, Van den Bossche is requiring the soft
drink giant to destroy its existing stock, start over with fresh
ingredients, clean its plants and put procedures in place to make
sure there is no repeat of these incidents. Coke immediately
accepted these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reporters took Van den Bossche to task for lifting the
restrictions before clearly identifying the source of the
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the table in a government building from which he
issued his statement also was adorned with a dozen Coke bottles,
raising the suspicions of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Van den Bossche, who chain-smoked throughout his news
conference, insisted that he didn't cave in to the American giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't negotiate,'' he snapped, stressing that he set the
terms for Coke's return to grace.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ivester's lieutenants for days have been frustrated
to the point of anger by what they considered to be Van den
Bossche's imperious style of dealing with them, the chairman heaped
praise on the minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the minister's obligation to the people in these
times of deep sensitivity regarding public health issues here,'' he
said, indirectly referring to a scare over the discovery that some
Belgian meat had been exposed to the cancer-causing substance
dioxin. ``Nothing _ I repeat, nothing _ is more important than
protecting the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare has been sufficient here to cause the ouster of
the government in national elections held this month.
</P>
<P>
   A new start
</P>
<P>
   Today, Coca-Cola will begin destroying soft drinks it has
stockpiled and any returned for a refund by consumers. Coke
executives said they did not know how much of the company's product
must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ivester seemed relaxed and even took a
gulp from the open glass bottle Coke placed on his rostrum when
prompted by a TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual unknown here a week ago, the chairman has become a
familiar face during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he appeared in full-page ads nationwide bearing his
personal message of contrition and reassurance. Wednesday night,
there he was again in 90-second commercials aired after news
broadcasts that also showed him at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the world's largest soft drink company said Coke
executives had met more than 25 times with the government over the
past few days trying to find a resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has said the illnesses were caused by small amounts of a
contaminant in the carbon dioxide used to carbonate drinks at its
Antwerp, Belgium, plant and when a fungicide used to treat wood
pallets at its Dunkirk, France, plant got on the exterior of cans.
Both plants are owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, the
largest soft drink bottler in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the government's scientists and the toxicologists
commissioned by Coke determined that these substances were present
in amounts too small to account for the illnesses, Ivester said he
was satisfied that the symptoms were caused by the ``off smell and
off taste'' caused by these substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have presented an abundance of scientific data,''
he said. ``We served millions of drinks every day in Belgium. We
have very stringent quality control procedures in place, and in
this case a couple of our quality control procedures broke down.
... Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium and
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   However, lawsuits already are in the works. The director of St.
Mary's School near Antwerp has reportedly taken initial steps to
sue Coke. Odilon Hermans, the school's director, told The
Associated Press that four students who drank Coke two weeks ago
are still too sick to return to classes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 280 students at his school, 39 became sick after drinking
Coke products, and 15 spent a night in the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government left in place a ban on Coca-Cola products from
the company's Dunkirk, France, bottling plant until French
authorities cleared production there.
</P>
<P>
   It also will maintain a ban on Coca-Cola vending machines in
Belgium. Ivester said that problems were found with 20 of the
company's 28,000 vending machines here, but the company would empty
all, inspect them and restock them, a process expected to take a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machine sales provide some of the highest profit margins
in the Coke system.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche said the Coca-Cola issue had become more
complicated when he was informed that there had been an extortion
attempt linked to Coca-Cola in Germany during the second week of
May. A ransom payment of several million marks had been demanded on
May 18, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by Belgian authorities, he is satisfied
that there is no connection with the situation in Belgium.

<P>
   Indeed, many of the calls to Coca-Cola's toll-free hotline in
Brussels have been demands for the return of their favorite soft
drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, we let the people of Belgium down,'' Ivester
told reporters at a news conference at the expansive Palais de
Congress. ``We are sorry for that.''
</P>
<P>
   As Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche announced his decision to
end restrictions on the sale of Coca-Cola's leading brands, he
expressed frustration that scientists have been unable to pinpoint
what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Coke products have been tested for 15,000 toxic substances, yet
the government says nothing has been found to explain why first
children and then adults experienced nausea, dizziness and vomiting
after drinking them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know with certainty the cause,'' Van den Bossche told
reporters. ``We're taking a risk, that's true, but not a big
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize this risk, Van den Bossche is requiring the soft
drink giant to destroy its existing stock, start over with fresh
ingredients, clean its plants and put procedures in place to make
sure there is no repeat of these incidents. Coke immediately
accepted these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reporters took Van den Bossche to task for lifting the
restrictions before clearly identifying the source of the
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the table in a government building from which he
issued his statement also was adorned with a dozen Coke bottles,
raising the suspicions of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Van den Bossche, who chain-smoked throughout his news
conference, insisted that he didn't cave in to the American giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't negotiate,'' he snapped, stressing that he set the
terms for Coke's return to grace.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Ivester's lieutenants for days have been frustrated
to the point of anger by what they considered to be Van den
Bossche's imperious style of dealing with them, the chairman heaped
praise on the minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect the minister's obligation to the people in these
times of deep sensitivity regarding public health issues here,'' he
said, indirectly referring to a scare over the discovery that some
Belgian meat had been exposed to the cancer-causing substance
dioxin. ``Nothing _ I repeat, nothing _ is more important than
protecting the public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare has been sufficient here to cause the ouster of
the government in national elections held this month.
</P>
<P>
   A new start
</P>
<P>
   Today, Coca-Cola will begin destroying soft drinks it has
stockpiled and any returned for a refund by consumers. Coke
executives said they did not know how much of the company's product
must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Ivester seemed relaxed and even took a
gulp from the open glass bottle Coke placed on his rostrum when
prompted by a TV reporter.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual unknown here a week ago, the chairman has become a
familiar face during the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he appeared in full-page ads nationwide bearing his
personal message of contrition and reassurance. Wednesday night,
there he was again in 90-second commercials aired after news
broadcasts that also showed him at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the world's largest soft drink company said Coke
executives had met more than 25 times with the government over the
past few days trying to find a resolution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Coke has said the illnesses were caused by small amounts of a
contaminant in the carbon dioxide used to carbonate drinks at its
Antwerp, Belgium, plant and when a fungicide used to treat wood
pallets at its Dunkirk, France, plant got on the exterior of cans.
Both plants are owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Enterprises, the
largest soft drink bottler in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the government's scientists and the toxicologists
commissioned by Coke determined that these substances were present
in amounts too small to account for the illnesses, Ivester said he
was satisfied that the symptoms were caused by the ``off smell and
off taste'' caused by these substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have presented an abundance of scientific data,''
he said. ``We served millions of drinks every day in Belgium. We
have very stringent quality control procedures in place, and in
this case a couple of our quality control procedures broke down.
... Our products are completely safe, both in Belgium and
worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   However, lawsuits already are in the works. The director of St.
Mary's School near Antwerp has reportedly taken initial steps to
sue Coke. Odilon Hermans, the school's director, told The
Associated Press that four students who drank Coke two weeks ago
are still too sick to return to classes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 280 students at his school, 39 became sick after drinking
Coke products, and 15 spent a night in the hospital, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government left in place a ban on Coca-Cola products from
the company's Dunkirk, France, bottling plant until French
authorities cleared production there.
</P>
<P>
   It also will maintain a ban on Coca-Cola vending machines in
Belgium. Ivester said that problems were found with 20 of the
company's 28,000 vending machines here, but the company would empty
all, inspect them and restock them, a process expected to take a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Vending machine sales provide some of the highest profit margins
in the Coke system.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche said the Coca-Cola issue had become more
complicated when he was informed that there had been an extortion
attempt linked to Coca-Cola in Germany during the second week of
May. A ransom payment of several million marks had been demanded on
May 18, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by Belgian authorities, he is satisfied
that there is no connection with the situation in Belgium.

LEWIS JURY SAYS IT CAN'T DECIDE IN CASE AGAINST CARDIOLOGIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The jury in the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice case
says it is unable to reach a verdict as to whether Lewis's chief
cardiologist, Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., was negligent in diagnosing
and treating the heart condition that killed the Celtics star.
</P>
<P>
   But the 15 jurors reported to Superior Judge Thayer
Fremont-Smith late Wednesday that they had reached verdicts on the
two other cardiologists sued for malpractice by Lewis's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Those verdicts, involving consulting cardiologists Peter L.
Friedman and Mark A. Creager, will remain secret until the jury
either resolves its deadlock on Mudge's liability or convinces
Fremont-Smith that it is unable to agree on a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Fremont-Smith Thursday morning will read the jurors additional
instructions aimed at reaching a verdict on Mudge, after which the
panel will resume deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the partial verdicts on Friedman and Creager
and the disagreement over Mudge's negligence followed 32 hours of
deliberation over five days.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Friedman and Creager had worked to portray their
clients as minor players who were asked by Mudge to consult on the
case but who had no direct role in Lewis's diagnosis or treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Exiting the courtroom, attorneys for the three doctors declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the jury must resolve three basic issues: whether
Mudge, Friedman, and Creager provided Lewis with negligent medical
care; whether such negligence contributed substantially to the
player's death; and, if it did, how much money Lewis's wife and two
children should receive as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen of the 15 jurors must agree in order to reach a verdict
on each of 16 questions. Ten of those questions are to be answered
only if the jury finds that negligence by any or all of the doctors
contributed to Lewis's death, and are aimed at determining the
amount of damages Donna Harris-Lewis and her children should
receive.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to Fremont-Smith by the jury foreman shortly
before 8 p.m., the panel reported that it had ``come to a decision
on questions three and five,'' which ask whether Friedman and
Creager provided negligent medical care to the former Celtics
captain.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which was read aloud in the jury's presence in a
Suffolk Superior courtroom, also said that ``at this time we have
come to a decision that the jury is deadlocked'' on question one,
which asks whether Mudge provided negligent medical care. ``We
await your instructions,'' the letter concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that ``probably everybody's pretty tired,'' Fremont-Smith
asked the jurors to continue deliberating this morning, for a sixth
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, tomorrow, after further due deliberations, you find
yourselves still deadlocked,'' he continued, ``then I will take at
that time your verdicts'' regarding Friedman and Creager.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has accused the three cardiologists of failing to
diagnose her husband with a life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth cardiolgist, Dr. John D. Rutherford, now in practice in
Texas, settled out of court with Harris-Lewis in April, on the day
that jury selection began. Details of the settlement have not been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors' lawyers have argued that the player's death was
caused by his failure to follow doctor's orders to avoid strenuous
exercise. They also contend that Mudge was unable to accurately
diagnose Lewis because the player did not tell him that he had used
cocaine until two weeks before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis vehemently denied that her husband used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis collapsed and died of heart failure while shooting baskets
at Brandeis University on July 27, 1993, 11 weeks after he had been
discharged from Brigham and Women's Hospital by Mudge.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and his wife had sought out Mudge after a group of leading
cardiologists dubbed the Dream Team had diagnosed Lewis with a
serious heart problem that could end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge reached a far different conclusion, announcing at a May
1993 news conference that Lewis had a benign fainting disorder, not
a life-threatening heart condition. With monitoring and drug
treatment, Mudge said, Lewis would be able to resume his basketball
career.

DEMOCRATS STALL SENATE TO FORCE DEBATE ON HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.D., Idaho, Okla., Ga., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate was paralyzed for a third straight day
Wednesday as Democrats pressed for immediate consideration of
legislation to define patients' rights within their health
insurance plans. Republicans rejected the Democrats' timetable and
terms, and leaders from both parties sought in vain to devise a way
around the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to block action on an agriculture spending
bill _ and threatened to similarly impede any other legislation _
until they got a solid promise of a full-fledged debate, within the
next few weeks, on new regulations for health maintenance
organizations and medical insurers.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans refused to grant Democrats the conditions they
sought for that discussion, and as hour upon hour of negotiations
failed to yield any agreement, the Senate was left in a surreal
state of suspended animation, with the empty time being eaten up by
hourly or even twice-hourly attendance calls.
</P>
<P>
   The tense standoff was a sign of just how contentious the
subject of HMOs and insurance companies was shaping up to be, not
just in the Senate but also in the House. The impasse also showed
that both parties had come to see the political stakes surrounding
the issue, which directly affects scores of millions of Americans,
as extremely high.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get votes,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority
leader, referring to 20 amendments Democrats want to add to the
Republican health care bill that would be the starting point of any
floor debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either that, or we'll sit on the Senate floor looking at
each other,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans questioned the disruptive parliamentary methods
Democrats were using to achieve their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure you get there by punching American farmers in the
face,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In a strict party-line vote, a Senate committee approved a
Republican bill in March, but there is no firm date for its
consideration on the floor. Democrats say that the bill's
protections for patients are feeble and few. They are convinced
that if they can introduce all their amendments and force a
point-by-point dissection of the bill's provisions, they can
embarrass Republicans and lure some of them to vote with Democrats
on aspects of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been emboldened in that thinking by the Senate's
debate over gun control, in which close examination of some
Republican proposals forced Republicans to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are trying to prevent that approach. In part, they
seem to sense that certain Democratic provisions will play better
in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want our members to go through a lot of votes that can
be misconstrued for political purposes,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republican bill and the Democratic proposal, rival
versions of which have come to be known as a patients' bill of
rights, address Americans' fears that HMOs and insurers are placing
a zest for profits above a concern for patients.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals of both parties create processes by which patients
can appeal treatment decisions to external arbiters. But
significant portions of the Republicans' plan apply only to about
48 million Americans in health care plans not regulated by the
states, while the Democratic proposal would affect about triple
that number of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal also gives a patient's primary doctor
more discretion in determining the medical necessity of a treatment
and removes current hurdles that prevent many patients in HMOs from
suing the organizations for botched decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic plan involves too much federal
meddling in matters best governed by states and will drive up
costs, prompting employers to diminish the number of people to whom
they offer medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Democrats were doing the bidding of trial
lawyers, who contribute heavily to the Democratic party. Democrats,
in turn, said that Republicans were the marionettes of large
corporations and insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Wednesday, 167 Democrats put their names on a
petition to force consideration of the Democrats' managed-care
proposal in the chamber. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert has pledged a
debate and votes this summer on a proposal by House Republicans,
but Democrats do not like it.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats would need 218 signatures to succeed and there
are only 211 Democrats in the House. Even so, the issue is a tricky
one for Republican leaders, who must remain aware that last year,
when Democrats held five fewer seats, the Democratic proposal was
defeated by only six votes, 216-210.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a compromise proposed by Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., has
a number of supporters and more closely resembles the Democratic
position.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Senate Republicans offered Democrats a four-day
debate in mid-July, but Democrats held out for an explicit
guarantee that they could present all of their amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they haven't got an alternative,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., noting that the chamber was at a standstill.

 Sylviane Gold, who reviews dance for Newsday, has been a theater
critic for The Wall Street Journal and other publications.  
 By SYLVIANE GOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sex may mean a great deal in our lives. But somehow
it doesn't count for very much in our drama. No, I have not
forgotten about the stacks and stacks of plays whose plots turn on
romance, or on adultery or incest, or the newer ones that work gay
or feminist changes on these well-worn themes.
</P>
<P>
   Western theater is peopled with distinctly sexual characters:
Oedipus, Gertrude, Camille, Willy Loman. But the plays they appear
in are not primarily about sex. Plays _ serious mainstream works by
serious writers that shed light on the role of sex in the human
drama _ are actually few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   This curious fact was underlined this past season not just by
the grim, long-running sex farce in Washington but by the unusual
presence of two plays on Broadway that (italics)did(end italics)
take on this big subject. In a culture in which sex looms as a
major presence in everything from music videos to painting, from
novels to advertising, Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' running at the
Music Box Theater, and David Hare's ``Blue Room,'' which closed
this winter after a sold-out run at the Cort, stand out as the sole
explorations of sex in what was widely hailed as Broadway's season
of the play.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the past for similar plays with similar themes will
yield very few examples. Trying to remember how our best
playwrights have handled the subject brings the realization that
either, like Lanford Wilson and Tony Kushner, they haven't really
devoted entire plays to it or, like Tom Stoppard and Caryl
Churchill, they've treated it comically.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes playwrights appear to be writing about sex _ Peter
Shaffer in ``Equus,'' David Rabe in ``Hurlyburly,'' David Henry
Hwang in ``M. Butterfly'' _ but are in fact using sex to pursue
other themes (creativity, male hubris and cultural imperialism,
respectively).
</P>
<P>
   In Alan Ayckbourn's ``Communicating Doors'' last year,
Mary-Louise Parker played a prostitute in black leather; the play
had numerous strategically placed doors, like a sex farce. But it
was actually a metaphysical meditation on the permeability of time.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's play is an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ``Reigen,''
which follows a chain of sexual encounters in turn-of-the-century
Vienna and which Schnitzler considered too obscene to produce.
(It's more familiar to us as ``La Ronde,'' thanks to Max Ophuls's
film version.)
</P>
<P>
   Hare borrows Schnitzler's pleasingly straightforward scheme of
changing one sexual partner in each scene until, after 10
couplings, we end with the same streetwalker who began the chain.
Not one of the couples, not even the husband and wife who dally
with each other between their dalliances elsewhere, could even
remotely be described as in love.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's concern here is not romance or even physical release.
With the exception of the streetwalker, for whom sex is a living,
the characters in ``The Blue Room'' use sex as an escape route, a
temporary, mechanical respite from routine, like a coffee break.
</P>
<P>
   For the four people Marber examines in ``Closer,'' sex is not
quite so casual. Sex has an urgency and import that makes them
desperate. Not for them the old saw that all's fair in love and
war; for them, sex and war are identical. And they fight on two
fronts: to win the object of their desires and to humiliate the
competition. Sex is not a sublime pleasure but a supreme weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Love 'em or hate 'em, and there are critics in both camps.
``Closer'' and ``The Blue Room'' can be shocking in their
preoccupation with their characters' libidos. Indeed, these
characters (italics)are(end italics) their sex lives. Unlike so
many contemporary plays that include sexual interludes and frank
dialogue but really care more about other matters, these plays
would make no sense without the sex scenes and the sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Brantley classed them with last season's Off Broadway
production ``Shopping and ... ,'' Mark Ravenhill's look at the
sexual preoccupations of a pair of nihilistic drug addicts, as
anti-romantic comedies about the joylessness of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the reams of propaganda that have emanated over the
last four decades from Hugh Hefner and Dr. Ruth and the whole ``Joy
of Sex'' industry, it's interesting that playwrights who do bother
to look at sex see it rather differently. Perhaps Tolstoy's maxim
about happy families applies as well to happy sex; maybe it's just
too boring to write about.
</P>
<P>
   Writers who (italics)have(end italics) dramatized stories that
pivot on the sexual natures of their characters _ Paula Vogel in
``How I Learned to Drive'' and Christopher Hampton in ``Les
Liaisons Dangereuses'' _ don't draw a pretty picture. Even when sex
is used by playwrights to amuse, as in farces and musicals, it
tends to be seen as a chaotic and destructive element in life
rather than a wholesome one.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only way to write a play in which sex is the
dominant theme is to create characters whose libidos dominate their
personalities _ monsters, by definition. Christopher Durang's ``Sex
and Longing,'' one of the few American sex comedies, took as its
main character a nymphomaniac who needed sex every 15 minutes;
critics were not amused.
</P>
<P>
   A play like Caryl Churchill's ``Cloud Nine'' (1979), in which
sex is at once funny, serious and good for you, is a real rarity.
</P>
<P>
   There have been periods in theater history, of course, when sex
was on the front burner: Jacobean playwrights like John Ford hung
bloody revenge plots on it and Restoration writers made witty sport
of it. But it shouldn't really surprise anyone that when Noel
Coward and George Bernard Shaw and Eugene O'Neill brought sex into
their plays, they did it in a gingerly way: they were writing for
audiences that didn't talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   When Mae West starred in her 1926 play about a prostitute,
``Sex,'' she spent 10 days in jail for her efforts. What
(italics)should(end italics) surprise is that the theater of our
own time seems not to have thoroughly assimilated the changes of
the late '60s and early '70s that transformed the rest of the
culture.
</P>
<P>
   This was the period that saw songwriters trade in
June-moon-spoon lyrics for ``Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce
soir?'' It saw bedroom scenes become de rigueur in movies made for
grown-ups. After ``Lady Chatterley's Lover'' was ruled not obscene
by a federal appeals court in 1960, novels were free to enter the
bedroom in explicit detail, and ``Portnoy's Complaint'' did away
with any remaining taboos in 1969.

 NEW YORK: in 1969.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As early as the '30s, modern dance choreographers had been
putting pelvic thrusts and grinds on stage, and by the '60s and
'70s, choreographers were routinely representing sex acts.
</P>
<P>
   When Kenneth Tynan devised ``Oh! Calcutta!'' in 1969, it was
meant to blast through the hypocrisy and shame that had kept this
crucial part of life off the stage for so long. Although it was
just a collection of skits, and mediocre ones at that, it was
nonetheless seen at the time as a breakthrough. (When the 1976
revival closed in 1989, the New York Times critic Frank Rich
checked out the final performance and found it ``antediluvian.'')
</P>
<P>
   But all that came of ``Oh! Calcutta!'' was a slew of ripoffs.
Who remembers ``The Dirtiest Show in Town''?
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the cultural ferment of the period had
no effect at all on serious theater. Downtown experimenters like
Richard Schechner, Charles Ludlam and Richard Foreman made
audiences ready for anything. Iconoclastic young playwrights like
Terrence McNally, Sam Shepard and Leonard Melfi depicted sexual
situations and used sexual language that paved the way for a play
about an incestuous child molester, like Ms. Vogel's ``How I
Learned to Drive,'' which would have been unimaginable in the
1950s. (And the odds on its winning a Pulitzer Prize would have
been very long indeed, even in the '60s and '70s.)
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Vogel is an exception. Most dramatists took advantage of
the looser language and the fewer costumes rather than reaching for
the more daring subject matter made available by the sexual
revolution. A single David Mamet play probably contains more
obscenities than Alexander Woollcott heard in a lifetime of
theatergoing. And nudity no longer surprises anyone; it's even in a
play about a John Donne scholar, for heaven's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you probably have to go back to 1987, when the Royal
Shakespeare Company production of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses''
arrived in New York, to find Broadway characters like those in the
plays of Hare and Marber, characters whose personalities are
expressed entirely through their sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   The relative absence of such characters from our stages, both on
Broadway and off, is peculiar for many reasons, not the least being
that theater itself springs from fertility rites. The first
theatrical performance may well have been a crude and lewd
representation of the sex act in some tribal ritual, and European
theater traces its roots to Dionysian festivals in ancient Greece,
with actors cavorting in abbreviated tunics and leather phalluses.
</P>
<P>
   Such entertainments didn't meet with the approval of the early
Christians, of course, and soon the form itself disappeared in
Europe. Given that theater next developed as a vehicle for
conveying the Gospel, it's little wonder that erotic elements were
not as prevalent as they were in the arts of the East.
</P>
<P>
   And while Western playwrights have found ways even in less
liberal periods to indicate that sex can be a driving force in
human destiny (think of Shakespeare's Othello, Racine's Phedre,
Strindberg's Miss Julie, Arthur Miller's Eddie Carbone), our
theater has for the most part been more comfortable laughing at
this crucial subject than exploring it.
</P>
<P>
   The sex drive, and society's response to it, has been used to
entertain audiences by Aristophanes and Feydeau and a slew of
British farceurs. Right now, Peter Ackerman's Off Broadway play at
the Promenade, ``Things You Shouldn't Say Past Midnight,'' offers
three beds and three pairs of sex partners. No one thinks of Mamet
as a comic playwright these days, but his breakthrough play, you
may recall, was ``Sexual Perversity in Chicago,'' a comedy about
the mating rituals of four proto-yuppies.
</P>
<P>
   Like comedies, musicals seem braver about venturing into the
sexual arena than dramas do. Perhaps because song and dance numbers
can so readily stylize sexual content, perhaps because of their
ancestral roots in burlesque and vaudeville, Broadway musicals seem
to deal more readily with issues of sex than straight plays do.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway musicals even dared to take on the sex industry,
however cavalierly, in ``Sweet Charity,'' ``The Best Little
Whorehouse in Texas'' and ``The Life,'' among others. Several
seasons back, before Hare tackled ``Reigen,'' Michael John LaChiusa
had turned the Schnitzler play into a much-admired musical, ``Hello
Again,'' at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it isn't just playwrights who feel more comfortable
dealing with sex in conventionalized, distancing formats. The
fourth wall is a highly transparent barrier: it's really no barrier
at all. And things that we don't mind watching at the movies or
reading in a novel can sometimes make us cringe in the theater. But
playwrights are supposed to be showing us our selves.
</P>
<P>
   And there's no question that you walk out of ``Closer'' feeling
as if you've had its four characters on a dissecting table and
picked through their very innards. By telling us about their sex
lives, Marber has exposed them far more deeply than if he had
written a play about their families or their friendships. Yet his
play is one of a mere handful that look at this complex and
compelling part of the human experience.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is a peculiar complaint. After all, food is even more
essential to life than sex, and we don't see too many plays on that
subject. The theater seems none the poorer. But dinner is about
bread; sex is about our connections to other people. Is there a
better definition of what theater should be?

BUSH DEFENDS NEW FOREIGN-ISSUES GAFFE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and JULIE MASON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Wednesday that a
pro-abortion rights politician would have a chance to become his
running mate if he won the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time Bush _ who says he personally opposes
abortion _ has stepped away from the anti-abortion stances that
have been required of Republican presidential candidates for the
last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of a campaign and fund-raising swing, Bush also
defended his mix-up of two new Eastern European countries that was
his latest international-issues gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, Va., on Tuesday, a reporter from Slovakia, a
breakaway republic from the former Czechoslovakia, asked Bush about
his country. Bush responded by praising the country and recalling a
meeting in Texas with its foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bush met in April with the prime minister of Slovenia,
a breakaway republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big world, and I've got a lot to learn. But should I
be fortunate enough to be elected, I'll be ready,'' Bush said. He
has been receiving briefings from foreign policy experts from the
administrations of presidents Reagan and Bush, his father.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has been criticized for lacking foreign policy
knowledge when he referred to Kosovars as Kosovoians; Greeks as
Grecians; and East Timorese as East Timorians.
</P>
<P>
   On the running mate question, Bush recently said he would not
try as president to overturn Roe vs. Wade with a constitutional
amendment, but would work toward policies that discourage abortion,
like the parental-notification law recently enacted in Texas. Last
week, Bush said that his Supreme Court appointees would face no
litmus test on abortion or other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rule nothing out. The most important criterion will be: Can
the person be president of the United States?'' said Bush, as
Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a Bush supporter who favors abortion
rights, stood at Bush's side during a visit to the Blessed Virgin
Mary Catholic School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I will want to know whether the person can help the
ticket,'' Bush said. ``But other than that, I haven't made any
other determinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Vice President Dan Quayle, also seeking the GOP
nomination, promised last week that his running mate, if he were
nominated, would oppose abortion rights, as would his Supreme Court
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Gary Bauer, who has been persistently
critical of the governor's stance on abortion, called Bush's
remarks about a running mate ``deeply disappointing, but not
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the third signal that Governor Bush has given
that the sanctity of human life is not a high-priority issue for
him,'' Bauer said. ``I am assuming the next thing we will hear is
that he wants to change the Republican Platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Lambert, a Republican National Committee member and
president of the Texas Home School coalition, said he hopes Bush
will not abandon the pro-life movement in choosing a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the governor, I think, is being magnanimous in trying to
reach out across the party, I think ultimately he will pick someone
who does hold his same, pro-life viewpoint,'' Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert said it's nothing less than what's expected by party
rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a vast majority of folks in the party who would
expect him to pick someone in keeping with his own philosophy,''
Lambert said. ``If you look at his efforts behind the scenes in the
Legislature to get parental notification passed, I think it's
indicative of the way he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridge said that even if Bush named a supporter of abortion
rights as his running mate, ``We (in the GOP) have a history of
honoring the vice presidential selections, and I think that will
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there would be some who would be displeased and
disapprove, but I think the majority of Republicans give the
benefit of the selection process to the man, to the individual,
they nominate for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appeal to social conservatives so far has been limited to
issues not likely to upset a general election audience. On Monday
in South Carolina, Bush promised that if elected president he would
push for increased federal funding for sexual abstinence education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it would be ``presumptive'' to talk about specific
politicians as potential running mates before winning the
nomination. But he praised Ridge as ``a good man,'' who has been a
good governor for his state.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge, who stood quietly during the questioning of Bush, last
year was told by the bishop of the Erie, Pa., diocese he was no
longer welcome at church-sponsored events because of his views
favoring abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in May, former Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed, an
unofficial adviser to Bush, told a Pennsylvania audience that
Ridge's views would not necessarily mean religious conservatives
would reject him as a possible vice presidential candidate.
</P>

   ``The emphasis is on the vice part, and he's not setting the
policy,'' Reed said.

   At the Catholic school, Bush promoted programs in which parents
could use tax-supported vouchers to send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge lost a legislative battle earlier this week to create a
private school voucher program for Pennsylvania. Bush lost a
similar battle in the Texas legislative session that just ended.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would use the presidency as a ``bully pulpit'' to
promote voucher programs in the states, but he indicated he would
not push for a federal voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, education governance issues _ how states determine
to provide a menu of opportunity to parents _ should be up to the
states,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush deflected a question on whether he might support
federal income tax credits for the parents of private school
children by saying, ``I'll talk about that when I lay out my budget
and tax plan.''
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with students at the Catholic school, a black
child asked him whether he would be willing to put racists in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will send people to jail if they commit a crime,'' said
Bush, who opposed a hate-crimes bill to enhance penalties for
race-motivated crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told the child that people should tell racists that this
nation will not tolerate racism and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure that (racism) is a jailable offense,'' Bush
said. ``But all of us should scold somebody who doesn't treat a
fellow person with respect.''

 &HT;    Jordan sidelined with sore hand
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brian Jordan missed Wednesday's game with a sore right
hand, after getting hit by a Mike Thurman pitch in the fourth
inning of Tuesday night's game. The good news after the game was
that it wasn't broken. The bad news on Wednesday was that it was
still very tender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was broken,'' said Jordan, the Braves' leading
run-producer with 57 RBIs, which had him tied with Sammy Sosa for
fourth in the National League. ``It's a bad day. Today I feel more
of the pain. Yesterday it was numb from all the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who had missed only one other game this year and is
second on the club to Andruw Jones in games played, continued
playing in Tuesday night's game until he came up to bat again, but
it hurt too much to swing a bat. Jordan is hoping he can take a
pain-killing shot if necesssary and be ready to play by the weekend
series against the New York Mets at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Williams started in right field on Wednesday and Ryan
Klesko moved into the cleanup hole in the order. Jordan was one of
a steady stream of Braves players headed for the training room on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez was placed on the disabled list Wednesday for his
sprained knee, retroactive to Monday, which means he'll be eligible
to come off on July 6 at home against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz battles
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz is set to make his second start since his disastrous
outing against the Orioles, when the seven runs he allowed called
into question the state of his tender elbow. But with his outing in
Arizona since then, when with the benefit of a home-run saving
catch by Jordan he shut out the Diamondbacks for six innings,
Smoltz (8-2) can take confidence into today's start against the
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Baltimore game there were some questions,'' Smoltz
said. ``When I had a chance to think about it, it was just a bump
in the road. I just realized what I went through last year, I may
have to go through that again. I'm good enough to win, just like
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz knows he's in for a fight this season to see if he can
pitch beyond some of the limits his elbow would seem to have in
store for him. To do it, he's made a change in his fastball
delivery that will takes some stress off the elbow. He's also given
up on the idea of pitching into the eighth and ninth innings
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter has declared himself ready to return to action the
next time the Braves need him to start against a left-hander. In
the mean time, Hunter is available for pinch hitting duties, which
he did for the first time Tuesday night since he sprained his left
ankle in Houston. He's still wearing an air-cast on the ankle and
says he's about 85 percent.... Lopez was paid a visit on Wednesday
by Davis Loftin, a 17-year-old from Dothan, Ala., whom Lopez
visited in the hospital last Nov. 23 when he was in Dothan for a
charity event. Loftin had undergone three brain surgeries and was
in and out of a coma after a car accident. Loftin, who arrived at
Turner Field in a wheelchair, stood for Lopez and took a few steps.

DEBATE OVER GAY MARRIAGE SPLITS PROMINENT CHURCH NEAR ATLANTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the governor on one side and a prominent
congressman on the other, a leading United Methodist church in the
Atlanta suburbs split this week in the latest case of what has
become a crisis in the church on the issue of same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   A breakaway group, led by the former pastor of the First United
Methodist Church of Marietta, had its first official service
Sunday. Attending and signing up to join the breakaway
congregation, named the Wesleyan Fellowship, were Rep. Bob Barr, an
influential Republican member of Congress, and his wife, Jeri.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes, a Democrat, chose to stay at First United
Methodist, which has about 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of about 450 families was the latest development
in a series of reprimands and threats between the Marietta church
and its regional conference that began in November 1997 when the
board of trustees of Emory University, an Atlanta institution
founded by the Methodist Church, ruled that same-sex marriage
ceremonies could be conducted on its campus under limited
circumstances. None have been performed to date.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of First United Methodist at the time, the Rev.
Charles Sineath, an Emory alumnus, said same-sex unions should not
be allowed on United Methodist Church property, like Emory. When he
found out that Bishop Lindsey Davis, head of the North Georgia
United Methodist Conference, was part of the trustees' unanimous
vote, Sineath could not be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   The board's ruling, along with his concerns about the
denomination's commitment to fundamental Christian beliefs, led
Sineath to leave his congregation and the United Methodist Church
altogether, taking with him a flock of similarly disenchanted
churchgoers.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, who was married at the church, said, ``We left First
United because Charles is our pastor, and we think the very
fundamental, Biblical principles he stands for are important.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes declined to comment, but in a speech June 17 to the North
Georgia United Methodist Conference, he said that one of the duties
of a Christian was ``to be tolerant and forgiving, and,
unfortunately, many confuse that with weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the debate on same-sex unions has strained the
denomination nationwide to the point that many Methodists fear the
possibility of a schism in the country's second-largest Protestant
denomination.
</P>
<P>
   The debate goes back at least to last year. On Aug. 11, five
months after a church court acquitted a United Methodist pastor who
conducted a marriage ceremony for a lesbian couple, the church's
judicial council ruled that same-sex unions could not be held in
United Methodist churches and that pastors involved in such
ceremonies could be defrocked.
</P>
<P>
   The California-Nevada conference is trying to decide whether it
should move for a trial against 68 United Methodist pastors who
publicly blessed a lesbian union in January in protest of the
council's decision.
</P>
<P>
   With factions on both sides pulling at the denomination's core,
the question is how much longer the 8.4 million United Methodists
will worship in the same house, said the Rev. Lyle Schaller, a
retired Methodist pastor from Illinois who is an expert on church
trends.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at First United Methodist of Marietta, which has
golf carts to shuttle members of its upper-middle-class
congregation from the parking lot, is a good example of how serious
the issues have become, Schaller said.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Brannan, a 12-year member who decided to stay at First
United Methodist, said, ``Reverend Sineath's leaving left us
groping around in the dark, looking for where do we go from here.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict was a critical moment for the Marietta church, said
the Rev. Sam Storey, the interim pastor, and has put a severe
strain on several marriages and friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Many who attended First United Methodist, including Sineath,
said they saw Davis' vote in the Emory case as a betrayal of their
values. In retaliation, the board of stewards for the Marietta
church withheld its annual $235,985 payment to the conference in
January 1998. The church later released the money, but only after
demanding that none of it be paid to any national agency of the
United Methodist Church.
</P>
<P>
   A task force commissioned in January by the stewards to examine
the state of the United Methodist Church concluded that the
national church had begun to hedge on issues like the factuality of
the virgin birth, the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ, and
homosexuality as sin. But experts suggest there is no evidence that
the church has been officially moving away from the traditional
view on the first two issues. On homosexuality, the church forbids
ordination of non-celibate homosexuals and same-sex unions. But
others hold different opinions within the national church, which
has caused the divisive debate.
</P>
<P>
   In April, largely in reaction to the report from First United
Methodist's task force, Davis wrote to Sineath denouncing the
report and saying he could not allow the Marietta church to
continue in its direction of ``unfairly playing on people's fears
and bias.''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, there was little peace between the Marietta
church and its conference. When Sineath came up for reappointment
in March, he was transferred to another church. First United
Methodist's board again voted to withhold its money from the
conference, and several members began talking about forming a new
church.
</P>
<P>
   Sineath chose to retire instead of accepting a transfer, and was
then fired by Davis when he accepted an offer to lead the breakaway
group.
</P>
<P>
   The situation left many lifelong members of First United
Methodist with a tough choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving First Marietta was the most difficult decision I've
ever made,'' said Frank Smith, 63, a member for 31 years. ``But we
were very disappointed in our bishop's vote, and, reading the
report, there came a time when we could no longer support the
national church.''
</P>
<P>
   When First United Methodist was the host of a reception for
Sineath a week ago, the receiving line lasted two hours. Even many
of those who decided to stay at First United Methodist called
Sineath a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in this church disagrees with what's
happened nationally,'' said Storey, the interim pastor. ``But we
chose to stay within the system and make our views known.'' &QL;

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is about as simple as science gets: Spread
10,000 bushels of ancient oyster shells on the bottom of New York
Harbor near the Statue of Liberty, and see if drifting oyster
larvae settle there and grow.
</P>
<P>
   But if the experiment planned for Thursday works, it could
portend a revival of a long-missing link in the ecology and marine
commerce of the waters around New York City. Before the harbor
became choked with pollution, oysters were abundant: the islands
now known as Liberty and Ellis were known to the Dutch as the
Oester, or Oyster, Islands. At the turn of the century, more than 1
million bushels of oysters were harvested each year around the
harbor, from Raritan Bay to the East River.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of the oyster restoration project, its designers
say, is simply to reestablish the mollusks so they can help consume
algae, which can deplete oxygen and suffocate fish, and create a
reef, where oyster colonies and fish can find shelter.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists also say they hope that oysters from New
York Harbor will eventually end up on the plates of restaurant
diners. Once mature, the oysters could be transplanted to cleaner
waters and then flushed of any lingering bacteria in tanks, as is
now commonly done with clams, said Benjamin Longstreth, the project
manager and New York City coordinator for Baykeeper, a private
environmental group in Sandy Hook, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Grand Central Oyster Bar, Michael
Garvey, when informed of the project, said he was hopeful, but
cautious. ``If the oysters are able to grow that means the system
as a whole is getting much better,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a long time, however, before New York City oysters
are listed along with the Cotuits and Chincoteagues on the Oyster
Bar's daily shellfish list, he said. ``It's a great idea,'' he
said. ``But for now, it's a noble experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The experiment has only become possible in recent years. Oysters
largely vanished in city waters early this century, ravaged by
overfishing, suffocated by plumes of raw sewage and buried by silt
washing down the Hudson River from upstate farms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the raw sewage is mostly gone, farming is fading and there
is no oyster harvest at all between Long Island and Delaware Bay,
according to fisheries biologists. The result is that the harbor,
which is seeing a revival of all manner of marine creatures, is
probably hospitable to oysters, Longstreth said.
</P>
<P>
   They just lack good homes _ for oysters, that means hard
surfaces full of nooks and crannies where the tiny larvae can
settle, out of reach of crabs and fish.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they need heaps of submerged oyster shells.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, a scattering of oysters has been seen
around the harbor and up the Hudson in Yonkers on piers, anchor
chains, even submerged grocery carts _ enough to provide a few
larvae, Longstreth said. But without a broad bed of shells, it is
unlikely that a large colony can be established, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mature oysters produce clouds of microscopic larvae that drift
on the tide until they find a hard surface. Those that settle in
the open are almost all eaten by predators. Those that make their
way into a tight space can survive and eventually reproduce, said
Dr. Mark Luckenbach, a marine ecologist at the Virginia Institute
of Marine Science in eastern Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Luckenbach, who was consulted by the Baykeeper group last
winter, has been overseeing the building of artificial oyster reefs
around the Chesapeake Bay, in hopes of reestablishing vast natural
reefs that were completely destroyed by fishing over the past
century. The new reefs will be kept off limits to harvesting,
acting as a reservoir of larvae that can disperse around the bay,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's Bureau of Aquaculture has been building shell
reefs to encourage the establishment of wild oyster colonies for 12
years, said John Volk, the bureau director. And oyster farmers have
used the technique to bolster their cultivated underwater beds for
generations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the restoration work around the country has taken
place in the center of a bustling urban harbor surrounded by
millions of people, Longstreth said. ``We're trying to give nature
a kick start,'' he said. The $35,000 project, which was approved by
the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, is being financed with grants from the Pew
Charitable Trusts, the Victoria Foundation and New Jersey Sea
Grant, Longstreth said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Longstreth oversaw final preparations, as a towering
crane on the waterfront in Elizabeth, N.J., deposited thousands
upon thousands of oyster shells onto a barge. The shells had been
dug from Maryland beds more than 1,000 years old and trucked to the
pier.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, they are scheduled to be towed to a spot in New Jersey
waters near the Statue of Liberty. A New York City Fire Department
fire boat will wash the heaps of shells from the barge into the
harbor with water cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Longstreth said the dumping was timed to precede the first burst
of spawning by the few resident oysters around the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Then it is a matter of waiting for the tides to carry the larvae
to the right spot. Divers will inspect the shells several times
late this summer and in the early fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If no oysters settle naturally, the next step will be to add
some imported live oysters to the bed of shells to seed the area
with larvae, he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Waldman, a biologist for the Hudson River Foundation, a
private group that is not involved in the project, said the time is
right for the oyster's return.

<P>
   ``This is an important part of the local fauna and it's been
kind of forgotten,'' he said. ``Finally, water quality is clean
enough where it's probably a good bet to help these things along.''

AFTER TRIM, TRANSIT BILL CLEARS THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a
$44.5 billion transportation spending bill, after fiscal
conservatives used a parliamentary maneuver to strike from it the
money needed to pay for running the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The move, by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., had the blessing of the
House leadership and averted another crippling slowdown of one of
the 13 spending bills that will finance government operations in
the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's outcome does not mean that the FAA will be left
without the money to pay its costs, including the salaries of the
nation's air traffic controllers and air safety inspectors. Rather,
the sum for the agency will be decided by a House-Senate conference
committee. The Senate's version of the transportation bill, though
not yet passed, would allot the agency about $250 million less than
the $5.9 billion the House had envisioned, and Coburn's effort
makes it likely that the lower number will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't saying we don't want an FAA,'' Coburn said. ``Our
goal is to get spending under control in the House and at the same
time to have adequate funds for the FAA.''
</P>
<P>
   Before passing the bill, on a vote of 429-3, the House also gave
another nod to fiscal conservatives by cutting from it $300 million
that had been designated for airport improvements. This cut had
little practical effect, since the money was from an unused balance
in the current fiscal year and had simply never been spent in any
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the conservatives won a $1 million cut from the
$158 million proposed for administrative functions of the
Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 annual spending bills, the transportation bill is only
the third that has been passed by the House. And the Democratic
minority maintained that none of the day's developments did
anything to avert a looming political showdown later this summer,
when the House will have to consider the largest domestic spending
bills, those for labor, education, health, housing and veterans
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Even many moderate Republicans say the spending limits required
by the Republican budget blueprint are so tight, and the cuts
required by them so deep, that these bills will not be able to win
House passage, much less get signed into law by President Clinton.
Democrats said Wednesday that against those bigger sums, the
savings being forced through now by conservatives were nearly
meaningless. ``It's one of these pretend schemes,'' said Rep.
Martin Olav Sabo, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   But the victories won by the conservatives Wednesday kept them
from thwarting their leadership and stalling the transportation
bill. Last month Coburn tied up the floor for days by offering
amendment after amendment to the agriculture bill, undercutting
efforts by Speaker Dennis Hastert to pass that and other spending
bills in an orderly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The two largest chunks of the transportation bill are $27.7
billion for highway spending and $5.8 billion for mass transit.
Both of those figures were mandated by last year's highway bill,
which, to the consternation of conservatives, was the largest
public works legislation ever enacted by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The mass transit spending, an increase of $407 million over the
current level, drew praise from New Yorkers, who are fighting
against a provision in the Senate version that would reduce that
financing by capping the percentage of total mass transit aid that
could go to any one state. The cap would strike hard at New York
and California, which together account for nearly 50 percent of the
nation's mass transit commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., said the Senate version of the
bill could result in a loss of $160 million to New York state.
``Unlike the bill on the Senate side,'' Congresswoman Maloney said,
``the House version understands that each city and state has
different needs. The same senators who may support caps for mass
transit I would assume would be opposed to similar caps on highway
spending.''

BUSH SEEKS IOWA LEVERAGE IN THE CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (jt) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is trying to use the broad support
for his presidential campaign among the Republican political
establishment in Washington to help him compete in an high-profile
straw poll in Iowa in August.
</P>
<P>
   In an internal memorandum, Sara Taylor, a Bush campaign official
in Iowa, has outlined a plan for 50 major corporate and trade
association lobbyists and other Washington insiders who back Bush
to each persuade at least 15 people in Iowa to participate in the
poll there.
</P>
<P>
   Several candidates have portrayed the event, set for Aug. 14, as
a significant early demonstration of support in Iowa, the state
that historically holds the first presidential caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he plans to compete aggressively in Iowa. And
while the non-binding straw poll amounts to little more than a
``beauty contest'' and has nothing to do with the actual caucuses
early next year, some campaigns have said the poll may be a
make-or-break competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush memorandum was obtained by a rival campaign and passed
on to The New York Times in the hope of revealing Bush's reliance
on the Washington establishment. The memo also demonstrates the
degree to which the Texan's campaign is competing intensely in the
event and how it is seeking to transform Bush's wide support in
Washington into an impressive showing in Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations for Bush in the event are quite high given that
he has overwhelmed the Republican field in opinion polls and
contributions. The goal of the effort, Ms. Taylor wrote, is to
``organize through supportive Washington Trade
Associations/companies to mobilize and turnout 700 Iowans who would
probably not otherwise attend'' the event.
</P>
<P>
   She explained, ``As your crew identifies friendly national
organizations that will encourage their Iowa members to participate
in the straw poll, we, in this office, will work the membership
through the identified key leaders of that organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign, said there
was nothing improper with turning to Washington insiders for an
event in which only Iowans can take part. ``These organizations
represents Iowans,'' she said. ``Their members are Iowans. This is
part of a good organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum listed roughly 50 lobbyists that the Bush
campaign is seeking to enlist, including officials of Associated
Builders and Contractors; United Airlines; the National Association
of Home Builders; National Beer Wholesalers; National Mining
Association; Bell South; National Restaurant Association; Union
Pacific; National Association of Manufacturers; American Trucking
Association; US West; Blue Cross/Blue Shield; Microsoft Inc., and
Consolidated Edison.

GOLDEN STATE NEEDS TO INVEST STRATEGICALLY, TREASURER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- State Treasurer Philip Angelides wants to borrow
a page from the business world to direct the investment of
California's bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with the Daily News editorial board Wednesday, the
former Sacramento developer criticized the way bond money for
infrastructure has been spent in the past _ without what he said
should have been a well-thought out plan. He said the state doesn't
use a comprehensive and cost-effective approach in allocating these
funds _ which is used for the construction and maintenance of
schools, parks and transportation, among others.
</P>
<P>
   As he unveils the Debt Affordability Report today, Angelides not
only follows his predecessors in recommending the amount of bonds
the state can afford to issue, but he also is implementing his own
vision of how the bond money should be spent. The report's title is
``Smart Investments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state doesn't have a strategic investment plan,'' he said.
``If you look at any corporation ... they never start the debate
with how much money they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Angelides also said that by taking care of California's
environment and helping to redevelop the inner cities, all
residents and businesses will benefit. The result will be a better
quality of life, reduced crime and poverty and a more educated work
force, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got some really good ideas,'' said Jean Ross, executive
director of the California Budget Project, a nonprofit policy
research group in Sacramento. ``What's different is the treasurer
is using his position as a bully pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Angelides has been aggressively promoting his vision
across the state. On Wednesday, he kicked off a nine-day campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce
in Sacramento, said he agrees with the treasurer's ideas in
general. But he thinks Angelides doesn't adequately address some
obstacles to his vision.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Zaremberg said it's hard to build condominiums and
apartment complexes in urban areas because of the potential of
frivolous construction lawsuits.

 _ SF CHRON   Animation Gizmo Gets Golfers in the Swing 
 &HT;     By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Dave Burns is not a computer geek and he's not a professional
athlete. He's just a frustrated golfer who dabbled in technology
and came up with a gadget that could be the salvation of hackers
everywhere.
<P>
   Burns' device is called SwingLab, and after two years of testing
at the Lake Merced Country Club, it's now available for public use
at the Mission Bay Golf Center, a driving range in San Francisco's
sunny South of Market neighborhood. A national rollout is slated
for next year.
</P>
<P>
   SwingLab is a kiosk akin to an automated teller machine or
self-serve gas pump. The golfer swipes his credit card and gets
computerized instruction for 95 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses a pair of video cameras, a monitor and some
computer graphics to show a golfer exactly what's wrong with his or
her swing _ during the swing.
</P>
<P>
   Because it takes place in real time, the company says SwingLab
is more effective than a video that a golfer watches later. And
because golfers can actually see what they're doing, it's also
better than having a personal instructor giving verbal
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   It's remarkably simple: A television monitor sits at the
golfer's feet. Cameras mounted at shoulder level capture the
golfer's swing from the front and side view, and put it on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Outlines displayed on the screen show how the golfer should be
aligned and where the club should be.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing feature, though, is SwingLab's use of
animation technology to convert videotape of pros' swings into a
graphic silhouette on the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The customer chooses a pro _ one that matches his or her body
size. Then, the customer's image is superimposed on the pro's, and
the two go through the swing together. ``It's a real-time feedback
loop,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   SwingLab says this puts golfers ``inside the swing'' of top
professionals like Paul Stankowski, Scott McCarron or Laura Davies.
</P>
<P>
   SwingLab has a dozen pro golfers in the system now and expects
to have 50 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy McDaniel, the coach of the University of California at
Berkeley women's golf team, said the superimposed video is an
effective teaching tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically stepping into someone's body, and if it feels
right, you can make the adjustments very naturally right on the
spot,'' she said. ``Instead of a teacher putting their hands on
your hip, you feel that swing, and it feels really good.''
</P>
<P>
   She said SwingLab also makes innovative use of music, combining
the video with a pulsing beat that helps players set a tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Stewart, 33, a San Francisco architect who tried it out
last week, said SwingLab ``made a big difference right away. There
were things I was doing wrong that I wasn't even aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   The Berkeley company has high expectations. It would like to put
a SwingLab kiosk at golf courses and driving ranges around the
country and is also working to install units in golf-crazy Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Under SwingLab's business plan, it will split the revenue with
the host. The company expects to be operating 300 machines by the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   A key selling point, said SwingLab chief executive Gary Wayne,
is how easy the kiosk is to operate. A local golf pro can help
someone with the system for a $10 introductory charge, or anyone
can try it themselves for 95 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   The SwingLab model could be easily translated to other
activities _ throwing a football or baseball, rehabilitation
exercise or skiing, for example. Some baseball teams have already
expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, it's golf, that most maddening of sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything people work harder at and get less
results from than golf,'' said Wayne, who speaks from personal
experience.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly applied to Burns, the inventor. A rangy,
sandy-hair San Anselmo resident, Burns, 44, had left Stanford a few
credits shy of earning his film degree. He found work in Hollywood
as a grip, moving cameras, lights and rigging around on the sets of
such movies as ``Titanic,'' ``Barb Wire'' and ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it's as fun as it sounds, but then you get tired
of standing in the same sneakers for 16 hours in a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, when his daughter was born, he shifted gears. He
shopped around a screenplay and worked on his golf game, but didn't
get far with either endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   He took a lot of golf lessons, until one day, his instructor got
so fed up with his regression to his old swing that ``he forbade me
from practicing not in his presence,'' Burns recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really mad,'' Burns said. ``I thought, `God, if I could
only see what I'm doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   He built a box with a TV in it and hooked it up to a video
camera. ``I could immediately see not only what I was doing wrong,
but where it was coming from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, he was fiddling with his cheap old Amiga
computer, and discovered the art of animation. He took a videotape
of PGA golfer Steve Elkington and made an animated outline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days later, I was standing inside Steve Elkington's golf
swing, in my back yard,'' he said. ``It was amazing. You're
learning what it feels like _ the actual feel.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he worked on the arduous process of
getting a patent. Then he looked for a businessman to run his
company.
</P>
<P>
   He met Wayne, 43, who had moved to California after he and his
partners sold their company, Ithaca Software, to Autodesk for $15
million in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled by it,'' Wayne said. ``I had seen many polished
business plans without good ideas. This was amateurish, but it
contained a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne approached venture capitalists, but they wanted to see
more research before they invested in the company. SwingLab's
financing has come mostly from private investors, including Wayne's
original partners from Ithaca Software and Rich Hanson, a former
StairMaster executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately recognized it as the best teaching device I had
ever seen,'' said Hanson, an exercise physiologist in Thousand
Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of golf and technology was bound to happen, judging
from who's on Bay Area courses. It's people like Jeff Rosenblum,
28, an interactive marketer for Questus New Media in Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to identify things that needed work in my swing
that I wouldn't have thought of without Dave and SwingLab,''
Rosenblum said after his introduction to the technology. ``You've
got to have the good golf swing so you can do the Web deals on the
golf course.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Wells to Use ATMs That Talk  &HT;     By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Threatened with a class-action lawsuit, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. agreed
yesterday to become the first bank in the United States to install
talking automated teller machines for the blind.
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  The technology still is being developed, but ATMs eventually
will be installed at all 1,500 Wells locations in California.
</P>
<P>
   Wells _ which is working with NCR and Diebold, its principal ATM
vendors, to develop the machines _ promised to install 20 of them
in the Bay Area and Los Angeles and San Diego counties within the
next 12 months. It said it will have 100 machines in place by Sept.
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Don Brown, a 40-year-old San Francisco resident and one of four
blind individuals who would have been the lead plaintiffs if a suit
had been filed, said the agreement ``extends the concept of access
for disabled people beyond physical access.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained: ``We already have the curb cuttings and the
wheelchair ramps, but now that we are in the information society,
access has to include access to information.''
</P>
<P>
   Most ATMs already have braille on the keypads _ but only 10
percent of blind people know braille. And those who do know braille
still can't read the silent instructions on the ATM monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said that when he banks after hours, he either must take
along a friend to help with the ATM or seek assistance from
strangers in the ATM line, ``which is probably not the most secure
way of dealing with financial matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The talking machines will be equipped with headphones to ensure
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Information on account balances and the size of withdrawals or
deposits, which now appears silently on ATM monitors, will be
recited by recorded voice through the headphones.
</P>
<P>
   Blind users will be instructed how to use the keypad to deposit
money, withdraw money, transfer funds or buy stamps _ a special
feature offered by Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Haeg, a Wells Fargo spokesman, said there will have to be
an ``orientation of some sort'' to familiarize blind customers who
don't know braille and can't use the keypad.
</P>
<P>
   Wells accepted the plan after more than four years of
negotiations with the California Council of the Blind and the
Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Feingold, a Berkeley lawyer representing the Council of
the Blind, said her client had a strong case under the Americans
with Disabilities Act, which guarantees the disabled equal access
to public facilities.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say whether other banks have been threatened
with lawsuits. But she added: ``If I ran a bank, I would pay
attention to this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann DeFabio, a spokeswoman for Bank of America, said that ``in
the past, we have been approached by the council'' but that no
lawsuit was threatened. She said BofA has been working on the
development of talking ATMs with manufacturers ``for several
years'' and plans a pilot project for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Haeg said Wells Fargo decided from the start ``to view this as a
business opportunity, pure and simple. There was never any
resistance by our management. We're in the service business, our
competitive advantage is better service, and this was a great
opportunity to offer service to a very important segment of our
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't know how many Wells customers are blind.

 IMac Knockoff Is Really a PC in Disguise  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Tucked away in a corner of the huge PC Expo trade show is a
translucent, curvaceous computer with built-in monitor and Internet
connections that comes in five bright colors.
<P>
   It sure looks like an iMac, but it's a Windows-based PC that
costs a third less than the trend-setting Apple model and even has
a floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
   Future Power, an 8-month-old Santa Clara company with backing
from a major Korean manufacturer, unveiled the iMac look-alike at
this week's PC Expo in New York City. Called E-Power, the new
machine is scheduled to go on sale in early September for $799.
</P>
<P>
   It's designed for users who like the iMac's hip styling and easy
setup but don't want to pay $1,199 or want the wider variety of
software available for Windows, according to Future Power
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The E-Power comes in five colors: sapphire, amethyst, emerald,
ruby and topaz. The iMac is available in tangerine, lime,
strawberry, grape and blueberry.
</P>
<P>
   While the iMac has been a huge hit with Apple fans, the E-Power
exhibit, sitting in the shadow of the huge Compaq booth, attracted
scant attention from the PC-centric crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The initial version of the E-Power will come with a 400-MHz
Intel Celeron chip, 64 megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard
drive, a 40x CD-ROM drive and, unlike the iMac, a standard floppy
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, it will have not only a 56 kilobit-per-second
modem, but also a built-in Ethernet networking port that can run at
either 10 or 100 megabits per second. The Ethernet port, which is
not built into most consumer PCs, makes it easy to connect cable
modems and other high-speed Internet access devices to the E-Power.
</P>
<P>
   The system will have two free connectors for the Universal
Serial Bus, a data channel, also used in the iMac. That makes it
possible to add external peripheral devices without most of the
hassles of traditional PC expansion ports.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the E-Power will have one internal slot, so users
can plug in a circuit board with extra features _ something not
possible with the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Software preinstalled in the E-Power will include Windows 98,
IBM's Lotus SmartSuite package of productivity applications and
other educational and entertainment titles. Future Power is backed
by Daewoo Telecom, a division of one of Korea's major industrial
conglomerates. The group already manufactures 300,000 PCs per
month, Future Power officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Future Power has no connection to Emachines, another
Korean-owned company that sells inexpensive PCs called etowers.
</P>
<P>
   Future Power executives said they don't think that their design
will infringe on any of Apple's intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Reynolds, a vice president at Dataquest in San Jose, also
didn't think there would be any legal issues, though he couldn't
guarantee that Apple won't try to sue.

 MEDIABYTES/DAN FOST  &HT;     Online Journalists Hope Association Will Improve Their 
 Credibility 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Online journalists want some respect.
<P>
   The nascent Online News Association wants to get it for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Net, after all, is the medium that brought us Matt Drudge's
unsubstantiated rumors (some of which turned out to be true),
paid-for book recommendations on Amazon.com, and Pierre Salinger's
online ``proof'' that TWA Flight 800 was shot down by a missile.
</P>
<P>
   The association, a month-old trade group that already has 100
members, aims to restore credibility and establish some standards
after such debacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all very much believe in the value of producing credible,
compelling journalism and want to foster that in this medium. It's
a medium that doesn't always have a reputation for that level of
quality,'' said Jamie Heller, editor of strategic ventures at
TheStreet.com and treasurer of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to institute prizes (online scribes feel shunned
by the Pulitzers and the National Magazine Awards) and foster a
collegial atmosphere that will help shape the new medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You face so many issues, it's so great to have a group of
colleagues you can bounce things off of,'' Heller said. She can ask
fellow members: ``How do you operate in a medium that has no
deadlines? How do you set up your newsroom? What kind of use do you
make out of things like hit reports on stories? What kind of
technology do you use to publish your stories?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's creating a network of people who are facing the same
challenges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Jaroslovsky, the managing editor of the Wall Street Journal
Interactive Edition and the president of the ONA, said people first
discussed forming a group when they would see each other at trade
shows. The idea finally came to fruition with a small amount of
seed money from Dow Jones, the Journal's parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The group will educate people about online journalism. For
instance, online sports journalists have been denied media access
to some athletic events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sponsoring body said, `We don't want to accredit you
because we have our own Web site, and you're competition,'''
Jaroslovsky said. ``To deny professional journalists the
opportunity to cover an event is not acceptable. We wouldn't stand
for it in print or broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaroslovsky said organizations like TheStreet.com or Cnet's
News.com, ``which have grown up around the Web, are every bit as
entitled to respect as the New York Times and the Wall Street
Journals and the CNNs of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Membership is $50 a year. The association's Web site is at what
Jaroslovsky called ``the euphonious
 &LR; www.onlinenewsassociation.org &LR; . We wanted  &LR; www.ona.org &LR; ,'' he
said, ``but the Ontario Nurses Association beat us to it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SETTING THE STANDARD STRAIGHT: As a magazine that publishes both in
print and online, the Industry Standard faces just the sorts of
issues that the Online News Association plans to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   One of the thorniest: corrections. An online news purveyor has
the option of smoothing over its mistakes without ever alerting the
readers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many online news purveyors, the Standard tells its readers
when it corrects an article. It even maintains a page of such
miscues, at  &LR; www.thestandard.com/articles &LR;   &LR; /corrections/ &LR; . But the
page had a technological problem: Each correction provided a link
to the full story, which appeared in its corrected form on the
screen. But when the reader printed the story, the original version
would show up, error and all.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, an April 19 story about Salon.com said that
Hambrecht and Quist was handling the initial public offering.
Wrong! It was W.R. Hambrecht, a different bank. The Standard posted
a correction, and the story was repaired. But click on ``print this
article,'' and the original, erroneous version would show up.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an inquiry, editor Jonathan Steinberg said the
problem was ``a technical glitch which we were not aware of,'' and
he had it fixed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Another change in the works: He's rethinking a policy under
which sources can complain about a story, and if he thinks there's
a likelihood their complaint will hold up, he'll grant an
``injunction'' of sorts and pull the story until the issues are
worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a complex story, it can take several days to determine
if the complaint is legitimate or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on those occasions when he'd yank a story, he said,
``Suddenly, there's a story out there that mysteriously
disappeared.'' Some people saw it, maybe some sites link to it, and
it's no longer up.
</P>
<P>
   That has him mulling a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to be in a situation where you're pretending
that something you published on your Web site, for however short a
period of time, never existed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a lot of interesting issues that arise,'' he
said. ``There are not very well-worked-out conventions about how to
deal with these things.'' &UR;  &LR;

 American Taking Reno Air Flights Under Its Wing  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
American Airlines said yesterday that it will fold Reno Air's 150
flights a day into its own operation by August 31.
<P>
   No jobs will be cut as part of the merger, American executives
said, and ticket prices are expected to remain competitive because
American still must compete against United Airlines, Southwest
Airlines and Alaska Airlines for passengers going up and down the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation announced yesterday follows last December's
purchase of Reno Air for $124 million by American. Since then,
American has been developing a plan to integrate the two systems.
</P>
<P>
   American is picking up all of Reno Air's flights and routes,
with the exception of service to Vancouver, Burbank and Tucson,
Ariz., that overlapped with existing service by American.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the merger will beef up American's north-south
service on the West Coast, which was the primary reason for the
merger.
</P>
<P>
   Reno flights that are being converted into American flights
include 14 flights a day from San Francisco International Airport
to Los Angeles and Orange County and 32 flights a day from San Jose
International Airport to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Portland, Reno and
Seattle. Reno Air did not serve Oakland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to flights added through the merger, American said
it plans to create 20 new West Coast flights to 19 cities in July.
That includes direct flights from San Francisco to Dallas-Forth
Worth and Chicago; flights from San Jose to Orange County, San
Diego, New York and Tokyo; as well as one additional flight from
Oakland to Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making a serious commitment to expanding and
strengthening American's presence in the West,'' said Mike Gunn,
American's senior vice president of marketing who made a sweep
through California yesterday promoting the consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   By August 31, all 2,000 former Reno Air employees will be
wearing American Airlines uniforms and all airport signage will
change from Reno to American.
</P>
<P>
   The Reno Air name will live on, in the form of aircraft paint,
for a few months longer. It will be January before the 25 ex-Reno
aircraft will be refurbished to conform to American's look and
feel. First-class cabins will be added, and both first-class and
coach sections will receive new cabin interiors.

 S.F. Board President Opposes AT&AMP;T Cable Plan  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors yesterday
opposed a proposal that would block competitors from offering
high-speed Internet service over AT&AMP;T's cable TV lines.
<P>
   At a meeting of the board's Public Utilities and Deregulation
Committee, Supervisor Tom Ammiano said he would vote against a
proposal recommended by the city's telecommunications department
because he believes that consumers should be able to select
high-speed access from a multitude of providers, not just AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The city department's proposal would allow AT&AMP;T, which recently
bought TCI, to control Internet access over the cable lines.
Instead, Ammiano said he will offer a substitute proposal and
scheduled a closed-session vote by the full board on the matter for
July 6.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is whether San Francisco customers will have one or
several choices for high-speed Internet access via cable TV lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T plans to offer super-fast Internet access over TCI's cable
lines. TCI customers will get the service through ExciteAtHome, an
Internet service provider that offers cable modem service at speeds
up to 100 times faster than a traditional dial-up modem.
ExciteAtHome is 40 percent owned by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But Ammiano and other board members want AT&AMP;T to allow other
Internet service providers, like America Online, to be able to
offer high-speed Internet access over TCI's cable lines.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like AOL want to let their customers gain access to
their own content through fast cable modems. Aside from building
their own cable systems, however, the only other way for AOL and
other ISPs to access cable lines is to lease them from providers,
like AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if a TCI customer wanted to use a cable modem to
access AOL, he or she would have to sign up with ExciteAtHome for
$40 a month and pay another $20 a month to AOL. With open access,
customers only would have to pay AOL and wouldn't have to go
through ExciteAtHome to get online.
</P>
<P>
   To force AT&AMP;T's hand, the Board of Supervisors has tried to make
``open access'' a condition for approval of the AT&AMP;T/TCI merger.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When AT&AMP;T bought TCI last year, it had to apply for a transfer
of control of TCI's cable franchise. The board is the body that
will approve that transfer.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has resisted allowing open access, saying it's not
technically feasible and arguing that municipalities cannot impose
such requirements. The company also has said open access would
delay its planned upgrade of TCI's cable systems across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a federal judge in Portland rejected AT&AMP;T's
arguments, saying cities do have the right to impose conditions
when approving a franchise transfer. The judge said, in a decision
that AT&AMP;T is appealing, that the telephone giant should be forced
to open its cable lines in the Portland area.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's competitors were hopeful that San Francisco would follow
Portland's lead and try to impose open access. For the past four
months, San Francisco and AT&AMP;T have been wrangling over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But yesterday, Julia Friedlander, who heads the city's
telecommunications department, recommended a proposal that critics
called weak and said would give AT&AMP;T a monopoly over high-speed
access.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation said AT&AMP;T would only have to provide open
access in San Francisco if a precedent was set and AT&AMP;T ``agreed''
to provide it in another city. It would not require that AT&AMP;T open
its lines even if a legal ruling, such as the one in Portland, was
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander admitted that the city wanted stronger language but
said AT&AMP;T was unwilling to commit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she recommended that the board approve the current
proposal because it included a provision guaranteeing that AT&AMP;T
would upgrade its cable system in San Francisco within four years.
If the city doesn't approve the negotiated agreement, she said,
AT&AMP;T could walk away from the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of risk for the city,'' Friedlander said.
``If the ordinance is not adopted, it's possible the (cable) system
will not get rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ammiano and two other board members said the proposal was
insufficient and would lead to an AT&AMP;T monopoly over high-speed
Internet access. ``This is an anticompetitive arrangement,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Yee, another board member, said if AT&AMP;T wants to walk
away from San Francisco, ``Fine, we'll have other people come in
and provide service.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Patch, an attorney representing AT&AMP;T, said the company
is not against open access but resents government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city should conclude that the far better public policy
here is that competition and not regulation should pick the winners
in the Internet service area,'' Patch told the board.
</P>
<P>
   He said competitors already have other ways to offer high-speed
access, such as over digital subscriber lines and via
satellite. &UR;  &LR; ``Forced access simply does not work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a coalition arguing against AT&AMP;T disagreed, saying open
access is what stands between San Francisco retaining its status as
America's ``most wired city'' or stalling on the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement, as it stands now, would create a local
monopoly stranglehold on cable Internet access,'' said Katie Roper,
director of the Bay Area Open Access Coalition. ``Just like
Portland, San Francisco has a right to expect and demand open
access.''

 Wells Fargo, 2 Other Banks Launch Firm to Speed Online
Bill  Delivery 
 &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Three major banks, including San Francisco's Wells Fargo, said
yesterday they are starting a company to promote online delivery of
bills to consumers.
<P>
   New York's Chase Manhattan and North Carolina's First Union will
join Wells Fargo in the venture, which will build a computer
switching system linking billers to financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Those institutions, in turn, will use their Internet sites to
deliver bills to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Formation of the for-profit company, tentatively named the
Exchange, brings the much-hyped but long delayed technology a big
step closer to widespread availability, the banks said. The company
will begin operating by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, different groups of banks and vendors are developing
their own systems using software languages that can't communicate
readily with other systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Exchange will use technology that will connect the separate
systems, potentially uniting billers, financial institutions and
consumers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to jumpstart the industry,'' said Wells Fargo
executive vice president Sharon Osberg, the bank's chief of online
financial services.
</P>
<P>
   First Union already offers bills over the Internet on a limited
basis and Wells Fargo plans to begin doing so by October. But
experts say growth will be limited until there is a single set of
standards that billers and financial institutions can use
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In online billing, consumers receive their bills electronically
when they go to their checking accounts on the Internet. They can
pay bills with a mouse click and their accounts will automatically
be debited.
</P>
<P>
   Under previous home banking setups, consumers could pay online
by keying in vendor information but bills were still delivered by
regular mail.

 Diamond's New Rio Offers More Music  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc. today will introduce a new version
of its Rio handheld digital music player that will store more music
than the original, play encrypted songs and come in four colors.
<P>
   Due out on store shelves in the fall, Diamond's new Rio PMP 500
will hold up to two hours' worth of music, about twice as much as
the original PMP 300. The new Rio, which will retail for $269, can
be upgraded with optional memory cards to store even more songs.
</P>
<P>
   The new version will come in three translucent colors _ gray,
teal and purple _ in addition to the basic black.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the new Rio will be compatible with Macintosh computers;
the original only worked with Windows-based PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the new Rio will be able to play scrambled as
well as unscrambled music.
</P>
<P>
   Both Rios are about the size of a pager and play music that has
been converted into the MP3 format, a method for storing, playing
and sharing audio on computers.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Rio came out in November, music companies had no
way to prevent people from copying music from a CD into the MP3
format and sharing it with others _ for free _ over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the first Rio _ an estimated 125,000 were sold
_ forced the recording industry to find a way to encrypt, or
scramble, music to thwart MP3 pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The first Rio, which now sells for as low as $119, can only play
music that has not been encrypted. Although the music industry
still has not agreed on a standard for encryption, Diamond says the
new Rio will be able to play copyright-protected music no matter
what standard is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   It also will play not just MP3 songs but also music stored in a
variety of other formats, including Microsoft's upcoming Windows
Media Audio.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst predicts that the Rio and other handheld digital
audio players could be a hot gift item by this Christmas, although
so far, only the original Rio MP3 player is on U.S. store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the lead in the market and we want to leverage that
lead,'' said David Watkins, president of RioPort Inc., a new
division of San Jose's Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio demonstrated the potential for sales of digital music
over the Internet. RioPort will try to cash in on that potential by
selling music, audio books, foreign language lessons and other
audio products over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc., said the
RioPort and the new Rio should keep Diamond, which is being
acquired by chipmaker S3, at the forefront of the market as other
competing devices start to appear later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs Inc. of Milpitas, for example, is developing its
Nomad MP3 player that also has an FM radio. Sony Corp. is also
working on its own digital music player.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the longest time, I've been concerned because Diamond had
the market in their hand and they weren't doing anything,'' Hardie
said. ``They were sitting there resting on their laurels.''
</P>
<P>
   In related news, Musicland Stores Corp., which owns video and
music stores including Sam Goody and Suncoast, launched a series of
new Web sites to sell CDs and videos online.
</P>
<P>
   Musicland Vice Chairman Keith Benson said the online sites could
eventually sell digital music directly to consumers through the
Internet or even at existing stores.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not concerned the digital music revolution will
replace his traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see this as a big negative to stores,'' Benson said.
``The Internet will be a transfer of market from stores, but since
the entire record industry is growing at about 6 to 7 percent per
year, nobody's going to suffer.''

SEARCH FOR SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER MOVES TO KENTUCKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill., Ky, Texas) 
 
By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ The search for suspected serial killer Rafael
Resendez-Ramirez is now focusing on Kentucky because he has
relatives in the Lexington area and a man matching his description
was recently seen in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Lexington police, along with a multi-agency task force
headquartered in Houston, believe the 38-year-old Mexican national
has returned to Kentucky, where the first of the string of eight
murders occurred in August 1997. Resendez-Ramirez was formally
charged Wednesday with the murder of University of Kentucky student
Christopher Maier and the rape of Maier's girlfriend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Resendez-Ramirez was charged with the June 15 murders
of two people in Jackson County, Ill., about 50 miles from the
Kentucky state line.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they had received reports that he was seen last
week at two homeless shelters in Louisville, and possibly a third
time Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The description we have of Rafael Ramirez was he was wearing a
white shirt, blue jeans, carrying a baseball cap. That was verified
through independent sources in Illinois,'' said Lexington Police
Sgt. Mark Barnard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sightings in Louisville indicated the same clothing
description from independent sources, with the baseball cap being
brown in color he was carrying or wearing at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said workers and patrons at the shelters were shown
pictures of Resendez-Ramirez and confirmed that he was the man they
had seen.
</P>
<P>
   Resendez-Ramirez is about 5-foot-7, 145 pounds. He uses many
aliases and changes his appearance frequently, although he is
believed to need prescription eyeglasses. He has scars on a right
fingertip, left arm and forehead, a faded tattoo of a snake on his
left forearm and, possibly, a tattoo of a flower on his left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The Salvation Army shelter in Louisville would not discuss the
reported sighting there, but the director of the St. Vincent De
Paul Center in that city said a man fitting Resendez-Ramirez's
description ate in their kitchen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it was him, but a person fitting the
description given to us by the FBI generally fit the man,'' said
center director John Cecil. ``In Louisville, Kentucky, that man
would stand out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cecil said the man was at the shelter about 20 minutes, just
long enough to eat. The center does not require patrons to sign in
or out for meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was no different from all the other people we serve in the
kitchen,'' Cecil said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not been sighted in Lexington, Barnard said
authorities here plan to hand out about 1,000 pocket-sized cards
with Resendez-Ramirez's picture to homeless shelters and the
Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that Rafael Ramirez is somewhere in the state of
Kentucky,'' Barnard said. ``We know he has family members here. We
know he has been here. This is where the earliest murder that we
had originates from... So there's a cell for him to operate out of
here somewhere or some knowledge that he has in the Lexington area.
That's got out interest high... And we are taking every
precaution.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnard would not elaborate on who the family members were,
saying only they were established citizens and were cooperating
fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is on a killing spree,'' said Assistant Lexington
Police Chief F.D. Root said. ``Certainly he is acting with reckless
abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Five of the murders Resendez-Ramirez has been linked to occurred in
Texas. On Dec. 17, 1998, the stabbed body of Dr. Claudia Benton was
found in her home in West University Place.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, the bodies of Norman and Karen Sirnic were found in
Weimer, Texas. On June 4, the bludgeoned body of Josephine
Konvicka, 73, was found in her Fayette County home. One day later,
Noemi Dominguez's beaten body was found in Houston in her home in
the 6900 block of Van etten. Her stolen car was found later in Del
Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Last week George Morber, 80 and his daughter Carolyn Frederick,
52, were found dead in their home in Gorham, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In northeast Texas, Hughes Springs police are trying to
determine if a palm print left at the Oct. 2 slaying of 87-year-old
Lefie Mason match those of Resendez-Ramirez. Mason's home in the
small town north of Tyler also was near train tracks.

 _ SF CHRON  
 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A/Dave Einstein  &HT;     Pros and Cons Of Cable Modems 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: I'm thinking about getting cable Internet service, which
recently became available in my community. But I've heard that it's
not really as fast as they say and that it can get pretty slow if
there are too many subscribers. Practically speaking, what kind of
speeds should I expect? Also, what if I want to connect a second PC
in my house to the service? Does that cost extra?
<P>
   A: Companies like AtHome say their cable modem connections
deliver the Internet up to 20 times faster than a 28.8
kilobits-per-second modem, which would make it 2.9 megabits a
second. In reality, however, you're never going to see that kind of
speed. The average user will get anywhere from 300 to 800 kilobits
per second. And yes, the speed does drop if a lot of people in a
local area are using the service at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the over-inflated claims, however, cable Internet
service is still a great deal, even at about $40 a month. That's
twice the price of the average dial-up connection. But the cable
connection doesn't tie up your telephone line. If you're an
Internet junkie, that's important. And best of all, the cable
service is always on, so you don't have to dial in each time you
want to use it.
</P>
<P>
   As to your other question, adding a second PC to a cable modem
account generally costs $5 to $10 per month. The service providers
say they have to charge for it because each PC connected through
the cable needs its own dedicated Internet address. Au contraire.
With a home-networking package such as AnyPoint from Intel, a
second PC in your home can share the primary Internet connection
for free, whether it's from a dial-up Internet service provider or
a cable service. Both PCs can be used simultaneously to surf the
Web, with no appreciable loss of speed. But bear in mind that
AnyPoint costs $189. So if you don't really need a home network,
you might be better off biting the bullet and paying the cable
company.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Talk's Cheap _ Word Isn't
</P>
<P>
   Q: My new PC came with Microsoft Works. It's a pretty bare-bones
suite of applications, and the word processor that's included just
isn't going to cut if for me. I'd like to get Microsoft Word, but I
know it's pricey. Are there any alternatives to Word that could do
the job and save me some money?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: You're right about Word being expensive. In fact, the
latest version, Word 2000, will cost you about $320. (You also can
get it as part of the Office 2000 suite for $450.) The most
cost-effective alternative probably is Word Pro 97, a full-fledged
word processor from Lotus which carries a street price of $62.
</P>
<P>
   You also might try hunting around for a program called Microsoft
Home Essentials. At under $100, it's a helluva deal _ comes with
Word 97 (the version that Word 2000 replaced) as well as versions
of Microsoft Money and Encarta, the CD encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   But Home Essentials may be hard to find because it appears that
Microsoft has phased it out (probably because it was cannibalizing
sales of Word and Microsoft Office). If you can't find Home
Essentials in any stores, try locating a used copy on eBay or one
of the other online auction houses. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Scanner SetUp
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to add a scanner to my system, but there's no place
to plug it into my computer. I already have a Zip drive connected
to the parallel port on the back of the PC, and my printer is
plugged into the pass-through port on the back of the Zip drive.
Any suggestions for a way to connect a scanner?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: You have a couple of options. One is to get a switch box,
which will let you run multiple devices off the single parallel
port on your PC. A simple switch box with two connections costs as
little as $7. Boxes allowing for more devices cost up to $50. Your
other option is to buy a scanner that uses a USB connection rather
than a parallel port (assuming that your PC has a USB port and that
you have Windows 98 or a later version of Windows 95 that supports
USB).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Optimizing your hard drive with Windows' Disk Defragmenter can
improve your system's performance. (It takes information that's
strewn around the disk and puts it back in order.) But defragging a
big drive can take more than an hour. So take advantage of the
Maintenance Wizard in Windows 98, which lets you run the Disk
Defragmenter at a scheduled time when you don't have to use the PC.
Go to Start/Programs/Accessories/System Tools, click Maintenance
Wizard, and follow the instructions.

LUCENT AND LEVEL 3 REACH $1 BILLION PHONE GEAR DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bolstering its cyberspace credentials, Lucent Technologies Inc.
agreed Wednesday to sell up to $1 billion worth of equipment to
Level 3 Communications Inc., the new long-distance communications
carrier, for transmitting phone calls using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   While Qwest Communications International Inc., perhaps the
best-known new long-distance carrier, and older brethren like the
AT&AMP;T Corp. use a range of communications technologies in their
networks, Level 3 is trying a pure Internet approach. That requires
finding ways to transmit not only Web pages but also phone calls
and video signals using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Level 3 is using mostly high-speed Internet switches made by
Cisco Systems Inc., the data communications giant, in the core of
its network. But Level 3 has turned to Lucent, the former equipment
arm of AT&AMP;T, to help replicate the strengths of the traditional
telephone network using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Level 3 signed up as the first big company to use a new product
that Lucent calls a ``softswitch.'' The softswitch is software that
runs on standard computer work stations and is meant to provide the
reliability and features of traditional phone switches but at a
fraction of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Because Internet technology, known as IP, breaks communications
down into small packets that can travel along different routes, it
is often more efficient than more traditional communications
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lucent softswitch, together with Level 3's IP network,
will bring customers the best of both the traditional telephone
network and the Internet _ ubiquity and reliability combined with
rapid cost reductions and innovative new services,'' said James Q.
Crowe, chief executive of Level 3. ``Customers will be able to get
the same quality of service but at lower cost, and they can further
benefit from the continuously improving price-performance of
Internet technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is developing a rival to Lucent's softswitch called a
virtual switch controller, which is being tested by the Sprint
Corp., the No. 3 long-distance carrier. Both products are basically
meant to help provide the telephone component for high-speed data
switches, many of which were designed to carry e-mail and Web
pages, not phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent and Cisco are developing their technologies for standard
computers instead of for their own systems in a bid to encourage
other companies to develop applications that can fit in their
frameworks. Lucent said that its softswitch had been developed for
Sun Microsystems Inc.'s Solaris operating system, a version of
Unix, and that it would be converted for use on the Microsoft
Corp.'s Windows NT system, the Hewlett-Packard Co.'s systems and
potentially Linux, a free version of Unix.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Level 3 will buy at least $250 million in
equipment from Lucent over four years, though the relationship
could grow to $1 billion over five years. Only 50 percent to 60
percent of Level 3's spending will be on the softswitch, with the
rest going for other Lucent products geared mainly for transmitting
phone calls using Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Lucent rose $3, to $65.6875, while Level 3 rose 43.75
cents, to $70.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent plans Thursday to complete its $20 billion acquisition of
Ascend Communications Inc., one of Cisco's foremost rivals. But
that deal will still leave Lucent without the sort of high-speed
Internet router required by the softswitch. That is one reason that
Lucent is close to an agreement to acquire Nexabit Networks Inc., a
private maker of high-speed Internet switches, for $600 million to
$800 million, according to executives close to those talks.

MICROSOFT'S FINAL WITNESS IS QUESTIONED ON PAYMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government lawyer began cross-examination of
Microsoft's final witness in its antitrust trial Wednesday and
quickly prompted him to disclose that Microsoft had paid about
$250,000 for his testimony and related work.
</P>
<P>
   The witness was Richard L. Schmalensee, dean of the Sloan School
of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Microsoft's expert economist for the trial. He said that over the
last two years he has charged Microsoft $800 an hour for his trial
work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the private company through which he bills
Microsoft paid him a $200,000 bonus last year, double that of the
previous year, presumably because of the Microsoft income.
</P>
<P>
   A fee of $800 an hour is not an unusual retainer for an expert
witness of this sort. But David Boies, the government's lead trial
lawyer, apparently hoped the disclosure would further his broad
effort to impeach Schmalensee's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Schmalensee was on the stand, in January, Boies
suggested that he was Microsoft's ``house economist.''
</P>
<P>
   Expert witnesses are routinely paid for their testimony. And
Boies posed his questions long after the government's own expert
economist, Franklin M. Fisher, another MIT professor, had left the
stand, giving Microsoft's lawyers no opportunity to pose similar
questions to him.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony while Fisher was on the stand suggested that he, too,
stood to profit handsomely from participating in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lacovara, a Microsoft lawyer, ended his friendly
examination of Schmalensee Wednesday morning with a long series of
questions about Web-based applications _ software programs that
reside on the Web and are used while on line.
</P>
<P>
   He showed several examples of new entrants in this budding
market and observed that the trend suggested Microsoft did not have
a durable monopoly in personal computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is hearing the case without a
jury, had shown interest in the subject Tuesday evening, saying he
imagined software companies were writing these programs ``in
droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, Lacovara introduced as evidence an Internet
news article published just two hours before Jackson's remark,
headlined ``Web-based applications debut in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, Your Honor, we get lucky,'' Lacovara said, and the
judge smiled appreciatively.
</P>
<P>
   But when Boies' turn came, he asked Schmalensee if it was not
true that to use a Web-based application, a user needed a Web
browser and an operating system _ in most cases, Windows.
Schmalensee reluctantly agreed. The unspoken question was: How does
this phenomenon threaten Windows if a Windows computer was needed
to use the programs?
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession, Boies also managed to discredit two charts
that Schmalensee had offered as evidence on Monday and, by
implication, to raise questions about the validity of a wide range
of statistics the witness had offered as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The charts were meant to show that the Netscape browser was
growing and thriving, despite Microsoft's efforts to crush it.
Boies quickly pointed out that the chart was flawed, the
conclusions exaggerated. Schmalensee, clearly flustered, stammered
a bit as he said: ``A comparison here suggests there's a
difficulty. One of these things is wrong, that's apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Microsoft offered a corrected version of the chart. But
then Boies set about attacking the underlying data. He showed
several e-mail messages in which a survey company had told
Microsoft that one of the key questions used to derive browser
market share was badly flawed, resulting in unreliable answers. But
Microsoft had not accepted the company's suggestion to change it.
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee said he had not even been aware of the discussion,
though the private company with which he is associated was a party
to the e-mail dialogue. In any case, the witness said, ``I'm not a
specialist in writing surveys, and wouldn't have felt competent to
evaluate it.'' Besides, he added, ``I don't consider it
particularly material.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Boies showed that one key question was so badly designed
that 20 percent of the answers were demonstrably unreliable. ``A 20
percent figure inconsistency _ wouldn't that bother you?'' he asked
Schmalensee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really depend on the exact question asked,'' the
witness replied.

MARKET PLACE: EXTENDED TRADING HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that after-hours trading is coming. But nobody
seems to know when.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ says it can be ready this fall, but prefers to wait until
next year. The New York Stock Exchange says it does not want to be
ready this year, and will wait until next year at least. Several
upstart electronic trading networks say they are ready to go as
soon as July. And the Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
solution befitting a government agency, wants to have a meeting to
select a committee to begin discussing the issues.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: Investors do not yet need to start burning
the midnight oil.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. said he would
convene a meeting June 30 to explore the issues raised by
after-hours trading with the major stock exchanges, brokerage firms
and consumer groups. The meeting will be co-sponsored by the Big
Board and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which
oversees the NASDAQ Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Following the meeting, the three sponsors will select working
group participants to iron out details about extended trading
hours, including issues of investor protection and education,
clearance and settlement of trades, other trading conventions like
trading halts and dissemination of market data, and options market
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summit will begin an industrywide effort to address issues
raised by after-hours trading that impact our U.S. capital
markets,'' Levitt said in a statement. ``Our goal is to insure that
market integrity and investor confidence remain strong, regardless
of when the markets are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, U.S. stock markets are open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Various proposals for evening-hours trading call for sessions to
extend from 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But institutional investors and small brokerage firms, among
others, have objected to the plans, in part because they do not
want to have to staff their offices late into the evening. Critics
also say that the after-hours markets, with fewer participants,
will be less liquid, causing stock prices to be more volatile and
less reflective of a company's real value.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of after-hours trading say that individual investors
want to be able to trade at night, when they have more time to
research their investments. In a digital world, they say, it no
longer makes sense to restrict their trading activity to a few
hours that are most convenient to people on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what effect, if any, the SEC's summit meeting
will have on the possibility that some private networks will allow
individual investors to begin trading after hours this year.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC has said it will not stand in the way of the electronic
communications networks, or ECNs, that want to start evening
trading this year. But the commission has said it will keep a close
eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   Among those ECNs is Eclipse Trading, which has received
investment commitments from two big Wall Street brokerage firms,
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Two others, Wit Capital and Island ECN, a subsidiary of Datek
Online Holdings Corp., have said they want to offer extended
trading hours by next year.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ, meanwhile, said last month that it would begin planning
to extend its trading hours as soon as this fall. But it insisted
that it wanted all parties to coordinate the start of after-hours
trading. When the Big Board said it would wait until 2000, NASDAQ's
plans became less clear.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington on
Wednesday, NASD chairman Frank Zarb said the smartest thing would
appear to be delaying after-hours trading until next year.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ officials said that while they could be ready for
after-hours trading this year, they would have to shift computer
programmers to that effort from other tasks, namely preparing for
the Year 2000 change-over and preparing for a switch to the
reporting of stock prices in decimals.
</P>
<P>
   That is not all going on at NASDAQ. Zarb said the NASD is
interested in building a futures trading business, which would
start with Treasury debt instruments and expand to other products.
The organization is also considering spinning off its regulatory
subsidiary and converting the NASDAQ Stock Market to public
ownership, complete with an initial public offering of shares in
the market.
</P>
<P>
   With so much on its plate, NASDAQ officials say they would not
be upset if evening trading in the United States was delayed until
next year. That would put the start date closer to that of its new
NASDAQ-Japan venture, which is expected to start up in the fourth
quarter of 2000. NASDAQ-Japan will offer trading of the 100 largest
NASDAQ stocks in Japan during Japanese market hours.
</P>
<P>
   Together with evening trading hours in the United States, the
NASDAQ-Japan proposal would provide NASDAQ investors with a
semblance of around-the-clock trading _ close to 24 hours a day, if
not seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want it, so extended hours will be a reality,'' Zarb
said Wednesday. The big question is when.

ECONOMIC SCENE: SOLUTIONS CAN BECOME PROBLEMS FOR MENTAL ILLNESS
INSURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (af)  
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The White House conference earlier this month on mental illness
highlighted the Clinton administration's campaign, led by Tipper
Gore, to achieve ``parity for all'' _ requiring health insurers to
provide the same coverage for mental illness that they provide for
physical illness. Bills in Congress would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The call for parity raises two questions. Is coverage of mental
health the same as that of physical health? And who should decide?
</P>
<P>
   Almost all employer-based policies impose higher co-payments and
other stricter limits on coverage of mental illness. Critics often
blame bias _ an irrational stigma attached to mental problems _ or
ignorance, misjudging the plight of the ``worried well'' or glibly
dismissing the value of ``taking cures.''
</P>
<P>
   Bias and ignorance are only a small part of the story. A new
study by Richard G. Frank of Harvard University and Thomas G.
McGuire of Boston University shows that powerful economic forces
compel plans to discriminate between physical and mental health.
Congress may still want to proceed. But markets will counteract
parity in ways that advocates will almost surely not like. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Americans experience some diagnosable mental
disorder in a typical year. Only about 25 percent of them receive
treatment. About 4 percent of the population suffers in any year
from the most severe problems: schizophrenia, manic depression and
major depression. But only between 30 percent and 55 percent of
them receive treatment. Given the yawning need, why don't employers
offer parity?
</P>
<P>
   The Frank-McGuire study offers two economic reasons. First,
adverse selection. A plan that offers generous coverage of mental
health would attracts people with expensive mental health problems.
In health care, a few patients always account for a large fraction
of expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity is exaggerated for mental health, where 5 percent
of such patients may account for 30 percent or more of costs. So a
plan whose lavish benefits attract the sickest mentally ill people
invites bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   One way to diminish adverse selection is for government to
impose parity. That way, plans could not easily tailor their
benefits to push the chronically mentally ill onto other insurers.
But health plans that offer equal physical and mental benefits
would butt up against a second insurance problem, moral hazard:
changes in behavior that are caused by the presence of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   People with health insurance buy more medical treatments than do
the uninsured. But studies of patients in fee-for-service plans
show that the impact of insurance on demand for treatment was twice
as large for treatment of mental problems as for physical problems,
McGuire said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason can be traced to the fact that nonsevere
forms of mental illness are hard to diagnose and leave therapists
wide discretion over course of treatment. He concludes that some of
the insurance-induced demand is for mental health services that
patients did not deem very valuable when asked to pay themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sobering estimate: about 12 percent of the population
with no diagnosable mental disorders receive treatment and account
for nearly a third of all visits for mental health. If parity
drives up mental health costs and premiums, the danger is that more
employers will drop coverage and more workers will turn it down
because it will have become too expensive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Frank-McGuire study, then, decisively concludes that
coverage of mental health is different from that of physical
health. So should insurance coverage treat the two types of
patients differently? Frank and McGuire used to think so, at least
for patients with nonsevere mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   But they have changed their minds, for a reason advocates will
find upsetting. The difference between then and now, they say, is
the explosive rise of managed care. Under managed care, contractual
niceties, like co-payments, deductibles and lifetime limits lose
their importance because every expenditure, regardless of
contractual obligations, is subject to second-guessing. So managed
care has all the tools it needs to control costs even if Congress
requires parity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parity,'' Frank said, ``is affordable only because managed
care exists.'' But making parity work by driving patients into the
scrupulous oversight of managed care is probably not what many of
its advocates have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There are grounds for government to dictate the list of benefits
that every private plan offers as one way to dull their ability to
tailor benefits to drive away the chronically ill. But the prospect
of legislators selling priority of place to medical specialities
bearing campaign gifts is hardly inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a better idea would to turn the task over to a blue
ribbon panel that would hand its recommendations over to
legislatures for an up and down vote without amendment. That would
put politicians in charge, but mute the craven features of the
current system. &QL;

MISSOURI REP. VERNON THOMPSON FACES FRAUD CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri Rep. Vernon Thompson, his son and
two others conspired to steal more than $250,000 in federal
anti-poverty funds from low-income apartment developments in Kansas
City, federal prosecutors charged Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Also charged in a 22-count indictment were Kevin R. Sallard and
Tuscon D. Redd, the owner and operator of a company that managed
several federally subsidized multifamily housing projects in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   According to the charges, as part of the alleged scheme Sallard,
40, and Jamil Thompson, 22, worked as straw employees of Redd's
management company, Omega Realty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about public funds that were intended to improve
the lives of financially disadvantaged people that ended up lining
the pockets of privileged people,'' Chris Whitley, a Justice
Department spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's attorney, Greg Vleisides, maintained his client's
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Mr. Thompson denies all of the charges,'' Vleisides
said. ``Without seeing the evidence, I think it's a weak case. By
the time we're done with it, we'll be able to prove Mr. Thompson
did not act improperly.''
</P>
<P>
   Redd's attorney, John P. O'Connor, said he had not yet seen the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he appears in court he'll be entering a plea of not
guilty,'' O'Connor said. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Sallard did not return calls to his home. Jamil Thompson did not
return calls to the Thompson home Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Sallard and the Thompsons worked
with Redd from April 1997 through May 1998 to misappropriate more
than $250,000 from accounts maintained to operate low-income
housing developments managed by Omega Realty.
</P>
<P>
   All four defendants were charged with conspiracy. In addition,
Vernon Thompson faces five counts of mail fraud for allegedly
working with Redd to mail more than $3,400 in fraudulent payroll
checks for work that his son and Sallard never performed.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, 44, faces 11 additional mail-fraud counts and five
money-laundering charges for allegedly concealing the theft of
$112,509 through five bank transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Jamil Thompson faces four mail fraud charges, and Sallard faces
one.
</P>
<P>
   The charges allege that after the funds were transferred into
Omega Realty accounts, the four then used the money for their own
benefit. They also created ``false and misleading'' documents at
Omega Realty and the housing developments to conceal the
conspiracy, according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Redd, who recently filed for bankruptcy in Kansas City, claiming
almost $500,000 in debts, faces the harshest potential sentence of
the four, 135 years in prison and $6.75 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Thompson could face 30 years in prison and $1.5 million
in fines. Jamil Thompson could be subject to 25 years in prison and
$1.25 million in fines. The maximum Sallard faces is 10 years in
prison and $500,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations into Vernon Thompson and his businesses began in
1997 after The Kansas City Star reported that he twice lobbied a
state agency on housing issues that ultimately benefited his
construction-supply business.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Thompson listed himself on state disclosure records
as an employee of the Citizen Housing and Information Council, a
nonprofit agency that co-developed Basie Court Apartments and
Martin Luther King Village.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, then-Jackson County Prosecutor Claire McCaskill
announced a state investigation into those and other housing issues
raised by The Star. Federal authorities later joined the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation expanded early last year, when the newspaper
raised questions about bingo operations operated by two nonprofit
corporations that Thompson led. State records revealed that bingo
games operated by the nonprofits did not account for some $64,600
in profits as required by state law.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 56, has represented the 37th House district _ which
covers part of Jackson County _ since his election in 1986. He is
chairman of the House Urban Affairs Committee, which handles much
of the state legislation that deals specifically with Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Since the state and federal investigations began in 1996 and
1997, Thompson has lowered his profile in the House.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the 1998 session, Thompson drew criticism
when he missed 13 of the House's first 20 floor sessions without
explanation, though his attendance improved after that.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is the second member of the Missouri General Assembly
to be indicted in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, former House Speaker Bob Griffin pleaded guilty to one
count of fraud and one count of accepting a bribe from political
consultant Cathryn Simmons. Griffin is serving a four-year prison
sentence in Florida.

EXCERPTS FROM COURT'S DECISION BROADLY EXPANDING STATE
SOVEREIGNTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)   (With SCOTUS-STATES-RIGHTS)  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Wednesday placing sharp new curbs on the ability of
Congress to make federal law binding on the states.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in Alden vs. Maine involving enforcement of the Fair
Labor Standards Act of 1938 was 5-4. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
wrote the majority opinion, in which he was joined by Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, as well as
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist.
</P>
<P>
   Justice David H. Souter wrote the dissent and was joined by
Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul
Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   We look first to evidence of the original understanding of the
Constitution. Petitioners contend that because the ratification
debates and the events surrounding the adoption of the Eleventh
Amendment focused on the States' immunity from suit in Federal
courts, the historical record gives no instruction as to the
founding generation's intent to preserve the states' immunity from
suit in their own courts.
</P>
<P>
   We believe, however, that the founders' silence is best
explained by the simple fact that no one, not even the
Constitution's most ardent opponents, suggested the document might
strip the states of the immunity. In light of the overriding
concern regarding the states' wartime debts, together with the
well-known creativity, foresight, and vivid imagination of the
Constitution's opponents, the silence is most instructive. It
suggests the sovereign's right to assert immunity from suit in its
own courts was a principle so well established that no one
conceived it would be altered by the new Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments raised against the Constitution confirm this
strong inference. In England, the rule was well established that
``no lord could be sued by a vassal in his own court, but each
petty lord was subject to suit in the courts of a higher lord.'' It
was argued that by analogy, the states could be sued without
consent in Federal court. The point of the argument was that
Federal jurisdiction under Article III would circumvent the states'
immunity from suit in their own courts. The argument would have
made little sense if the states were understood to have
relinquished the immunity in all events.
</P>
<P>
   The response the Constitution's advocates gave to the argument
is also telling. Relying on custom and practice and, in particular,
on the states' immunity from suit in their own courts, they
contended that no individual could sue a sovereign without its
consent. It is true the point was directed toward the power of the
Federal judiciary, for that was the only question at issue. The
logic of the argument, however, applies with even greater force in
the context of a suit prosecuted against a sovereign in its own
courts, for in this setting, more than any other, sovereign
immunity was long established and unquestioned. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Although the Constitution grants broad powers to Congress, our
federalism requires that Congress treat the states in a manner
consistent with their status as residuary sovereigns and joint
participants in the governance of the nation. The founding
generation thought it ``neither becoming nor convenient that the
several states of the Union, invested with that large residuum of
sovereignty which had not been delegated to the United States,
should be summoned as defendants to answer the complaints of
private persons.'' The principle of sovereign immunity preserved by
constitutional design ``thus accords the states the respect owed
them as members of the federation.''
</P>
<P>
   Petitioners contend that immunity from suit in Federal court
suffices to preserve the dignity of the states. Private suits
against nonconsenting states, however, present ``the indignity of
subjecting a state to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at
the instance of private parties,'' Not only must a state defend or
default but also it must face the prospect of being thrust, by
Federal fiat and against its will, into the disfavored status of a
debtor, subject to the power of private citizens to levy on its
treasury or perhaps even government buildings or property which the
State administers on the public's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, of course, a Congressional power to authorize
private suits against nonconsenting states in their own courts
would be even more offensive to state sovereignty than a power to
authorize the suits in a Federal forum. Although the immunity of
one sovereign in the courts of another has often depended in part
on comity or agreement, the immunity of a sovereign in its own
courts has always been understood to be within the sole control of
the sovereign itself. A power to press a state's own courts into
Federal service to coerce the other branches of the state,
furthermore, is the power first to turn the state against itself
and ultimately to commandeer the entire political machinery of the
state against its will and at the behest of individuals. Such
plenary Federal control of state governmental processes denigrates
the separate sovereignty of the states.
</P>
<P>
   It is unquestioned that the Federal Government retains its own
immunity from suit not only in state tribunals but also in its own
courts. In light of our constitutional system recognizing the
essential sovereignty of the states, we are reluctant to conclude
that the states are not entitled to a reciprocal privilege.

QUINTILES CONFIRMS NEW JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Quintiles Transnational Corp. confirmed
Wednesday that it would add 530 workers within three years at its
Kansas City product development office.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion was announced at a news conference Wednesday. The
jobs will double the size of the biomedical research company's work
force in Kansas City and strengthen the city's role as a center for
biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Gillings, chairman and chief executive of Quintiles, said
the package of development incentives offered to the company
clinched the decision to expand in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That created an opportunity to make a firm decision to focus
the growth of our clinical development in Kansas City,'' Gillings
said at a news conference attended by Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan
and Kansas City Mayor Kay Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The package of incentives is worth more than $6 million and was
chosen instead of offers in California and North Carolina. Gillings
said the company also considered expanding its operations in
Illinois or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina-based Quintiles entered Kansas City in January
when it paid $93 million for a chunk of Hoechst Marion Roussel's
operations. With that purchase, Quintiles inherited 488 full-time
workers in Hoechst Marion's drug development and approval
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since that acquisition, Quintiles already has added 148 jobs
locally, Gillings said.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles has been growing rapidly companywide and added 3,000
workers last year, Gillings said. As of Feb. 28, 1999, Quintiles
had 15,520 employees, according to a regulatory filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows we have the ability to achieve, or beat, the goals
that have been set up for us,'' Gillings said. ``As we add jobs, we
will add highly trained jobs to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles plans to blend into the biomedical research community
that is blossoming in Kansas City. Gillings noted that Quintiles'
work was a precursor to the research of centers such as the Stowers
Institute for Medical Research. Organizers of the institute, which
is being set up in Kansas City, hope it will be a leading research
center for cancer and other medical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of fountains is becoming a virtual font of biomedical
research,'' Gillings said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said the Quintiles expansion and related moves would
boost Kansas City's image as a center for research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe we are in Kansas City developing the potential
for a biosciences industry that could be unmatched around this
country,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles will raise its Kansas City profile even more by
investing $50 million to $65 million in its buildings and equipment
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investment will be greatly enhanced by the incentives
offered by the state and city,'' Gillings said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Missouri Development Finance Board approved
issuing $4 million worth of bonds to help Quintiles pay for its
expansion plan in Kansas City. Wednesday's announcement was a
formal acceptance of those terms.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for those funds, Quintiles promised to create 532
jobs in Kansas City. According to its state application for bond
funds, Quintiles said those jobs would pay an average of $30.21 an
hour, or $62,800 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Among its goals, Quintiles said it would hire 173 scientists who
would earn an average starting salary of $75,800. The lowest
average starting wage would be for 166 technicians earning $34,000
a year.
</P>
<P>
   State and local officials unveiled other incentives at the news
conference. The company qualifies for a state job-training program
that will provide about $350,000 in benefits and for a Missouri
low-interest loan program that will provide about $330,000 in
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The company will get $1.3 million worth of enterprise zone tax
credits over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Quintiles also inherits tax subsidies from its acquisition of
Hoechst Marion property that is within an existing tax increment
financing district in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The company also is negotiating with the Kansas City Economic
Development Corp. for a bond issuance that would lead to breaks on
personal-property taxes, said interim development corporation
President Gary Sage.

 WASHINGTON: reciprocal privilege.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underlying constitutional form are considerations of great
substance. Private suits against nonconsenting states especially
suits for money damages may threaten the financial integrity of the
states. It is indisputable that, at the time of the founding, many
of the states could have been forced into insolvency but for their
immunity from private suits for money damages. Even today, an
unlimited Congressional power to authorize suits in state court to
levy upon the treasuries of the states for compensatory damages,
attorneys' fees, and even punitive damages could create staggering
burdens, giving Congress a power and a leverage over the states
that is not contemplated by our constitutional design. The
potential national power would pose a severe and notorious danger
to the states and their resources.
</P>
<P>
   A Congressional power to strip the states of their immunity from
private suits in their own courts would pose more subtle risks as
well. ``The principle of immunity from litigation assures the
states and the nation from unanticipated intervention in the
processes of government.'' When the states' immunity from private
suits is disregarded, ``the course of their public policy and the
administration of their public affairs'' may become ``subject to
and controlled by the mandates of judicial tribunals without their
consent and in favor of individual interests.'' While the states
have relinquished their immunity from suit in some special contexts
at least as a practical matter, this surrender carries with it
substantial costs to the autonomy, the decision-making ability, and
the sovereign capacity of the states. . . .
</P>
<P>
   When the Federal Government asserts authority over a state's
most fundamental political processes, it strikes at the heart of
the political accountability so essential to our liberty and
republican form of government.
</P>
<P>
   The asserted authority would blur not only the distinct
responsibilities of the state and national governments but also the
separate duties of the judicial and political branches of the state
governments, displacing ``state decisions that `go to the heart of
representative government.' '' A state is entitled to order the
processes of its own governance, assigning to the political
branches, rather than the courts, the responsibility for directing
the payment of debts. If Congress could displace a state's
allocation of governmental power and responsibility, the judicial
branch of the state, whose legitimacy derives from fidelity to the
law, would be compelled to assume a role not only foreign to its
experience but beyond its competence as defined by the very
constitution from which its existence derives.
</P>
<P>
   Congress cannot abrogate the states' sovereign immunity in
Federal court; were the rule to be different here, the National
Government would wield greater power in the state courts than in
its own judicial instrumentalities.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting anomaly cannot be explained by reference to the
special role of the state courts in the constitutional design.
Although Congress may not require the legislative or executive
branches of the states to enact or administer Federal regulatory
programs, it may require state courts of ``adequate and
appropriate'' jurisdiction, ``to enforce Federal prescriptions,
insofar as those prescriptions relat(e) to matters appropriate for
the judicial power.'' It would be an unprecedented step, however,
to infer from the fact that Congress may declare federal law
binding and enforceable in state courts the further principle that
Congress's authority to pursue Federal objectives through the state
judiciaries exceeds not only its power to press other branches of
the state into its service but even its control over the Federal
courts themselves. The conclusion would imply that Congress may in
some cases act only through instrumentalities of the states. Yet,
as Chief Justice Marshall explained: ``No trace is to be found in
the Constitution of an intention to create a dependence of the
government of the union on those of the states, for the execution
of the great powers assigned to it. Its means are adequate to its
ends; and on those means alone was it expected to rely for the
accomplishment of its ends.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   This case at one level concerns the formal structure of
federalism, but in a Constitution as resilient as ours form mirrors
substance. Congress has vast power but not all power. When Congress
legislates in matters affecting the states, it may not treat these
sovereign entities as mere prefectures or corporations. Congress
must accord states the esteem due to them as joint participants in
a federal system, one beginning with the premise of sovereignty in
both the central Government and the separate states. Congress has
ample means to ensure compliance with valid Federal laws, but it
must respect the sovereignty of the states.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent attempt to disparage a conclusion with which it
disagrees, the dissent attributes our reasoning to natural law. We
seek to discover, however, only what the framers and those who
ratified the Constitution sought to accomplish when they created a
Federal system. We appeal to no higher authority than the charter
which they wrote and adopted. Theirs was the unique insight that
freedom is enhanced by the creation of two governments, not one. We
need not attach a label to our dissenting colleagues' insistence
that the constitutional structure adopted by the founders must
yield to the politics of the moment. Although the Constitution
begins with the principle that sovereignty rests with the people,
it does not follow that the National Government becomes the
ultimate, preferred mechanism for expressing the people's will. The
states exist as a refutation of that concept. In choosing to ordain
and establish the Constitution, the people insisted upon a Federal
structure for the very purpose of rejecting the idea that the will
of the people in all instances is expressed by the central power,
the one most remote from their control. The framers of the
Constitution did not share our dissenting colleagues' belief that
the Congress may circumvent the Federal design by regulating the
states directly when it pleases to do so, including by a proxy in
which individual citizens are authorized to levy upon the state
treasuries absent the states' consent to jurisdiction.

 WASHINGTON: to jurisdiction.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case before us depends upon these principles. The State of
Maine has not questioned Congress' power to prescribe substantive
rules of Federal law to which it must comply. Despite an initial
good-faith disagreement about the requirements of the F.L.S.A., it
is conceded by all that the state has altered its conduct so that
its compliance with Federal law cannot now be questioned. The
Solicitor General of the United States has appeared before this
Court, however, and asserted that the Federal interest in
compensating the states' employees for alleged past violations of
Federal law is so compelling that the sovereign State of Maine must
be stripped of its immunity and subjected to suit in its own courts
by its own employees. Yet, despite specific statutory
authorization, the United States apparently found the same
interests insufficient to justify sending even a single attorney to
Maine to prosecute this litigation. The difference between a suit
by the United States on behalf of the employees and a suit by the
employees implicates a rule that the National Government must
itself deem the case of sufficient importance to take action
against the state; and history, precedent, and the structure of the
Constitution make clear that, under the plan of the convention, the
states have consented to suits of the first kind but not of the
second. The judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine is
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Souter
</P>
<P>
   The Court's principal rationale for today's result, then, turns
on history: was the natural law conception of sovereign immunity as
inherent in any notion of an independent state widely held in the
United States in the period preceding the ratification of 1788 (or
the adoption of the Tenth Amendment in 1791)?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is certainly no. There is almost no evidence that the
generation of the Framers thought sovereign immunity was
fundamental in the sense of being unalterable. Whether one looks at
the period before the framing, to the ratification controversies,
or to the early republican era, the evidence is the same. Some
framers thought sovereign immunity was an obsolete royal
prerogative inapplicable in a republic; some thought sovereign
immunity was a common-law power defeasible, like other common-law
rights, by statute; and perhaps a few thought, in keeping with a
natural law view distinct from the common-law conception, that
immunity was inherent in a sovereign because the body that made a
law could not logically be bound by it. Natural law thinking on the
part of a doubtful few will not, however, support the Court's
position. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If the natural law conception of sovereign immunity as an
inherent characteristic of sovereignty enjoyed by the states had
been broadly accepted at the time of the founding, one would expect
to find it reflected somewhere in the five opinions delivered by
the Court in Chisholm v. Georgia. Yet that view did not appear in
any of them. And since a bare two years before Chisholm, the Bill
of Rights had been added to the original Constitution, if the Tenth
Amendment had been understood to give Federal constitutional status
to state sovereign immunity so as to endue it with the equivalent
of the natural law conception, one would be certain to find such a
development mentioned somewhere in the Chisholm writings. In fact,
however, not one of the opinions espoused the natural law view, and
not one of them so much as mentioned the Tenth Amendment. Not even
Justice Iredell, who alone among the Justices thought that a state
could not be sued in Federal court, echoed Hamilton or hinted at a
constitutionally immutable immunity doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Chisholm presented the questions whether a state might be made a
defendant in a suit brought by a citizen of another state, and if
so, whether an action of assumps it would lie against it. In
representing Chisholm, Edmund Randolph, the framer and then
Attorney General, not only argued for the necessity of a Federal
forum to vindicate private rights against the states, but rejected
any traditional conception of sovereignty. He said that the
sovereignty of the states, which he acknowledged, was no barrier to
jurisdiction, because ``the present Constitution produced a new
order of things. It derives its origin immediately from the people.
The states are in fact assemblages of these individuals who are
liable to process,''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Wilson took up the argument for the sovereignty of the
people more vociferously. Building on a conception of sovereignty
he had already expressed at the Pennsylvania ratifying convention,
he began by noting what he took to be the pregnant silence of the
Constitution regarding sovereignty:
</P>
<P>
   ``To the Constitution of the United States the term SOVEREIGN,
is totally unknown. There is but one place where it could have been
used with propriety. But, even in that place it would not, perhaps,
have comported with the delicacy of those, who ordained and
established the Constitution. They might have announced themselves
'SOVEREIGN' people of the United States: But serenely conscious of
the fact, they avoided the ostentatious declaration.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The Court's rationale for today's holding based on a conception
of sovereign immunity as somehow fundamental to sovereignty or
inherent in statehood fails for the lack of any substantial support
for such a conception in the thinking of the founding era. The
Court cannot be counted out yet, however, for it has a second line
of argument looking not to a clause-based reception of the natural
law conception or even to its recognition as a ``background
principle,'' but to a structural basis in the Constitution's
creation of a Federal system. Immunity, the Court says, ``inheres
in the system of federalism established by the Constitution,'' its
``contours [being) determined by the founders' understanding, not
by the principles or limitations derived from natural law.'' Again,
``(w)e look both to the essential principles of federalism and to
the special role of the state courts in the constitutional
design.'' That is, the Court believes that the Federal
constitutional structure itself necessitates recognition of some
degree of state autonomy broad enough to include sovereign immunity
from suit in a state's own courts, regardless of the Federal source
of the claim asserted against the State.. . .
</P>
<P>
   Least of all is it to the point for the Court to suggest that
because the framers would be surprised to find states subjected to
a Federal-law suit in their own courts under the commerce power,
the suit must be prohibited by the Constitution. The framers'
intentions and expectations count so far as they point to the
meaning of the Constitution's text or the fair implications of its
structure, but they do not hover over the instrument to veto any
application of its principles to a world that the framers could not
have anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   If the framers would be surprised to see states subjected to
suit in their own courts under the commerce power, they would be
astonished by the reach of Congress under the Commerce Clause
generally. The proliferation of government, state and Federal,
would amaze the framers, and the administrative state with its
reams of regulations would leave them rubbing their eyes. But the
framers' surprise at, say, the F.L.S.A., or the Federal
Communications Commission, or the Federal Reserve Board is no
threat to the constitutionality of any one of them, for a very
fundamental reason:
</P>
<P>
   ``(W)hen we are dealing with words that also are a constituent
act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize
that they have called into life a being the development of which
could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its
begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they
had created an organism; it has taken a century and has cost their
successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a
nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of our
whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred
years ago.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   There is much irony in the Court's profession that it grounds
its opinion on a deeply rooted historical tradition of sovereign
immunity, when the Court abandons a principle nearly as inveterate,
and much closer to the hearts of the Framers: that where there is a
right, there must be a remedy. Lord Chief Justice Holt could state
this as an unquestioned proposition already in 1702, as he did in:
``If an act of Parliament be made for the benefit of any person,
and he is hindered by another of that benefit, by necessary
consequence of law he shall have an action; and the current of all
the books is so.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackstone considered it ``a general and indisputable rule, that
where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy, by suit
or action at law, whenever that right is invaded.'' The generation
of the framers thought the principle so crucial that several States
put it into their constitutions.
</P>
<P>
   And when Chief Justice Marshall asked about Marbury, ``If he has
a right, and that right has been violated, do the laws of his
country afford him a remedy?,'' the question was rhetorical, and
the answer clear: ``The very essence of civil liberty certainly
consists in the right of every individual to claim the protection
of the laws, whenever he receives an injury. One of the first
duties of government is to afford that protection. In Great Britain
the king himself is sued in the respectful form of a petition, and
he never fails to comply with the judgment of his court.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet today the Court has no qualms about saying frankly that the
federal right to damages afforded by Congress under the F.L.S.A.
cannot create a concomitant private remedy. The right was ``made
for the benefit of'' petitioners; they have been ``hindered by
another of that benefit;'' but despite what has long been
understood as the ``necessary consequence of law,'' they have no
action.
</P>
<P>
   It will not do for the Court to respond that a remedy was never
available where the right in question was against the sovereign. A
state is not the sovereign when a Federal claim is pressed against
it, and even the English sovereign opened itself to recovery and,
unlike Maine, provided the remedy to complement the right. To the
Americans of the founding generation it would have been clear (as
it was to Chief Justice Marshall) that if the king would do right,
the democratically chosen Government of the United States could do
no less.

   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia _ Investors in the Russian Far East are used
to working with risks: the currency is fragile, deposits disappear
when banks close, and companies can be taxed out of existence
before they show a profit.
</P>
<P>
   But a new threat this week has rattled foreign business groups
here: a regional governor announced Monday that he was using the
main successor agency to the KGB to investigate whether a prominent
British businessman had illegally obtained shares for foreign
clients in Russia's biggest shipping company.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was followed by a demonstration Wednesday,
attended by ranking government officials, against foreign investors
in Russian shipping fleets.
</P>
<P>
   The Primorsky regional governor, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, said at a
news conference Monday that he had asked the Federal Security
Service, known as the FSB, to look into the business dealings of
British investor Andrew Fox, who serves on the board of Far Eastern
Shipping Co.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after Fox, who owns a brokerage firm,
Tiger Securities, said Nazdratenko had threatened to jail him in an
attempt to extort 7 percent of the shares of foreign investors
represented by Fox. The governor was also said to have demanded
that a candidate of his choosing be appointed general director and
that a new board be elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko denied making the threat and maintained that Fox
misunderstood him in a meeting June 3 in which they discussed the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman's accusation spurred Vladivostok's
government-dominated media into a weeklong series of Soviet-style
denunciations of Fox. On Tuesday, the tabloid Novosti accused Fox,
who is also the honorary British consul in Vladivostok, of wanting
to sell Far Eastern Shipping's fleet, so that ``we will have to
close all the maritime academies of Russia and delete Russia from
the list of seafaring countries.'' Even such national papers as
Izvestia published articles attacking Fox in their Far Eastern
editions.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the drumbeat of accusations from the governor's
office and in the media boiled over into a demonstration. Fox's
competitors at a refrigerated shipping line named Vostoktransflot,
who had also been assailing him all week, hired buses to bring
maritime academy students, sailors, captains and others to downtown
Vladivostok for a demonstration, company officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 people showed up to denounce Russian
businessmen close to Fox as ``agents of imperialism.'' The city's
mayor, Yuri Kopylov, denounced a Russian journalist whom he
glimpsed interviewing a business partner of Fox's. ``She won't be a
reporter for long,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the region is courting South Korean and Japanese
investors to rebuild two major ports, Nazdratenko blamed foreigners
for ruining the Russian Far East's limping economy. He called for
the nationalization of strategic industries, including shipping. In
a rambling statement that included attacks on NATO, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and the Chinese, Nazdratenko said Fox
``only fulfills the will of other states that want Russia not to
have anything,'' and added, ``He has his masters that he works
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox left the country last week amid the accusations and fears of
imprisonment. Reached by phone in London, he laughed when told of
Nazdratenko's latest accusations. ``I don't even think he knows
what he's talking about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the attacks against him have sent a chill through foreign
business executives in the Russian Far East, many of whom had
gathered in a Vladivostok hotel late last week for a U.S.-Russian
conference largely devoted to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners asked about the Fox affair were almost all upset. A
longtime Western businessman in Vladivostok who did not want to be
identified by name said the attack was all the more unnerving
because of Fox's stature as one of the early investors in the
Russian Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, who has lived in Vladivostok since 1992, estimates that
Tiger Securities has brought in $30 million to $40 million in
investment to companies in Primorsky, the southeastern finger of
Russia flanked by China and the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about the attacks, because Andrew was one
of the most successful foreigners in town,'' the businessman said.
``He was kind of a legend, really. People always talk about Andrew
Fox _ he's got his hands in everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consulate in Vladivostok sent a letter asking
Nazdratenko to disown the comments attributed to him and to leave
Fox alone.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kalicki, a Commerce Department official who was visiting
Vladivostok as a part of a working group from the U.S. West Coast
and the Russian Far East, said, ``We told him that first of all we
hope they will make sure that they will take no action of the sort
suggested in the report, and that secondly that they will issue a
statement making clear that this is not the attitude of the
administration here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nazdratenko has wielded increasingly unchallenged power in the
Primorsky region. Courts sympathetic to the governor have
invalidated the elections of political rivals this year. His
administration owns the only printing press in Primorsky, and the
governor's allies head the two television stations.

NYC SCHOOLS CHANCELLOR SHAKES UP LOW-PERFORMING SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew on Wednesday announced a
shake-up of New York City's lowest-performing schools, encompassing
56 of the system's 1,100 schools and nine of its 32 district
superintendents. He said that to continue to allow schools to fail
would be ``unforgivable.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, which was unanimously approved Wednesday at a
meeting of the Board of Education, Crew will close 13
low-performing schools and take direct control of 43 others,
including three high schools and 40 elementary and middle schools.
In those 40, he will offer a 15 percent raise to every teacher who
agrees to work longer hours and commits to staying three years.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal negotiated with the United Federation of Teachers and
endorsed by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Monday, those schools will
add 40 minutes of instruction a day, along with five days for
teacher training at the start of the school year. Class sizes will
be reduced, strict curriculums will be adopted and all children
will be required to go to summer school. Most of the $40 million
cost will come from state aid, Board of Education officials said,
adding that money would not be cut from other school programs to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the city's 32 superintendents are being removed, Crew
said: Two are being dismissed, one will be transferred to another
job in the schools and two are retiring. Four more have been put on
notice that he is concerned about their performance, and that they
will undergo a yearlong probation, in which they will be supervised
by Crew and his deputies.
</P>
<P>
   He will close 13 schools that have failed to meet state
standards and that could have been closed by the state at the end
of June. Three of those schools will be closed by next week and
their students transferred to other schools, while the rest will be
phased out over two years. The 13 schools will be replaced with new
schools, and many of their principals and teachers will be removed
or transferred to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the strongest single action that Crew has taken since he
became chancellor in October 1995, and since a state law was passed
in December 1996 giving him increased central control over what had
been a decentralized school system for nearly 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he could no longer tolerate large pockets of failure
across the city, and reacting in part to dismal scores in reading
and math released over the last two weeks, Crew said, ``The system
simply cannot be a tale of two cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew said the overhaul was the culmination of more than four
months of planning and the experience he has gained since taking
over the New York City school system, with its 1.1 million
students, in October 1995. He said he waited until now to act so
decisively in part because he lacked the power until the new state
law came into being, but also because he wanted first to impose
higher standards and then to give people fair notice that they
would be held accountable for meeting them.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has done all the things he announced Wednesday before, but
never on such a grand scale. Over the last three years, he has
removed or pressured into retirement eight superintendents,
according to aides. He has also closed 24 schools, up to seven in a
single a year, though the plans for some of those closings predated
him. Shortly after he took office, he created what he called the
chancellor's district, putting 13 failing schools under his direct
supervision in an effort to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Board of Education president William Thompson Jr., a close ally
of Crew, praised the chancellor for ``a gutsy move to take over
this many schools at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew announced his overhaul just two weeks after both state and
citywide tests showed a decline in achievement. Two-thirds of the
city's fourth-graders failed a new state reading and writing test,
and one out of five scored in the bottom level, meaning that they
can barely read or write. Math scores on a citywide test dropped 10
points, and scores even declined in third-grade reading, a
centerpiece of Crew's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The city has more schools on a state list of failing schools _
97 _ than ever before in its history, and state Education
Commissioner Richard Mills has threatened to close them down if
they do not improve.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has also been engaged in a very public feud with Giuliani,
who has labeled the school system dysfunctional and advocated the
abolition of the central Board of Education and its replacement
with a mayoral agency.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest test of Crew's plan will be his ability to turn
around the 43 schools that he has taken under his direct control.
He gave himself a deadline of two years to do that, although he
could well be gone by then. His current contract expires in a year,
with a two-year option to renew.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking change in those schools, which are scattered
throughout the city, is the package of financial incentives he is
offering to the teachers and paraprofessionals who work in them.
The package was negotiated with the United Federation of Teachers
and signed off on by Giuliani on Monday, aides to Crew said,
although City Hall is not paying for it.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes raises of 15 percent _ $6,000 for a
midlevel teacher _ for teachers who agree to work 40 minutes more
each day and to go through a week of training in the summer. The
teachers' union has long resisted calls for merit pay, and this
agreement skirts that issue by providing the payments to all
teachers in a school, regardless of experience, test scores or
other criteria based on performance.

VOICESTREAM AND OMNIPOINT ANNOUNCE $3 BILLION MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Voicestream Wireless Corp. and Omnipoint Corp., two regional
wireless communications companies seeking to expand their national
presence, said Wednesday that they would merge in a cash and stock
transaction valued at nearly $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will provide the new company with coverage of a far
broader swath of the country than either company has alone, with
licenses in 17 of the top 25 major wireless markets. The combined
company would provide service to more than a million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Following the merger, Voicestream will be the country's largest
provider of wireless service using the technology known as GSM, for
Global System for Mobile Communications. GSM, the dominant format
for wireless service in Europe, has been adopted in this country
mostly by smaller companies.
</P>
<P>
   As nationwide wireless carriers like AT&AMP;T, Sprint and Nextel
have beefed up their networks and expanded their marketing, smaller
regional carriers like Omnipoint and Voicestream have found it
harder to compete. By expanding its so-called footprint, or the
portion of the map covered by its communications services, the
newly merged company hopes to attract more customers and save on
marketing and back-office costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the transaction, which is expected to close in the fourth
quarter, Omnipoint shareholders will receive cash and stock valued
at about $32 a share, a 55 percent premium to the company's recent
stock price. Omnipoint has about 53 million shares outstanding,
making the purchase part of the transaction worth about $1.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hutchison Telecommunications Ltd. of Hong Kong, a
major shareholder in Voicestream, has agreed to invest $957 million
in the newly merged company.
</P>
<P>
   Voicestream has also agreed to invest $150 million in Omnipoint
prior to the close of the merger, including approximately $100
million to be provided immediately. Including assumed debt, the
entire transaction can be valued at $4.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a further component of the deal, Cook Inlet Region Inc., a
native Alaskan corporation, is to invest in a joint venture to
acquire certain licenses held by Omnipoint. Cook Inlet Region will
own 50.1 percent of the venture, and Voicestream will own the
remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Together with Cook Inlet Region, the newly merged company will
have licenses to provide service to more than 175 million people in
the United States, said John Stanton, who will remain chairman and
chief executive of Voicestream following the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Smith, currently chairman of Omnipoint, will become a vice
chairman of the combined company and will focus on developing the
new company's wireless data strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Omnipoint shareholders will receive $8 a share in cash and 0.825
share of Voicestream common stock for each of their Omnipoint
shares. Omnipoint shares rose 6.25 cents, to $20.8125 Wednesday,
while Voicestream shares rose 12.5 cents, to $29.50.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutchison investment will raise its ownership to 30 percent
of the combined company, assuming the exercise of certain
conversion rights in convertible preferred securities that it owns.
Prior to the merger, Hutchison owned 24 percent of Voicestream.
</P>
<P>
   Voicestream, which was spun off by Western Wireless only a month
ago, was advised in the transaction by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. Allen &AMP;

A WHO'S WHO OF TOP PLAYERS CONTEND FOR RYDER CUP POINTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Imagine a U.S. Ryder Cup team this fall without
Fred Couples, Justin Leonard, Tom Lehman and Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   It could happen. Only the top 10 players in the Ryder Cup points
standing through Aug. 17 will automatically qualify for the team.
And as of Wednesday, neither Couples (No. 13), Leonard (No. 15),
Lehman (No. 19), nor Janzen (No. 21) were in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the race for Ryder Cup points will be one of golf's
summer subplots, including this week, when many of the PGA Tour's
top players compete in the Buick Classic at Westchester Country
Club. Couples, Leonard, Lehman, and Janzen will be playing at
Westchester, along with three of the top seven players in the world
ranking: David Duval (No. 1), Vijay Singh (No. 4), and Ernie Els
(No. 7).
</P>
<P>
   This year's U.S. Ryder Cup captain, Ben Crenshaw, is also
playing Westchester, and he will add two captain's picks to the 10
players who automatically make the team. As Crenshaw stood in front
of his locker Wednesday, he paused to look at the latest Ryder Cup
points standings. If Ryder Cup veterans like Couples, Leonard,
Lehman and Janzen don't make the team on their own, Crenshaw's two
picks could become even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be an interesting next few months,'' said
Crenshaw, who will captain the team that faces Europe, Sept. 24-26,
at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass. ``I think when it's time to
decide, one of the picks will become fairly obvious. But that last
pick will keep me up at night. In fact, it already is.''
</P>
<P>
   While Crenshaw pondered what would happen this fall, others were
concentrating on what would happen this weekend. The Buick Classic
is the first PGA Tour event since Sunday's thrilling conclusion to
the United States Open, won by Payne Stewart, who made a 15-foot
putt on the final hole to defeat Phil Mickelson by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Although some top players like Tiger Woods and Davis Love 3d
took this week off, many players were looking forward to competing
again. Duval, who is still looking for his first major
championship, was deeply disappointed after finishing tied for
seventh at the U.S. Open, but he insisted that he had regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more ready than I thought I would be,'' said Duval,
who enjoyed taking batting practice with the Mets on Tuesday. ``I
expect myself to be prepared and ready to play well when I tee it
up. Those are my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning 11 tournaments since October 1997, Duval secured a spot
on the Ryder Cup team months ago. But while he was looking forward
to his first Ryder Cup, Duval had a different take on the biennial
competition than some players.
</P>
<P>
   Told that Stewart said he would shake teammates by the throat
who weren't excited about the Ryder Cup, Duval smiled and said,
``He better not put his hands around my throat.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Duval expanded on his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm looking forward to it,'' he said. ``But you talk with
the players, and it's a tough week. There's a lot of pressure. I'm
not saying I'm not going to be ready to play. I'm like any
competitor. But I don't see it as the end-all, be-all thing in golf
that a lot of other people seem to view it as.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, those players who are not in the top-10 Ryder Cup standing
hope that their push to make the team leads to better play. Duval,
Woods, Stewart, Love, and Mark O'Meara are No. 1 through No. 5,
respectively, in Ryder Cup points, and appear to have made the
team. Hal Sutton (No. 6), Jim Furyk (No. 7), Mickelson (No. 8),
Jeff Maggert (No. 9), and Steve Stricker (No. 10) complete the top
10 at the moment, but John Huston (No. 11), Steve Pate (No. 12),
Couples, Jeff Sluman (No. 14), and Leonard remain in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't play better, I won't be on the team,'' said
Couples. ``To be part of it would be awesome, but if not, there are
better players around now than me. But the whole thing is winning
it. I've been on five Ryder Cup teams and I've won twice. It's an
honor to play, but we've lost the last two, and when you don't win,
it's kind of tough to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, who played in his first Ryder Cup in 1997, wants to
help the United States change its Ryder Cup fortunes. But to do
that, Leonard will have to play well this summer. And he hoped this
week would be the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has everything to do with how I plan my schedule, this time
of year,'' said Leonard. ``It's a goal I want to achieve, and if I
don't, I'll be disappointed.''  &QL;

BRAZIL'S PRESIDENT OUSTS BANK BOARD THAT OPPOSED TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ In an effort to reassert control over unruly
factions in the government bureaucracy, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso has dismissed the board of one of the largest
government-controlled banks after it opposed an important tax.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso on Tuesday evening ousted the 10 highest-ranking
executives of Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo SA, known as Banespa,
including the president, Joao Alberto Magro. The bank had sought a
court order aimed at freeing itself from paying a 0.38 percent tax
on financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The tax, which this year is expected to raise at least 7 billion
reais _ now $3.9 billion _ is considered essential in containing
the nation's budget deficit, a lingering worry among investors
concerned with the long-term health of the Brazilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people questioning this tax in the courts,''
said Walter Molano, head of Latin American research at BCP
Securities in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The latest source of dissent, from a bank ranked as Brazil's
sixth-largest and controlled by national authorities, came at a
time when the president's ability to limit crises within the
government has been called into question.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an extreme example of how Cardoso can't control his
executive branch,'' said David Fleischer, a political science
professor at the University of Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Cardoso has had to deal with the resignation of
the appointee to head the federal police after the candidate was
accused of torture during military rule in the 1970s. That episode
followed a dispute between high-ranking aides on economic
development policy and a scandal over the freewheeling use of
military jets by Cabinet ministers for personal trips.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president's popularity rating has slipped to its
lowest level since he took office in 1995, his swift move against
Banespa is seen by some as a turning point. Earlier this week, the
president promised ``zero tolerance'' of dissent within the
government in an effort to strengthen his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Banespa has been a burden, with a history of bad loans. It is
scheduled to be privatized in October.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's largest privately owned banks, along with several
foreign institutions, are preparing bids for Banespa. ``Barring
strong opposition from unions, there is every indication Banespa
will be sold this year,'' said Erivelto Rodrigues, head of Austin
Asis, a banking-analysis firm.

DEFENSE ANALYST WAS ACTUAL AUTHOR OF KOSOVO ESSAY ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The mystery over the fake Shalikashvili essay has been
solved _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   A 2,000-word essay harshly critical of the Clinton
administration's handling of the Kosovo crisis _ erroneously
attributed to former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John
Shalikashvili _ has circulated widely over the Internet for the
past month, prompting the retired Army general to publicly deny its
authorship two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   George Friedman, a defense analyst and author from Austin,
Texas, has stepped forward to claim ownership of the article, which
accuses the Clinton administration of entering the Kosovo conflict
with insufficient military force. It also predicts that NATO
partners are moving toward a new collective security policy to
minimize U.S. leadership in the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, who runs a global defense analysis firm in Austin with
his wife, Meredith Friedman, said he wrote the essay, ``The World
After Kosovo,'' as an article posted on his Internet Web site _
www.stratfor.com _ on May 3. Several weeks later, they began
hearing that the article was being recirculated under
Shalikashvili's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was our own analysis'' of the impact of Kosovo, said
Friedman, who with his wife wrote ``The Coming War with Japan''
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like the retired general, Friedman said he was angered and
frustrated over the misidentification, but decided to ``let the
thing die quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few modalities (on the Internet) to solve this
kind of problem,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said neither he nor his computer-savvy colleagues have
been able to determine how _ or why _ his name was removed and
Shalikashvili's name was added to the essay. William Arkin, who
writes a column on Internet and defense issues for The Washington
Post, noted last week the essay was circulated as an attachment on
e-mail and had not been posted on the World Wide Web.

OLYMPIANS GATHER AT CAPITOL, REMEMBERING GAMES' IDEALS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They gathered on the steps of the Capitol, more
than 100 American Olympians _ from Fred Pollard, who has spent a
lifetime describing how it felt to be a black man confronting Adolf
Hitler at Berlin's 1936 Games, to Beth Botsford, a 16-year-old
double gold medal winner in 1996 who was late for Wednesday's
Olympic Day festivities because she would not miss her morning swim
practice.
</P>
<P>
   They came to uphold and salute the Olympic movement, living
monuments to its ideals, arriving in the nation's capital at a
time, not coincidentally, when the Olympic spirit could use a
boost. Several disquieting months of investigation into the abuses
of the bidding process for host Olympic cities was a ubiquitous
smirch to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   But under a brilliant sun, the jewels of American international
athletic competition from seven decades congregated, 47 gold medal
winners in all, their stories a reminder, in most cases, of a time
when Olympic athletes sold shoes and taught high school between
their workouts.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was much like a family reunion, with hugs on arrival
followed by the exchanging of pictures _ of children,
grandchildren, great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davenport, a gold medal hurdler who cherished the Olympic
experience he first encountered in 1964 so much he chased it into
the Winter Olympics as a bobsledder in 1980, chatted with the 1948
gold medal sprinter Harrison Dillard _ one generation's preeminent
hurdler swapping stories with another. Jim Ryun and Billy Mills,
American distance running royalty, posed for pictures. The gymnast
Bart Conner, when he wasn't critiquing the cartwheel technique of
attending children, drifted in and out of several conversations
with his fellow Olympians, at home it seemed whether the sport
being discussed was track or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying amongst ourselves,'' Conner said. ``There are
no former Olympians. We all have respect for each other's
accomplishments, secure in knowing our success wasn't an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can luck your way into money or fame. You can win the
lottery tomorrow. You can't luck your way into the Olympics. Being
an Olympian has a tag of credibility. It's something we'd like to
preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the subtext to the day, which was officially a
celebration of a worldwide Olympic Day. While the athletes may have
been a sideshow to the corruption of the International Olympic
Committee's site selection process, it was these Olympians who felt
a responsibility to offer perspective and solutions to restoring an
ideal they heartily embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I took away from the Olympics wasn't a gold medal,'' said
Mills, whose victory in the 1964 10,000 meters was one of the most
stunning in American Olympic track and field history. ``I took away
an understanding of the dignity and character of global diversity.
That's the power of the Games, and it's the only platform of its
kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our downfall was a profit-at-all-costs mentality. We have to
monitor that. Establish accountability with responsibility,
achievement with consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyomia Tyus was the two-time defending Olympic champion at 100
meters when she retired after the 1968 Games at 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have been just getting started,'' Tyus said Wednesday.
``But I had to find a 9-to-5. That's the way it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   Now working for the Los Angeles school district, she has watched
the U.S. Olympic team blossom with the benefit of huge corporate
sponsorships, and she has watched as the Olympic Games have grown
into something bigger and different than they were for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the spirit of the Games and the will of the athletes is
the same,'' she said. ``We were all brought up with morals. At
times like these, we just have to remember them.''
</P>
<P>
   The swimming champion Donna de Verona, like other Olympians
Wednesday, worried that the negative publicity about the
International Olympic Committee dealings would have too lasting an
impact on potential American corporate sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some departures already,'' she said. ``Sponsors
don't like to be associated with anything negative. When people
looked behind the curtain and saw the indulgences, it was a
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like today puts the focus back on the athletes. And,
by the way, the system was antiquated and needs to be changed. What
happened is a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end Wednesday, the festivities were part picnic, part
commemoration, a reunion in the classic sense because everyone
vowed to do it again next year. Eras were joined and generations
were bridged.
</P>
<P>
   Botsford, meanwhile, left the picnic a bit early. The Sydney
Olympics are 14 months away. She had an evening swim practice she
could not miss. &QL;

ADVANCED MICRO TO REPORT LARGER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advanced Micro Devices Inc. said Wednesday that
it would report a larger-than-expected second-quarter loss because
of steep declines in the price of microprocessor chips.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ends Sunday, the company said it would have
an operating loss of about $200 million, including various charges
for reorganization, and revenue of less than $600 million, of which
about $250 million will come from microprocessors. That compares
with $632 million in the first quarter. Based on about 146 million
shares outstanding, the loss would come to about $1.37 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts had been expecting a loss of about 40 cents
a share, according to First Call Corp., which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro made its warning after the close of the market
but had alerted reporters and analysts late Tuesday to an
announcement. Assuming the worst, investors drove shares of
Advanced Micro down by $1.0625, or 5.5 percent, to $18.1875.
</P>
<P>
   After a loss of $128.4 million, or 88 cents a share, in the
first quarter, Advanced Micro's warnings raised doubts that any
company other than Intel Corp. can profit in the microprocessor
business. In May, National Semiconductor Corp. said it was exiting
the business less than two years after buying its way in with the
$550 million acquisition of Cyrix Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the pricing model for personal computer
microprocessors has been permanently altered. With a $500 personal
computer offering most of the performance and features of a $1,500
PC, nearly all of the industry's growth has shifted to the low end.
</P>
<P>
   There is no room for a $500 microprocessor in a $500 PC, so the
bulk of Advanced Micro and Intel's sales volume has shifted to less
expensive chips. With technology no longer a driving factor, price
is the primary consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Advanced Micro, based in Sunnyvale, Calif.,
suffered because of its inability to manufacture projected volumes
of its K6-2 microprocessors, particularly the faster chips that
command higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the company's management said it had surmounted these
production difficulties but that aggressive price cuts by Intel,
coupled with the liquidation of Cyrix inventory by National, had
driven down the average selling price of its chips to $60 this
quarter from $78 in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray market activity and three official price cuts by Intel
dashed our hopes,'' said Advanced Micro chairman and chief
executive W.J. Sanders III in a conference call with analysts. He
said Intel was offering smaller PC manufacturers deals on obsolete
circuit boards as well as development services and marketing
support. ``Intel is actually priced below us, and on these packaged
deals they are substantially below us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel can afford deep discounts on its low-end products, partly
because it has the most efficient manufacturing operations in the
business, and partly because they are offset by premium pricing for
high-end processors used in work stations and servers. Advanced
Micro has lacked a high-end offering, but announced Wednesday that
it was shipping the Athlon processor, formerly known as K7, in
speeds as high as 600 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that he expected average prices of the K6 family of
chips to continue to fall but that this would be offset in part by
substantially higher prices for the Athlon series.

IN A TIME OF LISTS AND DEBATING THOSE LISTS, A NEW BOOK CHOOSES THE
100 BEST TV COMMERCIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's millennial fever. Maybe it's the fact that television
has reached maturity, at least chronologically if not emotionally.
Or maybe it's just the fad for compiling lists.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, there has been a rush to designate the
``best'' commercials and advertisements ever made _ and an ensuing
rush to debate the choices.
</P>
<P>
   The trade publication Advertising Age, for instance, recently
offered a list of the 100 best campaigns as part of a special issue
titled ``The Advertising Century.'' TV Guide, in a special issue
coming out on Monday, will present ``the 50 greatest TV commercials
of all time'' as determined by the votes of a panel that included
this columnist.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry in the Madison Avenue version of beauty pageants
arrives Thursday, as Random House publishes ``The 100 Best TV
Commercials ... And Why They Worked'' (Times Business, $29.95) by
Bernice Kanner, a longtime advertising journalist.
</P>
<P>
   The book, being introduced at the 46th International Advertising
Festival in Cannes, France, is based on work by the Leo Burnett Co.
in Chicago. In 1996, Burnett compiled a list of the top 100 spots
as selected by the agency's senior creative executives and leading
professionals throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The book presents an updated version of the Burnett list,
continuing its classification of commercials by categories like
demonstrations, music, fantasy, blockbusters and humor.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the book is ``to energize our industry that this
caliber of ideas, which can create tremendous success for a brand,
can be sold'' to clients, said Michael Conrad, vice chairman and
chief creative officer at Burnett, who wrote the forward for the
book.
</P>
<P>
   It is also meant, he added, to encourage copywriters and art
directors ``to take risks, to avoid cliches'' because such ``fresh
and new thinking and ideas'' can pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what values predominate among the commercials, Conrad
replied that most ``set a new standard, create a paradigm shift''
in competitive consumer product fields by striving successfully to
``own the major benefit'' in the market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the low-key Volkswagen Beetle commercials by Doyle
Dane Bernbach were focused on ``reliability and economy,'' he
added, while anthemic spots for Marlboro cigarettes by Burnett were
centered on ``flavor, which in tobacco is what you want to own''
and humorous spots for Heineken beer by Lowe Howard-Spink, part of
the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies,
concentrated on ``refreshment, which is to beers what flavor is to
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   Many commercials included in the book are spots that turn up on
most lists of all-time greats. Among them are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ The larger-than-life ``1984'' commercial for the Apple
Macintosh computer, by what is now the TBWA/Chiat/Day unit of TBWA
Worldwide, part of Omnicom Group.
</P>
<P>
   _ The warm and fuzzy paeans to Coca-Cola featuring the football
star Mean Joe Greene and singers atop a hill, by McCann-Erickson
New York, owned by Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two surrealistic spots saluting British Airways by what is now
the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi unit of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   _ The commercial by Ally &AMP; Gargano promoting Federal Express
that introduced a character who became known as the fast-talking
man.
</P>
<P>
   _ The initial spot in the long-running campaign for Energizer
batteries, also by what is now TBWA/Chiat/Day, in which a pink
bunny kept ``going and going and going'' through make-believe spots
for coffee, nasal spray and wine.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hilarious spot by Doyle Dane, now part of the DDB
Worldwide Communications Group unit of Omnicom, about an actor in a
fictitious food commercial whose occupational hazard, heartburn,
requires Alka-Seltzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's chic to say you're immune to advertising, you're smarter
than advertising,'' Ms. Kanner said, ``but it does invade our
pores.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing the book ``made me like advertising more,'' she added,
``because I was right in the heart of the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the frustrations inherent in narrowing choices, Ms.
Kanner said: ``Some countries aren't represented at all. There are
no Canadian commercials or Mexican commercials. There's nothing for
Levi's from the United States, though there are a couple for Levi's
from Europe. And the Wendy's commercial `Where's the beef?' was one
of the best ever but it wasn't on the list, so it's mentioned in
the description of another Wendy's commercial, `Russian fashion
show,' that was.''
</P>
<P>
   To try rectifying the imbalances, Ms. Kanner selects an
additional dozen commercials for praise in the final chapter in the
book. These are among those commercials:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Do you know me?'' campaign for American Express, by
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   _ The commercial that introduced the lying salesman for American
Isuzu Motors, by Della Femina, Travisano &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Mikey'' spot for Life cereal from Quaker Oats, by Doyle
Dane.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book omits or overlooks numerous commercials that
many would consider among the best. Here are some:
</P>
<P>
   _ Spots with dancing cigarettes for Old Gold and Lucky Strike,
from the early days of television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Commercials pairing the animated beer pitchmen Bert and Harry
Piel, for Piel's beer, with voices supplied by the comedians Bob
Elliott and Ray Goulding.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spots for Budweiser and Bud Light beers from the campaigns
starring the frogs and the boastful ``Yes I am'' man.
</P>
<P>
   _ A visit to a re-created ``1949 auto show'' for the VW Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   _ An elaborate production number with the dancer Ann Miller for
Heinz Great American Soups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Any Nike commercials featuring Michael Jordan, particularly
those teaming him with Spike Lee and Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   DDB, its predecessors and subsidiaries landed the most
commercials on the list of 100, with 20, followed by Burnett with
10 and BBDO Worldwide, owned by Omnicom, with 8. Of the 100 spots,
42 were made in America, followed by Britain with 28 and France
with 8.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some errors flaw the text of the book. A British Heinz
beans commercial is listed as from ``19TK,'' as in the proofreading
symbol for information to come. (The date is 1988). And in a
description of a commercial for Mates condoms, the spot is compared
with those of other condom makers, ``who'd pitched their brands
largely to Cassanovas.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder those other spots didn't make the list. How large a
market could there be for products aimed at amorous fans of Peggy
Cass?

AS OTHER CRIMES CONTINUE TO FALL, KILLINGS INCREASE BY 6 PERCENT
OVER 1998 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The number of killings reported so far this year in
New York City has risen 6 percent over the comparable period last
year, driven by an increase in homicides in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
The rise comes as other types of crime continue to drop and six
months after the city recorded its lowest annual number of
homicides since 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, major crime in the city has dropped 10 percent from
this time last year. And the increase in homicides, to 290 from
273, is still well below the 330 recorded at this time in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 13, reported crime had dropped in every borough, in
the subway and in public housing, according to preliminary data
from the Police Department. There were fewer reported rapes,
robberies, burglaries, grand larcenies and car thefts.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, though, slayings have gone up 27 percent from the
comparable period last year, to 56 from 44. In the Washington
Heights section of upper Manhattan alone, the number jumped to 14,
up from 5 by this time last year. In Morningside Heights, near
Columbia University and Harlem, there was only 1 homicide by this
time last year but there have been 4 so far this year, including
the slaying of Jacqueline Frezza, a 34-year-old marketing
consultant, who was killed by a bicycle-riding gunman who shot her
as she left her building. There were only 4 homicides in
Morningside Heights all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, killings are up 19 percent, to 125 so far this year
from 105 in the comparable period last year. In the Bronx, killings
are down 23 percent, to 59 from 77 in the comparable period last
year. In Queens those numbers are up 6 percent, to 47, from 44 in
the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicides come in cycles,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said in an interview Wednesday. ``We were seeing earlier in the
year a significant increase in domestic-related homicides, and we
have done things to try to address that. Homicides are still at the
lowest point in 35 years. There is no guarantee that the numbers
will be lower than last year, but that is still the goal.''

 McHALE, THOMPSON HEADLINE ADMITEES TO HALL OF FAME  
(jt) 
 By JERRY BREWER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Thompson, who was never hesitant to speak out on
issues ranging from race to college basketball eligibility
standards during 27 years as Georgetown coach, joined Kevin McHale
of the Boston Celtics on Wednesday as the headliners of the
Basketball Hall of Fame class of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, normally vehement and brash, spoke softly in a
telephone interview after the results of the election were
announced here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the period that ends all sentences,'' Thompson said of
his election. ``It's always more effective to whisper than to
shout, and now I get to whisper, `I'm in the Hall of Fame.'''
</P>
<P>
   Also elected to the Hall of Fame, which is based in Springfield,
Mass., were Wayne Embry, the former Cincinnati Royals center and
general manager of the Cleveland Cavaliers; the late Fred Zollner,
who helped found the National Basketball Association and owned the
Fort Wayne Pistons, and Billie Moore, the first women's coach to
lead two different schools (UCLA and Cal State-Fullerton) to
national titles.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who has a weekday morning radio show in Washington,
retired last January. He inherited a 3-23 team in 1972 and complied
a 596-239 record, reaching the Final Four three times and defeating
Houston for the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament
championship in 1984. He coached the U.S. Olympic team to a bronze
medal 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson boycotted two games in 1989 in protest of Proposition
42, an NCAA rule that linked financial aid to athletes' academic
performance, arguing that it hurt minority students. The rule was
overturned by a U.S. District Court in March.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who was Bill Russell's backup in the Boston Celtics'
1965 and 1966 championship seasons, was influential in the
development of such current National Basketball Association stars
as Allen Iverson, Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo and Alonzo
Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, whose revolutionary post moves are still mimicked today,
played 12 seasons and won three titles with the Celtics in the
1980s. He was part of one of basketball's greatest frontlines _
McHale, Larry Bird and Robert Parish.
</P>
<P>
   McHale, now vice president for basketball operations for the
Minnesota Timberwolves, averaged 17.9 points, 7.3 rebounds and shot
55 percent in his career. He was a seven-time All-Star and a
three-time member of the NBA's all-defensive team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get honored for something you have so much fun doing,
it just doesn't feel right,'' he said Wednesday. ``I never thought
of it as work.''

SUMMER READING SELECTIONS FOR YOUNG READERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With summer break, kids finally have time to read for
fun. Here's a look at some of the newest and best titles, from
picture books to meatier chapter books for older readers.
</P>
<P>
   We've also added a ``lemon alert'' to high-profile books that
left us puckered and perplexed.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to read? Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Picture books
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lion and the Unicorn,'' by Shirley Hughes (DK Ink,
$17.95). Ages 5-8.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has to be brave in wartime _ even Lenny, a little boy
who endures loneliness, bigotry and cruel teasing when he's
evacuated to a country estate during the London Blitz. He clutches
a lion-and-unicorn medal for courage, but in the end must find his
own inner strength. This book shows unusual depth of feeling, in
sensitive prose and emotionally wrought watercolors _ all enhanced
by thoughtful page design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too Big!'' by Claire Masurel, illustrated by Hanako Wakiyama
(Chronicle, $13.95). Ages 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie wins a giant, blue-and-white-striped dinosaur at the
carnival and wants to take it everywhere. But it's too big! When
Charlie gets sick and has to stay in bed, ``Big Tex'' proves to be
just right. Charmingly told, charmingly illustrated, in a delicate
retro style that's sweetly hip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swine Lake,'' by James Marshall, illustrated by Maurice Sendak
(Harper Collins/Di Capua Books, $15.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   A lean and mangy wolf sneaks into a porcine performance of the
Boarshoi Ballet, hoping to satisfy his taste for, er, art. To his
surprise, he does just that, as the toothsome piggies live to dance
another day. Marshall wrote this lighthearted tale shortly before
his death seven years ago. Sendak, his best bud, turns it into a
memorable pas de deux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eloise in Paris,'' by Kay Thompson, illustrated by Hilary
Knight (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   In this reissued 1957 classic, Eloise, a bon vivant with a flair
for melodrama, describes her exciting trek from New York's Plaza
Hotel to the City of Light. The story is rather wordy and
sophisticated for young children, who might find the original
``Eloise'' more their speed. But it's a fun read-aloud, and
Knight's comic drawings are full of joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morning, Noon and Night,'' by Jean Craighead George,
illustrated by Wendell Minor (HarperCollins, $15.95). Ages 4-7.
</P>
<P>
   A Newbery Medalist with a sure grasp of nature, George achieves
a Margaret Wise Brown feel in this lyrical ode to the rhythms of
the day, from East Coast to West. Poetic in feel, it's a wonderful
bedtime story stunningly illustrated with wildlife scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mystery of Mineral Gorge,'' by Julia Van Nutt, illustrated
by Robert Van Nutt (Doubleday, $15.95). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has a theory about the bloodcurdling screams coming
from Mineral Gorge each night. Could it be the ghostly Woman in
White? When 10-year-old Lucky and three other ``Cobtown heroes'' of
1844 face the mystery head-on, they uncover a happy surprise. The
fright factor is very low voltage in this pleasantly suspenseful
yarn, illustrated in a lighthearted, nostalgic style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cook-A-Doodle-Doo!'' by Janet Stevens and Susan Stevens
Crummel (Harcourt Brace, $17). Ages 4-8.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by his famous great-grandmother, the Little Red Hen,
Big Brown Rooster enlists some helpers to whip together a tasty
strawberry shortcake. What Turtle, Pig and Iguana lack in
experience, they make up for in enthusiasm as they learn the value
of teamwork. Crummel's exuberant pictures are a delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luba and the Wren,'' by Patricia Polacco (Philomel, $16.99).
Ages 4-8.
</P>
<P>
   Polacco, a master storyteller, puts a Ukranian spin on the story
of The Fisherman and His Wife. Here a generous peasant girl named
Luba wins unlimited wishes from a rescued wren. Luba desires
nothing, but her hard-working parents have an insatiable list of
demands. In the end, of course, they get their comeuppance. With
warm, affectionate pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bark, George,'' by Jules Feiffer (HarperCollins, $14.95). Ages
2-5.
</P>
<P>
   George is a dog that doesn't bark. Instead, he goes meow,
quack-quack, oink or moo. George's mother takes him to the vet, who
ceremoniously dons a rubber glove and gets to the bottom of the
problem. This minimalist book is over in a flash, but it's fun
while it lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pierre's Dream,'' by Jennifer Armstrong, illustrated by Susan
Gaber (Dial, $15.99). All ages.
</P>
<P>
   Lazy, foolish Pierre is napping under an olive tree when a
circus pitches its tent nearby. When he awakes, he assumes the
circus is a dream. Pierre joins the circus stars in feats of
derring-do, confident that no harm can befall a dreamer.
Imaginative, with rich, brilliantly hued pictures that are worth
lingering over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Birchbark House,'' by Louise Erdrich (Hyperion, 235 pages,
$14.99). Ages 9-12.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by her Ojibwa heritage, Erdrich presents an Indian
counterpart to Laura Ingalls Wilder's ``Little House'' books.
Omakayas, a spirited 7-year-old of 1847, rejoices in the
traditional rhythms of life on Lake Superior but also faces hunger,
white encroachment and the devastation of smallpox. Erdrich borrows
freely from ``Little House in the Big Woods''; her drawings even
resemble Garth Williams' beloved ``Little House'' pictures. But her
voice _ warm, lyrical and with a trace of sadness _ is wholly her
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skellig,'' by David Almond (Delacorte, 183 pages, $15.95).
Ages 9-12.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, a young English boy, has much to contend with _ a
deathly ill baby sister, preoccupied parents and the strangeness of
a new home. Then he explores the ramshackle garage and discovers
Skellig, a thin, pale creature covered in dust and cobwebs. Skellig
_ part man, part owl, part angel? _ grows strong in the care of
Michael and his friend Mina and in turn transforms their lives. A
beautifully mysterious story about love and beauty and the power of
rejuvenation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Hive for the Honeybee,'' by Soinbhe Lally, illustrated by
Patience Brewster (Scholastic, 226 pages, $16.95). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bees aren't the easiest creatures to warm to, fuzzy though they
are, but Irish writer Soinbhe Lally makes them surprisingly human
and sympathetic in this metaphorical novel about destiny and
choice. Original and compelling, this thoughtful story unfolds
through the eyes of Thora, a stolid worker bee whose sense of the
possible is challenged by two maverick drones. As Thora learns to
dream, her rebellious friends find nobility in the cruel destiny
that awaits all drones.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Her Majesty's Request: An African Princess in Victorian
England,'' by Walter Dean Myers (Scholastic, 146 pages, $15.95).
Ages 9-up. Non-fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Myers stumbled on the story of Sarah Forbes Bonetta in a packet
of old letters in a London bookshop. Intrigued, he pieced together
the near-fantastic life of this West African princess, who was
rescued from sacrificial death by a British naval officer who was
trying to stop the slave trade. The child grew up in England,
living a privileged life under Queen Victoria's protection. Sarah's
story, illustrated with historic photos, is riveting and not a
little sad, for this dignified princess never really found her
place in life. Myers, a highly respected black writer, cuts through
the complexities of race, class and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragweed,'' by Avi, illustrated by Brian Floca (Avon Camelot,
$15). Ages 8-12.
</P>
<P>
   Ragweed, a naive country mouse, hops a freight train and ends up
in an urban jungle, in this engaging prequel to Avi's acclaimed
``Poppy'' and ``Poppy and Rye.'' Ragweed's mentor is Clutch, a
green-haired hipster mouse who clues him in to the hateful stalkers
of F.E.A.R. (Felines Enraged About Rodents). There's a serious
message about intolerance, but Avi keeps it light, with plenty of
oddball characters and narrow squeaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holes,'' by Louis Sachar (Farrar, Strauss, Giroux, 233 pages,
$16). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the National Book Award and the Newbery Medal, this
deftly woven story takes us to Camp Green Lake, a barren wasteland
where young inmates spend their days digging holes, supposedly to
build character. When a hard-luck kid named Stanley Yelnats lands
there for a crime he didn't commit, the truth about Camp Green Lake
and his own tangled history begins to emerge. Suspenseful,
thought-provoking and filled with dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ties That Bind, Ties That Break,'' by Lensey Namioka
(Delacorte, 154 pages, $15.95). Ages 12-up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1911, as China goes through cultural upheaval, a spirited
little girl from a wealthy family refuses to have her feet bound.
Later, her big, ``peasant'' feet render her unmarriageable, forcing
her to make her own way in a changing world. Namioka, a Seattle
author who was born in Beijing, brings an authentic voice to this
engrossing story, with an afterword on the history of foot-binding,
and Victorian corsets and modern spike heels. For readers 9 to 12,
see ``Child Bride,'' by Ching Yeung Russell, illustrated by
Jonathan T. Russell. (Boyds Mills Press, 133 pages, $15.95).
</P>
<P>
   LEMON ALERT
</P>
<P>
   ``Life's Little Fable,'' by Patricia Cornwell, illustrated by
Barbara Leonard Gibson (G.P. Putnam's Sons, $16.99). Ages 5-up.
</P>
<P>
   Cornwell, a popular writer of grim adult mysteries, here proves
that writing children's books isn't as easy as it looks. (Some
Seattle booksellers murmur that this picture book would not have
seen daylight if not for Cornwell's marquee value).
</P>
<P>
   Here a boy named Jarrod frolics innocently in a land without
gravity or shadows. Things take an unexpectedly nasty turn as
Jarrod nearly succumbs to the evil pond god who lured his father to
his death. It ends on an implausibly happy note.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness in children's literature can be a fine thing, but this
story is downright creepy, and the plot crumbles like bad pie
crust. For instance, Jarrod knows he can climb trees and never fall
because ``he's daring and doesn't like rules.'' But if there's no
gravity, why a rule against climbing trees? And why don't the deer
and squirrels float too?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nova's Ark,'' by David Kirk (Scholastic/Callaway, $17.95). All
ages.
</P>
<P>
   This tale of a futuristic robot astronaut is slick, poorly
written and strangely lacking in soul. What it has, however, is 3-D
computer-generated imagery in Kirk's trademark lurid colors and a
publicity push that exploits the fame of his best-selling ``Miss
Spider'' books. In fairness, Kirk's older fans will probably be
intrigued by his Nova artwork, featured in The New York Times Book
Review's holiday '98 issue. But by themselves, catchy computer
graphics are a thin excuse for a children's book.

A STRING TO THE PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT PURDUE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mas Okui's 57-year love affair with fishing the
Eastern Sierra began not with rods and reels but string and a
safety pin _ and barbed wire and armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   Okui was in the fifth grade in 1942 when he and his family were
rousted from their Burbank home and transported to Manzanar
Relocation Center, a World War II internment camp in a dry,
desolate and wind-swept sliver of the Owens Valley. He was one of
more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans imprisoned in U.S. camps from
1942 to 1945; the closest town to Manzanar is Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Bairs Creek trickled through the southwest corner of Manzanar,
Okui recalled, exposing him and his friends to trout fishing for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would try to trap them, run them into a corner and catch
them with our bare hands,'' said Okui, now 67, a retired history
teacher living in Woodland Hills with his wife of 43 years, Aki.
``We also tried a string with a pin on the end, but that didn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, a rifle-toting guard tossed a bag of drop lines _ small
wooden frames wound with string _ over the barbed-wire fence. Okui
didn't catch anything memorable, but he has been hooked on fishing
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Today Okui is regarded as one of the finest fly-anglers in the
area, and many say his knowledge of Hot Creek _ a trophy
fly-fishing stream about 85 miles north of the long-ruined but
never-forgotten Manzanar site _ is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the better fishermen in Southern California, if
not the Western United States,'' said George Chapman, 79, of
Woodland Hills, who with Okui is a member of the San Fernando
Valley-based Sierra Pacific Flyfishers club. ``On Hot Creek he has
all the trout named and knows their hangouts. He knows every rock,
nook and cranny.''
</P>
<P>
   Okui's unique fly-tying and iconoclastic casting methods have
elevated him to guru status among some anglers. In the
Japanese-American community, he is known as a proud historian
dedicated to preserving the heritage of the Japanese-American
experience. He taught history and government classes for nearly 30
years at Canoga Park and Gardena high schools.
</P>
<P>
   After Manzanar, Okui graduated from San Fernando High and later
joined the Army. While stationed in Europe, he was smitten with the
notion of fishing the same Pyrenees streams where Ernest Hemingway
had wet lines. He got lost, met Basque sheepherders and caught a
few fish.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he found himself back in California. Here he concentrated
on bait-fishing Hot Creek because he couldn't figure out how to
fly-fish among the weeds. In his living room hangs an eight-pound
brown trout he hooked in the waters east of Mammoth Lakes, well
before the famous creek became a catch-and-release fishery.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1960s, Okui began fly-fishing with colleagues at
Gardena High and spent summer vacations traveling to hundreds of
streams in the West with Aki and their two sons, Matt and Paul.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few streams in the Western U.S. I haven't
fished at some point,'' Okui said. ``I've met some of the best
fishermen in the country. My philosophy is very simple: Go to a
stream you haven't fished before and give it three days; because if
there's a guy who's really good on that stream, you're going to
meet him during one of those three days.''
</P>
<P>
   Okui also formulated his own fly-tying style, as well. While
many anglers spend countless hours _ and dollars _ meticulously
matching their flies to the color and shape of the insects trout
favor, Okui, in keeping with his unassuming demeanor, has a simple
plan:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, they've got to work. They've got to be easy to tie. If
they are dry flies, they've got to be very visible. They've got to
be durable. And they've got to be cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Call him a frugal angler. His fishing methods have certainly
been shaped by his teacher's salary. Tough, long-lasting flies are
just one example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught 21 fish with one fly before I stopped using it, just
to see how durable a fly would get,'' he explained. The thrifty
Okui also often employs a 35-year-old reel he bought at a fire sale
for $15. The paint might be long worn off, but it catches trout
with the best of them. And while anglers have been known to spend
$500 or more for a top-flight fly rod, Okui prefers a rod
custom-built for him for $97.
</P>
<P>
   The fly-angler has developed an unorthodox method for tying
extra-long leaders. On Hot Creek, he casts leaders ranging from 16
to 22 feet, far longer than those used by most fly-anglers. This
technique allows him a 20- to 30-foot, drag-free float of the fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the drag-free float, the more fish are going to hit
that fly,'' he explained, because the current isn't forcing the fly
downstream at an unnatural pace.
</P>
<P>
   Okui said about two dozen fishermen have bought into this
unusual fishing system, including one of his former Gardena High
students, Dennis Tsuyuki. ``If you watch a modern fly-fishing video
and then watch Mas, you'd say, `What the hell is wrong with this
guy?' '' noted Tsuyuki, a vice president at Universal Studios.
``But it really works. His leader formula is probably the best I've
used.''
</P>
<P>
   Okui teaches fly-tying and fly-fishing classes through Sierra
Pacific Flyfishers and donates all his proceeds to an organization
that sends schoolchildren on field trips to Washington, D.C. He
also serves as curator of the Manzanar Project of the Eastern
California Museum in Independence and leads tour groups at the
Japanese-American National Museum in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels he was wronged as a child, but it's not with a
vengeance. Instead, he wants to ensure that it doesn't happen
again,'' Chapman said. ``He's all-American, that's for sure. But he
doesn't want people to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Some friends claim Okui's memories of two-and-a-half years in
Manzanar drive him to excel on the waters of the Eastern Sierra.
Not so, Okui said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fly-fishing is the only activity I know of, other than
meditation, where you can cleanse your mind,'' he noted. ``At this
point in my life, the things I'm interested in are going
fly-fishing, working at the museum and having fun. Life is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proof that the American system works.''

REDS MEADOW LURES ANGLERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES, Calif. _ When the road to Reds Meadow is cleared
of snow in either late spring or early summer, Eastern Sierra
anglers view it as a mini-trout opener.
</P>
<P>
   Fish at lakes such as Sotcher and Starkweather are finally
within line's length, nearly two months after the regular regional
trout opener on the last Saturday of April.
</P>
<P>
   Situated less than five miles west of Mammoth Lakes, Reds Meadow
is an oasis for anglers, backpackers and sightseers. It features
Devils Postpile National Monument, breathtaking Rainbow Falls and
several entries into the High Sierra, punctuated by the jagged
Minarets and towering Ritter Range.
</P>
<P>
   This summer for the first time, as a complement to the
Department of Fish and Game's traditional trout-stocking efforts,
Sotcher and Starkweather will be planted with Alpers rainbow, the
world-renowned hand-reared trout raised on nearby resident Tim
Alpers' family ranch. Alpers' truck will dump some 750 pounds of
trout _ about 200 fish at 3 to 6 pounds and heavier _ on July 1,
Aug. 2 and Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move that excites area residents and anglers alike, who
to this point could only hope that the half-pound trout the DFG
stocks into the two lakes would grow to the size that Alpers trout
are usually released into the wilds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enhancement to the area,'' said Emile Rummel of
Crowley Lake, a general contractor who moved from Beverly Hills to
the Eastern Sierra 30 years ago and has fished its trout-rich
waters ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic. Fishermen like to catch big fish. You
never brag about a 6-inch rainbow trout. You do brag about fish
that are 2, 4, 6 and 10 pounds or more. It's an experience you want
to repeat more than once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is funded by the Mammoth Lakes Chamber of Commerce
and is part of a $50,000 effort to stock Alpers trout into area
waters, including Mammoth Creek and Mary, George, Mamie and Twin
lakes in the Mammoth Lakes Basin. Recognizing the potential
attraction to anglers, the chamber has more than doubled what it
spent on last year's stocking project with Alpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city mothers and fathers in their wisdom have determined
that stocking these lakes and creeks in the Mammoth Lakes area is a
very astute move in enhancing the local economy,'' said Alpers,
understandably upbeat about the increase in spending on the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Alpers explained that the only time he has planted his trout in
Reds Meadow was about eight years ago, when he put 30 rainbows into
Sotcher Lake during the filming of a cellular-phone commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' Alpers said. ``It will be the
first time that I've really stocked down there with any type of
serious poundage and I think it's going to be a real draw for that
area down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Alpers trout and the DFG's stockers should be an enticing
combination, according to Mike Haynie, senior hatchery supervisor
for the DFG in Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our beneficiaries will be the angling public,'' Haynie
said. ``There is a large number of anglers and there are limited
resources available for angling opportunities. Both Mr. Alpers and
the Department of Fish and Game help fill that need.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, there is a diversity in the type of product that
we put out. He is putting out a larger fish. We are putting out a
smaller fish. However, we put out a greater number. So there are
opportunities for people to catch fish and opportunities to catch
large fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Madera County's Sotcher and Starkweather lakes _ both easily
accessed _ may be fished at all hours of the day and night, unlike
their Mono County counterparts, which can only be targeted in
daylight hours. Five trout may be taken per day; 10 may be in
possession. No other special regulations apply, but the DFG
recommends anglers become familiar with the 1999 California Sport
Fishing Regulations handbook.
</P>
<P>
   Starkweather is a veritable little pond with little fish when
compared to the wider, deeper Sotcher, where trout to at least 13
pounds, 11 ounces (at least according to the description on the
1987 photo of the trophy fish at Reds Meadow Resort) have been
taken.
</P>
<P>
   Rummel recommends anglers use floating processed bait (light
green), lures (Thomas Buoyant in a perch pattern), and, when the
fish are jumping, a fly-and-bubble setup with 4-pound line, three
to four feet of 2-pound leader and an olive Matuka streamer
pattern.

WRITER OF HARD-KNUCKLED NOVELS LIVES A WARD CLEAVER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Kirkland neighborhood is peaceful and suburban,
with broad lawns, well-kept homes and outsized vehicles. About the
only menacing note in this comfortable enclave of family life east
of Seattle is sounded by a curbside sign: ``Warning! Crime Watch
Neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign, though, does not tell the whole truth. This is not
only a neighborhood where crime is watched. This is a neighborhood
where crime is hatched, twisted schemes of one kind or another,
drug deals, phone pranks, sex scams, double crosses, even
murders-for-hire.
</P>
<P>
   They are all hatched in one house and in one room, a small
sanctuary of air-conditioned cool over the garage. Here, thriller
writer Robert Ferrigno sits at a computer and concocts his noir
excursions into the seamy side of life in Los Angeles, particularly
Orange County, a place of sun-baked California dreams and
all-American excesses where there is, as he puts it, ``vast
ambition and no interest in working for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between that L.A. terrain and this suburban street
could not be more stark, which is just the way Ferrigno likes it.
Here the 51-year-old writer, whose novels resonate with menace and
eroticism, lives a resoundingly normal life with his wife and four
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live a Ward Cleaver existence here _ something I never
thought I could achieve,'' Ferrigno relates. ``I consider myself
officially retired from a previous life that killed a lot of my
friends, those times of staying up all night and professional
gambling, times when I would either have $10,000 in my pocket or
have to do day labor, plus years of living in bad neighborhoods
with their intrigues, their interesting characters and their vivid
street dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the excesses of Ferrigno's previous life has been
wasted, as the many readers of his hard-knuckled novels can attest.
They provided the plot fodder for his much-noticed first novel in
1990, ``The Horse Latitudes,'' and four subsequent thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrigno's latest is ``Heartbreaker'' (Pantheon, 307 pages,
$24), which many critics and the author are calling his best novel,
one that abundantly displays the extra time and creative attention
lavished upon it by the writer and his new publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreaker'' is a page-turner with verve and sass. It is
rife with snap-crackling dialogue, sardonic humor and torrid love,
all Ferrigno trademarks, but honed this time to stiletto sharpness.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feelings are a little hurt,'' remarks one character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run them,'' advises another, ``under the cold-water tap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreaker'' opens when Val Duran, former Miami undercover
cop, flees the Flamingo City after extracting retribution for a
drug lord's murder of his partner, which he had to witness, in
horror, from a distance. Duran settles into a subterranean life in
L.A., working as a tech adviser on crummy movies while guarding his
privacy in hopes of not leaving any trail the drug lord can track.
</P>
<P>
   Then Duran, against his best intentions, falls for a Kyle
Abbott, a fiercely independent marine biologist, and soon finds
himself ensnared with her wealthy family, including her Hollywood
pretty-boy stepbrother. Kilo, as he is nicknamed, turns out to be
enmeshed with two scary partners (one femme fatale, one bruiser of
a Gulf War combat vet) in a plot to murder his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreaker'' soon becomes like a runaway freight train
barreling down three tracks at once _ the drug lord closing in on
Duran, his burgeoning relationship with Kyle and the unfolding of
the heinous murder for inheritance. And along the way, even the
careful reader is kept deliciously off-kilter with fiendish
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   As one character observes, ``Ain't nothing certain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Heartbreaker'' began with just two images in Ferrigno's fervid
imagination, the sort of cinematic snippet that floats into his
mind in the pre-dawn hours or in the last moments before sleep at
night.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a man forced to watch the murder of a friend and a
Hollywood hunk tied down on a bed, both images of profound
helplessness. He would spend months letting the images develop
until he was ready to sit down at his computer and try to figure
out ``how these people might fit together.''
</P>
<P>
   This is how Ferrigno's books have all been born, but little
about the rest of the process of writing ``Heartbreaker'' would
follow his usual pattern. The difference this time was that the
writer was working with Sonny Mehta, a legendary New York literary
figure who is head of the Knopf Publishing Group.
</P>
<P>
   Mehta not only headed the company publishing Ferrigno's new
novel, he served as its editor, a line-by-line, take-your-time
editor of the old school now nearly extinct. So the writer not only
spent more than twice as long on ``Heartbreaker'' as his previous
novels, he benefited from an editor who gave him both intense
attention to every detail and a long leash to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being on the phone with Sonny for five hours one
day, going over a section of the book line by line in order to cut
three pages,'' Ferrigno recalls. ``I told him at one point that I
thought I had to do something a certain way and he said to me, `You
don't have to do anything any way.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There was such a sense of freedom working with him _ that was
why this was the happiest experience I have had on a book. On my
first book, I didn't know what to do; on this book, I tried to
forget everything I'd learned before.''
</P>
<P>
   What did not change, however, was Ferrigno's basic mindset. His
novels are character-driven, rather than plot-driven (``I don't do
procedurals; I'm more interested in inhabiting the skins of the bad
guys and the good guys''). And Ferrigno, who readily admits he
skipped sections of ``The Silence of the Lambs'' because the
violence was ``too graphic, too real,'' prefers to render menace
more than actual violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a morality to my work,'' he stresses.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a distinctly cinematic quality to Ferrigno's
thrillers. They seem virtually camera-ready, as Hollywood has
recognized. Ferrigno's novels have been optioned repeatedly for
films, although none has actually made it to the screen. The writer
is disappointed about that, but past experience has made him savvy
about the fickle ways of filmdom.
</P>
<P>
   As Ferrigno relates, ``I remember when the option first lapsed
on `The Horse Latitudes' and I wanted to cry _ I thought, `My God,
does that mean my book is not any good?' Now I think of the money I
receive for film options as free money. I got six figures from the
option for `Heartbreaker' and that recently lapsed and somebody
else may soon be optioning it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrigno, a soft-spoken and unassuming straight shooter, is a
remarkably successful commercial writer, well-compensated for his
talents. He has been from the outset when ``The Horse Latitudes''
earned a publisher advance with foreign rights of almost $500,000
and a Time magazine rave as ``the most memorable fiction debut of
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't appreciate that at the time,'' he admits. ``I didn't
realize how rare that was with a first book.''
</P>
<P>
   That early success was sweet revenge for Ferrigno, who had quit
his job as a feature writer at the Orange County Register to pursue
his novelist's dream, a leap into the unknown that prompted the
paper's editor to warn Ferrigno ``you'll never make newspaper wages
again.'' Ferrigno never has made newspaper wages again; his have
always been higher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he credits his newspaper journalism for turning him into
a writer, despite his master's from the writing program at Bowling
Green University in Ohio. Ferrigno honed his journalism skills on
alternative weeklies in Seattle for the now-defunct Seattle Sun and
later as one of six co-founders of The Rocket, a rock music paper,
before moving to the big leagues of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to write there _ learned to write fast, be incisive
and to get to it,'' he emphasizes. ``People then spent 25 cents for
a paper and they didn't spend that to read me. So I figured I had
to trap them, engage them in such a way that they could not stop
reading me.''
</P>
<P>
   His days as a professional poker player also contributed to the
writer that Ferrigno is today. He spent five years earning his
living playing cards at gaming tables in Seattle private clubs and
in Las Vegas casinos. He still makes a couple of pilgrimages to Las
Vegas every year in order to keep his gambling skills current,
which also benefits his writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poker is about learning to scope out your opposition,''
Ferrigno says. ``It's more about character than cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, this self-described ``expatriate L.A. writer'' seems
totally at home in his suburban Seattle milieu, the wood stove in
the family room, the framed kid art, the rustic wood glider for two
out back. But he is nowhere more at home than in his study, where
the bookshelves hold editions of his books, both American and
foreign, testament to this writer's goal achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal has always been to be one of those writers who, when
you open one of their books, you see a list of the books that
writer has written,'' Ferringo stresses. ``That list shows you're
someone who's in the game for the long run. It's just like in
gambling: It's nice to have all the money at the end, but there's
also something about being in the game right until the end. Then
you're a player.''

CBC WORTH TUNING INTO FOR SOME SUMMER FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a French-Canadian surname like Levesque, I'm genetically
predisposed to watching CBC Television. This is especially true in
the summertime, when U.S. networks go on vacation, figuring there
aren't enough people watching TV to warrant the introduction of
fresh new programming.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, my need for Canadian programming went
unfulfilled unless I went to the trouble of snagging the
over-the-air signal from CBUT in Vancouver, B.C. This exercise
involved propping a small TV set on the kitchen counter, tilting it
slightly with the help of ``The Joy of Cooking,'' and pointing the
antenna in the general direction of the Yukon.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't do this too often, because the picture was fuzzier than
the memory of a Seattle Mariners executive, and it was no fun
sitting three inches from the screen trying to follow the puck on
``Hockey Night in Canada.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, TCI Cable upgraded my neighborhood and restored CBC
Vancouver to its rightful place in my cable-channel universe, so
now I can watch ``The National'' with Peter Mansbridge and
``Broadcast One'' with Gloria Macarenko, without leaving a
noseprint on the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Canadian broadcasters, part of the CBC's mission is
to ``Canadianize'' programming. It's a government rule, a safeguard
against being swallowed up by the Hollywood entertainment gorilla.
So, while CBC's affiliates still air ``The Simpsons'' and ``The
Wonderful World of Disney,'' they concentrate on original stuff
created in Canada for Canadians (and Americans who happen to live
near the border).
</P>
<P>
   This honeymoon is still quite new, so I may be guilty of the big
gush. But I know there are readers out there who share my affinity
for CBC, even if the quality varies widely.
</P>
<P>
   CBC is best known for its news and public-affairs shows. It also
does sports pretty well, and some of its sketch comedy is a riot,
though I have no idea what it is that people find amusing about
``The Red Green Show.'' (Last week, when I was at the Banff TV
Festival, the stars of the show _ Steve Smith and Pat McKenna _
were much funnier in person. Still, Smith reports that ``The Red
Green Show'' is the best money-raiser for PBS stations stateside
during their begathons.)
</P>
<P>
   The weakest programming on the CBC schedule continues to be
Canadian-produced dramatic series, whose production values don't
quite measure up to their best U.S. counterparts. But buoyed by
audience response to shows like ``Da Vinci's Inquest'' and
``Nothing Too Good for a Cowboy,'' the CBC schedule next fall will
continue with the Canadianization effort, which began three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new series this fall are ``P.R.,'' a comedy about the
entertainment industry, and ``In Tha' Mix,'' a drama about two guys
producing a campus hip-hop radio show. Short-season series include
``These Arms of Mine,'' a six-episode drama about friends and
lovers in Vancouver; ``Cover Me,'' a three-part miniseries about
elite agents fighting international terrorism, and ``Jake &AMP; Jill,''
a six-installment romantic comedy. The major effort next season
will be a 30-hour documentary series titled ``Canada: A People's
History.''
</P>
<P>
   'Scuse me while I stock up on the Molson.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   The season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' originally
scheduled to air May 25, will be broadcast July 13 at 8 p.m. on The
WB Network. The episode involves high school students rising up in
arms against a demon mayor, so The WB decided to delay the
broadcast rather than air it so close to the date of the Columbine
High School shootings in Littleton, Colo. ... Why is this man
smiling? Jeff Smulyan, who sold the Seattle Mariners to the
Over-the-Bill Gang currently seeking a $60 million increase in its
allowance, graces the cover of this week's Broadcasting &AMP; Cable
magazine. Though undervalued by Wall Street, Smulyan's
Indianapolis-based Emmis Communications Corp. (16 radio stations,
six TV stations, six magazines) has grown steadily over the years.
In the past 18 months, Emmis has spent more than a billion dollars
on acquisitions and investments, none involving major league
baseball. ... Electronic Media reports that NBC is negotiating with
``Profiler'' star Ally Walker to release her from her contract. The
three-year-old series, produced by NBC Studios, reportedly will
replace Walker with a new character. ... Here's some fodder for the
next backyard barbecue. A survey commissioned by Illuminations, the
yuppie candle company that has stores in Seattle and Bellevue,
reveals that 51 percent of 423 respondents nationwide say watching
Martha Stewart on TV stresses them out, and that Dan Rather is more
stress-inducing than Peter Jennings or Tom Brokaw. ... Fans of
``Another World'' may find consolation in knowing that four
characters from the daytime soap, which is ending its 35-year run
this week, will show up temporarily on ``As the World Turns'' later
this summer. Procter &AMP; Gamble Productions, which owns both shows,
will have Jake and Vicky McKinnon (Tom Eplin and Jensen Buchanan)
and Lila and Cass Winthrop (Lisa Peluso and Stephen Schnetzer)
making brief stops in Oakdale.

JUDGE ALLOWS 2 PRICE LEVELS IN STOCK PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a decision with broad implications for privately
owned companies and their workers, a federal judge in Manhattan has
ruled that such concerns may use different methods to value company
shares that workers buy outright and those that they purchase in a
retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in the case of an executive with a Connecticut
brokerage house who sought $6 million in March 1996 as fair market
value for 120,000 shares of his employer's stock. But the company,
Soundview Technology Group of Stamford, Conn., said the shares had
a book value of $696,000.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Pollack, a senior judge in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, ruled that Soundview may use different techniques to
value shares sold in its stock purchase plan and in its 401(k)
profit-sharing plan so long as the methods are reasonable and are
consistently applied.
</P>
<P>
   He also held, after a three-day trial, that book value was a
reasonable proxy for fair market value in determining how much to
pay departing employees for Soundview shares held in the 401(k)
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In publicly traded companies the value of shares can be
determined from trading in securities markets. But millions of
Americans work for companies whose stock does not trade publicly
and, therefore, whose value is more difficult to determine. The
issues in the Soundview case are more likely to arise in employee
stock ownership plans than in 401(k) plans, which tend to be
invested in mutual funds and securities that can be easily valued.
</P>
<P>
   The case was complicated by the fact that the plaintiff, Arnold
Owen, had been one of five top executives at Soundview, was a
trustee of the 401(k) plan and had hired appraisers to value the
shares of Soundview in the 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the U.S. Department of Labor told Soundview
that its valuation of its shares in the 401(k) plan was improper
and violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the 1974
law governing retirement plans. It also found that the book value
technique used by Soundview understated the value of Owen's shares
by at least 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department noted that in 1991 it had threatened to sue
the company unless it properly valued shares in the 401(k) plan, a
threat reiterated in the Feb. 10 finding.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack held that the Labor Department investigation and
findings were irrelevant to Owen's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The judge not only ruled against Owen, but found him so lacking
in credibility that he decided all issues in favor of Soundview and
said he must pay Soundview's legal costs because he brought the
case in bad faith. The amount will be determined later.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack, in a 29-page opinion, also suggested that had Owen
bought his 120,000 shares outside of the 401(k) plan he might have
been entitled to more money. But the judge held that as a
sophisticated executive who had signed key documents, Owen knew or
should have known how his Soundview shares in the 401(k) plan would
be valued.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with nonmarketable shares are required to use fair
market value for their shares in 401(k), employee stock ownership
and similar retirement plans, said David West, the senior
retirement plan specialist at Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher in Los
Angeles. Book value, the pricing technique used by Soundview, may
or may not represent fair market value, West said.
</P>
<P>
   John Reichman of Wachtel &AMP; Masyr, one of Owen's lawyers, said
the decision would be appealed and that he expected the Labor
Department would join in that appeal.

HE'S NOT A GAMBLER, BUT BOXER AYALA TRYING TO BEAT ODDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Like many innocent out-of-towners, Fort Worth's
Paulie Ayala needed to have the betting line on his title fight
against World Boxing Association bantamweight champion Johnny Tapia
spelled out for him yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia-Ayala occupies a prime spot on the big electronic board in
the Race &AMP; Sports Book at the Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino, site of
their scheduled 12-rounder on Saturday night. As of yesterday
afternoon, the odds on Tapia successfully defending his 118-pound
title stood at minus-$600. The odds on Ayala, the WBA's No.
2-ranked contender, were listed at plus-$400.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean to prospective bettors, innocent or
otherwise?
</P>
<P>
   ``Minus-$600 is a heavy favorite for Tapia,'' said Marc Ratner,
executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, and a
participant in the final prefight news conference here. ``When
you're laying 6-to-1, that's a pretty good favorite. In other
words, if you wanted to bet on Tapia, you have to put up $600 to
win $100. If you want to bet on Ayala, you bet $100 and you can win
$400. There's no value, as they say, to betting on the favorite.
You get much better odds when you bet on the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the odds nor the explanation, however, lightened Ayala's
mood before he and trainer Henry Mendez took their seats on the
dais at the hotel's Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those odds are crazy. But I don't bet,'' Ayala said. ``I throw
in some change in the slot machines, but I don't bet. But I bet _ I
mean, I'm confident _ I'm going to win. This is a business trip
really. There's no joking or gaming around for me. I'm here to
fight, make money and go on home. I'm not here to leave some of it
in the casino, for the decorations.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after their final news conference in Los
Angeles, Ayala and Tapia dutifully sat through their guaranteed
final news conference with promoter Bob Arum of Top Rank, Inc.
Clearly, the mix of a whirlwind promotional tour that began so
amicably last month had clashed with the demands of training camp,
and the realization that someone is going to suffer a serious
career setback in two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we were in LA on Tuesday,'' said Tapia, 32, of
Albuquerque, N.M. ``I'm tired of this ... . And I'm anxious to get
to him \RAyala\S. You don't even know. I'm tired of looking at him
at press conferences. I'm tired of talking into the mike. It's time
to put up. Ain't nobody taking my belt away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Freddie Roach said Tapia _ a three-time champion despite
repeated bouts with cocaine earlier this decade _ definitely had
slipped on his game face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they changed opponents tomorrow, we don't care,'' Roach
said. ``Johnny's getting a little fed up with me in the gym. He
peaked on Friday, our last day of sparring. We're just maintaining
right now. We haven't boxed since that day, and we won't box until
we see Paulie.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tapia (46-0-2, 25 knockouts), Ayala's formal remarks were
clipped after what he also considered a wasted trip to a club in
Hollywood to pump up pay-per-view sales on Showtime Event
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do my part for the promotion,'' said Ayala, 29. ``But
it messed up my \Rtraining\S schedule. I left Vegas at 7 in the
morning and got back at 5 in the afternoon. I went to the gym at 6
and wound up running at 9 at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm through selling tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he really was not. When it came time for Ayala (27-1,
12 KOs) to stand behind the microphones and shower yet another
round of praise upon his opponent, he flicked on the switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me seven years to get my first title shot, so this
one's come a lot faster,'' said Ayala, who suffered a sixth-round
technical loss against then-World Boxing Council champion Joichiro
Tatsuyoshi in Japan on Aug. 23. ``I'm just ready to fight. I'm
looking forward to a very intense night of boxing. I'm confident
and looking forward to being the WBA bantamweight champion of the
world.''

UCLA'S MOORE ELECTED TO HALL OF FAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billie Moore, the former UCLA and Cal
State-Fullerton women's basketball coach who won two NCAA
championships, was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moore joins ex-Boston Celtic Kevin McHale, former Georgetown
coach John Thompson and two contributors, Wayne Embry and Fred
Zollner, to form the class of 1999. The induction ceremony is Oct.
1 in Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned and a little in awe,'' Moore said. ``A lot of
people have asked me how I feel. I'm the type of person who has to
think about things before I decide how I feel. I'm still thinking
about this.''
</P>
<P>
   In eight years at Fullerton State, Moore was 140-15 and won the
1970 NCAA title. In 16 seasons at UCLA, she was 296-181 and won the
1978 title. She coached Ann Meyers and Denise Curry, and she guided
the United States to the silver medal in the 1976 Olympics in
Montreal _ the first Olympics for women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, she was a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told those players that there would be a lot more Olympic
teams, but there would only be one first Olympic team, and we were
proud to be the first,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore learned of her induction Tuesday evening after returning
to her Orange County home from a round of golf. She shared the news
with her family, then waited for the official announcement
Wednesday morning. The phone hasn't stopped ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't really sunk in yet,'' Moore said. ``It's so
different for me because basketball is such a team sport and this
is an individual honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore retired from UCLA after the 1993 season. Like John Wooden,
she has opted for the shadows, not wanting to pressure her
successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Current Bruins coach Kathy Olivier) asked me to wait to come
back until she was ready,'' Moore said. ``So two years ago, I went
to a few games. She's feeling more comfortable. If I had that team,
I'd feel more comfortable, too.''

GOLDMAN SACHS PROFIT IS UP 30 PERCENT IN FIRST PUBLIC QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported its first quarterly results as
a publicly traded company Wednesday with a gain that exceeded
analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman exhibited strength in market trading and investment
banking in reporting second-quarter earnings of $624 million, or
$1.30 a share, excluding one-time charges associated with the
firm's initial public offering last month. That was up 30 percent
from the $476 million the firm made in the second quarter a year
earlier, calculated as if the firm was a public company last year,
and well above the $1.07 consensus estimate of 11 securities
analysts surveyed by the First Call Corp., a research company.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue from trading and investments rose 23 percent from the
quarter a year ago and 27 percent from the first quarter, to $1.7
billion, while revenue from investment banking rose 5 percent from
a year ago and 11 percent from the first quarter, to $1 billion. In
asset management and securities services, revenue rose to $749
million, up just 2 percent from a year ago but up 17 percent from
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very strong numbers particularly because they were
ahead of the first quarter, which was extremely robust in and of
itself,'' said Joan Solotar, brokerage industry analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``But they aren't singular; other
firms will report strong results as well.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. reported
second-quarter earnings that were far above analysts' expectations.
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. is expected to issue results
Thursday. Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., Paine Webber and other brokerage
firms whose second quarter ends June 30 report their results next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong results, shares of Goldman fell $3, or 4.4
percent, to $65.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing the firm's overall strengths, David Viniar,
Goldman's chief financial officer, acknowledged the quarter's
robust market. ``It's impossible to disassociate our performance
from the market,'' he said. ``We took advantage of a favorable
market with an excellent performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The only thing we caution everybody about is not to
annualize these numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, two analysts told First Call Wednesday that they
were raising their 1999 earnings estimates for Goldman to an
average of $4.34 a share from the previous estimate of $3.66 on the
strength of Wednesday's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the firm took a $2.3 billion one-time
charge associated with awarding stock to employees in connection
with its initial public offering. In addition, the firm listed a
$200 million charitable donation to a foundation, the Goldman Sachs
Fund. Including those charges, Goldman reported net income of $340
million, or 71 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Goldman's 221 former partners own about half of the company's
shares. Another 21 percent is shared by the company's 13,000
employees. The rest of the nonpublic shares are roughly split among
Goldman's 125 retired partners and outside institutional
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's partners ended their firm's 130-year status as a
private partnership by selling 69 million shares, or roughly 15
percent of the firm, to the public. The $3.7 billion initial public
offering was the largest financial services IPO ever and the
second-largest United States stock offering of any kind.

EDITORIAL: SUPREME MISCHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 24:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court ended its 1998-99 term on two deeply
disturbing notes. On Tuesday it significantly weakened protections
afforded by a federal law barring discrimination against people
with disabilities. Wednesday, in three separate decisions delivered
in a morning of high drama, it significantly strengthened the power
of the states in the federal system while weakening those of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The states' rights decisions were particularly alarming.
Although basic civil rights protected by the 14th Amendment are not
affected, the decisions will make it harder to enforce uniform
policies on matters of national concern like the environment or
health. They also provide further evidence of the increasingly
bitter ideological split among the justices over how to balance
federal and state powers. Finally, they confirm the narrow but
nonetheless decisive control of a coalition of five conservative
justices.
</P>
<P>
   These five _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Associate
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas _ have been steadily whittling down the legitimate
authority of the federal government in a series of 5-4 decisions
since 1996. This same group, supposedly opposed to judicial
activism, has now declared two federal laws unconstitutional and
left important precedents in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   One of the states' rights cases involved an attempt by state
probation officers in Maine to enforce their right to overtime pay
under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Writing for the
majority, Kennedy said that the Constitution's ``structure and
history'' not only shielded states from lawsuits in federal courts
but also gave them immunity from state court lawsuits seeking to
enforce a federal right. In other words, he seemed to suggest, the
Maine probation officers have a federally protected right to get
paid for overtime work, but no effective way to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   In the same cramped spirit, the court invoked the doctrine of
sovereign immunity to protect Florida from having to defend itself
in federal courts from legal challenges to its program to help
families save for tuition in the state's public universities. A New
Jersey bank with a similar tuition-savings program had brought two
suits, saying that Florida had violated federal patent law as well
as federal trademark law. The court ruled for Florida in both
cases.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the court's main focus was the Americans with
Disabilities Act. In a humane and soundly reasoned ruling, it
upheld by a 6-3 vote a 1991 federal regulation that barred states
from segregating mentally disabled individuals in a state
institution when a small supervised group home in the community
would be medically and socially more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, the court used three other cases to
narrow the law's reach in the vital area of employment
discrimination. In its core 7-2 holding, the court declared that
individuals with physical impairments that can be easily corrected
so they can function normally are not ``disabled'' and therefore
are not entitled to protection under the Act _ even though the
disabilities cost them their jobs. As Justice John Paul Stevens
countered in a forceful dissent, that ``crabbed version'' of the
law ignores its intended purpose, which is to protect anyone with a
disability from being discriminated against because of it.
</P>
<P>
   The unhappy result of the court's final 48 hours is thus two
glaring legal anomalies. People with federally protected rights
have no realistic way to enforce them against states. People
considered sufficiently disabled by employers to be denied a job
are now seen by this court to be insufficiently impaired to
challenge that decision under the Disabilities Act. All in all,
this was not a worthy exit.

LEITER STACKS THE METS' DECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seven superb innings, seven overpowering strikeouts
and four victories in his last four starts have made it pretty
clear that the staff's ace, Al Leiter, has found his way back into
the New York Mets' deck. And oh, how that deck has been stacked
lately, as the Florida Marlins unfortunately discovered for the
second straight game Wednesday night, losing by 6-3 to a team that
has won 13 of its last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run fifth helped bury the Marlins before 25,116 fans at
Shea Stadium. Edgardo Alfonzo with a 3-for-4 night and three runs
batted in, and Roger Cedeno with two steals, his 40th and 41st of
the season, were a big part of it.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied 2-2, Cedeno led off the fifth with a line
drive single and had Marlins starter Brian Meadows (5-8) worried
enough to pitch out. Cedeno stayed _ for a pitch. But on the next
one, he stole second _ his second theft of the night and 41st of
the season _ when catcher Mike Redmond sailed his throw.
</P>
<P>
   After Rey Ordonez sacrificed Cedeno to third and Leiter grounded
out to second, Meadows walked Ricky Henderson. It was a mistake to
leave men on the corners for Alfonzo, who finished the game 3 for 4
with three runs batted in. His homer in the third cut a Marlins
lead to 2-1. His first-pitch single up the middle this time put the
Mets up for good, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   When John Olerud doubled down the right field line to chase
Alfonzo and Henderson home, the Mets were on the verge of getting
the 11th victory against one loss from its starting rotation in the
last 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, on the night Bobby Bonilla got his first hit
since June 11 _ a pinch-double in the seventh _ Mike Piazza's club
tying hitting streak ended at 24 games. It was a frustrating night
for the Mets' catcher, who got slammed in the back when Bruce Aven
swung through a Leiter pitch for a strikeout in the seventh. In the
eighth, Piazza misjudged a foul pop off the bat of Preston Wilson
that sent him head over heels in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   And at bat, he went 0 for 4, leaving him tied with Hubie Brooks
(1984) for the club record in consecutive games hit safely.
</P>
<P>
   But it was clearly Leiter's night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's doing anything different, but he's getting
different results,'' said manager Bobby Valentine. ``He's a little
more healthy. And he's also changed the grip on his change up which
is giving hitters a different look.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, it hardly looked as if Leiter, who was
signed before the season for $32 million over four years to anchor
the Mets staff, would duplicate his recent good form. After winning
three straight starts - including a three hit, eight strikeout gem
in a 4-3 win over St. Louis last week _ the left hander struggled
with his control early in Wednesday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring the leadoff hitter Luis Castillo, Leiter yielded
singles to Alex Gonzalez and Aven, then walked Kevin Orie to load
the bases. He looked as if he might escape trouble when he fanned
Danny Bautista, but then Preston Wilson squibbed a single over the
outstretched glove of Alfonzo at second base to chase Gonzalez and
Aven home for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets inched back in the third when Cedeno (2-3, 2 runs
scored) led off the inning by putting his quick wheels to work and
dribbled a perfect bunt down the third base line that Orie couldn't
handle.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, he got the jump on Meadows and blitzed down
the base line for his 40th stolen base. After Ordonez laid down a
sacrifice bunt to move Cedeno to third, the Marlins pulled the
infield in for Leiter and dared the .045 hitter to drive one by
them.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need to. Leiter took the count to 1-2 and tomahawked a
chopper over the mound that was fielded by Gonzalez, but not in
time to get Cedeno, and the Mets were down, 2-1. His RBI, followed
by Alfonzo's homer in the fourth cleared the way for Leiter to
befuddle the Marlins hitters with crisp fast balls and fluttering
off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a run scoring single to Gonzalez in the seventh, but
Alfonzo got it back the next inning when he drove Melvin Mora, who
was running for Bonilla, home with his third hit of the night. With
Armando Benitez pitching the eighth and John Franco recording his
18th save in 19 opportunities by pitching the ninth, the Mets
pitching _ starting and relieving _ suddenly looks formidable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It might even get better, for Bobby Jones is expected to come
off the disabled list soon and earlier in the day, the Mets called
up the hard throwing Octavio Dotel from Triple-A Norfolk, where he
was 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   After six years in the minor leagues, Dotel will make his major
league debut Saturday night against the Braves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long, slow climb for the Dominican right-hander,
one that may have ended Wednesday when the Mets decided to send the
struggling Jason Isringhausen back to Class AAA Norfolk, and a new
assignment in the bullpen there, and bring up Dotel in his place.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets may be hoping he is up to stay. In 12 starts with
the Tides, Dotel, 23, had a 3.99 earned run average and was second
in the International League with 84 strikeouts. He brings a
six-year 55-25 record from the minors, and confessed Wednesday that
he thought he might have arrived in the majors sooner. But
Valentine said the slow rise helped the right-hander master command
of four pitches: fastball, curve, slider and change-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He moved up the organizational ladder properly,'' Valentine
said. ``Everything I know about him makes me confident he could be
a successful major league pitcher. He showed he had command of his
pitches. He was consistent. He was striking guys out, but he wasn't
walking a lot of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's here, Dotel said his goal is simple: to stick.
``They think I'm ready, that's why I'm here,'' he said. ``Now I
want to find a way to stay.''

   Lehman Brothers, one of the nation's largest investment banks,
has been censured and fined $100,000 as part of a settlement of
regulatory charges that included an accusation that it failed to
comply with market rules intended to ensure that public investors
get a fair share of hot initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The violations involved $16 million worth of stock sold as part
of four offerings that went to market between April and December
1996, according to NASD Regulation, an arm of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, which announced the settlement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the offering problems, regulators also cited the
firm for violations of rules governing short sales _ which are
sales of borrowed stock by investors who hope to profit on a
subsequent decline in the price _ and on disclosure of sales
charges to mutual fund purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   William Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said the firm would not
comment on any details of the case, which arose in the course of a
routine NASD examination of the firm that began early in 1997.
While Lehman neither denied nor admitted any wrongdoing, it did
submit a letter to NASD regulators indicating that it had improved
its record-keeping procedures to prevent such violations in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Lehman settlement comes amid continuing regulatory concern
about whether big brokerage houses are shortchanging the public by
using scarce shares in hot initial offerings to reward big clients
or attract potential clients, a practice known as spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldsmith, the executive vice president of NASD
Regulation, said that while the Lehman case did not deal directly
with the spinning issue, it reflected the same regulatory premise:
that brokers should make a ``bona fide public distribution'' of hot
initial public offering shares, defined as new issues that trade at
a premium in the market, immediately after they begin trading.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was accused of selling shares to investors who should not
have been allowed to buy, failing to adequately determine whether
other purchasers could legally buy shares, and inaccurately
reporting to regulators the percentage of each of the disputed
offerings that had been sold to public investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Goldsmith, the sanctions against Lehman, higher
than in many typical cases involving offerings-allocation rules,
reflected the large number of shares that were incorrectly handled
_ more than 1.1 million _ and their aggregate market value.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the violations involved shares of Pharmaceutical
Product Development Inc., which went public in April 1996;
Thermoquest Corp., which went to market in May 1996; Rofin-Sinar
Technologies Inc., which was first sold in October 1996, and Memco
Software Ltd., which went public in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to regulators, the short-sale violations occurred on
14 separate days between July 1995 and February 1997 and involved
violations of NASD rules requiring that short sales on a stock that
is declining in price be transacted at a price at least 1/16 higher
than the previous bid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lehman had failed to fully notify customers about
sales charges involved in approximately 4,100 mutual fund
transactions worth about $165 million.

   Norman Hirsh, who supervised the development of the Apache
attack helicopters that were used extensively in the Persian Gulf
War in 1991 and recently in Yugoslavia, died on June 8 at his home
in Coto de Caza, Calif. He was 64 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He died of a heart attack, his wife, Sharon, said.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former engineer and aerospace executive at McDonnell
Douglas Helicopter Co., in Mesa, Ariz. As a vice president and
general manager there, Hirsh also fostered production and sales of
more than 200 Apaches. Using lasers and infrared technology, the
Apaches, unlike other helicopters, are capable of combat operations
at night and in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsh, who was born in the Bronx, N.Y., on April 20, 1935,
graduated from the Bronx High School of Science and earned a
bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering at Purdue University.
He began his engineering career at Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn,
Mich., and in 1958 he moved to California as a design engineer for
General Dynamics in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Hirsh took a job in the aircraft division of Hughes
Tool Co. in Culver City, Calif., specializing in rotocraft. He rose
there from mechanical engineer to deputy program director for
Hughes Helicopters. The company later became part of McDonnell
Douglas Corp., which merged with Boeing Co. in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsh left McDonnell Douglas as an executive vice president in
1990 and then spent three years in Port Angeles, Wash., as
president of Rogerson Hiller Corp. and Rogerson Aircraft Corp.
flight structures group. He retired in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   He served as president, chairman and a fellow of the American
Helicopter Society.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Hirsh is survived by two daughters, Sharon
Margaret Hirsh of Coto de Caza and Lisa Beyrooty of Newport Beach,
Calif.; a son, Richard Scott Hirsh of Studio City, Calif., and
seven grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: A PEACE OVERTURE IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>

   The case of the Kurdish rebel chief, Abdullah Ocalan, confronts
Turkey's leaders with a critical choice. The special state security
court trying Ocalan for treason is expected to hand down its
verdict in the next few days. He has acknowledged most of the
charges against him and his conviction is virtually certain, with a
mandatory penalty of death by hanging. But for weeks Ocalan, whose
15-year campaign of terrorism and violence has resulted in some
30,000 deaths, has been proposing a deal. Spare his life, he says,
and he will work to persuade his militant followers to negotiate a
peaceful solution to the Kurdish revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's offer should be tested. He ought to pay for his crimes.
But lengthy imprisonment, not hanging, is the appropriate
punishment. Ankara should not pass up what could be a rare chance
to end Turkey's most corrosive political problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan says he now believes violence has become a dead end and
that Kurdish rights can best be protected by a democratic Turkish
state. He envisions a peace based on expanded freedom to use the
Kurdish language in schools and broadcasting and says he is ready
to urge his followers to lay down their arms and work peacefully
for such reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Any death sentence issued by the security court must be
successively reviewed by an appeals court, Turkey's Parliament and
President Suleiman Demirel before it can be carried out. Turkish
politicians will be reluctant to spare Ocalan's life because he is
reviled by the non-Kurdish majority. Many Turks also fear that
greater language rights for Kurds could fray national unity. But
the quick execution of Ocalan that some politicians now clamor for
would also strain that unity, and could set off new outbursts of
Kurdish violence in Turkey and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Turkey's harsh response to even nonviolent
Kurdish activism has led to severe human rights abuses. Writers,
journalists and elected officials have been arrested and peaceful
political parties banned. These abuses have made Turkey a pariah in
Europe and set back its ambitions for European Union membership. In
response to Ocalan's violence, the country's armed forces have
devastated Kurdish-inhabited areas of southeastern Turkey, razing
villages and driving tens of thousands of refugees to Ankara and
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan now offers a realistic chance of ending this conflict.
Turkey should spare his life and see whether he can deliver.  &QL;
