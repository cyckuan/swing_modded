<HEADLINE> Two Israeli Soldiers Killed, Three wounded by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed and three others wounded in a guerrilla attack in the
so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon today, sources in
Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia said.
</P>
<P>
They said that the casualties were caused when guerrillas
attacked the Israeli position of Balat in the
1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone, patrolled by SLA militia
backed by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
operation.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, which spearheads a guerrilla warfare against the
Israeli occupation on the Lebanese land, said that one group of
its fighters carried out the attack on the Israeli position,
"causing serious casualties and damages."
</P>
<P>
It added that Israeli forces retaliated for the attack by
firing mortars at the villages of Kifra and Yatir opposite the
Israeli-occupied border strip, without causing civilian
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Today's death of the two Israeli soldiers brought to 27 the
number of the Israeli soldiers killed by Moslem guerrillas in
south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has demanded Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon
with its 35,000-strong forces deployed in this country, to curb
guerrilla activities against Israeli occupation forces in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state vowed that it would launch strikes targeting
guerrillas and Syrian forces in Lebanon if it is attacked by
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas and shellings by
Israeli occupation forces at villages constitute a daily scene
on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish settlements from
cross-board guerrilla attacks.

<P>
AMMAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan received
at the Royal Court here today Qiao Shi, Chairman of the Standing
Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC), promising
that he would visit China soon.
</P>
<P>
While expressing welcome to Qiao, who arrived here earlier
today on a three-day official visit to the kingdom, the king said
that his country attached great importance to the relations with
China in various fields, which were formed on the basis of mutual
respect.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that Jordan would lay stress on continuous
development of the friendly relations and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction at Qiao's current visit, adding that
it would serve as a new stimulus to the Sino-Jordanian ties.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit is a new step and a new stimulus to the bilateral
ties," King Hussein told the NPC chairman.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian monarch added that China was one of the most
important friends of Jordan in the sphere of non-alignment
movement.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the continued cooperation between Jordan and
China would benefit all the peoples in the world.
</P>
<P>
Qiao conveyed to King Hussein regards and best wishes from
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and other leaders, and renewed the
invitation by President Jiang to the king to visit China at an
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein accepted the invitation, saying that he would
visit Beijing soon.
</P>
<P>
Qiao voiced the hope that the Jordanian head of state and
Chinese leaders would exchange views on regional and
international issues of common concern during his forthcoming
visit to China, in view of the great changes that have been
taking place in China, other Asian countries and the Arab world
since 1983 when the king visited China.
</P>
<P>
The future visit by King Hussein to China would greatly
contribute to the development and peace in the Middle East and
the world at large, Qiao said.

<HEADLINE> Aliens warned Not To Replace Dismissed Zimbabwean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) today warned foreigners not to fill the posts left
vacant by the dismissed nurses and junior doctors, saying the
foreigners will do so " at their own risk."
</P>
<P>
ZCTU Secretary General Morgan Tsvangirayi said international
trade unions had been contacted to warn their members against
taking up employment in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
''It will not be tolerated because their coming to Zimbabwe
will undermine the negotiation process of other workers,"
Tsvangirayi said without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has begun advertising the posts left
vacant by nurses and junior doctors who were dismissed by the
government earlier this week for defying orders to return to work
after a work stoppage to press demands for improved working
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare
Nathan Shamuyarira said on Friday the jobs had been advertised in
Britain, South Africa and other African and overseas countries.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's health delivery system was plunged into a
crisis about three weeks ago after nurses, who form the bulk of
the system, went on strike demanding allowance increases. They
were later joined by junior doctors.
</P>
<P>
The government responded to the strike by dismissing the
nurses and junior doctors, leaving the country's major hospitals
to operate only an emergency service.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU has has planned a protest march on midday on Monday,
and the police went on alert on Friday and Saturday and cordoned
off the Africa Unity Square where demonstrators will probably
have a rally.

<HEADLINE> Mandela on S. Africa's Policy on Zairean Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 9 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today pledged to help solve the crisis in Zaire
but stop short of a decision to contribute to the peacekeeping
forces.
</P>
<P>
Mandela made the remarks after meeting with visiting former
Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere today.
</P>
<P>
The South African president said he understood the importance
of forming an African peacekeeping force and the role that South
Africa could play in it.
</P>
<P>
"But, for the time being, the country would not commit itself
to taking steps for military intervention in the Great Lakes
Region," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment we are working in the dark. I have asked him
(Nyerere) to find out what it is they want us to do," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Nyerere stressed the important role
South Africa should play in the formation of an African
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how it could function without South Africa," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The main problem in Zaire, Nyerere said, is that refugees
still stranded in eastern Zaire and should be repatriated back to
Rwanda as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders in the region had called for an immediate
ceasefire, and the establishment of a "safe corridor" for
refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, the most important job is to establish a neutral
African peacekeeping force backed up by the United Nations, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Indigenisation Policy Being Formulated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe government said
today it is making consultations before a comprehensive
indigenisation policy can be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Opening the second annual conference of the Institute of
Administration and Commerce, Minister of State for State
Enterprises and Indigenisation, Cephas Msipa, said the policy was
being drafted.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be a blue-print to give guidance as to how to
implement the indigenisation program which seeks to change
Zimbabwe's economic status quo from mostly white ownership to
black majority ownership.
</P>
<P>
After gaining independence in 1980, Zimbabwe's economy has
over the years been controlled by the minority whites, leaving
the majority blacks either to be workers or owners of small
retail outlets in the suburbs or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"The imbalances in the economy which we inherited from the
previous regimes are unsustainable and unjust in free Zimbabwe,"
said Msipa.
</P>
<P>
"In pushing ahead with indigenisation, due care has to be
taken not to destroy what is already in place as there are other
macro-economic issues like unemployment, balance of payments to
be considered," he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Directors
of the International Monetory Fund, at a meeting in Washington
last Friday, approved Tanzania's Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility (ESAF) loan totalling 240 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Yona said that the first installment of about 40 million
dollars was likely to be released in January next year after

</P>
<P>
"The approval of the ESAF loan means that we (Tanzania) are
now credit worthy, opening doors for donor countries to extend

LISAKA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Easing mineers' fear of losing
jobs, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba said today that his
government will not totally sell all its shares in the Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) when it comes up for
privatization.
</P>
<P>
The president made the statement in his election campaign tour

</P>
<P>
The government can't dispose all its shares as it has to
maintain some interests in the conglomerate which is the backbone
of the country's economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured miners that all the workers's interest will be
taken care of before the mine is privatized. The miners have
expressed their fears that they will lose their jobs and benefits
when ZCCM is privatized.
</P>
<P>
''We can't sell the mines without knowing what will happen to
the miners and their families,'' Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not allow the investors to
retrench miners immediately the mines are sold.
</P>

While touring in Luapula Province, Chiluba said mining has a

<HEADLINE> Yemeni FM Starts Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Abdul Karim Al-Ariyani started
today an official visit to Saudi Arabia, the second in ten days,
apparently to quicken the process of normalization of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) reported from Riyadh, capital of
 Saudi Arabia, that during his stay in the kingdom, Al-Ariyani
would hold talks with Saudi officials aimed at promoting a
solution to the 60-year-old border disputes between the two
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Efforts in the direction of settling the disputes have been
made by both countries in the past two years and some progress
has been attained.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding in
February 1995 directed at alleviating tension along the border
areas and promoting the normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Recent months have seen a flurry of exchange of official
visits and contacts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Before his current tour of Saudi Arabia, Al-Ariyani had held
discussions with Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin
Abdel-Aziz on joint efforts to settle the dispute and promote
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
His visit also comes two days after the exchange of letters
between Nayef and his Yemeni counterpart Hussein Mohammed Arab
concerning security cooperation between Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Last July, the two ministers signed two security agreements,
the first being related to fighting crimes and exchanging
security expertise and the second checking drug traffic.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Works To Bring Israel, Egypt Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
currently working toward strengthening trade relations between
Israel and Egypt by conducting trilateral projects, with
U.S. business people playing a central role, according to a
report published in the latest issue of the bi-weekly Israel
Business today.
</P>
<P>
Edward Walker, U.S. ambassador to Egypt, recently told
members of the Israeli business community that the U.S. is
examining the possibility of establishing a permanent body that
will coordinate links between the U.S.-Egypt Chamber of Commerce
and the U.S.-Israel Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Walker made this comment at a meeting arranged by Walker's
counterpart in Israel, Ambassador Martin Indyk. As part of the
program aimed at cementing ties between Israel and Egypt, Indyk
will play a reciprocal visit to Cairo in the coming weeks, when
he will address a group of Egyptian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The program of trilateral projects was formulated during the
preparatory discussions prior to the Cairo economic conference
which is due to open on November 12.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have been quoted as offering an optimistic view
of Egypt's economic development, with the U.S. eagerness to
nurture Egypt's role as a decisive factor in the region's
economic fortunes.
</P>
<P>
Walker was critical of Israel, saying that the U.S. efforts
to help the Jewish state prepare for the economic conference
would be conducted by the presence of an Israeli ambassador in
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Walker also has some stern words about Egypt, when he
criticized its cold approach to peace with Israel as
"shortsighted," but he did not specify.
</P>
<P>
However, he offered some word of encouragement by explaining
that Egyptian companies are no longer fearful of Israeli
dominance of their economy, and that they are now seeking links
with their Israeli counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Accuses Israel of Violating April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon tonight accused Israel
of violating their April ceasefire understanding by bombardment
at several south Lebanese villages in which one civilian was
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Lebanese National News Agency said that Israeli
forces fired artillery from their positions of Rshafa and
Hmayyed in the so-called "security zone" in south Lebanon at the
village of Yatir and Kifra this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said that Rashid Mussa Gurani, a villager in Yatir, was
wounded in the bombardment when he was working in the field, and
he was hospitalized in Sour.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli artillery also shelled the vicinities of Harit,
Haddatha, Eit Al-Jabal, Mansouri, Wadi Maryamin, Wadi Thirbin,
Zibgin and Jabal Buten, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment was accompanied by heavy machine gun fires
sweeping the villages and reconnaissance flights of Israeli
warplanes at low altitude over the middle sector of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The official agency said that by doing so, the Jewish state
violated the cease-fire understanding reached on April 26, which
put an end to a 17-day Israeli blitz against Moslem guerrillas
in south Lebanon in which some 200 people, mostly civilians,
were killed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding bars the combating parties in
south Lebanon from targeting attacks at civilians or launching
attacks from the civilian areas, but it allows raids on Israeli
troops occupying south Lebanon and gives both sides the right to
self-defense.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombardment followed an attack by guerrillas of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, at an Israeli outpost in
the 1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Israeli client South Lebanon Army militia said
that two Israeli soldiers were killed and three others wounded
in the attack at Blat.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Beirut, Hezbollah said that one
group of its guerrillas launched the attack at 12:10 a.m. (10:10
GMT), in which they used machine guns and anti-tank rockets,
destroying an Israeli Merkava tank.
</P>
<P>
The casualties brought to 27 the number of the Israeli
soldiers killed by Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon this year.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Lebanese Foreign Ministry was
seeking "with deep concern" a solution for the Lebanese families
expelled from the Israeli occupied border strip, the state-run
LNNA reported.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Foreign Ministry informed "big countries,"
especially the United States and France, of the danger of the
Israeli move and raised the problem on the bilateral level.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Leadership Replaces Mladic with Colic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Defense Council of
Bosnian Serb state Republika Srpska on Saturday appointed
Major-General Pero Colic chief of general staff to replace Gen.
Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic signed the decree on the
appointment, Tanjug news agency reported from Pale, the Bosnian
Serb capital on the Sarajevo suburb.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Pale television, Plavsic thanked Gen. Mladic
and all members of the headquarters for "all they have done for
the Serb people during the four-year war."
</P>
<P>
But international opposition to Mladic made it impossible for
him to remain in the post, Plavsic explained.
</P>
<P>
The international tribunal in the Hague has charged Mladic of
war crimes committed during the three-and-half-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The Serb assembly changed the Serb army headquarters, which has
been headed by the Serb army commander Mladic over the past four
and half years, as the general staff on September 12.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Plavisic also dismissed the entire general
staff, including Mladic's deputy, Gen. Milan Gvero and chief of
staff Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic.
</P>
<P>
Major-Gen. Colic was born in 1938 in the village of podglavice,
near the town of Glamoc in Bosnia. He graduated from a military
academy and had been the commander of the Serb 5th Kozara brigade
during the civil war from early 1992 to late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decree also appointed Major-General Dragan Josipovic as
Colic's deputy.
</P>
<P>
Josipovic was born in Banja Luka in 1957. He graduated from a
military academy and had been commander of the Ilijas brigade and
commander of the Romania-Sarajevo Serb infantry brigade.

<HEADLINE> Changes Unlikely in US Mideast Policy: AL Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The new U.S. Administration is
unlikely to overhaul its future Middle East policy, an Arab
League official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Mahmud Abulnassr, director of the Arab League
Office to the United Nations, told the local radio Sawt el-Arab
(Voice of Arabs) that any change in the U.S. policy regarding the
area would depend on coordination between the Republican Party
and Democratic Party on the one hand, and the new Administration
and the Congress on the other.
</P>
<P>
The Republican dominance in the U.S. Congress would diminish
the expectation for stepped-up U.S. enterprise in the Mideast, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League official expressed the hope that the Clinton
Administration would push forward the various tracks of the
Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The resumption of negotiations on the Arab-Israeli tracks is
not, in itself, a target," he said, calling on the U.S, the
European Union and Russia to pressure the Israeli government to
go ahead with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf area and Iraq, the U.S. has prevented
international efforts from lifting sanctions on Iraq and
implementing the "oil for food" agreement between Baghdad and the
U.N..
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. stance against re-nominating
U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term
remains so far unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries have reportedly pinned much hope on Clinton to
force Israel's hardline government to make concessions to the
Arabs after he was free of electoral restraints.
</P>
<P>
Greater U.S. involvement in the Israeli-Palestinian talks
actually began several months ago, after Netanyahu's victory over
the then prime minister Shimon Peres in May.
</P>
<P>
In September, after months of deadlock in negotiations and
Palestinian anger running high, Palestinian police and Israeli
troops engaged in three days of deadly gun battles. Clinton
invited Netanyahu and Arafat to Washington to douse the flames.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the summit, U.S. Mideast peace coordinator
Dennis Ross was dispatched to the region, shuttling for three
weeks between the Gaza City and Jerusalem to try to wrap up a
deal on Hebron, the last West Bank city still under Israeli
control.
</P>
<P>
But an agreement remains elusive. U.S. diplomats lately
suggested that U.S. mediation was not available indefinitely and
that Ross would come back only when he felt there was more in
common.

<HEADLINE> Peace in Middle East Unavoidable, Chinese NPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
praised here today the courage and flexibility Jordan displayed
in making peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
At his talks with Saad Hail el-Sorour, speaker of the Lower
House of Jordan's Parliament, Qiao, who arrived here earlier
today on a three-day official goodwill visit to the kingdom, said
the Arab-Israeli conflict, with its complexity and a long
history, could produce various kinds of difficulties and
challenges on the path of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
China believes that achieving peace and stability in the
Middle East was unavoidable and in the interests of the peoples
in the region and the world at large, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that collective and untiring efforts by all
parties concerned would lead to continuous progress in the
Arab-Israeli talks, which should be based on U.N. resolutions
and the principle of "land-for-peace."
</P>
<P>
He added that a comprehensive and just solution to the Middle
East issue would help promote not only stability and development
in the region, but peace and stability in the world as well.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pledged that China would try its best to work closely
with all parties concerned, including Jordan, to achieve a
comprehensive, just and durable peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and Sorour also discussed bilateral relations in various
fields between the two countries and other regional and
international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Expert Predicts Cooling in US-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli strategic
analyst has predicted an overall cooling in U.S.-Israeli
relations in the next four years of the second Clinton
Administration, reported Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio at the weekend, Professor Bar
Rubin, a senior fellow at the Research Center for Strategic
Studies in the country's Bar-Ilan University, said that there are
three basic categories for the U.S. Middle East policy.
</P>
<P>
He added that the first is the Gulf security and a strong
opposition to Iran and Iraq, maintaining sanctions on those
countries. He noted that this policy will remain 100 percent the
same in the second term of President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The second issue is Israeli-Palestinian peace process and the
U.S. policy in this regard will remain 100 percent the same; and
the third is Israeli-Syrian track and this area is going to be
changed noticeably, noted the analyst.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said that the U.S. and Israeli policies regarding
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are likely to differ and the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations will be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
On whether the U.S. will exert pressure on Israel, Rubin
said, "We are in for a period, that perhaps will start next
spring, in which the warm atmosphere of U.S.-Israeli relations
might become distinctly cooler. I think that there may well be a
lot of verbal criticisms from the U.S. toward the (Prime Minister
Binyamin) Netanyahu government's policy. Thus it will create
tensions on U.S.-Israeli relations."
</P>
<P>
He said that one can assume that the Arabs will act in a way
to "maximize the possibility of the U.S.-Israeli rift."

DAMASCUS, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
Vice-President Manui Marine and the Director General of the
Italian Foreign Ministry Political Affairs Department, Emerdo de
Francis, arrived here this evening for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
In press statements he made on his arrival, Marine affirmed

process, and that it has appointed an envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
The EU is seeking a greater and more effective role in the
peace process due to its strategic, security and economic
interests in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Troika delegation consisting of officials from Italy,
Holland and Ireland will be warmly welcomed by Arab states, which
want more active EU efforts in the peace march to achieve balance
against the Israeli-biased U.S. role, some observers here noted.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries welcomed the European Commission's
nomination of Spanish Ambassador to Israel Michael Angel
Moratinus as a special envoy to the region, according to the
Marine's press statements available here.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy, Marine added, will start his mission within a

<HEADLINE> One Israeli Soldier Killed in South Lebanon: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 9 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was
killed in a clash with Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon
today, reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened this afternoon when Hezbollah guerrilla
fighters opened fire with anti-tank missiles, mortar shells and
light arms at an Israeli army post and South Lebanon Army forces
in the eastern sector of the Israeli self-declared "security
zone."
</P>
<P>
A missile hit an Israeli tank killing the 19-year-old
soldier. Three other soldiers were also wounded, one of them
seriously, in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese guerrilla group claimed responsibility for the
attack.
</P>
<P>
However, sources in Israel's client South Lebanon Army militia
said two Israeli soldiers were killed and three others wounded in
a guerrilla attack in the so-called "security zone" in south
Lebanon today,.
</P>
<P>
They said that the casualties were caused when guerrillas
attacked the Israeli position of Balat in the
1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone, patrolled by SLA militia
backed by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and-run attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas and shellings by
Israeli occupation forces at villages constitute a daily scene
on the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the "security zone" in south Lebanon in
1985 as a buffer to shield its northern Jewish settlements from
cross-board guerrilla attacks.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik, Bildt Meet on Bosnian Council of Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Serb member of Bosnia's
three-men presidency Momcilo Krajisnik held talks Saturday with
the international community High Representative Carl Bildt to
discuss setting up a council of ministers of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, which was held in Serb capital Pale,
Krajisnik told reporters that a position had been coordinated on
this issue, and he was sure Bildt would convey the Serb position
to the other two presidency members -- Kresimir Zubak (Croat) and
presidency President Alija Izetbegovic (Muslim).
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik did not disclose the details about the Serb position
but said he hoped that the other two members would agree with the
Serb view and that the presidency would set up a council of
ministers at its next session in Sarajevo's national museum on
Tuesday, Tanjug news agency reported from Pale.
</P>
<P>
Over the last two sessions, the three-men presidency had failed
to reach any agreement on the composition of the future council.
But reports said a Serb would become the new prime minister and a
Croat the foreign minister of the unified Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik added, however, that he did not believe that this
would automatically solve all other problems.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Bosnian Serb president Biljana Plavsic met
with SCE Bosnia mission chief Robert Frowick in Pale to discuss
municipal election in Bosnia, which has been postponed until next
spring.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Plavsic told the press that they had
discussed the OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe) role in the future elections, which the Serb side had
never questioned, according to Tanjug reports.
</P>
<P>
Frowick, for his part, said he had wished to exchange views on
the matter of municipal elections, and hoped that agreement would
be reached about the OSCE's monitoring of the elections.
</P>
<P>
OSCE is charged by the international community to organize and
monitor the elections in Bosnia. It has successfully helped
organize the September 14 elections which elected the Bosnian
presidency and the parliaments of the two entities in the country.

WASHINGTON, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering the role its forces might play as part of security
component for a humanitarian intervention in Zaire, a U.S.
official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are actively studying what type of security component would
be necessary for an intervention. We are also actively studying
what role the U.S. might play as part of such a security
component," the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States is studying the role as there is an
"emerging international consensus" that humanitarian intervention
will be necessary to address the crisis in eastern Zaire, which
requires a security component.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, the United Nations Security Council called
on U.N. members to pay the groundwork for a multinational force to
help end the crisis in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
More than a million refugees, most of them Rwandan Tutus, fled
recent fighting between the Zairian army and Zairian ethnic
Tutsis, who are backed by the Rwandan Tutsi government.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday that
the United States was reviewing a variety of proposals to deal
with the crisis with other nations in Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Burns said however that the United States has not yet made a
decision on whether it can and will participate in such a force.

<HEADLINE> China Expands World Cooperation in Oil Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is holding talks
with Iraq to sign massive oil exploration contracts with the
Middle East country.
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corporation is negotiating with Iraq
on the signing of a five-million-tons a year oil production
contract.
</P>
<P>
Also under discussion is the possibility of helping Iraq set up
another oilfield, with a annual capacity of 15 million-tons,
officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China and Russia have agreed to jointly explore
natural gas resources in Siberia, by laying a oil pipe from
Siberia to China.
</P>
<P>
China is pluralizing its cooperation with foreign countries on
the development of its petroleum industry, by taking part in
overseas oil drilling, opening own off-shore oil installations
with foreign help, and importing more oil products.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials and experts from the
petroleum industry, China has been participating in oil drilling
and inspections in a number of foreign countries, including Peru,
Thailand, Canada, Sudan and Papua New Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Chinese oil drillers have contested many international oil
tenders involving big projects, such as those in Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
Experts say China plans to import more oil products, as part
of its efforts to expand its foreign ties in the sector, though
the country's domestic oil demand will be satisfied by its own
products.
</P>
<P>
As high water-content has made it increasingly difficult to
maintain high-yields in the country's land oilfields, China is
pinning high hopes on its cooperation with foreign companies in
developing oilfields in off-shore areas and three basins in
northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China's off-shore oil output is
expected to hit 14 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign drillers have also been involved in oil exploitation in
some old land oilfields in China, including Daqing Oilfield, the
largest of its kind in the country, and Liaohe Oilfield, both in
Northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The proven explorable oil reserve in China is not as high as
its theoretical oil reserve, which amounts to dozens of
billion tons.
</P>
<P>
However, Li Xunli, an official from the State Planning
Commission, holds that there is no problem for the country to be
self sufficient in oil by relying on its own resources until
2010.

Some local economists say that along with the progress made by
China in the internationalization of its economy, the country should
try to develop its energy production and utilization, in line with
the international energy market, in a bid to share quality energy
resources with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Economists suggest that the country should take a pluralized
road in energy production and supply, gradually readjusting
its energy development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Conducting exchanges with foreign countries will also be
helpful in improving the country's technological, administrative,
investment, commercial and competitive capabilities in the
industry, they hold.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the government has emphasized the utilization
of resources and markets, domestically and internationally, to
maintain a sustained economic development and to link up with the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
China has strengthened its cooperation with Persian Gulf
countries such as Saudi Arabia, Amen, Qatar and Kuwait, with
ministers in charge of oil or energy industries from those
countries paying visits to China for discussions on investments
and other kinds of cooperation in exploitation of oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Some local analysts note that there are good opportunities for
China to compete with other countries on oil and gas exploitation
markets in countries which have worked out multi-billion programs
to set up new oil-fields, renovating existing oilfields and oil
refineries.
</P>
<P>
The analysts suggest China signs long-term purchase contracts
with those countries when they get the chance to increase their
oil production.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Saudi Arabia has agreed to
cooperate with China in setting up oil refineries in East China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China Petroleum Corporation and Kuwait have signed a

<HEADLINE> Martin, Fung Win Hong Kong Badminton Open Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Third-seeded Fung Permadi
of Chinese Taipei and Denmark's second seed Camilla Martin
defeated their opponents in the finals to win the men's and
women's singles titles at the 1996 Hong Kong Badminton Open
Championships here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian-born Fung, 29, defeated unseeded Indonesian
Salim 15-12, 15-10. Salim upset third-seeded Dane Thomas
Stuer-Lauridsen 15-11, 15-10 Saturday to qualify for the final.
</P>
<P>
Fung moved to Taiwan two years ago for a better chance for his
career and has been playing for the Taiwan Cooperative Bank. The
winner of the recent China Open in Dongguan, South China, said he
felt better there as the tournament drew more top-level players.
</P>
<P>
"We'll try to extend our contract with him after the current
contract expires next spring," said Yeh Kuo-Huei, manager of the
Chinese Taipei team.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Fung will act as a playing coach in the future so
as to bring up more players for the team.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked eighth in the world, scored a comparatively easy
11-8, 11-6 victory over the 17-year-old Indonesian sensation.
</P>
<P>
She owed much of her victory to the numerous unforced errors
made by her opponent.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't use any special tactics today. I just played my
normal game," she added.
</P>
<P>
"I've played so many tournaments since the Olympic Games, and
I really felt very tired today," admitted Audina. "And the
injuries on my body did affect my performance today."
</P>
<P>
But she still planed to compete in the coming Thai Open, the
Grand Prix Finals and perhaps the World Cup later this year.
</P>
<P>
Men's doubles top seeds Antonius and Deny Kantono beat
second-seeded Malaysians Yap Kim Hock and Cheah Soon Kit 15-6,
15-3 for the title.
</P>
<P>
Top-seeded Danes Marlene Thomsen and Lisbet Stuer-Lauridsen in
the women's doubles downed second-seeded Indonesians Indarti
Isolina and Deyana Lomban 15-9, 15-12 to win the crown.
</P>
<P>
The mixed doubles title went to second-seeded Michael Sogaard
and Rikke Olsen who downed fifth seeds Ericksen and Mariene
Thomsen 15-8, 15-11.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Economy Conducive to Regional Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that the Egyptian economy with its distinct
characteristics would largely contribute to stability in the
Mideast region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Egyptian-Asian seminar on investment and trade,
 he said that Egypt's economy is active, "so that it can pursue
the path of the `economic tigers' in East Asia."
</P>
<P>
Briefing the delegates on the Egyptian economic reform, he
said the process continues with a view to having the private
sector steer the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian economy, with its own characteristics, is
largely considered an economy with the widest horizons in the
Middle East and with the ability to bring about stability in the
region," said the top Egyptian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Though the situation in the region does not augur well, the
crisis could be eventually fought off, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of those crises we will overcome them in order that
a just, overall and balanced peace will be achieved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa anticipated that peace would prevail and problems be
solved in a way acceptable to all peoples of the area and within
the framework of international legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said stability is gradually phasing in and paving the
way for investment, trade, economic cooperation and subsequently
the cherished economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Such seminars like today's would serve as an expanded stage
for south-south and north-south cooperation, especially in the
investment, trade, tourism and environment domains, he concluded.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of International Cooperation Nawal el-Tatawi
also addressed the symposium, attended by 350 prominent Asian
officials and the Asian ambassadors accredited to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
A total of 170 businessmen from Thailand, Pakistan, Indonesia,
India, China, Japan and South Korea besides some Egyptian
businessmen also took part.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation to the forthcoming Cairo Economic
Conference attended the symposium today.

<P>
The 45-member delegation, headed by Vice-Minister of Foreign
Trade and Cooperation Liu Shanzai, includes 15 ranking officials
and 30 businessmen who represent 20 companies.

<HEADLINE> China to Become World's Number One Fur Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to become
the world's top fur market in the coming three years, the world's
largest fur marketing company has predicted.
</P>
<P>
The forecast has been made by Saga Furs of Scandinavia, a
company jointly formed by fur breeders' associations in Denmark,
Finland, Norway and Sweden in 1954.
</P>
<P>
Saga says it intends to strengthen cooperation with China in
the fur industry to help China develop the industry, and enlarge
its fur market, according to L. Boe Hansen, president of Saga.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking during a fur fashion show held by Saga in
Beijing. It was the largest fashion show of its kind that Saga has
ever held in Asia, and celebrated the 10th anniversary of the
first Saga fashion show in China in 1986.
</P>
<P>
At the gala evening, Saga presented collections designed by
international top fashion designers, from Italy, France, Japan,
and the US, including Gianfranco Ferre, Louis Feraud, Nina Ricci,
and Lecoanet Hemant.
</P>
<P>
China's fur industry has now increased its export products,
instead of mainly serving the domestic market, making China an
important production source for the global fur market, said Hansen.
</P>
<P>
Saga will join with Nordic fur auction companies to hold a
range of seminars for designers from the Chinese fur, leather and
textile industries, to help improve the country's fur industry.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Denmark, Saga has won a worldwide market
share of 68 percent of farm-produced mink, and 86 percent of
farmed fox skins. It began to establish contact with Chinese
organizations and fur factories as early as 1978.

<HEADLINE> Public Order of Chinese Colleges Turning Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- University and college
campuses in China have become safer for students after a
nationwide drive.
</P>
<P>
Public order on the college campuses has notably turned for the
better, the Central Committee for Comprehensive Management for
Public Security has reported.
</P>
<P>
The improvement has also spread to areas surrounding colleges
and universities.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, more than 400 criminal
cases threatening public security at colleges in nine cities or
provinces have been cracked over the past two months. A total of
760 suspects were seized during the crack down.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, eight criminal cases on college campuses, and four
cases related to colleges have been dealt with.
</P>
<P>
In south China's Guangdong Province, 23 criminal cases and 25
other cases affecting college security have been cracked.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, police arrested a hooligan who for years had
molested girl students in the East China Normal University, by
disguising himself as a woman.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, security departments have focused on
checks of recreational places, commercial stands, as well as
stalls selling books, discs and other goods.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has focussed on 72 spots with security problems in
colleges, as well as 214 sales stalls, 136 companies, 37 food
outlets, eight dance halls, video game halls and entertainment
halls. Over 6,400 outsiders were ordered away from campus areas,
and 450 other people were told to leave campuses.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong's public security, educational, industry and commerce
management, and cultural departments have waged 85 campaigns in
colleges, uncovered 162 rooms leased to outsiders, pulled down 767
makeshift shelters built without authority, 290 unlicensed
commercial stalls, 10 dance halls, and discovered 500 unauthorised
people on campuses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past months, many local governments have formed
leading groups to deal with problems in the areas surrounding
colleges.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has cleared away more than 500 stalls from around
Tianjin University and Nankai University.
</P>
<P>
Changsha, capital of central China's Hunan Province, has closed

meters of campus boundary walls.
</P>
<P>
In Nanning, capital of southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, police launched sudden swoops on seven roads
around Guangxi University. They forced the closure of 102 illegal
cultural and recreational places, and seized 4,000 pornographic
books and magazines.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese lawmaker today
called for strengthened enforcement of agricultural laws to help
guarantee the healthy development of agriculture and the rural
economy.
</P>
<P>
Buhe, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, made the call at a meeting in Hefei, capital of east
China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Buhe toured Fuyang, Bengbu, Fengyang and other places

not strictly implemented, and many cases against the laws have not
been dealt with seriously.
</P>
<P>
"Agricultural laws are related to the development of the national
economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Officials at all levels should attach great importance to the
enforcement of agricultural laws."
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC Standing Committee has made 10 laws
governing agriculture, and various areas should work out more
specific rules to implement them.
</P>

dealing with agricultural cases in an effort to protect the legal
rights of farmers.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Wants Closer Economic Links With France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China has told France that it
wants the two countries to have a closer economic cooperation
including the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua said today in Beijing that
China wishes to step up its cooperative relations with friendly
countries including France, on the principles of equality, mutual
benefit, long-term cooperation and mutual development.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement this afternoon during a meeting with
French Minister of Industry, Post and Telecommunications Frank
Borotra.
</P>
<P>
Zou said that China and France enjoy good relations in economic
cooperation, with mutual trust established in many areas such as
energy, nuclear power and aviation. He believes Borotra's current
visit will help push forward economic cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Borotra noted that there has been friendly relations between
France and China. He said France wishes to promote its political
relationship of mutual respect and trust with China, and on the
basis of this, develop more economic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier spoke highly of France's independent
foreign policy. Meanwhile, he agreed with Borotra over France's
stand of long-term and comprehensive cooperation with China in the
area of nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zou briefed the minister on China's plan
for energy development blue-printed in the ninth five-year-plan
for national economic and social development and the long-term
objectives up to the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier also exchanged views with Borotra on possible
ways by which China and France will increase their cooperation in
nuclear power, as well as measures involved in environmental
protection.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Big Business Time in Doubt at MENA Three (I) (by Hou Jia) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Puting political loggerheads
aside, Egypt is managing to concentrate on business with
Israel. But it is in doubt that the Cairo conference will succeed
where 17 years of normalization and two economic conferences have
failed.
</P>
<P>
After years of cold peace, Egyptian-Israeli economic ties
remain limited in scope. Take-off for limited cooperation did not
ensue after Egypt spearheaded the Arab-Israeli reconciliation in
1979 and signed a peace treaty with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The hopes appeared to have been dashed when the implementation
of the Palestinian-Israeli peace accords grounded to a halt
following Binyamin Netanyahu's rise to power in June.
</P>
<P>
In fact, apart from agriculture, tourism and Egyptian oil
exports to Israel, bilateral economic cooperation has been
negligible.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Israeli trade, which stood at 16 million U.S. dollars
in 1981, rose to modest 77 million dollars in 1995. Of which Egyptian
oil exports to Israel alone account for 20-30 percent annully.
</P>
<P>
Though a trade protocol signed by the two countries in May 1980
provides for the application of most favored nation status,
the facilitation of trade itself was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the frustrations, Egypt seems geared up to play the
role of a pioneer and cornerstone of the Middle East peace process
as well as a regional gateway for multinational investment.
</P>
<P>
The mentality is well reflected in the 188 Egyptian projects
presented to the third Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference for partnerships, valued at 33.5 billion Egyptian
pounds (about 10 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 100 projects to be proposed by Israel are old
ones, whose implementation was allegedly "delayed by the lack of
readiness on the Arab side," Lior Ben Dor, Press Attache at the
Israeli Embassy, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Israeli cooperation on tourism, agriculture and
infrastructure will figure high on the MENA agenda, including a
number of joint ventures which were discussed at previous
conferences in Casablanca and Amman, but so far left
untended.

<P>
The final countdown of the conference is ticking to the end,
but many Egyptian businessmen still argued that Israel could take
advantage of the Egyptian labor and resources and have the lion's
share of any deal with the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of Egypt's General Federation of Trade
Unions, business between the two countries has been moving at a
snail's pace because Egyptians have not reacted positively to
Israeli products.
</P>
<P>
"Many traders fear importing Israeli goods since they know that
the goods will rot on the shelves before they find a buyer," said
a member of the federation.
</P>
<P>
It seems when Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told
reporters Saturday that regional cooperation should be based on
peace and not otherwise, he barely balanced it with his definition
of the MENA Three as a conference for business and of Israel as an
equal "normal" partner for the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
In fact, some Egyptian businessmen have decided to stay away
from the Cairo conference as a result of Netanyahu's hardline
policy and the stalemate in the peace process. Even among those
that do attend, anti-normalization sentiments are running high as
a result of the latest Israeli killings in the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
"(That) We are attending does not mean that we will agree to
each and every project proposed at the meeting, if it conflicts
with our national interests, irrespective of how profitable it
is," said one businessman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many Israeli businessmen and several cabinet
ministers responded by deciding to boycott the conference.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Israeli representation is impressive. The 50
from governmental institutions and an equal number of businessmen
from the private sector nearly double its former representations.
</P>
<P>
Thus it is expected that when the conference goes into full
swing, the interplay of market forces will take control.
</P>
<P>
On the other side of the coin, some businessmen think MENA
Three will offer Egyptians a chance to meet their Arab and
European counterparts.
</P>
<P>
So far, 3,500 people, including government officials, private
businessmen and journalists, have confirmed their participation in
the MENA Three.

<HEADLINE> Work of Soong Ching Ling Foundation Fruitful (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Chinese children
have been helped by a foundation, established in memory of one of
the country's well-known patriots.
</P>
<P>
Fruitful results have been made by the Soong Ching Ling
Foundation in conducting exchanges with foreign countries,
implementing a plan to help children go to school, and launching
an anti-smoking drive among youngsters over the past four years.
</P>
<P>
This evaluation was made at the third council meeting held by
the Soong Ching Ling Foundation today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The late Honorary Chinese President Soong Ching Ling was
a great international fighter and forerunner of the world peace
and progressive cause of mankind. Her foundation was set up in
1982.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reviewed the work since the second council meeting
in 1992, and put forward its future plans, defining that the
foundation's third council will be in the service of realizing the
country's Ninth-Five Year Plan and a grand goal in 2010, by
holding high the banner of patriotism.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren sent a letter of
congratulations to the meeting. He spoke highly of the Soong Ching
Ling Foundation's work, and expressed the hope that it will make
continued efforts to contribute to world peace and the country's
progress.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a working report at the meeting, Liu Qilin,
vice-president of the foundation, said that the foundation has
played host to nearly 3,000 visitors from more than 20 countries,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
It has also conducted cooperation with Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
in the fields of education and publications, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, Liu said the foundation has given assistance to the
poverty-stricken areas in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region to
build 10 primary schools. A total of more than 30,000 pupils have
benefitted from the aid.

CHANGSHA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Service sector industries
have provided work for over four million people in Central China's
Hunan Province over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The province has witnessed a fast growth in its tertiary
industry, with the service sector share reaching over 31 per cent

During the past five years, the industry absorbed more than
three million new laborers, and another one million people laid
off from other sectors.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial government's plan, in the next five
years, the tertiary industry will maintain a growth rate no lower
than 11 per cent, and its turnover will account for 34 per cent of
the province's GDP.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iran Welcomes Visit by Chinese NPC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today welcomed the
forthcoming visit by Qiao Shi, Chairman of the Standing Committee
of China's National People's Congress (NPC), claiming it as an
important event of the Sino-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference here that the visit by the Chinese NPC chairman
to his country is "a strong indication of existing good relations
between Iran and China."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question raised by Xinhua, he said: "We have
promoted our relations in different fields. We have very
progressive and comprehensive relations between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
Heading a high-level delegation, Qiao Shi is scheduled to pay
his official visit to Iran from November 12 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Velayati said, "Receiving the high-ranking official from China
is an important sign for the very strengthened and promoted
relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"China and Iran have had long history of friendly relations.
Both countries belong to Asian countries. We have exchanged a lot
of visits by delegations between the two sides and we have many
commonalities," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Mohammad Javad Larijani,
Vice-Chairman of the Iranian Parliament's Foreign Policy Commission,
told Xinhua today that the upcoming visit by the Chinese NPC
Chairman to Iran is "a very important event for different reasons."
</P>
<P>
He said that it would be a very high-level contact and
discussion between the two parliaments, which have played an
important role in creating the relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that China and Iran have maintained historic, very
consolidated, deep-rooted and strategic relations, which are very
promising for the future in the region.
</P>
<P>
"My vision of the Asian role in the next century's
international affairs is that Asia is going to play a very
important international role not only economically but also
politically as well. China is a very important element in
that role," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has seen a very rapid change in China not
only in the economic but also in social, scientific and other
fields as well. "As an observer, I can say that there is
difference in every six months (in China)."
</P>
<P>
In economic cooperation, China and Iran have reached
agreements on 45 projects with a total contracted value of 2.6
billion U.S. dollars, including the Tehran subway construction
and some power projects.
</P>
<P>
A Chinese trade official said that the volume of the import
and export between the two countries is expected to reach 700
million dollars this year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis beat Brenda
Schultz-McCarthy 7-6 (7-5), 6-3 at the Bank of the West semifinals
Saturday to take on Monica Seles in the final match in Oakland,
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old Swiss girl, who will rise to No. 6 in next
week's rankings, set up a Sunday final meet with top-seed Seles,
who exploited Irina Spirlea to post an easy 6-3, 6-3 victory in
her semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Hingis is now 15-2 since losing to Steffi Graf in the U.S. Open
semifinals. Both losses were against Jana Novotna.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who last week was upset by Jennifer Capriati in the
semifinals at Chicago, was in control against Spirlea.
</P>
<P>
Win or lose, Seles has earned enough points to rejoin rival
Graf, who took the week off, at the top of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Seles, 22, took command early against Spirlea, winning the
first eight points of the match and never looking back.
</P>
<P>
Now that she's in the finals, Seles is a good bet to win her
third open title here, where she has a 14-1 career record her only
loss was to Martina Navratilova in the 1991 finals. She beat
Navratilova in Oakland finals in 1990 and 1992.

components in Xi'an, with an investment of 25 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The biggest bunch of contracts was signed on November 7, when
AVIC president Zhu Yuli signed his name on four other contracts
with AlliedSignal, British company Rolls Royce, and its joint
venture with BMW of Germany - BMW Rolls Royce. The contracts
involve projects for co-production of aviation equipment,
co-development of aircraft engine systems and project management.
</P>
<P>
As the main forces competing for a share of China's commercial
airplane market, Boeing, as a market leader in the country, again
vowed to continue its long-standing cooperation with China;
McDonnell Douglas voiced the hope that its successful
co-production projects with Chinese manufactures will help
maintain its status as one of the major commercial jets suppliers
to China; while Europe's consortium Airbus Industrie reiterated
its goal to hold half of the Chinese market with its Airbus
jetliners in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
The Russian delegation, headed by Russia's minister of defense
industry and its ambassador to China, and composed of business
people from 39 companies, was the biggest foreign entourage at the
show.
</P>
<P>
The Russians displayed their newest products, including Tu204
passenger jet, Mig and Su fighters.
</P>
<P>
Zinovy Pak, Russian Minister of Defense Industry, said
Sino-Russian cooperation had many advantages over that between
China and Western countries, especially projects in fields like
development of military and commercial planes, human-born space
flights, and satellite application technologies.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the Russian and the Chinese sides had signed
hundreds of contracts during the show.
</P>
<P>
"China's aviation and aerospace market, one with the greatest
potentials in the world, has attracted us to Zhuhai," said Yuri
Sapozhnikov from Lepse Electric Machine Building Works in Kirov.
</P>
<P>
"We were more charmed by this market when we found at the show
that the potentials are turning into reality."
</P>
<P>
Sapozhnikov said his plant had signed four contracts with
Chinese partners, something "we didn't expect before we came to
China."

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A car explosion killed at least
12 people and wounded 20 this morning in the Algerian capital
Algiers, the Agence France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack, on a coach in the eastern district of Birkhadem of
the capital, was believed to be launched by Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
The coach, carrying dozens of workers of a state-owned company,
was destroyed by the bomb, placed in a car parked several meters
away from the coach, AFP quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic extremists increased their attacks since the
announcement last month by Algerian President Liamine Zeroual of a
November 28 referendum on constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 Algerian figures made an appeal today to the president
to give up the constitutional reform plan, which they said could
only aggravate extremism and violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed in violence since 1992,
when the Algerian army deprived the Islamic Salvation Front from a
parliamentary election victory.

</P>
<P>
But seismologists are assuring people in coastal towns and

</P>
<P>
There was little influence in Shanghai or its surrounding
areas, according to Tang Quan, press spokesman at China's State

</P>
<P>
Tang, also deputy director of the CSSB, said this morning that
a strong earthquake measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale rocked the
south Yellow Sea at 21:56 (Beijing Time) yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake slightly shook Shanghai and a number of cities
in east China's provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China's farming industry must
continue to be given top priority after this year's bumper
harvest, Jiang Chunyun, Chinese vice premier and member of
political bureau of Communist Party of China Central Committee,
said today.
</P>
<P>
He has urged the country to carry on with a comprehensive
survey on any new problems that occurred after this year's bumper

</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Wu Guanzheng, party secretary of Jiangxi, and
Governor Shu Shenyou, the vice premier visited villages in
Nanchang, Yichun and Jiujiang, and exchanged opinions with
hundreds of local officials and farmers.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's emphasis on agriculture will not
falter after the bumper harvest. Governments at all levels should
continue to bless the agricultural sector with a top priority in
local economies, and all preferential policies should be carried
out to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's purchase of farm produce, and
readjustment in agriculture, should be guaranteed, and water
conservancy facilities and other production conditions should be
improved, according to Jiang.
</P>

wiped out in rural areas in order to lighten the finance burden on
farmers.

</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Senate Speaker Ahmed
Al Lawzi lauded the visit to Jordan by Qiao Shi, Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China
(NPC), describing it as a new symbol of the development of
bilateral ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Qiao who arrived here Saturday on a
three-day official visit to the kingdom, Lawzi praised the
Sino-Jordanian relations as "strategic," noting that scopes of
bilateral cooperation are "very wide" ranging from politics,
economy and trade to science and technology and culture.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said China had watched closely the situation in the
Middle East in the past decades.
</P>
<P>
He expressed satisfaction and appreciation of Jordan's pivotal
and special role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Beijing's longstanding position toward the peace
 process, saying that China always stands by Arab countries
especially the Palestines and expresses support for moving ahead
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On whether China would be a next superpower, Qiao recalled the
address that Deng Xiaoping delivered at the U. N. General
Assembly 22 years ago. Qiao quoted Deng as saying that "China
will never be a superpower."
</P>
<P>
The NPC chairman told Lawzi that China had upheld the
principle in the past and would adhere to it in the future.
</P>
<P>
Qiao and Lawzi also discussed the friendly cooperation in the
various fields between Jordan and China, between China's NPC and

<HEADLINE> Booming Chinese Market Attracts Aerospace Giants (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China's aviation industry was
flying high today after landing two billion US dollars worth of
contracts during the country's first ever air show.
</P>
<P>
The country will need hundreds of new jetliners over the next
two decades as air travel in 21st century China will reach
sky-high levels, along with more airports.
</P>
<P>
The aero industry in China is experiencing unprecedented
growth, and has become a market of great potentials.
</P>
<P>
The comment was made by John F. McDonnell, chairman of US-based
McDonnell Douglas, when he visited the '96 China International
Aviation and Aerospace Exhibition. His views well represent the
general impression of all those who attended the air show, which
closed today in the south China city of Zhuhai.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day event, China's aviation and air transport
industries signed about two billion US dollars worth of
co-production and purchase contracts with foreign partners, which
included industrial giants such as AlliedSignal, CFM International
and United Technologies Company.
</P>
<P>
Taking the air show as a good chance to promote their products,
leading aircraft manufacturers sponsored press conferences and
flight demonstrations one after the other at the show.
</P>
<P>
McDonnell Douglas displayed an MD-90 passenger jet, the newest
type under co-production with Chinese manufacturers. An A340, the
biggest of the Airbus family, was brought to Zhuhai, and then set
off on a non-stop flight from the city to New York to set a new
world record; and the Russians made breath-taking flight
demonstrations with their Su-27 and Su-30 fighters.
</P>
<P>
All the industrial giants were fully prepared before they
arrived at Zhuhai to snatch a share of China's huge aviation and
space markets, commented John Bailey, general manager of Message
Management Ltd, a company mainly engaged in public relations
affairs for some of the world's major aviation and aerospace
businesses.
</P>
<P>
His remark was confirmed by official figures published during
the show:
</P>
<P>
-- China is to spend 140 billion US dollars in the next two
decades to import more than 1,300 passenger jets. Around 250 of
them will be brought in over the next five years;
</P>
<P>
-- China's demand for helicopters around the year 2,000 is
estimated at 200 to 300;
</P>
<P>
-- China is to focus on the construction of 41 major airports,
as well as renovating and expanding 100 more;
</P>
<P>
-- the 1.7 billion US dollars 100-seater program in which China
plays a leading role is to start next year, with production of
close to 1,000 passenger jets projected over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Faced with such alluring market prospects, foreign businesses
have expanded operations, set up new offices in China, and signed
more contracts and agreements with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
Just before the exhibition, AlliedSignal Aerospace of the US
announced the establishment of AlliedSignal China Limited in
Shanghai, and the plan to boost its investment in China from the
present 150 million US dollars to 200 million in five years.

<HEADLINE> hke- Zairean Tutsis Accuse Rivals of Using Refugees as Human Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Banyamulenge Tutsis
today accused Zairean government troops and Rwandan Hutu
extremists of using thousands of refugees as their human shields,
the Agence France Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuel Kamanzi and Octave Nkwaya, both members of the
Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire
(ADFLCZ), said that Tutsi soldiers did not shoot back Saturday
when Zairean troops bombarded Goma from the hills west of the city.
</P>
<P>
One young woman was killed and another wounded Saturday when
Goma came under artillery fires from Zairean troops, who are
reportedly preparing to attack Goma and other towns in the Kivu
region taken by the ADFLCZ in the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Zairean troops, backed by former Rwandan Hutu military men and
militias, are still holding some pockets of resistance in the Kivu
region in eastern Zaire, while some 400,000 refugees are staying
in the hills infiltrated by armed Hutu extremists.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France today again called on the United Nations
Security Council to send a multinational force to eastern Zaire
without delay.
</P>
<P>
"We are moving toward the biggest human catastrophe which will
ever take place," said French State Secretary for Emergency
Humanitarian Actions Xavier Emmanuelli.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has not yet given its green light for
the dispatch of an intervention force to eastern Zaire, although
it agreed in principle to the need of deploying such a force.
</P>
<P>
Reports from eastern Zaire said that the refugees are dying in
the thousands in a small bay beside the Lake Kivu, 27 kilometers
west of Goma, because of hunger, thirst, and epidemic diseases.
</P>
<P>
The French state secretary also rejected a proposal by former
French minister of cooperation Bernard Debre that a Hutuland be
set up between Zaire, Rwanda and Burundi as a solution once and
for all to the ethnic crisis in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Emmanuelli said that if the border between these countries was
changed, a Pandora's Box would be opened "with inestimable
consequences" on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The Charter of the Organization of African Unity describes the
borders between African countries inherited from the colonial
times as "sacred."

the country's telecom industry.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in Beijing during a meeting with the
chairman of Canada's Nortel, the Northern Telecom Corporation,
Donald Schuenke. The chairman is currently in Beijing to attend
Nortel's international consultants' committee meeting, along with
other representatives, including former US Secretary of Defense
Frank Carlucci, and Sir Anthony Pilkington, chairman of Britain's
glass makers Pilkington.
</P>
<P>
Zou said there has been good cooperative relations between
Nortel and China. Nortel holding its international consultants'
committee meeting in Beijing, the first time the event has
been held in China, will help the company in its understanding of
China, and promote Nortel's economic and technological cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
Recalling China's economic development since 1949, the vice
premier concluded that China is now moving ahead in a positive
direction for development. Telecommunications, he said, as an
important factor in economic development, promises great
potential for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
China welcomes foreign companies, including Nortel to
participate in the country's telecom development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tough competition exists in China's telecom industry, Zou
noted, adding that the key to increased market share lies in
quality and price.
</P>
<P>
Nortel is a major Canadian multi-national company, which has so
far invested over 6.5 million US dollars in China. It is reported
that Nortel plans to increase its investment in China in
telecommunications, micro-electronics and other areas in the next
few years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Receiving Letter from Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran today denied receiving a
letter from the United States, which threatened to take actions
if Tehran continued to support international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said at a press
conference that "we have not received the letter from the United
States. They (the U.S.) know the limit and nobody can threaten
us."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian press reported that the U.S. has sent a
letter to the Iranian government threatening to take actions if
Iran continued what it called Iran's "support for terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language daily Kayhan International quoted a
source from the Foreign Ministry as saying that the
U.S. Administration had sent the letter to the Iranian government
via the Swiss Embassy in Tehran which is looking after the
American interests.
</P>
<P>
The source said the letter has not specified what actions
Washington may take if Iran ignores the American warning.
</P>
<P>
However, another source from the ministry confirmed receiving
the letter by the Islamic republic, saying that "there
is nothing new in the letter and I don't interpret the content
of the letter as threatening."
</P>
<P>
Velayati said: "We know how to deal with Americans if they
threaten us. We will give them crashing guns."
</P>
<P>
On the Iranian-U.S. relations, he said that there is no
difference between the Democrats and Republicans. So, it makes no
difference to Iran whether the Democrats or the Republics won the
elections.
</P>
<P>
When commenting on the call for a dialogue with Iran by
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East Robert
Pelletreau during his visit to the United Arab Emirates last
month, Velayati said that there was nothing new in the
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
He described the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and the expected departure by Defense
Secretary William Perry from the new Clinton Administration as
being a failure to the U.S. policies in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The reshuffling of the secretaries of state and defense in
that country in the new administration is an indication of the
failure of American defense and foreign policies, particularly
in this region," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has rejected the call by
U.S. government officials for a dialogue with Tehran and called the
whole nation to struggle against the U.S. as a religious duty.
</P>
<P>
On November 3, Iran held nationwide rallies against the United
States to mark the 17th anniversary of the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran by radical students on November 4,
1979. Iran and the United States have remained hostile to each
other since then.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has accused Tehran of backing international terrorism
and seeking possession of nuclear weapons. It even threatened to
launch a military strike against Iranian targets.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A thick blanket of fog
enveloped China's capital, Beijing today brought in by a blast of
warm air. The city has been hit several times in the past week by
fog, an unusual November weather pattern, say experts.
</P>
<P>
Capital International Airport received thousands of telephone
calls from passengers wanting to know if their flights were
affected. But nearly 10,000 were given the bad news that they had
to wait for departures to be rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
Road traffic in and out Beijing was slow and sluggish in the
heavy fog.
</P>
<P>
The fog started to lift during the morning, but it did not
clear completely until late noon.
</P>
<P>
It was rare for Beijing to have a such a thick fog in November,
said Gong Xuezhong, a weatherman at the Municipal Meteorological
Observatory.
</P>
<P>
Usually strong winds sweep in during this period because of the
cold air coming from Siberia. But a stream of warm air from the
south entered the area and caused the thick fog, he said.
</P>
<P>
Polluted air trapped in the fog can be slightly harmful to
health, but the fog will quickly fade away by tomorrow, according
to Gong.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank Vows to Stop Illegal Fund-Raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China has vowed to deal a hard
blow to underground fund-raising, which promises extremely high
interest rates, but seldom pays back the lenders.
</P>
<P>
"The underground money market has become resurgent after the
recent two interest rate cuts for bank deposits, and seriously
intervened with normal financial order," warned a central bank
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The market was already red-hot, and the money collected this
way was re-invested in businesses, in spite of its initial
function of alleviating borrowers' temporary debt burdens, the
banking official said, warning that some institutions were also
involved in such activities.
</P>
<P>
The official urged that this kind of fund-pooling activities be
immediately curbed, because the promise of high interest rates,
quoted as between 30 percent and 60 percent, could only be at
extremely high risk.
</P>
<P>
"Banks should remain the first choice for investors, because it
is the safest place for savings, and it promises steady returns,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
He added that although the current interest rate of one-year
bank deposits was cut to 7.47 percent, investors enjoyed higher
returns since the inflation rate at present stands at only 6.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the results of illegal fund-raising
were destructive, and could easily lead to debt disputes between
borrowers and lenders.
</P>
<P>
"The rights of the lenders cannot receive legal protection,
since such lending agreements are seldom written in black and
white. In addition, the interest rate is too high for some
borrowers to repay, and some borrowers have been bankrupted,"
added the official.
</P>
<P>
The official also warned investors against some lending traps
on underground money market, and pledged a severe crack-down on
such crimes.

<HEADLINE> Further Efforts Needed to Attract FDI: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Though the prevailing
environment for the operation of foreign direct investment (FDI)
in India is as good as in other Asian nations, the country has not
been as successful in attracting it, said a study by the Reserve
Bank of India ( RBI).
</P>
<P>
The incentives offered by India to FDI for some specific
sectors like power and hydro-carbon and protection of property
rights are comparable with other Asian countries, yet a few
aspects relating to regulation and bureaucratization need
attention for making the environment more competitive.
</P>
<P>
The study highlighted that the FDI inflows between August 1991
and June 1995 generally moved into priority areas such as power
generation, oil refinery and telecommunications, which have large
scope for transfer of technology.
</P>
<P>
The gap between FDI approvals and actuals in India has been
wide. The findings of the study indicate that there is still room
for attracting FDI and further efforts are needed in this regard.

KUALA LUMPUR, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim today denied the charge that the incident
of a group attempting to stop a meeting on East Timor here was
orchestrated by the government.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government neither was involved in nor did it
sanction the action of the Malaysian People's Action Front, which
barged into Hotel Asia where the meeting was being held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"They acted on their own. I was not notified by them. Well,
certainly there was no sanction" from the ruling National Front,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, or the Second Asia Pacific Conference on East
Timor (APCET II), was sponsored by a group of non-government
organizations.
</P>
<P>
During the incident, police arrested 66 people, including
members of both the Action Front and NGOs from 12 countries. The
NGO members were sent back to their home country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad was quoted today by local news
media as saying "we do not want to do something which will only
damage our relations with our neighbors."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister criticized the organizers of the APCET II
for defying the Cabinet's decision to disallow the meeting to be
held in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, a former Portugal colony, was integrated as
Indonesia's 27th province in 1976. But the United Nations and
several European countries still recognize Lisbon as its
administrative authority.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government had said it did not allow the
conference to be held in the country and told the organizers to
call it off.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Uganda's Economy in Downturn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 10 (Xinhua) -- As the year 1996 comes to an
end, Uganda's economy is has shown a sign of downswing.
</P>
<P>
Business community here claimed that a substantial slowdown in
wholesale and retail sales has appeared over the past three
months.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices have successively risen since August this year
while annual headline inflation rate increased from 5.3 percent in
June to 7.8 percent, 8.8 percent and 9.2 percent respectively in
July, September and October.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts here attributed this trend to the despressed
state of the international coffee market. According to the Uganda
Coffee Development Authority, the monthly average unit value of
export for September 1996 stood at 1.37 U.S. Dollars per kilo of
coffee. The same period of last year, however, witnessed the
value at 2.19 U.S. Dollars. representing a drop of 37.4 percent
between the two periods.
</P>
<P>
In September 1996, Uganda exported 371,324 bags (60 kilo each)
of coffee and earned some 30 million Dollars, but in September
1995, 284,650 bags were exported bringing in nearly 40 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some others in the business community here hold that the slump in
economy was caused by the currently increased defence
expenditure. Eight million Dollars were spent in a single month
of October in the war in the north with the rebels of the Lord's
Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
Many other traders here blame the introduction of VAT (Value
Added Tax) for depressed sales including wholesales and retail
sales.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet expenditure, an important part of the country's
budget, is also held burdensome to the country's economy. Cost
increased rapidly after the number of cabinet members rose from
48 to 56. The seven-day traders' strike added to the trend,
resulting in a loss of 37.8 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although the Ugandan government has already anticipated a
downturn in the economy after the fall of coffee prices, it still
projects a GDP growth rate of seven percent for the next three
years, as compared with the GDP growth rates of 10 percent in
1994 and 8.2 percent in 1995. This is because the government
believes that the impact of the drop in the coffee prices will be
at least partially offset by an increase in private transfers
from abroad into uganda.
</P>
<P>
Private transfers from abroad into Uganda increased from 330
million Dollars in 1994/95 to 550 million Dollars in 1995/96 due
to the prevailing peace and stability across the country in
recent years. The Uganda Investment Authority has predicted that
the transfers from abroad will rise in the 1996/97 financial
year.
</P>
<P>
Some businessmen hope that provided the war in the north ends
after the signing of a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan on
border conflict next month, the slump in economy will come to
a stop soon.

<HEADLINE> Japan, U.S. to Join Hands on Nuclear Power Plants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Hitachi Ltd. has reached
a basic agreement with a major U.S. firm on joining hands in
construction of nuclear power plants, a major economic newspaper
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Hitachi's linkup with Bechtel
Group, based in San Francisco, is primarily aimed at jointly
snapping up a greater share in high-flying Asian markets including
China.
</P>
<P>
Under the basic agreement, Hitachi and Bechtel will share data
on the design and procurement of equipment for use in nuclear
power plants to cut construction costs and shorten the time needed
for construction.
</P>
<P>
Hitachi will also hook up its computer system that controls
ways to exchange three-dimensional data with customer power
utilities and contractors with that of Bechtel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese firm is also considering expanding its cooperation
with Bechtel to the area of thermal power generation plants in the
future, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Off-Shore Bank Planned in Zanzibar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- An American investor
Herbert Law is to set up the biggest world off-shore bank in
Zanzibar next year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here from the town of Zanzibar
today, Law signed an agreement to establish the bank in the Isles
with his local partener, Lambert Mathew, in Zanzibar on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that when established it would become the
safest in the world.
</P>
<P>
The bank would open with an initial capital of one billion
U.S. Dollars for the project on a 24-month funding tenure, he
said, adding that Tanzania would gain two percent tax revenue
from the transactions of the off-shore bank.
</P>
<P>
Currently there is more than two trillion Dollars circulating
in off-shore banking business in various parts of the world: the
Caribbean Island of Cayman, Bahamas, Man, Virgin Islands in the
United States and in Euruope, Law said.
</P>
<P>
"Right now the Cayman Island is very popular and probably the
best in the world, while the United States and Europe are
insecure places," he continued.
</P>
<P>
Law described Zanzibar as most secure place with a protective
shield where once the off-shore bank is established, would draw money
from the world for investment.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield Scores Dramatic Upset Over Tyson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield created
one of the biggest upsets in the history of boxing Saturday night,
pounding Mike Tyson into submission at 37 seconds of the 11th
round to capture the WBA heavyweight championship in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, an enormous underdog in a bout that was originally
scheduled five years ago, knocked Tyson down in the sixth round
and then unleashed a series of punches late in the 10th round that
all but finished the fight, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Tyson survived the 10th, but had nothing left and when
Holyfield put together a series of 12 consecutive punches that
left his opponent staggered on the ropes, referee Mitch Halpern
stepped in to stop the fight 2:23 deep into the round.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old Holyfield not only beat Tyson, he dominated the
dominator. He knocked Tyson down with a left hook in the sixth
round, cut him over the left eye in the same round, had him in
serious trouble in the 10th and stopped him with a nine-punch
barrage in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
"`I'm not a guy who makes excuses," Tyson was quoted as
saying. "He fought a good fight. I look forward to a rematch."
</P>
<P>
Said a jubilant Holyfield: "I gave it what it takes to win the
fight. It wasn't about getting tired, it was about not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
Holyfield became the WBA champion and the second man to hold a
piece of the heavyweight title three times. The other was Muhammad
Ali.
</P>
<P>
A sellout crowd of 16,205 began chanting "Holyfield!
Holyfield!" in earnest when Holyfield dropped Tyson with a left
hook in the sixth round. It was in that round that a gash appeared
over Tyson's left eye and the defending champion complained that
he had been butted.
</P>
<P>
The sixth round really turned the fight in Holyfield's favor
because in the fifth, Tyson had wobbled him with a right uppercut
and it appeared Holyfield might become Tyson's fifth comeback
victim.
</P>
<P>
Tyson rallied in the seventh round but then Holyfield took
charge in the eighth and ninth with solid left jabs and sharp
rights and Tyson appeared befuddled.
</P>
<P>
In the 10th round, Tyson landed a hard hook early. But with 20
seconds left, Holyfield landed a hook that sent Tyson reeling back
into the ropes. Holyfield pounced on Tyson and landed about a
dozen hard punches to the head.
</P>
<P>
Tyson appeared out on his feet, but the ropes saved him.
</P>
<P>
Tyson came out for the 11th like a man sleepwalking, and
Holyfield landed a left jab and followed with eight punches to the
head, including three left hooks. The last punch was a right to
the head that put Tyson into the ropes, and referee Mitch Halpern
stopped it.
</P>
<P>
"He was out," Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer, said: "All you've got to do is
swing and you can beat Mike Tyson."
</P>
<P>
As for the ending, Holyfield said, "I knew I had to be at my
best. If I got hit by seven unanswered punches, they'd stop the
fight on me as well."
</P>
<P>
Tyson still appeared dazed when he left the ring.
</P>
<P>
"He was about to get knocked down again," said Halpern.
</P>
<P>
The first four fights of Tyson's comeback, which began August
19, 1995, lasted a total of less than eight full rounds.
</P>
<P>
There was some question about Tyson's stamina if Holyfield was
able to force him into the later rounds.
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't a lack of stamina that beat Tyson. It was a
tremendous performance by Holyfield, who had lost two of his
previous three fights but insisted he could be champion again.
</P>
<P>
"Don't write Tyson off," promoter Don King said. "We're going
to dance again. We're going to see if we can put together the
greatest rematch in the history of boxing."
</P>
<P>
Tyson was expected to fight March 15 against the winner of the
Michael Moorer-Francois Botha IBF fight Saturday night. Moorer
kept that title when he stopped Botha 18 seconds into the 12th
round.
</P>
<P>
In another heavyweight title bout, Henry Akinwande kept the WBO
title by stopping Alexander Zolkin at 2:32 of the 10th round.
</P>
<P>
A rematch certainly would be lucrative for both fighters and
Tyson would have to settle for the challenger's share of the
purse. The 30 million U.S. dollars Tyson earned Saturday night _
and he earned it _ boosted his total earnings for his five
comeback fights to 105 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Holyfield earned dlrs 11 million and a place in boxing lore for
his 33rd victory and 24th knockout. He has lost three times.
</P>
<P>
Tyson now has a 45-2 record with 39 knockouts.

</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Chairman of the Electoral Commission
Justice Bobby Bwalya in Lusaka on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Israeli-Syrian Peace Talks to Resume </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has said that peace talks between Israel
and Syria will be resumed in January.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an opening session of the annual Jerusalem Business
Conference Saturday night, Netanyahu said that he was
encouraged by the statement made by Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Shara earlier Saturday that his country would continue
to seek peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to pursue the quest for peace and we are going
to achieve peace, I am confident, not only with the
Palestinians, but equally with Syria," Netanyahu said,
adding that "I am confident that we can restore Syrian-Israeli peace
talks soon, perhaps in January, possibly before."
</P>
<P>
"We have committed ourselves to doing so. We were able to
talk one another in Madrid (Middle East Peace Conference) and
after Madrid, and there is no reason that we shouldn't be able to
do that," Netanyahu told the gathering of 2,500 businessmen. "Now
there is every good reason for both of us to pursue peace," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Al-Shara told reporters that U.S. President Bill Clinton had
sent a "positive and encouraging" message to Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad after his re-election. He said Clinton expressed
his interest in renewing the Syrian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
However, al-Shara said that the negotiations with Israel will
not resume "tomorrow," but at the beginning of next year, since
the U.S. Administration must address numerous domestic problems
before it can deal with foreign issues.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks suspended after a string of suicide
bombing explosions in Israel in late February and early March
this year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases "Total Closure" on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The "total closure" Israeli
imposed on the Gaza Strip and West Bank on October 24 began to be
 eased at 4 a.m. this morning.
</P>
<P>
Under the order announced by an army spokesman, 35,000 married
Palestinian workers over the age of 30 are permitted to enter
Israel, of them 20,000 were from the West Bank and the rest from
the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Karni crossing between Israel and Gaza began
to be open to imports and exports without restriction, and
merchandise was allowed to be transferred from Gaza to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "total closure" was declared by the Israeli
military authorities as a measure to prevent suicide bombing
attacks by Islamic Jihad to mark the anniversary of the
assassination of its leader Fathi Shkaki.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic fundamentalist group believes that Shkaki was
murdered by Israeli secret agents in Malta on October 26,
1995.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians always condemn closure on Palestinian
territories as "collective punishment."

<HEADLINE> FAO Official Acclaims China's Achievements in Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China is highly acclaimed in
the world for its ability to feed 22 percent of the world
population with only 7 percent of the world's total arable land,
said a senior official of the Food and Agriculture Organization.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on the eve of the first-ever World
Food Summit to be held in Rome from November 13 to 17, Ajmal
Qureshi said, "From a level of 1500 Calories per capita per day in
the early 1960s, the country has increased food availability to
over 2700 Calories per capita per day, mainly through increases in
domestic production," China's rural poor population also declined
from 260 million in 1978 to 65 million in 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi, who has been the FAO representative in China since
1992, said, "The agricultural policy followed thus far (by China)
to achieve these results has been extremely successful, and in
particular I would like to underline the reforms introduced after
1978 which have demonstrated the seriousness of the pragmatic and
imaginative policies of the government and the high priority that
it has attached to the agricultural sector."
</P>
<P>
He added that the reforms since 1978 have provided a package of
incentives underlining the role of research and technology in
increasing agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"Although there have been a lot of debates on the issue of
China's ability to feed its population in the years to come, FAO
has adopted an optimistic view and appreciates the Chinese
government's efforts to streamline its agricultural policy and the
high priority attached to the agricultural sector," Qureshi said.
</P>
<P>
"China's achievements in the agricultural sector are no less
than a miracle in modern times," he said. While China's population
a little more than doubled to over 1.2 billion in 1995 from 500
million in 1949, Qureshi added, its cereal production increased
more than four times during this period from only 113 million tons
to 466 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The FAO official pointed out that China's practice could be
helpful to other developing counties and therefore facilitate the
south-south cooperation between China and a number of African
counties.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the cooperation between FAO and China, Qureshi
said that the cooperation has always been excellent since the
country joined the Organization and a total of 51 FAO projects
have been carried out in China.
</P>
<P>
"China is regarded as a country in which technical assistance,
such as the one provided by FAO, is best utilized, absorbed and
replicated before maximizing the impact of such technical
assistance projects," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between FAO and China during the last
few years has concentrated on food security, sustainable
agriculture, credit extension, agricultural statistics, and forestry.
</P>
<P>
Qureshi mentioned in particular the special "Program on Food
Production in Support of Food Security" whose pilot phase is being
completed in Sichuan province in southwestern China. He said
Sichuan's outstanding performance would be a model to other 14
developing countries assisted by the Program aimed at increasing
agricultural production and productivity through participatory
approaches and the maximization of available inputs and
techniques.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the upcoming World Food Summit, Qureshi said that
the meeting will be a great success and have a global perspective
in dealing with the aspects of food security and addressing the
root causes of and seeking solutions to hunger and malnutrition in
all parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, the summit will draw the world's attention to
the seriousness and complexity for the problem of food security and
will ensure the timely adoption of appropriate solutions as well
as the effective implementation of the decisions to be made at the
summit," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the summit will obtain the commitment of the
heads of state and government to the goal of universal food
security and approve a plan of action which the governments will
have the responsibility to implement together with international
organizations, non-governmental organizations, private sectors,
academic and research institutions and the civil society in
general.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Import of Some US Textiles, Other Goods (correction) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to
temporarily suspend the import of some textiles, agricultural and
animal husbandry products, fruits, alcoholic drinks and beverages
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban will be effective as of December 10, according
to an announcement jointly issued today by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) and the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to the US unilateral cut of
import quotas of Chinese textiles, which severely violated the
bilateral textile agreement.
</P>
<P>
Regulations of the Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic
of China also support the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Moftec and the General Administration of Customs will draft
the detailed list of commodities, based on information from
concerned departments and enterprises, before December 10.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, the US Trade Representative Office levied
charges against China's 1996 textile quotas of 195,000 dozens and
134,000 kilograms of items covering 13 categories, and invoked
triple charges on five of the categories for the first time, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Such actions by the US were made without full consultation and
clear evidence to support the action, and only on the allegation
that Chinese enterprises had made illegal textile transshipments,
the announcement noted.
</P>
<P>
The retaliative action by the United States has seriously
violated the Sino-U.S. bilateral textile agreement, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has requested the US Trade Representative
Office to withdraw its quota chargeback decision in the spirit of
developing Sino-U.S. bilateral trade, and stated that failure to
do so will leave the Chinese side no other choice but to take
corresponding action, it said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the U.S. side has not withdrawn its quota decision,
it stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the US has recently formed a
series of trade and non-trade barriers to restrict China's textile
exports to the United States, which have resulted in the sharp
decrease of Chinese textile exports to the US.
</P>
<P>
China and the US signed the fourth bilateral textile agreement
in 1994, it said, and since then, the US Trade Representative
Office has made charges against China's textile quotas of
2,755,000 dozens and 134,000 kilograms of goods for three
consecutive years, in the absence of full consultation and clear
evidence.
</P>
<P>
This has seriously affected China's textile export to the
United States and China's ability to pay for imports from the
United States, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always honored its commitment to the
development of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the Chinese government holds that
trade disputes should be settled under the principles of the
bilateral agreement, and opposes any practice intended to impose
the will of one side upon others in trade dealings.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, we wish to urge the United States to handle trade
disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade, and refrain
from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,"
it said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Mrs. Sonia Gandhi, widow of
former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, has conveyed to some Congress
Party leaders that she is willing to do "whatever possible" on her
part to help various factions of the party to unite and arrest the
party's decline and disintegration.
</P>
<P>
According to top Congress sources, Sonia is actively
considering the request made by Congress President Sitaram Kesri
to become a member of the Congress Working Committee( CWC), the
highest policy-making body of the party, and provide guidance to
the party.
</P>
<P>
Several CWC members and Congressmen from all over the country
have been urging Sonia Gandhi to provide guidance to the party in
some manner so that the Congress regains the confidence of the
people.
</P>
<P>
After Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991, Sonia Gandhi was
persuaded by the Congress to succeed her husband to continue
leading the party as the chief, but she refused. Since then she
has not taken any active role in the party's work.
</P>
<P>
At the last CWC meeting held here on November 4, the question
of requesting Mrs. Gandhi to become a member of the CWC was
mentioned by some leaders and the party president announced that
he would pursue the matter.
</P>
<P>
Congress sources said that in response to Kesri's request and
that of other leaders, Mrs. Gandhi was inclined to do whatever
possible from her side.

<P>
VIENNA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of central and eastern
European countries ended a two-day summit of the Central European
Initiative (CEI) today, agreeing to boost regional cooperation and
re-build peace in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued after the summit, the 16-member group
agreed to expand regional cooperation, especially in transport and
energy, combating organized crime and protecting the environment.
</P>
<P>
The heads of government also emphasised the importance of
economic development in order to secure the successful
implementation of the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords which ended the
43-month war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that special attention and priority should be given
to reconstruction projects in the war-torn areas of Bosnia and
Herzegovina and Croatia, the Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky
quoted the communique as saying.
</P>
<P>
The summit also adopted Moldova as the 16th member of the CEI.
</P>
<P>
But the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia failed to become the
17th and final member after strong opposition from Albania. Under
the rules of the CEI, which was set up in 1989, decisions
must be taken unanimously.
</P>
<P>
Albania accused Yugoslavia of mounting aggression against
ethnic Albanians in the Kosovo region, where violence has flared
up repeatedly over recent months.
</P>
<P>
Bosnia will take over the rotating chairmanship of the CEI from
Austria and will host a summit next year in Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Government Ready For Talks with LTTE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
ready for talks with the liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE)
to end the current civil war and was prepared to use a third party
to facilitate the dialogue if necessary, the official "Sunday
Observer" said today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga told the newspaper
in an interview recently that the talks could take place at any
time once the LTTE had indicated willingness to lay down arms to
agree to a fixed and limited time frame for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the government was ready to use a third
party to facilitate a dialogue if that would help bring the LTTE
to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
The government had received dozens of offers of help in
mediation by institutions, individuals and foreign governments.
The third party mediator could be someone within the country or
outside, she said.
</P>
<P>
But the president stressed that the government would insist
that the two conditions relating to the laying down of arms and a
fixed time frame for the talks must be observed by the LTTE.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the government had no option but take into
account the past record of the LTTE in reneging on ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the negotiations initiated by the government as it
came to power in 1994, the president pointed out that "we gave
them almost everything they wanted, but they kicked us in the
teeth."
</P>
<P>
She argued that the LTTE seemed to have a practice of using
such ceasefire merely to use the time for re-grouping and
preparing for further military campaigns. It was in this light
that the government had no option but to insist on certain
conditions, she added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Welcomes U.S. Lifting Sea Shrimp Import Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand welcomes the United
States' lifting of a five-month-old ban on imports of ocean shrimp
from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry Permanent Secretary Sompol Kiatphaibool said
on Saturday that "this is good news for us. The announcement
will enable Thai (shrimp) exporters to sell on the U.S. market
again."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Undersecretary of State Joan Spero announced Friday that
the U.S. had certified that Thailand was complying with its
sea-turtle-protection regulations requiring the use of sea turtle
excluder devices on motorized ocean-going shrimp vessels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. certification was made following an inspection tour by
U.S. officials on shrimp trawlers in southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Shrimp exports are one of Thailand's chief sources of foreign
exchange, earning more than 20 billion baht (800 million US
dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
However, only 10 percent of shrimp exports, or 2 billion baht
(80 million dollars) were affected by the ban, which applied only
to shrimp harvested at sea. The rest are farmed.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Pollwatch Worried About Illegal Campaigning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 10 (Xinhua) -- Pollwatch, a neutral agency
for monitoring Thailand's campaign and election activities, is
worried about the increased use of illegal tactics to pull in
votes during the past week.
</P>
<P>
Some candidates gave supporters money under the guise that they
were paying for traveling expenses and arranged parties for those
attending campaign meetings, according to Somchai Srisuthiyakorn,
secretary of Pollwatch.
</P>
<P>
Illegal tactics also include the use of film stars and
entertainment to attract supporters to campaign rallies, Somchai
said.
</P>
<P>
Pollwatch has also found that many government officials and
"men in uniform" have failed to remain impartial, as required by
law, by giving speeches in favor of particular parties, and
organizing meetings which turned into political rallies.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring body has also received reports that canvassers
and candidates have withdrawn money in small denomination notes
from banks to pay off voters.
</P>
<P>
With the election set to take place next Sunday, the agency has
been working with Bangkok and provincial police by sending out
about 1,000 rapid deployment units to various parts of the country
to prevent vote-buying.
</P>
<P>
Pollwatch will also look into allegations that almost 30
million baht (1.2 million US dollars) has been transferred to the
lower northern province of Phisanulok for vote-buying in
constituency 1.
</P>
<P>
Last week, at least three election canvassers, one each for the
Democrat, New Aspiration and Chart Pattana parties, were reported
killed in violence cases related to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palang Dharma (virtue force) Party leader, Thaksin
Shinawatra, said Thai politics was deteriorating, with vote-buying
becoming more widespread than ever before.

<HEADLINE> Caution Urged in Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing scholar cast doubt
last week on an over-optimistic approach to development of China's
insurance market and urged that cooling-down is needed, according
to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
Insurance premiums have grown by an average annual 30 percent
since 1990 to reach 60 billion yuan (7.2 billion US dollars) last
year.
</P>
<P>
If the growth continues at this speed, the market will be worth
at least 200 billion yuan by 2000 --- a forecast widely held by
insurers at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"But such rapid growth comes from many irregular operations,"
argued Hao Yansu, a professor at the Central Institute of Finance
and Banking.
</P>
<P>
Hao urged related authorities to take measures to regulate the
industry to grow at a moderate speed.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the Chinese market has great potential, he said
the ordinary people's low income still prevents them from buying
policies.
</P>
<P>
According to Hao, some life policy underwriters violate
regulations which stipulate the ceiling of agent commission -- 10
percent of premium -- and pledge as much as 40 percent of the
premium.
</P>
<P>
Commission on flight and auto safety policies is 85 percent and
65 percent of the premium.
</P>
<P>
"Under-the-table deals are inevitable under this situation, and
illicit methods include repetition of policy buying and canceling,
which creates more commissions for agents. Hao said, adding that
such misconduct hurts the customers' interests.

<HEADLINE> Central American Aborigines Demand Better Living Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, November 9 (Xinhua) -- The chiefs of indigenous ethnic
groups in Central America are demanding their governments respect
their right to self-determination and improve the living standards
of aboriginal groups in the Isthmus.
</P>
<P>
The demands were made by delegates from 57 communal
organizations and 137 indigenous nations in the region at a
conference of the First Central American Meeting of Indigenous
Leaders and the Commission of Health of the Indigenous Parliament
of America.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the Indigenous Council of Central
America, aims to establish mechanisms to facilitate the work of
indigenous leaders and parliamentarians to implement joint
projects to improve the health of indigenous peoples.
</P>
<P>
Arturo Adalid Echeverria, acting president of the Indigenous
Parliament of America, said "the indigenous peoples are part of a
state but have their own characteristics."
</P>
<P>
"What we are demanding is to be recognized as part of a society
and respect for our right to self-determination. We want to be
seen as the forgers of our own destiny and not as the
justification of a budget," he said.
</P>
<P>
Isabel Zapata, commissioner of the Ngobe Buble General Congress
of Chiriqui, Panama, said the only thing indigenous populations
demand is to be permitted to work the land to make it produce
what is needed to satisfy their basic needs.
</P>
<P>
"The land is what gives us health and health means life. We
cannot talk about integral development of a country if the people
are hungry. Nobody can talk of health if there is malnutrition,"
he added.

Earlier in the day, Serb republic's president Biljana Plavsic

civilian leadership backfired.

well as to improve the people's life there", the paper quotes Jia
Qinglin, Beijing's new acting mayor as saying.

-- Japan is urged to value its trade ties with China. An
official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation said that Sino-Japanese economic and trade
co-operation is basically sound at present, but will be improved
only when Japan works harder to remove obstacles and value the
success that Japanese investors and traders have achieved in China.

-- Together with the restoration of the exercise of Chinese
sovereignty over Hong Kong next July, one of the most important
events of 1997 will be the blocking of the Yangtze River at the

<P>
With the project proceeding on schedule, the bidding for rights
to build the dam will be opened at around the Spring Festival in

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The North China Regional
Administration of the Civil Aviation Administration of China
(CAAC) will provide air traffic control equipment and services to

</P>
<P>
"We are bringing our advantages including excellent engineers

said Zhou Wuxuan, deputy director of the Air Traffic Management
Bureau of CAAC's North China Region Administration.
</P>
<P>
An enterprise has been set up to provide installation and
maintenance services for traffic control systems and other
equipment such as air conditioners, automobiles, radio navigation

<HEADLINE> Croatian President Meets Serb Enclave Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, November 9 (Xinhua) - Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
met Serb representatives from a breakaway Serb enclave in Eastern
Slavonia on Saturday as part of a U.N. mandate to restore Croatian
rule over the area.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting between the two sides since the
Serbs revolted against the Croatian government's move to
independence in 1991, a move which sparked the disintegration of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Vojislav Stanimirovic, head of the nine-member Serb delegation
described the meeting as "a step forward," local reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, he said that Tudjman had promised the
delegation that all Croation citizens, both Croats and Serbs,
would be able to return to their homes in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were displaced during the war in which Serb
forces seized almost a third of Croatia in 1991. Croatia then
re-took two of three Serb pockets in counter-attacks last year
before a U.N. mission ended the war.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonian Serbs and the Croatian government signed an
agreement last December, under which the region will return to
Croatia after no more than two years of U.N. administration and the
Croatian government will guarantee full rights to the Serb
population.
</P>
<P>
Stanimirovic said that his side raised unresolved
issues, including the right to vote in local elections for Serbs
who had not lived in Eastern Slavonia before 1991, the opening of
borders with Yugoslavia, and reclamation of property by Serbs in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Klein, the U.N. Transitional Administrator in Eastern
Slavonia, who also participated in the two-and-half hour meeting,
characterized it as another important step toward the process
of settling the Eastern Slavonia issue, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Klein, Tudjman told the Serb representatives that
"the past could not be changed but that the future could be
created with goodwill and a constructive approach to the benefit
of all people(in Croatia)".

<HEADLINE> Gold Industry Opening to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
last week the country needs more understanding from foreign gold
companies, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Ai Dacheng, deputy director of the gold bureau with the
Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, told the newspaper that China
has already made some achievements in this regard over the past
two years, but there is still more work to do. The sector used to
be one of the most closely guarded industries.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with other industries which experienced a smooth
transition from the planned economy to the market economy, the
gold sector is rather slow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The sector is in the dilemma of having one foot in the market
economy and one in the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
gold products and purchase are still strictly controlled by the
central government, meaning China will not open the sector
completely at one stroke. It lost all government subsidies and
supporting policies overnight when China adjusted policies for the
industry in September 1993.
</P>
<P>
Now, foreign investment is welcomed on a trial basis at mines
of generally lower grade and metallurgical difficulty.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government and the concerned ministries and
commissions are investigating integrating the system with the
international practice together with related rules on attracting
foreign investment.

<P>
SARAJEVO, November 9 (Xinhua) - Chairman of the Bosnian
Presidency Alija Izetbegovic has asked the European Union to
extend its mandate in Mostar which expires at the end of this
year, local media reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic made the request in a letter to Irish Foreign Minister
Dick Spring, who is also the current chairman of the EU council of
ministers. The European Union has been administrating Mostar in the
past two years in an effort to reunify the ethnically-divided city.
</P>
<P>
Mostar hold a key to the success in the (Croat-Moslem) Federation
of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the positive developments in the town will
directly influence the establishment of joint institutions at the
federal and cantonal levels, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"A scaled-down presense of the EU mission in Mostar would encourage
extremist forces that try to hamper the inevitable unification of the
city," it added.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Import of Some US Textiles, Other Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to
temporarily suspend the import of some textiles, agricultural and
animal husbandry products, fruits, alcoholic drinks and beverages
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The temporary ban will be effective as of December 6, according
to an announcement jointly issued today by the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (Moftec) and the General
Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in response to the US unilateral cut of
import quotas of Chinese textiles, which severely violated the
bilateral textile agreement.
</P>
<P>
Regulations of the Foreign Trade Law of the People's Republic
of China also support the decision.
</P>
<P>
The Moftec and the General Administration of Customs will draft
the detailed list of commodities, based on information from
concerned departments and enterprises, before December 6.
</P>
<P>
On September 6, the US Trade Representative Office levied
charges against China's 1996 textile quotas of 195,000 dozens and
134,000 kilograms of items covering 13 categories, and invoked
triple charges on five of the categories for the first time, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
Such actions by the US were made without full consultation and
clear evidence to support the action, and only on the allegation
that Chinese enterprises had made illegal textile transshipments,
the announcement noted.
</P>
<P>
The retaliative action by the United States has seriously
violated the Sino-U.S. bilateral textile agreement, the
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has requested the US Trade Representative
Office to withdraw its quota chargeback decision in the spirit of
developing Sino-U.S. bilateral trade, and stated that failure to
do so will leave the Chinese side no other choice but to take
corresponding action, it said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the U.S. side has not withdrawn its quota decision,
it stressed.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the US has recently formed a
series of trade and non-trade barriers to restrict China's textile
exports to the United States, which have resulted in the sharp
decrease of Chinese textile exports to the US.
</P>
<P>
China and the US signed the fourth bilateral textile agreement
in 1994, it said, and since then, the US Trade Representative
Office has made charges against China's textile quotas of
2,755,000 dozens and 134,000 kilograms of goods for three
consecutive years, in the absence of full consultation and clear
evidence.
</P>
<P>
This has seriously affected China's textile export to the
United States and China's ability to pay for imports from the
United States, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always honored its commitment to the
development of Sino-U.S. bilateral trade on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the Chinese government holds that
trade disputes should be settled under the principles of the
bilateral agreement, and opposes any practice intended to impose
the will of one side upon others in trade dealings.
</P>
<P>
"Once again, we wish to urge the United States to handle trade
disputes in the spirit of advancing bilateral trade, and refrain
from taking any actions harmful to bilateral trade in the future,"
it said.

BEIJING, November 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has listed
eight memorial sites, where Japanese soldiers carried out acts of
aggression during World War II, to be used as educational tools

at the Changxingdian trained their man-eating dogs, and where over
10,000 civilians were buried in Yanqing County.
