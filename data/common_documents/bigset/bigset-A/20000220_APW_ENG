<HEADLINE> 'Hated' Starks Now With the Bulls  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- After so many years of loathing John Starks, it's going to
take Chicago Bulls fans awhile to warm up to him.
</P>
<P>
	   Starks, hated from his days with the New York Knicks, was greeted with a
mixture of boos and cheers Saturday night when he took the floor for the first
time as a Bull.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was good," Starks said, smiling, after the game. "They wouldn't be doing
their jobs (if they didn't boo)."
</P>
<P>
	   There was a loud chorus of boos whenever he touched the ball at first, but
the jeers were replaced by cheers the longer he was on the floor. When he made
two free throws in the third quarter -- his first points as a Bull -- he cheers
actually drowned out the boos.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him I thought the fans would appreciate him," coach Tim Floyd said.
"Bottom line, we're 1-0 with John Starks. They've got to like that."
</P>
<P>
	   Maybe, but it's still a little hard for Bulls fans to see Starks wearing the
red and black. In the early 1990s, when the Bulls and Knicks had their
old-fashioned, take-it-to-the-floor rivalry, the fans couldn't hate Starks
enough.
</P>
<P>
	   He was a thug, tripping Scottie Pippen and jawing with Michael Jordan almost
to the point of blows. He was a taunter, giving Bulls fans grief whenever he got
the chance. Worst of all, he had the game to back up his mouth, dunking over
Horace Grant in the playoffs and hitting killer 3s.
</P>
<P>
	   So it must be some sort of cosmic payback for him to now be wearing a Bulls
uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   "Being in New York and the rivalries we had here against Chicago made this
city well-hated, in a sense, team-wise," he said earlier Saturday after his
first practice with the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's funny how this league works. You can't never say never."
</P>
<P>
	   Starks came to Chicago from the Golden State Warriors on Wednesday as part
of the three-team, Toni Kukoc trade. At first, it seemed like it had to be a
mistake. This, after all, was Starks, one of the biggest sources of bad blood
between the Knicks and Bulls.
</P>
<P>
	   He and Jordan once got into an argument so intense their teammates had to
separate them. He tripped a fast-breaking Pippen once, and took him down with a
hard foul another time.
</P>
<P>
	   "Chicago was the team to beat," Starks said. "You knew you had to go through
them in order to get to what you wanted to get to and that was a championship.
You had to come in here with a focus like no other."
</P>
<P>
	   That never made Bulls' fans feel any better, though. To many of them, the
only thing worse than acquiring Starks would be if the Bulls took down Jordan's
banner and gave Starks his number.
</P>
<P>
	   "Starks!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our mortal enemy!!!!!" one fan wrote in a message board
on the Chicago Tribune's Web site. "Starks ... is the last player in the world I
would ever have wear a Bulls uniform."
</P>
<P>
	   During the game, one fan yelled, "Hey Starks! Go back to New York!"
</P>
<P>
	   But Chicago can be a forgiving town for the players who wear its uniforms.
Dennis Rodman's antics in his days on the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys crew make
Starks look like a choir boy. Yet when Rodman came to Chicago before the 1995-96
season, he quickly became a fan favorite.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, helping Chicago win its last three titles didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our fans have always appreciated hard-playing guys," Floyd said. "That was
clear when Dennis Rodman joined the Bulls. John Starks is a hard-playing guy. It
might be a little unusual to see him with 'Bulls' on the jersey early on, but I
think the first time he dives on the floor or does something defensively, he'll
be a Bull."
</P>
<P>
	   Starks hustled for the 14 minutes he was in the game, harassing the Clippers
defensively. He went 0-for-6 from the floor, but he made his two free throws,
grabbed three rebounds and had two assists.
</P>
<P>
	   And one of these days, maybe he won't hear any boos.
</P>
<P>
	   "Winning solves all that," he said. "It's good to come out and get a win
tonight. I know what it's like to get a win in Chicago now."

<HEADLINE> Strutzel Beats Gray in 800 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jess Strutzel, a UCLA senior, beat Johnny Gray in the 800
meters for the second consecutive year in the Los Angeles Invitational indoor
track meet Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	Strutzel, who finished seventh, three places behind Gray, in the 1999 U.S.
national outdoor championships, was timed in 1 minutes, 50.11 seconds on the
boards at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
	Gray, four months shy of his 40th birthday, was clocked in 1:50.46. Milton
Brown finished third in 1:50.64.
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Lagat of Kenya, the NCAA 5,000 champion for Washington State last year,
was a runaway winner in the LA Invitational mile with a time of 3:59.60.
</P>
<P>
	Brian Berryhill of Colorado State was second in 4:02.31, and Benjamin Kapsoiya
of Kenya third in 4:05.60.
</P>
<P>
	In the 800, Gray led early, fell back to third as Strutzel moved in front in
the third lap, cut inside and passed Brown in the final turn, but could not
catch Strutzel.
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who hopes to become the first track and field athlete to compete in five
Olympics, was not pleased with the way the race unfolded as he lost for the
first time in four indoor meets this year.
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody could see who had the most energy out there,'' Gray said. ``But I
got boxed in and couldn't quite catch him.
</P>
<P>
	``My training is going great. I'm going up to the Olympic Trials in July to win
the 800, not just to make the team. That will surely show the public my
durability,'' said Gray, who first ran in the LA indoor meet in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	Strutzel, 17 years Gray's junior, also hopes to earn one of the three U.S.
Olympic berths in the 800 in the trials July 14-23 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going for the NCAA titles both indoors and out, hopefully make the
Olympic team, and run under 1:45 this year,'' Strutzel said.
</P>
<P>
	Other LA Invitational winners included 1996 Olympian Amy Acuff, with a height
of 5 feet,, 10 inches in the high jump; Mary Sauer, who cleared 14-2 in the pole
vault; and Von Ware, who went 52-0 3/4 in the triple jump.

<HEADLINE> McCain Demands S.C. Polling Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By LEIGH STROPE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Consolidation of Republican primary polling places
across South Carolina caused voter confusion and prompted demands from John
McCain for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign complained that precincts that were supposed to be open
were closed. The Arizona senator demanded ``a full investigation'' after
discovering the Pond Branch voting precinct in Greenville was closed. Campaign
manager Rick Davis said there were no plans to sue, however.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume said representatives of the
civil rights group had received complaints Saturday morning that some polling
places in heavily black areas were closed. He said he would send a
representative to South Carolina after the polls closed to investigate the
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to take a look at these complaints to see if any violations
occurred,'' Mfume said at the NAACP's annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the consolidations, turnout was phenomenal, with a record of about
570,000 ballots cast -- more than double that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Cam Underwood, who has helped run the Republican primary for more than 25
years, was working at the William J. Clark Middle School polling station in
Orangeburg south of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've seen people today voting that I haven't seen in a long time,'' she
said. In the primary four years ago, 339 people cast ballots at William J.
Clark. Underwood said almost 400 had voted by 1 p.m. this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We just had to call for more ballots,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   By early afternoon, 10 polling places in the Columbia area were running low
on ballots because of high turnout, said Shell Suber, GOP county chairman, who
was getting more copied at Kinko's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're keeping very strict tabs on how many extra ballots each place gets
to verify votes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Paper ballots were used in 44 of the state's 46 counties.
</P>
<P>
	   The state does not control political parties' primaries in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to a lawsuit, the state Republican Party promised last week to
open all state-designated polling places and, if necessary, pay state election
workers to staff them. Two Democrats had sued and complained to the Justice
Department that the GOP's practice of not opening all polling places, especially
in predominantly black areas, violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   The consent order was approved Monday by a three-judge federal panel
scheduled to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it was clear -- the court has already settled this,'' McCain said.
``I don't know what to say. It's very disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP Executive Director J. Sam Daniels said the party opened 1,429
polling places out of 1,752 that normally operate in a general election. That's
almost twice as many as in the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But 23 of 139 precincts were consolidated in Greenville County that were to
be open after some volunteers did not pick up their ballots and ballot boxes
Friday, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some precincts were closed elsewhere in the state, but ``not to the degree
that it has happened in Greenville,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Columbia, more than 100 people showed up at their regular voting spot,
Virginia Wingard Memorial United Methodist Church, only to find signs telling
them to go to a middle school. There were no directions or an address.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Jackson, who was doing some handiwork for the church, said he spent
much of the morning helping lost voters. A church pastor finally wrote
directions on signs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think he was tired of telling people where to go,'' Jackson said.

<HEADLINE> Seven Killed in Calif. Highway Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GILROY, Calif. (AP) -- A car moving at least 60 mph crossed the center line
of a highway in Northern California early Saturday and smashed head-on into a
pickup truck, killing all seven people in the vehicles, the state Highway Patrol
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crash happened on state Highway 25 near Gilroy, about 75 miles south of
San Francisco, about 4:20 a.m., said California Highway Patrol dispatcher Cindy
Dichiara.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men in the car and three adults and two children in the pickup were
reported dead at the scene. The car was believed to be moving between 60 and 65
mph in a 55 mph zone.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses traveling in a vehicle behind the car told police they made
several attempts to get the car back onto the right side of the road by flashing
their headlights, Highway Patrol Officer Adam Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very surreal, very disturbing to see such death has to happen that
way when it's actually all very preventable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Identities provided by the San Benito County Sheriff's office listed the
truck's driver as Ismael Smiley Chavarria, 25. The truck's passengers included
Chavarria's girlfriend, Jennifer Ann Lohr, 35; Lohr's two sons, Bryon Lohr, 13,
and Kevin Lohr, 11; and Roland Wilson, 24. All lived in Gilroy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the car were driver Edward Martinez, Jr. 21, and his friend, Jacob Samuel
Margherita, 27, both of Los Banos.
</P>
<P>
	   Highway 25 was closed in both directions at the scene of the crash for about
10 hours.

    SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 27 points and Vin Baker hit four straight
baskets in the final five minutes as the Seattle SuperSonics beat the Boston
Celtics 94-91 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker, who sat out the first six minutes of the fourth quarter, made the
four straight shots after Boston's Antoine Walker tied it at 83 with five
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton's free throw gave the Sonics a 94-91 lead with 15.7 seconds
remaining, and Paul Pierce missed a 3-pointer with nine seconds left. The Sonics
grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker finished with 17 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierce led the Celtics with 23 points and eight rebounds. Walker added 21

<HEADLINE> Loyola Marymount Retires 2 Jerseys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Lucille Gathers-Cheeseboro returned to the basketball
court where her son died, much more composed than that dreadful night 10 years
ago, but still teary-eyed and still clinging to Bo Kimble for emotional support.
</P>
<P>
	   Loyola Marymount formally retired Hank Gathers' No. 44 jersey and Kimble's
No. 30 on Saturday night at Gersten Pavilion during halftime of the Lions' game
against Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
	   And the flood of memories from those seemingly endless days of mourning
haunted those who were there on March 4, 1990, when Gathers collapsed during a
conference tournament game and was pronounced dead about 1 1/2 hours later at a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hank loved this gym and he loved this campus," his weeping mother told a
crowd of 4,100 that greeted her and sons Derrick and Charles with a standing
ovation as they walked onto the court for the 15-minute ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know he's watching us now because his spirit is with me. I will come back
and visit, because this is my second home."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Westhead, who coached Gathers and Kimble at Loyola, presented Gathers'
mother with her son's jersey in a glass-enclosed frame. Athletic director Bill
Husak presented Kimble with his jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   They are the first two male athletes ever to have their uniform numbers
retired by the school.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's so overwhelming. Words can't describe it," Derrick Gathers said. "It
brings a great deal of warmth and closure together. I think we needed to get
back out here to see some people who we hadn't seen for 10 years -- people who
Hank loved. You felt Hank's presence -- the words that were said about Hank and
Bo, and the stories."
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of his death -- three weeks after his 23rd birthday -- Gathers
was expecting to be a lottery pick in the NBA draft and also was hoping to start
a second career in sports broadcasting. Gathers' mother got emotional a couple
of hours prior to the ceremony when asked if she felt her son was cheated by
fate.
</P>
<P>
	   "At first, I thought about that until about a year after it happened. But I
can't say that now because I know God is in control of everything and in charge
of all of us," she said. "Hank was that flower that was picked, and it was time
for him to go. But he was mine for 23 years. I appreciate that and I have my
memories of that."
</P>
<P>
	   One memory that won't go away was Gathers' final basket. It was a slam dunk
off an alley-oop pass from Terrell Lowery, which gave Loyola a 25-13 lead in its
West Coast Conference semifinal game against Portland.
</P>
<P>
	   Gathers backpedaled to midcourt, staggered to his right and crashed to the
floor in convulsions, just seconds after a stoppage in play. Paramedics worked
feverishly on him, but to no avail -- while his mother and aunt wailed in horror
just inches away. The coroner's report said he died of myocarditis, a treatable
inflammation of the heart.
</P>
<P>
	   The aftermath of Gathers' death wasn't pleasant. Lawsuits were filed by
Lucille Gathers, straining her relationship with Loyola Marymount. The family
ended up alienating a lot of people during the next several years -- including
Kimble.
</P>
<P>
	   But all of that became old history on this occasion, as Kimble embraced
Lucille and Derrick at the end of the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of things that went on 10 years ago and the litigation that followed
and the things that were said, when we look back on that now, we see a lot of
regrets and a lot of people's feelings that we may have hurt," Derrick Gathers
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "And on a day like today, we can put all that behind us, finally, and say,
'Thank you, Loyola for accepting my brother and the Gathers family as family.'
We finally get to say that with this ceremony and celebration -- and that's
what's important.'
</P>
<P>
	   Kimble and Gathers, who also were teammates at Philadelphia's Dobbins Tech
High School, spent a year at Southern Cal before transferring to Loyola. The
move mostly had to do with the firing of coach Stan Morrison by then-USC
athletic director Mike McGee, and the hiring of George Raveling as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   The Trojans' loss was Loyola's gain. The two kids from the projects of
Philadelphia put Westhead's breakneck style of offense into motion and brought
the small Catholic school in Westchester into national prominence.
</P>
<P>
	   Gathers led the nation in scoring and rebounding in 1988-89, joining Wichita
State's Xavier McDaniel as the only players to accomplish that feat, and
finished his three seasons at Loyola averaging 28.5 points, 11.1 rebounds and 59
percent from the field. Kimble averaged 26.4 points in his three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   But 10 years later, Kimble is most remembered for the way he led the
emotionally charged Lions to NCAA tournament victories over New Mexico State,
defending champion Michigan and Alabama before they were trounced in the Western
Regional title game against eventual champ UNLV.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimble took his first free throw left-handed in each of the first three
games as a tribute to Gathers, who was such a poor free throw shooter that he
switched hands and tried shooting left-handed. He made all three.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the moment I took that first one, I really didn't care if the ball went
over the backboard," said Kimble, who missed all three left-handed free throws
he attempted in the NBA. "It meant the same to be whether the ball went in or
not, because I was paying tribute to Hank. But America wanted it to go in -- and
it was from the heart."

<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 27 points and Vin Baker hit four straight
baskets in the final five minutes as the Seattle SuperSonics beat the Boston
Celtics 94-91 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker, who sat out the first six minutes of the fourth quarter, made the
four straight shots after Boston's Antoine Walker tied it at 83 with five
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton's free throw gave the Sonics a 94-91 lead with 15.7 seconds
remaining, and Paul Pierce missed a 3-pointer with nine seconds left. The Sonics
grabbed the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker finished with 17 points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierce led the Celtics with 23 points and eight rebounds. Walker added 21
points and eight rebounds for Boston, which is 1-2 on a six-game West Coast
trip.
</P>
<P>
	   Both teams rebounded with solid performances after one-sided losses Friday
night. Seattle was coming off a 118-85 loss to Sacramento, and Boston a 122-100
setback at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sonics biggest lead in the last five minutes was 89-85, with the Celtics
staying close behind Pierce and Walker.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle reserves Jelani McCoy, Rashard Lewis and Greg Foster helped the
Sonics come from behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Down 74-71, the Sonics went on a 12-2 run capped by McCoy's dunk for an
83-76 lead with 7:12 left. McCoy had six points during the spurt and gave the
Sonics some toughness under the basket.
</P>
<P>
	   Payton scored 15 points during the third period. Anderson's two baskets,
including a buzzer-beater from 15 feet, gave Boston a 71-69 lead after three
periods.
</P>
<P>
	   Boston beat Seattle 111-86 during their first meeting at the Fleet Center on
Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   The Celtics outscored the Sonics 11-2 over the last 2:56 of the first half
for a 49-44 halftime lead. Dana Barros and Pierce made 3-point shots during the
spurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle had taken a 42-38 lead with a 9-0 run. A blocked shot and assist by
Foster and five points by Payton fueled the spurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Pierce put on a dazzling all-around performance in the first quarter with
six points, three steals and two blocked shots. On successive possessions,
Pierce rejected Payton's left-hand layup attempt and a jump shot by Patterson.

	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Brandon Kurtz scored 12 of his 18 points in the
second half and No. 13 Tulsa pulled away for a 64-56 victory over San Jose State
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Heard added 11 points for the Golden Hurricane (25-2, 10-1 WAC), who
outshot San Jose State (13-13, 4-7) 46 percent to 37 percent en route to their
fifth straight victory and 18th in 19 games. Kurtz also had 10 rebounds for
Tulsa, unbeaten in nine meetings with San Jose State.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Garrett, playing his second game since becoming academically eligible,
had 13 points to lead the Spartans. Cory Powell added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose State led by a point at the break and hung with the taller, more
physical Golden Hurricane until wearing down in the late going.
</P>
<P>
	   Garrett hit 3-pointer to pull the Spartans to 41-40 with 8:40 remaining, but
the Golden Hurricane then put together a decisive 12-2 run that put Tulsa up
53-42 with 5:34 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Dante Swanson, left wide open in the left corner, and Marcus Hill, pulling
up from the top of the key, each hit 3-pointers during the flurry.
</P>
<P>
	   After Kurtz hit a turnaround jumper to tie it at 29, Eric Griffin hit a pair
of free throws to put the Spartans back on top.
</P>
<P>
	   But that proved to be San Jose State's final lead as the Golden Hurricane
got five straight points from David Shelton, moving in front 34-31 .
</P>
<P>
	   Garrett hit a 12-foot fallaway jumper moments before halftime, giving San
Jose State a 26-25 lead after being down by five earlier in the period.

<HEADLINE> Strutzel Beats Gray in 800 Meters  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA senior Jess Strutzel beat Johnny Gray in the 800
meters for the second consecutive year in the Los Angeles Invitational indoor
track meet Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	Strutzel, who finished seventh, three places behind Gray, in the 1999 U.S.
national outdoor championships, was timed in 1 minute, 50.11 seconds on the
boards at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
	Gray, four months shy of his 40th birthday, was clocked in 1:50.46. Milton
Brown finished third in 1:50.64.
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Lagat of Kenya, the NCAA 5,000 champion for Washington State last year,
was a runaway winner in the LA Invitational mile with a time of 3:59.60.
</P>
<P>
	Brian Berryhill of Colorado State was second in 4:02.31, and Benjamin Kapsoiya
of Kenya third in 4:05.60.
</P>
<P>
	High jumper Shane Lavy, a former Big 12 champion at Nebraska, proved one of the
highlights of the meet when he cleared 7 feet, 7 1/4 inches. Lawrence Johnson,
who won the pole vault at the 1996 U.S. trials and finished eighth in the Games
at Atlanta, went 18-8 1/4 to win his event.
</P>
<P>
	In the 800, Gray led early, fell back to third as Strutzel moved in front in
the third lap, cut inside and passed Brown in the final turn, but could not
catch Strutzel.
</P>
<P>
	Gray, who hopes to become the first track and field athlete to compete in five
Olympics, was not pleased with the way the race unfolded as he lost for the
first time in four indoor meets this year.
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody could see who had the most energy out there,'' Gray said. ``But I
got boxed in and couldn't quite catch him.
</P>
<P>
	``My training is going great. I'm going up to the Olympic Trials in July to win
the 800, not just to make the team. That will surely show the public my
durability,'' said Gray, who first ran in the LA indoor meet in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	Strutzel, 17 years Gray's junior, also hopes to earn one of the three U.S.
Olympic berths in the 800 in the trials July 14-23 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going for the NCAA titles both indoors and out, hopefully make the
Olympic team, and run under 1:45 this year,'' Strutzel said.
</P>
<P>
	Other LA Invitational winners included 1996 Olympian Amy Acuff, with a height
of 5 feet,, 10 inches in the high jump; Mary Sauer, who cleared 14-2 in the pole
vault; and Von Ware, who went 52-0 3/4 in the triple jump.

<HEADLINE> Coach Abdul-Jabbar Reports to Work  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Midway through the third quarter, Los Angeles Clippers
center Michael Olowokandi moved through heavy traffic on the court and put up a
beautiful baby sky hook.
</P>
<P>
	   A lesson from his new coach, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
	   "We just got poor Kareem in today ... and he was already helpful tonight,"
Clippers coach Jim Todd said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, that would be Kareem as in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the NBA's career
scoring leader -- and the Clippers newest assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-time MVP made his NBA coaching debut Saturday, flying to Chicago to
meet the Clippers a day after he was hired. As the Clippers walked into the
United Center, a few of them couldn't help but sneak peaks at the big man
hanging out in the hallway outside their locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   "Definitely you step back and you say, 'Wow,"' Olowokandi said. "Any time
you have an addition such as Kareem, who's been there and who's experienced with
what it takes to win and win championships, that's always a good thing."
</P>
<P>
	   Abdul-Jabbar has long wanted to be a coach, even taking a job for five
months -- and a $1 salary -- last year as an assistant at an Apache high school
in Arizona. While the 7-foot-2 Abdul-Jabbar's primary responsibilities will be
teaching fundamentals and working work with the Clippers' two big men,
Olowokandi (7-0) and Keith Closs (7-3), he's willing to do just about anything
Todd asks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel I have knowledge that's not really being transferred across the
generations," he said. "The game really isn't being taught very well at this
point and time, and a lot of things that I know seem to be going by the wayside.
I felt I could do something about that."
</P>
<P>
	   And Todd is glad to have him. The Clippers have been struggling defensively
almost as long as they've been in existence -- only Dallas and Detroit are
giving up more points a game -- and Todd hopes Abdul-Jabbar can help. Todd also
hired former NBA great Dennis Johnson, a member of three championship teams, as
an assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping with him and DJ -- we've got two of the top defensive guys of
the NBA of all time -- that some of that stuff is going to rub off," Todd said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Abdul-Jabbar is so new to the job -- he met with Olowokandi and Closs
before the game to get up to speed on the rules changes in the 11 years since he
retired -- he's not quite sure what kind of a coach he'll be. A screamer? A
stomper? The silent type?
</P>
<P>
	   He was quiet for much of Saturday's game, sitting next to Todd with his head
towering above everyone else's. But when Tyrone Nesby managed to call a timeout
while falling out of bounds, Abdul-Jabbar jumped up, nodding his head and walked
over to Nesby to slap hands.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that's something that will evolve," Abdul-Jabbar said of his
coaching style, smiling. "But my role model in all of this is John Wooden. I
hope to be able to do some of the things he did."
</P>
<P>
	   Abdul-Jabbar retired after the 1988-89 season with 38,387 points in a record
57,446 minutes. The 52-year-old Hall of Famer averaged 24.6 points, 11.2
rebounds and 3.6 assists in his 20-season career -- six with the Milwaukee Bucks
and 14 with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   He played on six championship teams -- the first with Milwaukee in 1971, and
the final five with the Lakers in the 1980s. He also led UCLA to three NCAA
championships and an 88-2 overall record in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Unlike Magic Johnson, who took a role in the Lakers' front office when he
retired, and Michael Jordan, who only took a year off before buying part of the
Washington Wizards franchise, Abdul-Jabbar was out of the game for years before
he even thought about going back.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't necessarily miss being in the NBA," he said. "But as time went on,
I saw that I had some knowledge that could help people in the NBA. I don't see
the game being coached very well at the most basic levels of the game, grade
school and high school and sometimes even college."
</P>
<P>
	   Though he's best known for his 14 years with the Lakers -- who could ever
forget Abdul-Jabbar in his purple shorts and goggles, using the most delicate of
touches on his sky hook? -- he said it won't be that strange to make the
transition to Los Angeles' other team.
</P>
<P>
	   Or will it?
</P>
<P>
	   "It's kind of odd, but a couple of my friends ended up in the same position.
Norm Nixon and Jamaal Wilkes ended up playing for the Lakers," he said. "I mean
the Clippers."

Bush Takes Momentum From McCain in S.C.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- With 99 percent of the vote counted, George W. Bush
had 301,050 votes, or 53 percent, to John McCain's 237,888 or 42 percent, in
South Carolina's GOP Primary. Alan Keyes was a faraway third at 25,510, or 5
percent. Bush snatched momentum from his insurgent rival as the race heads into
an 18-state sprint over 17 days. Bush needed to win here to stall McCain's
surge, and indeed for months his campaign had seen South Carolina as a
tradition-minded "firewall state" which could blunt any damage from the chars of
New Hampshire. The Texas governor had a huge lead in early polling but McCain
closed the gap in the past 10 days -- only to see Bush mount a $4 million
campaign with help from interest groups and surrogates who questioned McCain's
conservative credentials.

Iran Reformists Appear To Lead Vote
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Reformers promising wider freedoms appeared to be well
on their way toward taking control of Iran's parliament from hard-liners
Saturday, according to results for more than half the contested seats. State
television said results have been declared for 168 of the 290 seats, but it did
not give the affiliations of the elected lawmakers. But the official Islamic
Republic News Agency said about 67 percent of those seats --or about 112 -- went
to reformists, 25 percent were won by hard-liners and the rest were taken by
independents. If the trend continues, which appears likely, reformists will oust
hard-liners from power in the parliament for the first time since the 1979
revolution put clerics in charge of the country.

150,000 Protest Against Haider

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- More than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators crammed
a historic Vienna square on a cold, rainy Saturday evening in the largest
protest yet against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
Vienna police estimated 150,000 people attended the main rally. It ended
peacefully Saturday night after four hours. Anti-government rallies have become
a near-daily practice in Vienna since the new government coalition took office
Feb. 4. The outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU
expansion, as well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has
since apologized.

U.S. Pushes for Lower Oil Prices

oil-producing countries to lift production limits that have sent heating oil
prices soaring in the United States. Mexican officials said they shared
Richardson's concern about inflation, but would respect a "gentlemen's
agreement" with other producers not to increase output before April 1.
Richardson told a news conference after the meeting that U.S. officials were
worried about production levels and the low level of oil inventories.

Egyptian President Visits Lebanon

Saturday, meeting with his Lebanese counterpart and expressing support for the
guerrillas who are fighting Israeli occupation of a section of southern Lebanon.
President Hosni Mubarak's visit demonstrated the two nations' solidarity in the
face of recent Israeli airstrikes here. Mubarak held talks with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud. Israel occupies a strip of territory inside Lebanon,
where its soldiers engage guerrillas to keep them away from the border. The
Hezbollah guerrilla group is trying to force the Israelis to withdraw. The area
is the last active Arab-Israeli war front.

Bulls Defeat Clippers 74-72
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Chris Carr hit a 3-pointer with 27 seconds left, and Will
Perdue made his only free throw of the game 13 seconds later to seal the Chicago
Bulls' 74-72 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday night in a
matchup of the NBA's worst teams. Eric Piatkowski tipped in Michael Olowokandi's
miss with 5.8 seconds to go, but the Clippers dropped the inbounds pass on their
next possession and Troy Hudson missed a long 3-pointer at the buzzer. The loss
gives the Clippers the dubious distinction of fewest victories (11) and worst
winning percentage (.208) in the league.

the Panthers, who had their four-game home winning streak snapped in front of
their first sellout crowd of the season.

	OSAKA, Japan (AP) -- The city of Osaka opened its campaign for the 2008 Summer
Olympics on Sunday with concerts, speeches and traditional performances aimed at
rallying public support.
</P>
<P>
	Osaka, Japan's second-largest city and its historical commercial hub, made its
official bid Jan. 25. Nine other cities, including Beijing, also are competing
for the games.
</P>
<P>
	At an office and convention complex in the center of the city, Osaka Mayor
Takafumi Isomura urged his countrymen to back the effort to bring the Summer
Games back to Japan for the first time since the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.
</P>
<P>
	``The most important thing is for everyone in the country to make an appeal
before the IOC,'' Isomura told a crowd of several hundred.
</P>
<P>
	Isomura also said he expected an especially clean bidding process under new
International Olympic Committee rules imposed after the organization's biggest
corruption scandal surrounding the 2002 Winter Games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
	Candidate cities are expected to undergo a rigorous review to make sure they
meet minimum requirements. The winner will be selected by secret IOC ballot in
Moscow in July 2001.
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's events included traditional ``taiko'' drumming, a ``Shorinji'' martial
arts demonstration, a concert, a rally walk in the park surrounding Osaka's
castle, and a symposium of former Olympians, including swimmer Mark Spitz, who
won seven gold medals in the 1972 Munich games.

Bush Defeats McCain in South Carolina
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- George W. Bush snatched momentum from his insurgent
rival John McCain on Saturday to win South Carolina's GOP primary. Exit polls in
South Carolina showed that McCain failed to best Bush on some of his strongest
points. The former Vietnam prisoner of war aggressively recruited veterans, but
only managed to split their vote with Bush. And the man who rides the "Straight
Talk Express" didn't score as a reformer and he didn't fare any better than Bush
when voters were asked to name the candidate who says what he believes. On
Tuesday Republicans will select delegates in Michigan and McCain's home state of
Arizona, with three contests coming a week later.

	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Rebels holding out in Chechnya's southern mountains
shot down a Russian helicopter that was targeting the militants' last

Russians have squeezed the Chechens into a few regions in the breakaway
republic's rugged south, and concentrated air and artillery fire Saturday on the
Argun and Vedeno gorges. Russian warplanes and helicopters flew more than 150
missions in Chechnya over the previous 24 hours, striking targets in the two
gorges, which slice south through the mountains to the Georgian border, the

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Egypt's president paid a key visit to Lebanon on
Saturday, meeting with his Lebanese counterpart and expressing support for the
guerrillas who are fighting Israeli occupation of a section of southern Lebanon.
President Hosni Mubarak's visit demonstrated the two nations' solidarity in the
face of recent Israeli airstrikes here. Mubarak held talks with Lebanese
President Emile Lahoud. Israel occupies a strip of territory inside Lebanon,
where its soldiers engage guerrillas to keep them away from the border. The
Hezbollah guerrilla group is trying to force the Israelis to withdraw. The area
is the last active Arab-Israeli war front.

John Lennon Files To Be Released
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal judge ordered the FBI to release notes from a
phone conversation and two letters about John Lennon, the Beatles singer who was
murdered in 1980. According to the FBI, 10 pages of Lennon's file were withheld
at the request of a foreign government that had given the FBI the documents. The
release of the documents was prompted by author and historian Jon Wiener, who
filed a federal Freedom of Information Act request in 1983 to obtain all U.S.
government documents on Lennon. The ACLU, which joined Wiener's attempt to
obtain the files, said the FBI under the Nixon administration used surveillance
in an attempt to deport Lennon due to his opposition to the Vietnam War.

	   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Marc Savard's second goal, a deflection 35 seconds
into overtime, gave the Calgary Flames a 3-2 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on
Saturday night. Bill Lindsay also scored for Calgary, which won its NHL-record
11th overtime game. The Flames also won on consecutive nights for the first time
this season -- they beat the Oilers 4-2 Friday night. Jarome Iginla assisted on
both of Savard's goals to extend his points streak to 10 games. Ryan Smyth and
Todd Marchant scored for Edmonton.

	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 27 points and Vin Baker hit four straight
baskets in the final five minutes as the Seattle SuperSonics beat the Boston
Celtics 94-91 on Saturday night. Baker, who sat out the first six minutes of the
fourth quarter, made the four straight shots after Boston's Antoine Walker tied
it at 83 with five minutes left. Payton's free throw gave the Sonics a 94-91
lead with 15.7 seconds remaining.

<HEADLINE> Mexico School Activists Release Cops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Angered by the arrest of students and supporters,
activists in a rural school dispute surrounded dozens of unarmed police officers
Saturday and held them captive for almost 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The confrontation began after the arrest of students who had occupied the El
Mexe Rural Teachers College in Tepatepec, a town 50 miles north of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
	   The government's Notimex news agency said 68 officers were held in
Tepatepec's town plaza before being freed late Saturday night after jailed
students were released.
</P>
<P>
	   Notimex said a large crowd of students, supporters and townspeople had
stripped the officers of their shirts and shoes and bound them with rope.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier students took over the school and demanded the ouster of
administrators, who student spokesman Victor Soto said had ties to state
officials profiting from the proceeds of the school's lands.
</P>
<P>
	   They also staged a sit-in in front of the state government palace in the
state capital in Pachuca. A government statement said ''900 pseudostudents''
tried to seize the palace at 3 a.m. Sunday but were repulsed, with no injuries
but several arrests.
</P>
<P>
	   Hidalgo state Gov. Manuel Angel Nunez said administrators had been trying to
crack down on student political organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said police recaptured the El Mexe school itself on Saturday
morning. The 176 students inside were being questioned by police and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions apparently infuriated the students and their supporters, who
seized the unarmed policemen.

<HEADLINE> More Whites Have Glaucoma Surgery  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A survey of Medicare claims found blacks were about half as
likely as whites to undergo surgery for glaucoma, the most common cause of
blindness in black Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors, whose study appears in the February issue of Archives of
Ophthalmology, say their data from the early 1990s suggests the disparity in
surgery rates may be narrowing slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   But, they wrote, "A major change in the public health policies in the United
States may be needed if we hope to see a further narrowing of the gap."
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, the nation's second-leading
cause of irreversible vision loss. The authors note that more than $1 billion
yearly is spent on federal aid to blind glaucoma patients, who number about
120,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaucoma is characterized by a buildup of pressure within the eyeball,
typically caused by a blockage of fluid that normally bathes the eye. Excessive
pressure may damage the optic nerve and result in vision loss. The most common
form usually occurs after age 40. Treatment typically begins with medication,
followed by surgery -- either conventional or with lasers -- if that fails.
</P>
<P>
	   The disease is at least four times more prevalent in black Americans than in
whites, but the current study and others suggest blacks are undertreated.
</P>
<P>
	   The authors, led by Dr. Uday Devgan, a UCLA ophthalmologist, analyzed
Medicare claims for both types of glaucoma surgery for 30,495 blacks and 160,792
whites submitted between 1991 and 1994. Patients were at least 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   From calculations of glaucoma prevalence in patients of both races in that
age group, the authors determined that the rate of surgical procedures for
blacks was nearly half that of whites and 47 percent below what would have been
expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous researchers found similar disparities when examining Medicare
records from the late 1980s through 1991, the authors noted. Though Devgan and
colleagues found a slight trend toward higher surgery rates for blacks in the
latter part of their study, they said the disparities were nonetheless
troubling.
</P>
<P>
	   Racial disparities also have been found in rates for other ailments,
including heart disease treatments and knee and hip replacements. The glaucoma
authors say reasons for the disparities may be similar to possibilities raised
by previous studies -- lack of health-care access, inadequate education about
the disease, overtreatment of whites and racial bias.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Mills, a University of Kentucky ophthalmologist involved in
national glaucoma research, said cultural factors also may play a role.
</P>
<P>
	   "Black patients tend to be less willing to agree to surgery when recommended
than do Caucasians," said Mills, who was not involved in the study.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still looking at disparities for which we don't have complete
explanations," Mills said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study did not include information on claims from Medicare HMOs or
Veterans Affairs hospitals, which could push the numbers higher. The authors
also did not look at surgery rates before age 65, and said it's possible --
though not likely -- that blacks may have more glaucoma surgery before age 65
than whites.

<HEADLINE> Sporting Goods Officials Worried  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA DREYFUSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaders in the sporting goods industry worry that the new
generation of customers, kids now in school, may miss the games that keep the
industry in business.
</P>
<P>
	   The officials are setting aside money for a lobbying drive to pass federal
legislation that would encourage school districts to expand physical education.
The hope is that, if more kids learn in school to enjoy sports, the industry
will start to grow again.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sporting goods industry has been too tied up in the pro games and the
glamor, and not about the average people playing the game," said Jim Baugh,
president of Wilson Sporting Goods. "People have become less active. They may be
increasing the fan base, but fans do not mean participants."
</P>
<P>
	   In a meeting spearheaded by Baugh, officials of leading manufacturers,
retailers and trade groups decided on a two-tiered strategy of encouraging
physical education and of consumer awareness of the need for being active. The
meeting took place Feb. 11 in Atlanta at The Super Show, the Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association's annual exposition.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislative part of the strategy is to pass a $400 million program of
incentive grants for local school districts to improve their PE programs, said
Tom Cove, the manufacturers association's vice president for government
relations. To help get that done, participants in the meeting pledged "what we
regard as seed money, more than $1 million over the next couple years, and most
likely significantly more," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, however, $1 million is not big bucks. "The money will buy
more of the ability to spread the word, rather than hard-core lobbying
resources," Cove said. His goal is to attach the PE bill, introduced by Sen. Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska, to a major school funding reauthorization that has a greater
chance of passing. And Cove wants allies to help him do it.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the allies is Judy Young, executive director of the National
Association for Sport and Physical Education, a professional group. Her
organization is urging members to write their senators to get the PE funds
cleared.
</P>
<P>
	   But supporters will have to fight off activists who would rather use the
money for academics, Young said. People like PE in the abstract but tend to cut
programs when the choices become specific. "We have a lot of academic pressure
right now," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, PE has an enormous need, Baugh said. Only one state,
Illinois, requires physical education daily from kindergarten through 12th
grade. "I don't think we've done a good job of promoting the health needs of
America," he said. "If (kids) don't get their bodies healthy, their minds are
not going to be healthy."
</P>
<P>
	   This generation plays a lot of its games on the computer or the television.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are a lot of different things competing for leisure time," said Larry
Weindruch, spokesman for the National Sporting Goods Association, a
retail-oriented trade group. And compared to the constant involvement of a video
game, it's just not as interesting to a kid to be "standing in right field,
waiting for someone to hit a fly ball to you," he said. The job of the new
coalition is to show kids it is interesting, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Physical activity has been declining. In 1987, 23 percent of children ages
12-17 participated in an activity involving fitness on at least 100 occasions,
according to American Sports Data Inc., a polling firm. By 1997, the rate was
down to 19 percent, the company said. Meanwhile, childhood obesity was going up,
and more than 1 in 5 adolescents are overweight, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Physical education is an important factor in whether kids grow into adults
with a lifelong interest in physical activity, said American Sports Data's
president, Harvey Lauer. A survey found that, of adults who exercised 250 or
more days a year, 60 percent said high school physical education classes
encouraged them to be active later in life. Only 10 percent of sedentary adults
felt they got encouragement in high school.
</P>
<P>
	   For the industry, a lot is riding on this. Equipment sales for 1998, the
latest year of association data, totaled $18.6 million, down 2 percent from
1997. Essentially, industry sales are flat, said Thomas B. Doyle, the National
Sporting Goods Association's vice president for information and research.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest buyers of sporting goods are those from college age through 35,
so growing a big new buyers' market from elementary school is a long-term
project, Doyle said. But the industry leaders know their businesses will be hurt
later if they don't get active now, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And research has shown that adults who stay inactive run higher risks of
conditions ranging from overweight to diabetes and heart disease, as well as an
early death. "If we take health seriously, let's take PE seriously," Doyle said.

<HEADLINE> Tonsillectomy Alternative Proposed  </HEADLINE>
    By JOANN LOVIGLIO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A new procedure promises to shrink swollen tonsils
without the excessive discomfort and bleeding of a traditional tonsillectomy.
But does it mean patients won't need ice cream afterward?
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Mansoor Madani says his patients can feel free to indulge if they
choose, but they won't be motivated by pain.
</P>
<P>
	   Madani says he has developed an alternative to tonsillectomies that works
just as well as surgery but without the drawbacks. He has performed the
procedure, which uses radiofrequency-generated heat to shrink tonsils and takes
only a few minutes, on 13 patients so far.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just like when you put certain foods in the microwave and they shrink.
It is very similar to microwave energy, but the heat is not nearly as high,"
said Madani, an associate professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery at Temple
University and director of The Center for Corrective Surgery Techniques in Bryn
Mawr.
</P>
<P>
	   In the procedure, which takes about one minute, Madani inserts a
heat-emitting probe about the size of a needle into three spots on each tonsil
for a few seconds each.
</P>
<P>
	   The needle -- heated to about 120 to 150 degrees -- slowly shrinks the
tonsils like a water balloon being stuck with a pin, with most patients seeing
complete results in about eight weeks, Madani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Because the procedure is considered experimental, the cost -- approximately
$2,000 -- is not covered by insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew Addiego of Burlington, N.J., who suffered for years from recurring
tonsil infections and sleeping problems, long considered having his enlarged
tonsils removed but did not want to go through the traditional surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Addiego, who recently underwent Madani's "tonsillar coblation" procedure,
said, "I didn't want to be laid up for a week and a half."
</P>
<P>
	   "This took five minutes, and most of that time was the doctor's explanation.
I was awake through the whole thing."
</P>
<P>
	   He suffered only a mild sore throat after the procedure, which he had done
during his lunch hour from work. He was able to eat right away and suffered only
minor discomfort -- unlike some patients who have to subsist on ice cream and
ice chips after a radical tonsillectomy.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only side effect is that I sleep better than ever before; I used to
snore myself awake," Addiego said. "Now my head hits the pillow and I'm out."
</P>
<P>
	   Madani had been using the technology on patients' noses and mouths for
several years to treat chronic nasal congestion and snoring before trying it out
on tonsils. He plans to report his findings in April to the American College of
Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons conference in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The procedure holds promise, but it is unclear whether the positive results
will last, said Dr. Ralph Wetmore, chairman of the tonsils and adenoids
subcommittee of the American Academy of Otolaryngology and a professor at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly if you shrink the tonsil and it stays reduced, it would offer
significantly less (of a chance of) morbidity than performing a tonsillectomy,
but it's unknown what the long-term results are," Wetmore said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wetmore said it also may be a difficult procedure to perform on children
because they would be awake.
</P>
<P>
	   "Its benefits are probably better achieved in the adult population," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Rivals Newt As Fund-Raiser  </HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER LOVEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In his first year as House speaker, Dennis Hastert showed
he could match the political money-raising operation of his more outgoing
predecessor, Newt Gingrich, to benefit the Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At this stage ... Hastert's been able to achieve about the same bottom
line as Gingrich did, with a whole lot less flair,'' said Marshall Wittmann of
the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Illinois Republican's style, vastly different from Gingrich's
in-your-face conservatism, makes that bottom line surprising to some colleagues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a perception among particularly hard-core, real, true Republicans
in the country that there is a huge void now that Newt is gone,'' said Rep. Ray
LaHood, R-Ill. ``But the rank and file in our conference and the party people in
Washington know he's doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gingrich, R-Ga., was known for lengthy speeches filled with passionate,
acerbic rhetoric. He demanded near-complete control of events. He brought along
large entourages, and frequent television appearances secured his role as the
party's national standard-bearer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's speeches are short, to-the-point and nonconfrontational. He often
prefers more intimate settings and does little television. He travels with only
a couple of aides.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingrich ``wanted to do everything with Barnum-and-Bailey style. In
contrast, Hastert views his role as the guy who quietly, behind the scenes,
without much fanfare, shakes the money tree,'' Heritage Foundation's Wittmann
said.
</P>
<P>
	   In his little more than a year as speaker, Hastert has attended fund-raisers
for 52 colleagues, several more than once, in addition to dozens of party events
and lobbyist meet-and-greets, said John McGovern, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   The overall fund-raising numbers for Gingrich and Hastert are difficult to
compare.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1995, Gingrich's first year as speaker, he raised $1.9 million for his
re-election campaign and $461,000 for his leadership fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastert's total last year was slightly more: $2.39 million combined for his
campaign and leadership political action committees, split about evenly between
the two. He has added $100,000 more through a PAC based in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingrich's fund-raising prowess continued even out of office. His leadership
PAC took in $1.38 million last year -- $230,000 more than Hastert's fund.
</P>
<P>
	   But PAC figures represent only part of what a House speaker raises.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimates of the total Gingrich gathered for Republicans in his first year
hovered around $28 million. Hastert, meanwhile, raised $14 million in 1999 and
$6 million more in January, McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
	   Such staff-generated totals easily are exaggerated by including direct mail
and phone solicitations that include only mentions of the leader's name or
events where several politicians were hosts.
</P>
<P>
	   McGovern said he includes only money Hastert raised himself, or events at
which he alone was the host. That was not the practice for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingrich already had a potent fund-raising network when he was elevated to
speaker after the Republicans took control of the House in 1994. The federal arm
of GOPAC, the state-based committee Gingrich formed in the 1980s, took in $4
million in the 1993-1994 election cycle, mostly transfers from the larger state
fund.
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Hastert rose from near-obscurity to speaker after Gingrich and
the Republicans' choice to replace him, Bob Livingston, resigned suddenly during
President Clinton's impeachment. Hastert's leadership PAC raised only $130,603
in 1997-1998, the cycle before he took office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact is that it's stunning that Denny Hastert, who came from virtual
anonymity, has been able to ramp up a veritable fund-raising machine in just a
year,'' said former New York GOP Rep. Bill Paxon, who led the National
Republican Campaign Committee in the 1994 and 1996 elections.

<HEADLINE> Little Richard Says Movie Accurate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MACON, Ga. (AP) -- Little Richard has proclaimed that a television movie
about his life is "pretty good and pretty accurate," even if it leaves out some
of the most important stuff.
</P>
<P>
	   He told his hometown newspaper, the Macon Telegraph, that the movie is too
short to tell the whole story.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two hours, an hour and a half with commercials, that's not a long time,"
said Richard, who served as the movie's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
	   He says the movie, which aired Sunday on NBC, doesn't address his influence
on other rock legends such as the Beatles, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix -- who
got his start as Richard's guitarist.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think they spent enough time on the music, personally, because I am
the architect of it. I started it," he said. "Rhythm and Blues had a baby, and
somebody named it rock 'n' roll. And it came out of Macon, Georgia."

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Beach Boy Brian Wilson intends to continue

<HEADLINE> McCain Stumble Could Help Bradley  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bill Bradley hopes the McCain drain is over.
</P>
<P>
	   Relegated to the status of junior reformer for nearly three weeks, Bradley
says Sen. John McCain's loss in South Carolina clears the way for his own
struggling Democratic campaign to renew the pitch to independents and moderate
Democrats who have been moving toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's gotten a shot of oxygen which had been drawn out of his campaign by
McCain,'' said Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University.
``In American politics there can only be one novelty at a time, and McCain has
been the novelty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once Bradley's partner in spreading the message of reform, McCain has been
the focus of attention since his Feb. 1 upset of Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire, where he won support from independents and crossover Democrats -- the
same group Bradley had hoped to attract.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, returning from a campaign swing to Seattle, was flying high over
the Dakotas when an aide delivered the news of McCain's loss in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we're back, and we're able to make the case that we're out there to get
all the votes,'' Bradley told cheering supporters a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Sunday about the opportunity created by McCain's loss, Bradley said,
``I think I'm making a strong case to all Americans, independents and Democrats
and even some Republicans to bring them over to our side, and we're having some
success,'' he said on ABC's ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by satellite from St. Louis, where mechanical trouble forced his
plane to land Saturday night, Bradley said the South Carolina results show that
``it's tough for a reformer to win against entrenched power, against the
establishment power. I think I learned that, and I think John McCain learned
that last night.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, and his current strategy
places a premium on Washington state, which holds a nonbinding primary Feb. 29
-- the only Democratic vote in advance of the March 7 contests, when 16 states
hold primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   But while McCain has gained against Bush in national polls, Bradley has
slumped farther behind Gore -- a deficit of about 40 percentage points in the
latest surveys. He is trails in the polls in California, the biggest of the
March 7 prizes, and in New York, where he played professional basketball for 10
years before running for Senate in neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledges the need to win some of the March 7 contests. He
campaigned in Northeastern states last week and was returning to New York for a
Monday debate with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're making up ground,'' Bradley said. ``We're moving in Connecticut,
Rhode Island, we're moving in New York, and we're going to have a big contest
Feb. 29 in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the spotlight focused on McCain in recent weeks, Bradley made the case
that McCain's ``presence in the race actually helps me, because what it does is
it focuses on reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has taken time to stress distinctions between himself and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's against abortion rights, I'm for abortion rights. He's against gun
control, I'm for gun control,'' Bradley told reporters Friday in Minneapolis, on
his way to Seattle. ``He doesn't have thoughts about how to resolve the 44
million people without health insurance in America. I've put out a very specific
program to do that. ... He has an environmental record that's not good. I have
an excellent environmental record.''

<HEADLINE> Russians Not Fazed by Shady Banks  </HEADLINE>
    By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- For most Russians, banks are not symbols of stability. They
exist not for lending or protecting money, but rather to serve the needs of
business, which sometimes requires hiding income from the government.
</P>
<P>
	   This world, where banks appear and disappear, often to little notice by
regulators, is the backdrop of a $7 billion money-laundering scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   The murky maze of Russian banking was on display last week in New York,
where a former Bank of New York executive and her husband pleaded guilty to
money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucy Edwards, the bank's former Eastern European Division vice president,
and Peter Berlin admitted helping Russian bankers wash the billions through
accounts at the bank in order to avoid Russian taxes and to cover up the money's
connection to crimes -- including money used as ransom for a kidnapping in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   The case also revealed the operations of so-called 'pocket banks,'
established to take care of the financial transactions of an individual company.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Edwards, Berlin and unidentified Russian coconspirators
offered to transfer money in and out of Russia via two such pocket banks, making
it easier to avoid complying with currency control regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   In that case, customers were assured that funds would be transferred abroad
without them having to open an account at an authorized bank or provide a
contract, an import transaction passport, or a permit authorizing such a
transfer.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the funds were transferred abroad by two Russian banks, DKB
and Flamingo, using correspondent bank accounts at The Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian businesses also directed customers to pay for goods or services by
wiring funds to front companies set up by Berlin. They then received the
proceeds in cash from DKB in Russia or had DKB wire the funds from the front
companies' accounts to offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Oleg Solovov, former deputy manager at DKB, said his bank had done nothing
wrong according to Russian law.
</P>
<P>
	   "If someone wants to send money abroad ... if they submit all the proper
papers, the bank has no right not to conduct the transfer," he told ORT
television on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The DKB and Flamingo banks have gone out of business, but the prominent
banks that established them, Sobinbank and MDM, are still on the scene.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander Mamut, who had close ties with former President Boris Yeltsin's
inner circle, was a Sobinbank board member who later took the helm of MDM. He
has denied any wrongdoing. MDM says it had no dealing with either DKB or
Flamingo since 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Sobinbank officials could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last autumn police raided offices of both Flamingo and Sobinbank.
</P>
<P>
	   At Flamingo, they found $535,000 whose origin bank officials had trouble
explaining. In Sobinbank's vault, officials found $1.6 million and 13 pounds of
gold ingots, hidden in a niche. The money's owner, a top official in the
state-controlled company that manufactures space rockets, said it came from a
bank loan intended to help build a country home outside Moscow. He denied
knowing where the gold came from.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian police said at the time that money suspected to have been channeled
to Bank of New York via Flamingo came from Sobinbank, but no legal action has
followed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nor have government promises to restructure the country's banking system and
introduce stricter regulations since a national financial crisis in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   A state agency charged with rebuilding the banking system after the crisis
hasn't had the power or determination to stop bank owners from siphoning off
assets.
</P>
<P>
	   And Russian officials have so far kept mum on Edwards' and Berlin's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the sea of questions left in the case is what affect -- if any -- it
will have on acting President Vladmir Putin, who is running to keep his spot for
good on March 26.
</P>
<P>
	   He has spoken often of his commitment to combating corruption and has worked
to distance himself from his predecessor's scandal-tinged administration. But
his determination to investigate allegations against Yeltsin's inner circle
remains to be proven.
</P>
<P>
	   Nikolai Petrov, a political analyst with the Carnegie Endowment, said he
believes Putin may sanction legal proceedings against some of the most
controversial Russian tycoons in the run-up to the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the former security chief, he definitely has plenty of evidence against
any of them," Petrov said in a telephone interview. "Every leading businessman
here has somehow broken the law."

<HEADLINE> Nun: Cuban Grandma Wanted To Defect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A nun who arranged a reunion between Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban grandmothers began advocating for the boy to stay in the United States
after learning that one of them wanted to defect, The Miami Herald reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with the grandmothers last month at her home in Miami Beach,
Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, said she was giving
up her previously announced neutrality.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin told the Herald she had not talked publicly about why she
abandoned her neutral stance because she did not want ``to endanger the family
in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``But this is more about that little boy than anyone else, and I have to do
whatever I can to help him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said Roger Bernstein, one of the lawyers retained by Elian's Miami
relatives, had visited her and persuaded her to tell what she knew to help his
case.
</P>
<P>
	   Her change of heart came after speaking alone to both women for about five
minutes and then spending a few minutes alone with Elian's maternal grandmother.
</P>
<P>
	   When one of the grandmothers spoke to her about defecting, she questioned
whether Cuba was the best place for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This talk of defecting got me to thinking; if one of the adults wanted
out, perhaps it was not a good place for the child,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been the center of controversy since he was found clinging to an
inner tube on Thanksgiving Day off the Florida coast. His mother and 10 others
traveling with him in an effort to flee Cuba drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is currently staying with his Miami relatives. The U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his return to Cuba and his
father, but Elian's U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami judge will hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court has
jurisdiction in the case.

<HEADLINE> Problems Cited at Airplane Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A federal audit of aircraft manufacturer McDonnell
Douglas found problems at the facility that built the Alaska Airlines jet which
crashed last month off the California coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit -- performed in the early 1990s -- found employees at the
company's Long Beach, Calif. facility performed sloppy work, improperly
inspected parts and used out-of-date blueprints, the Los Angeles Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-83 that crashed into the Pacific on Jan. 31 was delivered to the
Alaska Airlines in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration said manufacturing procedures at the
plant were marred by chronic breakdowns, but the deficiencies did not threaten
flight safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't deliver an airplane unless it meets all of our quality
standards,'' said John Thom, a spokesman for the Boeing Co., which acquired
McDonnell Douglas in 1997. ``We have processes in place, and there are checks
along the way. It is in our own self-interest to produce quality and safe
airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 reported problems with the aircraft's
horizontal stabilizer and were trying to correct them when the plane crashed,
killing all 88 aboard. No official cause of the crash has been determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The Douglas Aircraft Co., where the plane was built, had been struggling
financially at the time of the audit. The McDonnell Douglas subsidiary posted a
$222 million operating loss for 1989, according to The Times, and was straining
to fill orders for its jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   Supervisors urged employees to improve their work in January 1991, shortly
before a team of federal auditors arrived. Still, the FAA audit still found
problems throughout the production line.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 has a strong safety track record, according to FAA data.
Mechanical problems with its horizontal stabilizer, however, have prompted the
FAA to order mandatory inspections five times since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   After the January crash, the FAA ordered the inspection of the horizontal
stabilizer on more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, which
use similar control mechanisms as the jet which crashed.

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Court N.Y. Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are ``morally blind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' Gore said to laughter
from the audience at the Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady each had warm words for the other.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She stands for the best values of New York state,'' Gore said. ``Her voice
will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up for her.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The appearance marked the first time the two had campaigned together in New
York, where Clinton is making history as the first first lady to seek public
office. The race has pitted her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   The church service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored by
the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before Gore and
Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the Apollo Theater
in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference brings together hundreds of the state's top black and
Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York
state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998
election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
``for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters.''

<HEADLINE> 'The New Yorker' magazine celebrates 75 years in print  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bylines glimpsed in The New Yorker since its 1925 debut:
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath, W.B. Yeats.
<P>
	   Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
	   W.H. Auden, Ogden Nash, James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
	   With the magazine's double-issue now on news stands, the ghosts of authors
and artists past help celebrate the venerable publication's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Snatches of their vivid pictures and prose dot the magazine pages under the
headline "Takes," standing alongside a current offering about Fidel Castro's
public relations war over Elian Gonzalez. There's also an analysis of Martha
Stewart which concludes she taps into the power "of the woman who sits down at
the table with the men, and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips."
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Allen is back, ending his long hiatus as a contributing writer.
</P>
<P>
	   The man best known for his films and a headline-grabbing romance/marriage
with longtime paramour Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, Allen penned "Attention
Geniuses: Cash Only" for his return to the magazine. The piece is a rambling,
off-the-wall story of a therapist who daydreams of accepting a musician's work
in lieu of cash. It's disastrous, of course, as the man's song titles include
"The Earthworms of Tuscany."
</P>
<P>
	   The story is an amusing, fulfilling one of David Remnick's priorities as The
New Yorker's fifth editor. Allen has a tough time, however, competing with the
magazine's alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a sampling of the competition's work:
</P>
<P>
	   -E.B. White on learning to crank start the Model T: "It was a special trick
and until you learned it (usually from another Ford owner, but sometimes by a
period of appalling experimentation) you might as well have been winding up an
awning," White wrote in 1936. "Often, if the emergency brake hadn't been pulled
all the way back, the car advanced on you ... I can still feel my old Ford
nuzzling me at the curb, as though looking for an apple in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   -Vladimir Nabokov on butterflies: "Through the smells of the marsh, I caught
the subtle perfume of butterfly wings on my hands, a perfume that varies with
the species; it was vanilla, or lemon, or musk, or a musty, sweetish odor
difficult to define."
</P>
<P>
	   -And Philip Hamburger on Mussolini's execution and subsequent hanging: "To
an outsider like myself, who happened to be on hand to see Mussolini, Clara
Petacci, Pavolini Starace, and some of the other Fascists dangling by their
heels from a rusty beaming front of a gas station, the breathless, bloody scene
had an air of inevitability. You had the feeling, as you have at the final
curtain of a good play, that events could not have been otherwise."
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Wallace Ross, a self-taught man rumored teasingly by his staff to
have finished reading but one book in his life, founded The New Yorker in 1925,
at first with the breezy about-town flair of 1920s New York. Later, under the
gentle guidance of Katherine White, who shepherded serious fiction onto its
pages, the magazine began to take shape. It took on the voice that resonates
today, somehow conjuring the whispers of Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein in
the cafes of Paris, witty, intelligent, and yes, a little too full of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ross was an aggressively ignorant man, with a head full of odd scraps of
information and misinformation," reported longtime staffer Brendan Gill in his
1975 book "Here at The New Yorker." Driving home the point, he explains that
Ross might likely badger an author with the question: "Is Moby Dick the whale or
the man?"
</P>
<P>
	   Something of that tone comes through on the pages of The New Yorker even
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current Commentary offered by Anthony Lane, Thurber is remembered
with the following quote: "Two overcoats which he left in The New Yorker office
last spring were stolen, or else he left them someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   And much later, from Donald Barthelme in a "The Talk of the Town" recipe:
"About twenty pounds of sliced onion would be a good addition, although they
probably should have gone in earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   It's that tone, that something, that Remnick hopes to see more of.
</P>
<P>
	   After 18 months as editor, he says he still can't wait to put his pants on
every morning and come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine has had its troubles in recent years, including flagging
circulation and advertising sales, but all that appears to be on the rebound.
Circulation is up to 844,000 from 628,000 in recent years, and ad pages are up
37 percent this quarter, according to the director of public relations. About
76.7 percent of subscribers renew.
</P>
<P>
	   That means Remnick can focus on the fun stuff, like weekly cartoon meetings
and soothing ruffled writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real joy. Sure, it's exhausting and even once in a blue moon
frustrating and it's always difficult. It's always difficult to do the best you
can in so many ways," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He says Anthony Lane, the commentary writer, summed it up best in advising
what to do when you inherit a tradition: "The crucial thing is not to ape it,
still less to seize up with awe, but to ask yourself what, by way of homage, you
can possibly bring to the party."
</P>
<P>
	   That, Remnick says, is what he is figuring out.

<HEADLINE> Cops not trigger happy, experts say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the popular "Lethal Weapon" movies, the actors
portraying cops shoot their weapons endlessly, killing bad guys one after
another.
<P>
	   Those visions, coupled with the real-life shooting of Amadou Diallo last
year - killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four New York City police
officers - reinforce the stereotype that all cops are trigger happy.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to police officials and crime experts, the majority of police
officers never fire their weapons during their careers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well over 95 percent never shoot their weapons here," said New York City
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in New York City, with 41,000 cops - the largest in the nation,
there were 155 incidents where police fired their weapons. Forty-two "offenders"
- people being pursued for questioning or arrest - were shot by cops, according
to department firearms discharge statistics. Cops also shot three bystanders -
none was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 42 "offenders" shot, 11, including Diallo, were killed. Diallo was
standing in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building when four cops
approached him for questioning, officially putting him in the "offender"
category. The four are on trial for murder in Albany, N.Y., and testified they
thought they saw him with a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Four New York police officers were shot and wounded by perpetrators last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of the low number of police shootings, there's the perception that
cops constantly fire their weapons, and according to Safir, no fan of the press,
it's the media's fault.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are surprised that most officers never fire their weapons
because they've seen so much press based on one or two incidents," Safir said in
a recent interview. "The truth is, the media conditions people. It's the only
thing you hear about in the press, 41 shots and those kind of things."
</P>
<P>
	   "People hear 41 shots and they think it's not an aberration, when it's quite
an aberration," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldine Majors, 52, an elementary school teacher who lives near the Bronx
street where Diallo was killed, said movies and TV shows reinforce the
stereotype of gun-toting, mean cops.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cops are always shooting at someone in the movies or TV," Majors said.
"Take that picture and add it to the perception enforced in young minority kids
from the poor neighborhoods that cops are bad. The Diallo shooting was nothing
new to us."
</P>
<P>
	   But in study after study, it's been proven that the majority of police
officers nationwide never fire their guns in their careers. In conversations
with several current officers of all ranks, with career spans of seven to nearly
20 years on the force, not one had fired his or her weapon. The officers all
wished to remain unidentified due to the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But all had been in situations where they had to pull their weapons out of
their holsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the worst feeling in the world, having to pull your gun," said a
female detective with nearly 18 years of experience. "Because there's a chance
you may have to use it."
</P>
<P>
	   And most of the cops who do fire their weapons are assigned to the more
dangerous units, such as narcotics, or patrol in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoffrey Alpert, a criminologist who studied police shootings in Miami over
a 10-year period, said most officers do their best to not get in the situation
where deadly force is required.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's true in LA, true in Chicago, true in Miami, true in New York," said
Alpert, a professor at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And the officers who are involved in shootings are those in certain units,
said Willam A. Geller, a criminologist who co-authored "Deadly Force: What We
Know," a book on police shootings nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "The likelihood that you're going to use your weapon in the line of duty
depends hugely on a given city," said Geller, who runs a consulting firm in
Illinois. "It also depends on your unit, such as special street crime kinds of
units."
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers accused of murdering Diallo all belonged to the NYPD's
Street Crime Unit, whose goal was to patrol high crime neighborhoods to search
for illegal guns, and sometimes to investigate a violent crime pattern. The
officers stopped Diallo because they thought he matched the description of a
serial rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And, unlike Hollywood, police are trained to use their weapons only as a
last resort, wrote Louis Anemone in the NYPD's 1998 Firearms Discharge Data
Report. Anemone, now retired, was chief of department - the highest ranking
uniformed officer - when the Diallo shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent telephone interview, Anemone said that message has not gotten
out to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   "They NYPD is the most restrained department in the nation among large
departments, when it comes to the use of deadly physical force," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police shootings in New York City have steadily declined in the 1990s, and
Safir attributes that to good training.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a tactics house at the firing range and police officers get a real
sense of when to shoot and not to shoot," he said. "We go through so many
scenarios and change them so often that they don't become routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Other large departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
report low incidences of police shootings as well. But in 1998, the Washington
Post published a series revealing that the District of Columbia police shot and
killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other large U.S. police
department. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1999 for the
series.
</P>
<P>
	   The series prompted action by city and federal officials. Police Chief
Charles Ramsey asked the Justice Department to probe a decade of police
shootings to try to restore public confidence, and announced a sweeping
retraining program for the entire force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research
group, said retraining may be needed in other cities to prevent some shootings
that result from the cultural gap between black suspects and white police.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police need more training - cultural training," said Williams, who once
headed the Newark, N.J., police department. "We need to engage in a broader set
of parameters that involves the culture of inner city youth. We need to draw
from savvy street officers, who day after day engage these young kids and never
shoot anybody."

<HEADLINE> Philanthropy spurs hot trend in education - after-school programs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The normal school day at P.S. 27 is long over, but
fifth-grader Shanna Holmes is still in a classroom, busily creating an elaborate
3-D greeting card.
<P>
	   The 10-year-old is one of 235 children in the Crossroads After-School
Program at the Brooklyn school. When she and her classmates master the 3-D
cards, they will teach the technique to residents at a nearby home for mentally
handicapped adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fun," Holmes says of the Crossroads program. "We teach people. I like
staying in school after school.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lot better than being at home. At home all I do is watch TV and be
alone," Holmes adds, gazing up from the milk carton that is soon to be the
centerpiece of her card.
</P>
<P>
	   After-school programs like the year-old one at P.S. 27 are a growing trend
fostered by charity foundations which in turn get help from community groups and
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to make after-school activities a permanent fixture of American
life, much as Andrew Carnegie did a century ago with libraries, by building them
in towns and cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The free after-school programs are popular with parents. One survey showed
90 percent of Americans favor them. Much of their popularity can be traced to
the increasing number of working mothers; nearly 80 percent of mothers of
children ages 6 to 13 are employed full-time.
</P>
<P>
	   Government is responding to the need. In 1997, Congress set aside $1 million
for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a pilot after-school program.
This year it allocated $454 million to help support the centers in 1,600 rural
and inner-city schools in 49 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been exponential growth in after-school programs," says Adrienna de
Kanter, a special adviser to the U.S. Department of Education. "It's been a
silent revolution that there be activities for kids ... to keep buildings open
after school."
</P>
<P>
	   At P.S. 27 in New York, principal Marilyn Fuenes says the after-hours
program has given her school a new spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two years ago, nothing was happening. The kids couldn't play. They would go
to school and then go home. ... Now the school has come to life," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The elevated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway runs by outside the school in Red
Hook, a low-income, dockside area. The neighborhood has one of the city's
largest public-housing projects, and 97 percent of P.S. 27 students are poor
enough to receive free school lunches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crossroads program at P.S. 27 is a partnership between Good Shepherd
Services, a neighborhood community group, and The After-School Corporation,
which provided the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Philanthropist George Soros started the corporation in April 1998 with a
challenge grant. He pledged up to $125 million over five years to create
after-school programs in New York City public schools, with the goal of matching
his grants with public and private money on a three-to-one basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation has created nearly 100 after school programs for 26,000
children. It estimates that a program operating Monday through Friday, for three
hours costs about $1,000 a year per child.
</P>
<P>
	   This school year, its budget is $36 million, with over $25 million coming
from private and public coffers. Included is $17 million from New York City and
the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs are designed to enrich learning and 45 minutes are devoted to
homework, but they have a wide range of recreational activities, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes you have to take the reins off a little," says John Powell, 24, a
volunteer in the P.S. 27 program who was once a student at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In one classroom on a winter's afternoon, first- and second-graders thump
drums, knock wooden sticks together and bang tambourines on their hips, keeping
time with a music teacher. When the song ends, the kids clap and burst out
laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the hall, second graders in theater class shriek with excitement as
they transform themselves into Pikachus - a favorite character from the popular
Pokemon cartoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixth- and seventh-graders in the volunteer Counselor-in-Training program
act as mentors to first- or second-graders. Mentor Emanuel Turner says he feels
like a teacher and guidance counselor as he helps a second-grade "buddy" learn
to read. He is learning patience himself too, Turner says, since his charge
would rather run around than do homework.
</P>
<P>
	   Socorro Perez, a mother of second- and seventh-grade boys, said that she
used to have problems helping with homework - her first language is Spanish -
before enrolling her sons in the free program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's helped them a lot," she said. "Before they stayed at home. Sometimes I
had to contact a friend to help with the English homework."
</P>
<P>
	   Soros said his vision is that after-school programs that "will eventually
become a universally available, public responsibility." He praised the 21st
Century Community Learning Centers, funded by the U.S. Department of Education,
was a good way to bolster after-school efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Soros' corporation, the Department of Education does not create the
programs single-handedly. Almost all after-school programs are a collaboration
between the government, private groups and community organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, schools receiving grants from 21st Century get training from
the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has donated $83 million over six
years to support the centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Political leaders also have started pushing the after-school programs.
During his State of the Union address in January, President Clinton said he
wanted to more than double funding for after-school and summer-school programs
to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore also has spoken favorably about the after-school
idea, and Republican hopeful George W. Bush recently said he wants to reverse
federal rules that prevent churches and synagogues from being part of the
after-hours programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Negron, who runs an after-school program in New York's Washington
Heights neighborhood, said he's not surprised to see politicians "jumping on the
bandwagon."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no coincidence that it's an election year," he said. "For parents it's
a hot issue."

<HEADLINE> Candidates Thoughts on Race Issues  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Racial Relations
</P>
<P>
	   What is one example of something you could do as president to improve racial
relations?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``Moving our country to a time of true racial unity is at the
core of who I am and why I am running for president. While one of the first
things I would do as president would be to sign an executive order ending racial
profiling, it would be just a first step towards healing the racial divide. If
I'm president, I want one thing to be known: If you want to please the boss, one
of the things you'd better show is how in your department or agency you've
furthered tolerance and racial understanding. I think we need to build a
multiracial coalition to address the issue, and I would provide the leadership
and vision this country needs to move toward a time where, in the words of Toni
Morrison, 'race exists, but it doesn't matter.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``I think that the most important thing we can do today to correct
the legacy of slavery and racial discrimination of all types is to ensure that
all Americans have the opportunity to succeed and make the most of their
God-given potential. If elected president, I will fight to give every child a
world class education and build a safer society for all our children. I will
continue to work to break down barriers in our work places, in our schools, in
our police stations and in the hearts of Americans. I will work to close the
opportunity gap that too often divides our society and expand economic
opportunity in untapped markets in American cities. And I will vigorously
enforce our civil rights laws, protect affirmative action programs that have
worked for minorities and women, and pass tougher hate crimes legislation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``I am proposing immigration reform to make it possible to
fully assimilate the 30 million immigrants who have arrived in the last 30
years. I will also make the control of illegal immigration a national priority.
Without these reforms, America will begin a rapid drift into uncharted waters.
We shall become a country with a dying culture and deepening divisions along the
lines of race, class, income and language. We shall lose for our children and
for the children of the 30 million who have come here since 1970 the last best
hope of Earth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``A president must provide leadership that sets a positive,
inclusive agenda and brings people together to achieve common objectives, rather
than dividing people into groups and pitting them against one another. The
president can lead by speaking out against hatred, bigotry and prejudice. I am a
uniter, not a divider. I do not believe in pitting one group of people against
another. There is a trend in this country to put people into boxes. Americans
don't belong in little ethnic and racial boxes. There are boxes all over the
world in places like Kosovo, Bosnia, Rwanda; and they are human tragedies. We
must embrace America's diversity and recognize the richness of our different
heritages and cultures. In the 21st century, I see a United States with one big
box: American.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: ``Come to work every day.''
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``I believe in the protection of civil rights and the promotion
of equal opportunity for all Americans. These are fundamental principles of
democracy for which so many of our countrymen have laid down their lives. I
would use the office of the presidency to set a positive example and to foster
the unity, healing and understanding that befits a great nation founded on the
principle that all men are created equal. I'm running for president to inspire
the next generation to serve causes greater than their self-interest. One of
those causes is achieving the vision of our Founding Fathers and that of Martin
Luther King Jr. of equal opportunity and justice for all Americans.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hillary Clinton at side, courts minority votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are "morally blind."
<P>
	   Gore, with Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton at his side, was
campaigning for support among New York's increasingly politically important
community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism, which he said still exists in America.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind...some of those
individuals just left the state of South Carolina," Gore said to laughter from
the audience at the Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore, paraphrasing a Bob Dylan song, said, "They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see." Gore
called the flag "that accumulated heritage of injustice."
</P>
<P>
	   At the church service, Gore and the first lady each had warm words for the
other.
</P>
<P>
	   "She stands for the best values of New York state," Gore said. "Her voice
will be heard. Her vision will make a difference...I will stand up for her."
</P>
<P>
	   "No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,"
the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
	   It marked the first time the two had campaigned together in New York, where
Clinton is making history as the first first lady to ever run for public office.
The race has pitted her against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
	   The church service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored by
the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before the vice
president and his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination were
scheduled to debate at Harlem's Apollo theater.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus weekend annually brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders. The minority community in New York is an
increasingly powerful voting bloc. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of
voters in the state's 1998 election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power comes in the state's March 7
presidential primary, considered a major showdown for Gore and former New York
Knicks basketball star Bill Bradley. Both have made major appeals to minorities
in their bids for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that the first lady and Gore didn't want to
be seen much together as they each worked to escape the long shadow of President
Clinton, aides to both have said that is not true.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, one Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last
week that "for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just

<HEADLINE> 'The New Yorker' magazine celebrates 75 years in print  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Bylines glimpsed in The New Yorker since its 1925 debut:
F. Scott Fitzgerald, Sylvia Plath, W.B. Yeats.
<P>
	   Dorothy Parker, Truman Capote, E.B. White.
</P>
<P>
	   W.H. Auden, Ogden Nash, James Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
	   With the magazine's double-issue now on news stands, the ghosts of authors
and artists past help celebrate the venerable publication's 75th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   Snatches of their vivid pictures and prose dot the magazine pages under the
headline "Takes," standing alongside a current offering about Fidel Castro's
public relations war over Elian Gonzalez. There's also an analysis of Martha
Stewart which concludes she taps into the power "of the woman who sits down at
the table with the men, and, still in her apron, walks away with the chips."
</P>
<P>
	   Woody Allen is back, ending his long hiatus as a contributing writer.
</P>
<P>
	   The man best known for his films and a headline-grabbing romance/marriage
with longtime paramour Mia Farrow's adopted daughter, Allen penned "Attention
Geniuses: Cash Only" for his return to the magazine. The piece is a rambling,
off-the-wall story of a therapist who daydreams of accepting a musician's work
in lieu of cash. It's disastrous, of course, as the man's song titles include
"The Earthworms of Tuscany."
</P>
<P>
	   The story is an amusing, fulfilling one of David Remnick's priorities as The
New Yorker's fifth editor. Allen has a tough time, however, competing with the
magazine's alumni.
</P>
<P>
	   Here's a sampling of the competition's work:
</P>
<P>
	   -E.B. White on learning to crank start the Model T: "It was a special trick
and until you learned it (usually from another Ford owner, but sometimes by a
period of appalling experimentation) you might as well have been winding up an
awning," White wrote in 1936. "Often, if the emergency brake hadn't been pulled
all the way back, the car advanced on you ... I can still feel my old Ford
nuzzling me at the curb, as though looking for an apple in my pocket."
</P>
<P>
	   -Vladimir Nabokov on butterflies: "Through the smells of the marsh, I caught
the subtle perfume of butterfly wings on my hands, a perfume that varies with
the species; it was vanilla, or lemon, or musk, or a musty, sweetish odor
difficult to define."
</P>
<P>
	   -And Philip Hamburger on Mussolini's execution and subsequent hanging: "To
an outsider like myself, who happened to be on hand to see Mussolini, Clara
Petacci, Pavolini Starace, and some of the other Fascists dangling by their
heels from a rusty beaming front of a gas station, the breathless, bloody scene
had an air of inevitability. You had the feeling, as you have at the final
curtain of a good play, that events could not have been otherwise."
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Wallace Ross, a self-taught man rumored teasingly by his staff to
have finished reading but one book in his life, founded The New Yorker in 1925,
at first with the breezy about-town flair of 1920s New York. Later, under the
gentle guidance of Katherine White, who shepherded serious fiction onto its
pages, the magazine began to take shape. It took on the voice that resonates
today, somehow conjuring the whispers of Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein in
the cafes of Paris, witty, intelligent, and yes, a little too full of itself.
</P>
<P>
	   "Ross was an aggressively ignorant man, with a head full of odd scraps of
information and misinformation," reported longtime staffer Brendan Gill in his
1975 book "Here at The New Yorker." Driving home the point, he explains that
Ross might likely badger an author with the question: "Is Moby Dick the whale or
the man?"
</P>
<P>
	   Something of that tone comes through on the pages of The New Yorker even
today.
</P>
<P>
	   In the current Commentary offered by Anthony Lane, Thurber is remembered
with the following quote: "Two overcoats which he left in The New Yorker office
last spring were stolen, or else he left them someplace else."
</P>
<P>
	   And much later, from Donald Barthelme in a "The Talk of the Town" recipe:
"About twenty pounds of sliced onion would be a good addition, although they
probably should have gone in earlier."
</P>
<P>
	   It's that tone, that something, that Remnick hopes to see more of.
</P>
<P>
	   After 18 months as editor, he says he still can't wait to put his pants on
every morning and come to work.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine has had its troubles in recent years, including flagging
circulation and advertising sales, but all that appears to be on the rebound.
Circulation is up to 844,000 from 628,000 in recent years, and ad pages are up
37 percent this quarter, according to the director of public relations. About
76.7 percent of subscribers renew.
</P>
<P>
	   That means Remnick can focus on the fun stuff, like weekly cartoon meetings
and soothing ruffled writers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a real joy. Sure, it's exhausting and even once in a blue moon
frustrating and it's always difficult. It's always difficult to do the best you
can in so many ways," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   He says Anthony Lane, the commentary writer, summed it up best in advising
what to do when you inherit a tradition: "The crucial thing is not to ape it,
still less to seize up with awe, but to ask yourself what, by way of homage, you
can possibly bring to the party."
</P>
<P>
	   That, Remnick says, is what he is figuring out.

<HEADLINE> Cops not trigger happy, experts say  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In the popular "Lethal Weapon" movies, the actors
portraying cops shoot their weapons endlessly, killing bad guys one after
another.
<P>
	   Those visions, coupled with the real-life shooting of Amadou Diallo last
year - killed in a hail of 41 bullets fired by four New York City police
officers - reinforce the stereotype that all cops are trigger happy.
</P>
<P>
	   But according to police officials and crime experts, the majority of police
officers never fire their weapons during their careers.
</P>
<P>
	   "Well over 95 percent never shoot their weapons here," said New York City
Police Commissioner Howard Safir.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year in New York City, with 41,000 cops - the largest in the nation,
there were 155 incidents where police fired their weapons. Forty-two "offenders"
- people being pursued for questioning or arrest - were shot by cops, according
to department firearms discharge statistics. Cops also shot three bystanders -
none was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the 42 "offenders" shot, 11, including Diallo, were killed. Diallo was
standing in the doorway of his Bronx apartment building when four cops
approached him for questioning, officially putting him in the "offender"
category. The four are on trial for murder in Albany, N.Y., and testified they
thought they saw him with a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   Four New York police officers were shot and wounded by perpetrators last
year.
</P>
<P>
	   In spite of the low number of police shootings, there's the perception that
cops constantly fire their weapons, and according to Safir, no fan of the press,
it's the media's fault.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think people are surprised that most officers never fire their weapons
because they've seen so much press based on one or two incidents," Safir said in
a recent interview. "The truth is, the media conditions people. It's the only
thing you hear about in the press, 41 shots and those kind of things."
</P>
<P>
	   "People hear 41 shots and they think it's not an aberration, when it's quite
an aberration," he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Geraldine Majors, 52, an elementary school teacher who lives near the Bronx
street where Diallo was killed, said movies and TV shows reinforce the
stereotype of gun-toting, mean cops.
</P>
<P>
	   "The cops are always shooting at someone in the movies or TV," Majors said.
"Take that picture and add it to the perception enforced in young minority kids
from the poor neighborhoods that cops are bad. The Diallo shooting was nothing
new to us."
</P>
<P>
	   But in study after study, it's been proven that the majority of police
officers nationwide never fire their guns in their careers. In conversations
with several current officers of all ranks, with career spans of seven to nearly
20 years on the force, not one had fired his or her weapon. The officers all
wished to remain unidentified due to the Diallo trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But all had been in situations where they had to pull their weapons out of
their holsters.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the worst feeling in the world, having to pull your gun," said a
female detective with nearly 18 years of experience. "Because there's a chance
you may have to use it."
</P>
<P>
	   And most of the cops who do fire their weapons are assigned to the more
dangerous units, such as narcotics, or patrol in high-crime areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Geoffrey Alpert, a criminologist who studied police shootings in Miami over
a 10-year period, said most officers do their best to not get in the situation
where deadly force is required.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's true in LA, true in Chicago, true in Miami, true in New York," said
Alpert, a professor at the University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And the officers who are involved in shootings are those in certain units,
said Willam A. Geller, a criminologist who co-authored "Deadly Force: What We
Know," a book on police shootings nationwide.
</P>
<P>
	   "The likelihood that you're going to use your weapon in the line of duty
depends hugely on a given city," said Geller, who runs a consulting firm in
Illinois. "It also depends on your unit, such as special street crime kinds of
units."
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers accused of murdering Diallo all belonged to the NYPD's
Street Crime Unit, whose goal was to patrol high crime neighborhoods to search
for illegal guns, and sometimes to investigate a violent crime pattern. The
officers stopped Diallo because they thought he matched the description of a
serial rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And, unlike Hollywood, police are trained to use their weapons only as a
last resort, wrote Louis Anemone in the NYPD's 1998 Firearms Discharge Data
Report. Anemone, now retired, was chief of department - the highest ranking
uniformed officer - when the Diallo shooting occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent telephone interview, Anemone said that message has not gotten
out to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   "They NYPD is the most restrained department in the nation among large
departments, when it comes to the use of deadly physical force," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police shootings in New York City have steadily declined in the 1990s, and
Safir attributes that to good training.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a tactics house at the firing range and police officers get a real
sense of when to shoot and not to shoot," he said. "We go through so many
scenarios and change them so often that they don't become routine."
</P>
<P>
	   Other large departments, such as Chicago, Los Angeles and Philadelphia,
report low incidences of police shootings as well. But in 1998, the Washington
Post published a series revealing that the District of Columbia police shot and
killed more people per resident in the 1990s than any other large U.S. police
department. The Post won a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1999 for the
series.
</P>
<P>
	   The series prompted action by city and federal officials. Police Chief
Charles Ramsey asked the Justice Department to probe a decade of police
shootings to try to restore public confidence, and announced a sweeping
retraining program for the entire force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hubert Williams, president of the Police Foundation, a nonprofit research
group, said retraining may be needed in other cities to prevent some shootings
that result from the cultural gap between black suspects and white police.
</P>
<P>
	   "Police need more training - cultural training," said Williams, who once
headed the Newark, N.J., police department. "We need to engage in a broader set
of parameters that involves the culture of inner city youth. We need to draw
from savvy street officers, who day after day engage these young kids and never
shoot anybody."

<HEADLINE> Philanthropy spurs hot trend in education - after-school programs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The normal school day at P.S. 27 is long over, but
fifth-grader Shanna Holmes is still in a classroom, busily creating an elaborate
3-D greeting card.
<P>
	   The 10-year-old is one of 235 children in the Crossroads After-School
Program at the Brooklyn school. When she and her classmates master the 3-D
cards, they will teach the technique to residents at a nearby home for mentally
handicapped adults.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's fun," Holmes says of the Crossroads program. "We teach people. I like
staying in school after school.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a lot better than being at home. At home all I do is watch TV and be
alone," Holmes adds, gazing up from the milk carton that is soon to be the
centerpiece of her card.
</P>
<P>
	   After-school programs like the year-old one at P.S. 27 are a growing trend
fostered by charity foundations which in turn get help from community groups and
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea is to make after-school activities a permanent fixture of American
life, much as Andrew Carnegie did a century ago with libraries, by building them
in towns and cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
	   The free after-school programs are popular with parents. One survey showed
90 percent of Americans favor them. Much of their popularity can be traced to
the increasing number of working mothers; nearly 80 percent of mothers of
children ages 6 to 13 are employed full-time.
</P>
<P>
	   Government is responding to the need. In 1997, Congress set aside $1 million
for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, a pilot after-school program.
This year it allocated $454 million to help support the centers in 1,600 rural
and inner-city schools in 49 states.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's been exponential growth in after-school programs," says Adrienna de
Kanter, a special adviser to the U.S. Department of Education. "It's been a
silent revolution that there be activities for kids ... to keep buildings open
after school."
</P>
<P>
	   At P.S. 27 in New York, principal Marilyn Fuenes says the after-hours
program has given her school a new spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   "Two years ago, nothing was happening. The kids couldn't play. They would go
to school and then go home. ... Now the school has come to life," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The elevated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway runs by outside the school in Red
Hook, a low-income, dockside area. The neighborhood has one of the city's
largest public-housing projects, and 97 percent of P.S. 27 students are poor
enough to receive free school lunches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Crossroads program at P.S. 27 is a partnership between Good Shepherd
Services, a neighborhood community group, and The After-School Corporation,
which provided the funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Philanthropist George Soros started the corporation in April 1998 with a
challenge grant. He pledged up to $125 million over five years to create
after-school programs in New York City public schools, with the goal of matching
his grants with public and private money on a three-to-one basis.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporation has created nearly 100 after school programs for 26,000
children. It estimates that a program operating Monday through Friday, for three
hours costs about $1,000 a year per child.
</P>
<P>
	   This school year, its budget is $36 million, with over $25 million coming
from private and public coffers. Included is $17 million from New York City and
the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
	   The programs are designed to enrich learning and 45 minutes are devoted to
homework, but they have a wide range of recreational activities, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sometimes you have to take the reins off a little," says John Powell, 24, a
volunteer in the P.S. 27 program who was once a student at the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In one classroom on a winter's afternoon, first- and second-graders thump
drums, knock wooden sticks together and bang tambourines on their hips, keeping
time with a music teacher. When the song ends, the kids clap and burst out
laughing.
</P>
<P>
	   Down the hall, second graders in theater class shriek with excitement as
they transform themselves into Pikachus - a favorite character from the popular
Pokemon cartoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixth- and seventh-graders in the volunteer Counselor-in-Training program
act as mentors to first- or second-graders. Mentor Emanuel Turner says he feels
like a teacher and guidance counselor as he helps a second-grade "buddy" learn
to read. He is learning patience himself too, Turner says, since his charge
would rather run around than do homework.
</P>
<P>
	   Socorro Perez, a mother of second- and seventh-grade boys, said that she
used to have problems helping with homework - her first language is Spanish -
before enrolling her sons in the free program.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's helped them a lot," she said. "Before they stayed at home. Sometimes I
had to contact a friend to help with the English homework."
</P>
<P>
	   Soros said his vision is that after-school programs that "will eventually
become a universally available, public responsibility." He praised the 21st
Century Community Learning Centers, funded by the U.S. Department of Education,
was a good way to bolster after-school efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Soros' corporation, the Department of Education does not create the
programs single-handedly. Almost all after-school programs are a collaboration
between the government, private groups and community organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, schools receiving grants from 21st Century get training from
the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, which has donated $83 million over six
years to support the centers.
</P>
<P>
	   Political leaders also have started pushing the after-school programs.
During his State of the Union address in January, President Clinton said he
wanted to more than double funding for after-school and summer-school programs
to $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore also has spoken favorably about the after-school
idea, and Republican hopeful George W. Bush recently said he wants to reverse
federal rules that prevent churches and synagogues from being part of the
after-hours programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Negron, who runs an after-school program in New York's Washington
Heights neighborhood, said he's not surprised to see politicians "jumping on the
bandwagon."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no coincidence that it's an election year," he said. "For parents it's
a hot issue."

<HEADLINE> Italy Shuts Route To Blow Up Bomb  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy shut down a central stretch of its major north-south rail
and road routes and evacuated hundreds of people Sunday to blow up a newly
uncovered American-made bomb dropped in World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The rusted bomb contained about 550 pounds of TNT, authorities said.
Explosives experts deemed it too fragile to dig out or disarm. Instead, they
excavated a crater and used plastic explosives to destroy the bomb from afar.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Perfectly successful,'' said Lt. Col. Fabio Commellini, one of the leaders
of the explosives team.
</P>
<P>
	   An allied warplane dropped the bomb near Terni, about 40 miles east of Rome,
on Jan. 28, 1944, when much of Italy was under German occupation. The bomb
landed in the Paglia River, near a rail route.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I remember it well. It was raining bombs everywhere and rail cars were
falling in flames in the Paglia,'' said Filivio Rossi, a 72-year-old resident of
the area. ``It seems like I can still hear people screaming.''
</P>
<P>
	   It was Rossi who spotted the bomb on what apparently was a newly dried
stretch of riverbed on Feb. 13, mistaking it at first for a stone.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday, authorities rerouted traffic in both directions on the A-1
autostrada and the Rome-Florence rail route in case of any trouble with the
detonation. Officials ordered about 500 nearby residents evacuated, opening a
reception center for the few who did not leave and using ambulances to evacuate
the sick to hospitals for the day.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosives team may have more work ahead of it -- officials said Sunday
they had found another unexploded World War II bomb in the same area, this one
at the foot of a railway bridge. Authorities did not immediately announce their
plans for that bomb.

<HEADLINE> McCain Stumble Could Help Bradley  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURENCE ARNOLD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Bill Bradley hopes the McCain drain is over.
</P>
<P>
	   Relegated to the status of junior reformer for nearly three weeks, Bradley
says Sen. John McCain's loss in South Carolina clears the way for his own
struggling Democratic campaign to renew the pitch to independents and moderate
Democrats who have been moving toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's gotten a shot of oxygen which had been drawn out of his campaign by
McCain,'' said Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University.
``In American politics there can only be one novelty at a time, and McCain has
been the novelty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Once Bradley's partner in spreading the message of reform, McCain has been
the focus of attention since his Feb. 1 upset of Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire, where he won support from independents and crossover Democrats -- the
same group Bradley had hoped to attract.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, returning from a campaign swing to Seattle, was flying high over
the Dakotas when an aide delivered the news of McCain's loss in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So we're back, and we're able to make the case that we're out there to get
all the votes,'' Bradley told cheering supporters a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Sunday on ABC's ``This Week'' about the opportunity created by
McCain's loss, Bradley said, ``I think I'm making a strong case to all
Americans, independents and Democrats and even some Republicans to bring them
over to our side, and we're having some success.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by satellite from St. Louis, where mechanical trouble forced his
plane to land Saturday night, Bradley said the South Carolina results show that
``it's tough for a reformer to win against entrenched power, against the
establishment power. I think I learned that, and I think John McCain learned
that last night.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, and his current strategy
places a premium on Washington state, which holds a nonbinding primary Feb. 29
-- the only Democratic vote in advance of the March 7 contests, when 16 states
hold primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   But while McCain has gained against Bush in national polls, Bradley has
slumped farther behind Gore -- a deficit of about 40 percentage points in the
latest surveys. He is trails in the polls in California, the biggest of the
March 7 prizes, and in New York, where he played professional basketball for 10
years before running for Senate in neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledges the need to win some of the March 7 contests. He
campaigned in Northeastern states last week and was returning to New York for a
Monday debate with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're making up ground,'' Bradley said. ``We're moving in Connecticut,
Rhode Island, we're moving in New York, and we're going to have a big contest
Feb. 29 in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the spotlight focused on McCain in recent weeks, Bradley made the case
that McCain's ``presence in the race actually helps me, because what it does is
it focuses on reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has taken time to stress distinctions between himself and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's against abortion rights, I'm for abortion rights. He's against gun
control, I'm for gun control,'' Bradley told reporters Friday in Minneapolis, on
his way to Seattle. ``He doesn't have thoughts about how to resolve the 44
million people without health insurance in America. I've put out a very specific
program to do that. ... He has an environmental record that's not good. I have
an excellent environmental record.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Pelt Peacekeepers With Rock  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A crowd of angry Serbs pelted
American and German peacekeepers with rocks and bricks Sunday during a massive
house-to-house search for illegal weapons in this tense, ethnically divided
Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapons search was a bid to halt a spiral of violence that has been
building since Feb. 2, when two Serbs died in a rocket attack on a U.N. bus.
Nine people have been killed and dozens arrested in violence since in Kosovska
Mitrovica, which is divided into predominantly Serb and predominantly ethnic
Albanian sides of town.
</P>
<P>
	   French Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping
force, said soldiers from a dozen countries found no weapons in the southern
section, where mostly ethnic Albanians live.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Serb northern part, where the Americans and some Germans came under
attack from an angry crowd, he said soldiers found plastic explosives, 15 rifles
and handguns, one grenade, one machine gun and loads of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was arrested. Those injured included two American peacekeepers,
one with a broken nose and one with a chipped tooth, and three Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,300 troops, including French, Americans, Germans and Canadians, set
out shortly after dawn to conduct the major search operation on both sides of
the Ibar River, which divides the town, said Lt. Cmdr. Philip Anido, a NATO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Peacekeepers' helicopters circled above Kosovska Mitrovica, dropping
leaflets that read: ``Attention! Attention! KFOR (Kosovo Force) soldiers are
here to search for weapons. Hand over your weapons when asked to do so by KFOR
soldiers. Do not impede KFOR operations. KFOR soldiers will treat you with
dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The troops went from house to house and building to building, searching
through areas where the peacekeepers suspect there may be weapons and criminal
activity, Anido said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans, who were searching in the Serb north of the city, met with an
increasingly hostile crowd that began throwing snowballs at their armored
vehicles. Later, the crowd hurled stones and broken bricks. The hail of rock
continued as the Americans drove south toward the ethnic Albanian section of
town hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb officials bitterly complained about alleged acts of violence and
intimidation committed by the Americans. Defying the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. town
curfew, about 200 Serbs stood in protest for an hour Sunday evening on their
side of the river, next to the main bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans were smashing doors, destroying furniture. There was no reason
for such behavior,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, a local Serb leader. Earlier in the
day, Ivanovic said the Americans had broken all the doors in a student dormitory
and also searched for weapons in the north side's children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. spokesman Capt. Russel Berg called the troops and the U.N. military
police who assisted them ``very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no action on the part of the American soldiers'' that would have
incited a confrontation with the Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists here.
After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic
Albanians began attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   With so many Serbs and ethnic Albanians living in the same community,
Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically mixed city in the province -- and the
most violence-prone. Chanliau said the weapons searches would continue until
Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German commander of the peacekeeping force, is
satisified that the job has been done.

<HEADLINE> Apollo Strike Threat Called Off  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE ROTH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The show will go on at the Apollo Theatre.
</P>
<P>
	   A planned stagehands' strike that threatened a presidential debate between
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley was called off Sunday. Theater management and
the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees reached an agreement
just after dawn, the union and the theater said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates had vowed not to cross a picket line at the 1,483-seat
theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Union workers, who have been without a contract since September, announced
Saturday that they would strike at noon Monday -- hours before the scheduled
debate -- unless they had a new deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A new contract that calls for an increase in wages and benefits and
overtime provisions has been reached, and there will be no walkout at the Apollo
on Monday,'' union spokesman Bruce Cohen said. The new agreement was to be
signed by the union and management later Sunday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Grace Blake, executive director of The Apollo Theatre Foundation, also
announced the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe that the negotiations have produced a fair and equitable
agreement,'' Blake said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Union workers had charged that the theater was not negotiating in good
faith, and had demanded reinstatement of a fired shop steward.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley-Gore debate, focusing on race and urban issues, is the only one
scheduled in New York before the state's March 7 presidential primary.

<HEADLINE> Powers' Son Opens Memorial to Dad  </HEADLINE>
   By BURT HERMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERLIN (AP) -- In the days after May 1, 1960, the world learned of Francis
Gary Powers, whose U-2 spyplane was shot down over Russia in one of the
flashpoints of the 40-year standoff between the world's superpowers.
</P>
<P>
	   His son, Francis Gary Powers Jr., didn't start really learning about his
father's past until Aug. 1, 1977 -- when condolences poured in after the pilot
died when the helicopter he flew for a Los Angeles television station crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That's when I realized the importance of what he had done during the Cold
War,'' said Powers, who was in Berlin at the Allied Museum on Sunday to open an
exhibit about his father. ``But at that time it was too late to ask him about it
because he had already passed away.''
</P>
<P>
	   Powers, now 34, said that after a period of mourning he became more curious
about learning his father's story. He started to read history books and do
research, collecting material that eventually led to the traveling exhibit,
which is being shown in Berlin through June 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Seen for the first time as part of the exhibit are fragments from the
helicopter Powers was flying the day he died. Other items include a
Latvian-style rug Powers made while in Soviet prison, his medals and varsity
letters he earned in high school and college for football and track.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. authorities had thought the high-flying U-2 aircraft was out of reach
of Soviet weapons, and Powers had been tapped as the most qualified pilot to fly
the sensitive mission photographing Soviet military sites.
</P>
<P>
	   But the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, and under Soviet
interrogation Powers admitted he was working for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   President Eisenhower first said the plane was doing weather research and was
lost over Turkey. A picture of the plane with a NASA logo was given to the press
to bolster the cover story. But the United States eventually admitted the truth
to try to salvage relations with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the first time a president was caught telling a lie, something we
assume happens all the time now,'' the younger Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident led to the collapse of a peace summit in Paris weeks later.
</P>
<P>
	   Powers was sentenced to 10 years in prison in August 1960. But he was
exchanged for KGB master spy Col. Rudolph Abel on Feb. 10, 1962 at a site
practically down the road from the Allied Museum: Berlin's Glienicke Bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   The son, who works as a manager for an Internet company, doesn't plan to end
his quest through history with just the current exhibit. He is also founder of
the Cold War Museum, which he said will open in the next few years after finding
a site in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``History is the lesson, not just to remember the U-2 incident but also to
remember the Cold War,'' Powers said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese PM Orders Smuggle Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES HUTZLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China's premier has ordered customs agents to step up their
efforts in an 18-month-old smuggling crackdown that has already uncovered the
biggest corruption scandal in 50 years of communist rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Premier Zhu Rongji's issued the order on state television's national evening
newscast Sunday. His remarks appeared aimed at conveying the Communist Party's
resolve to end the scandal, which has led to the arrest of several high-ranking
officials.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some dark sheep and termites have been exposed and severely punished by
law,'' Zhu said. This ``shows our party has the determination, the ability and
the means to punish corruption and excise this malignant tumor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Zhu told customs officials to beef up their ranks, instill discipline and
ferret out corruption. He ordered customs agents to step up their attacks on
smugglers and improve coordination with a task force set up at the start of the
crackdown in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jiang Zemin was also shown on state television lecturing party
officials about the need for purity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Communist Party members and leading cadres must be honest in performing
their duties,'' Jiang said. ``In the face of the corrosive influences of money
worship, hedonism, extreme individualism and drinking and merrymaking, they must
not be stained by one blot.''
</P>
<P>
	   The flurry of activity seemed intended to head off criticism of the
leadership by the national legislature, which opens its annual session in two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of officials -- including the wife of a member of the party's
powerful, 21-member Politburo -- have come under suspicion in a smuggling
scandal centered on the southeastern port city Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
	   A state-run newspaper's Web site reported last month that nearly $10 billion
in smuggled goods flowed through Xiamen and that 159 people were involved. The
crackdown early on netted China's top police official in charge of combatting
smuggling. Among those under arrest are China's top immigration officer, two
city deputy party secretaries, a vice mayor and police officials, the Guangzhou
Daily's Web site reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Chinese leaders have remained virtually silent about the scandal and have
ordered a news blackout until the investigation is finished. But rumors and Hong
Kong and foreign media reports have been carried on Chinese Web sites, edging
the scandal into the public eye.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials and academics, speaking on condition of anonymity, believe party
leaders want to make results of the investigation public before the National
People's Congress convenes.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Expect Peace Outline by May  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians will likely reach a framework
agreement for a final peace treaty in May -- three months past the original
deadline, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an agreement would ultimately dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza
Strip, a senior minister in Barak's Cabinet said, the latest sign that the
government is preparing its public for uprooting settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was to have been reached last week, but negotiations are
stalled over the location of an interim withdrawal from the West Bank. In
addition to settlements, the accord is to tackle tough issues like the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that the framework accord would likely be
ready in three months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't be shocked if we reach a framework agreement in May,'' his office
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak blamed the Palestinians, in part, for the delay, saying that they
refused an offer to hold 20 days of intensive negotiations in January. The
Palestinians suspended talks earlier this month after they learned that Barak
refused to give them three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem as part of an interim West
Bank troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say the framework agreement, which was Barak's idea, should
be skipped in favor of direct negotiations over the treaty itself, due by
September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We no longer need the framework agreement,'' Palestinian Speaker of
Parliament Ahmed Qureia said. He blamed the deadlock on Israel's ``impossible
positions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, meanwhile, said ``there is no doubt'' that
Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip would have to be dismantled as part of a
final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin told Israel's army radio that Gaza settlements were not historically
justified and were impractical, because Jews would always be a tiny minority
among a huge Palestinian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not the (Biblical) Land of Israel. It is the most crowded place in
the world, and I don't think there is any justification for leaving settlements
there,'' Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin's comments, though not an official government position, were
consistent with other statements and leaks from officials close to Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   In another sign that the government was laying the groundwork for evacuating
settlements, army radio quoted unnamed senior defense officials as saying that
they had prepared a map showing 21 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza that
would be dismantled in a permanent peace agreement and 16 whose status was in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Barak told his Cabinet that ``no such map exists and no one has
asked the army to prepare such a map,'' his office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the reported map is consistent with promises by Israeli officials
that the Palestinians would ultimately control a contiguous block of West Bank
land, a crucial underpinning to the state Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopes
to declare by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians maintain that all 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip are illegal and must be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak himself has not explicitly said he would evacuate settlements, a
position that would encounter fierce opposition from about half of the political
spectrum, including two coalition partners. Beilin's statements and other leaks
are likely efforts to test public opinion on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Leader: Elections 'Fair'  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ROTHBART Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JALAL-ABAD, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Kyrgyzstan's president praised Sunday's
parliamentary elections as open and fair even as the exclusion of most
opposition parties has sullied his nation's reputation as Central Asia's
strongest democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Of 27 political parties registered in Kyrgyzstan (pronounced keer-ghi-STON),
only 11 were allowed to compete in the election. Most main opposition parties
were barred from fielding their strongest candidates because of minor
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 545 candidates were competing for 105 seats in the two houses of
parliament, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Many were running as independents,
preferring to keep their party affiliations unofficial to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout in the vote in this former Soviet republic was 55.4 percent, the
Central Election Commission said after polls closed, according to the Interfax
news agency. Tensions and police presence were high in areas where opposition
candidates were barred from the race, but no violence was reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Results were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   International and domestic observers were monitoring the vote, and some
violations were reported. Students at the Jalal-abad University in southern
Kyrgyzstan said they voted up to four times under different names at the urging
of teachers pushing the university dean's bid for a parliamentary seat.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, international organizations have sent messages to President
Askar Akayev voicing concerns that the election process was unfairly restricted.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrgyzstan, a poor, mountainous country of 4 million people, had been
considered the most democratic nation to emerge from former Soviet Central Asia.
But Akayev, who has led the country since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union,
has increasingly cracked down on dissent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have tried to make the elections as open, fair, democratic and
transparent as possible,'' Akayev said after casting his ballot in the capital,
Bishkek. ``I am certain that a parliament meeting present-day standards and
promoting reform will be elected.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he added that his former Soviet republic was not yet ready to be ruled
by a strong parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Political and economic reforms are currently in progress in the republic
and a strong authority is necessary at this stage,'' he said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Vice President
Al Gore were among those sent messages expressing concern over the restrictions
on political activity. The Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan was barred from
campaigning after a court ruled that a party congress to select candidates
failed to reach a quorum. The Poor People's Party was barred because its charter
did not state that it would participate in elections.

<HEADLINE> State to equip fire departments with thermal-imaging cameras  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Elizabeth Fire Chief Louis Kelly has no doubt a
state plan to spend $7.5 million on heat-seeking cameras for every fire
department in New Jersey will save lives.
<P>
	   He recalled an apartment fire that tore through a high-rise senior citizens
complex on Sept. 28, 1997. Firefighters, blinded by thick black smoke,
previously would have crawled on their hands and knees and groped their way
through every apartment on the floor to search for victims. But thermal-imaging
cameras allowed firefighters to stand in the doorway of each apartment and scan
inside. They rescued 10 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The state plans to make the cameras available soon. E.D. Bullard of
Cynthiana, Ky., submitted the low bid of $7,695 per camera, but the purchase may
be delayed because another bidder, Fairfield-based Electrophysics, has filed a
protest. It claims Bullard did not meet several of the state's specifications.
</P>
<P>
	   William Cane, director of the fire safety division in the State Department
of Community Affairs, said his office will distribute the cameras at a rate of
100 per month over a 10-month period once the contract is awarded. Big city fire
departments will receives multiple cameras based on population, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This allowed firefighters to go into a totally darkened room, filled with
smoke, and see an individual who may be hiding in a corner or a child in a
closet," said Cane. "This is a gift. Lives will be saved."
</P>
<P>
	   The state plan to supply all 750 fire departments in New Jersey with
thermal-imaging cameras may be the first of its kind in the nation, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is going to bring New Jersey a long way," said Denis Onieal,
superintendent of the National Fire Academy in Emmitsburg, Md., who served on
the Jersey City fire department for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Jersey City became one of the first fire departments in the state to have a
thermal-imaging camera when it paid more than $25,000 for one over six year ago.
It bought another a year later.
</P>
<P>
	   Jersey City Fire Chief Frederick Eggers said the cameras have been a
tremendous aid in searching for fire victims. They also helped in the search for
people trapped when a Jersey City movie theater undergoing demolition work
collapsed onto an adjoining building in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the cameras can help reduce damage to a burning structure by
determining whether a fire is traveling behind a wall and help firefighters
better assess chemical fires by detecting heat sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Like any firefighting tool, the cameras do have limitations.
</P>
<P>
	   "If there is too much heat it can white out the camera, which reacts to
infrared heat," said Stephen Benner, deputy chief of the Trenton Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Bought individually, thermal-imaging cameras typically cost between $18,000
and $25,000. They are either hand-held or mounted on a helmet, with color or
black and white monitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Some departments have purchased cameras with the help of corporate and civic
sponsors and fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the case with Bayonne, which paid $20,000 for its first camera. It
has a video link that allows fire officials outside a burning structure to
assess the situation in real-time.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't saved any lives with it yet, but I certainly have the confidence
it will do the job," said Bayonne Fire Chief Thomas Lynch.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Hershman, spokesman for the International Association of Fire Chiefs in
Fairfax, Va., said firefighters began using thermal-imaging cameras about five
years ago. Before that, the devices were only used for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Their use has since spread to police departments looking for fugitives in
wooded areas or darkened rooms and for tracing the movement of suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   For many firefighters, the cameras can't get into their hands a day too
soon.
</P>
<P>
	   Little Falls Fire Chief Edmund Pomponio recalled a house fire in which two
small children perished more than 25 years ago. The heavy smoke made it
difficult for firefighters to reach the second-floor bedroom, where they found
the 3- and 5-year-olds barely alive. The firefighters got the children out of
the burning house, and tried to resuscitate them, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had the camera, we would have located them three or four minutes
earlier," said Pomponio. "We probably could have saved their lives."

<HEADLINE> Bush Ally King Endorses McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Peter King switched allegiances Sunday and endorsed
Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination, accusing former
ally George W. Bush of displaying a ``willingness to take any road to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
	   King announced his decision in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press, one day after McCain's campaign lost to Bush in South Carolina's GOP
primary. ``It just shows you the feelings I have for the man,'' the New York
Republican said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   King said Bush lost his support during the South Carolina campaign when he
visited Bob Jones University, a hotbed of religious conservatives that critics
say espouses segregation and anti-Catholic views. McCain did not speak at the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the White
House,'' said King, who first signaled that he might defect after McCain won New
Hampshire's leadoff primary Feb. 1 and gained momentum headed into the South
Carolina contest.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other prominent Bush backers privately warned in advance of South Carolina's
election that they might jump ship if Bush lost, prompting the Texas governor to
denounce ``weak-kneed'' allies.
</P>
<P>
	   King said such ``macho talk'' angered him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time somebody equates standing up for their religious convictions as
weak-kneed, that raises questions about their qualifications to serve'' as
president, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   King acknowledged that political considerations drove him to Bush in the
first place. New York Gov. George Pataki urged the state's delegation to rally
behind the front-runner to protect the state's interests, King said. ``It seemed
to me that Bush was so far in front that it wasn't worth disagreeing with the
governor on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly converted King said McCain is better qualified than Bush to be
president, particularly on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had differences with John McCain over the years. He's a strong-minded
guy and we've had a couple of arguments. Having said that, I just think he
really has what it takes to be president,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Land Rover To Leave Md. for N.J.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LANHAM, Md. (AP) -- Land Rover North America, maker of the Range Rover
luxury sport-utility vehicle, will pull its national headquarters, along with 60
jobs, out of Maryland, moving closer to the U.S. headquarters of its parent, BMW
Group, in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision to move the company's administrative and marketing operations
was announced to employees on Jan. 31, a Land Rover spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The move represents a change in course for the company, which four years ago
announced plans to expand in the Washington area. Land Rover spent $10 million
to build its 60,000-square-foot corporate headquarters and the company campus,
known as Land Rover University, which included a 10,000-square-foot training
campus with an accompanying six-acre off-road track.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Revlon Sells Products Unit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Revlon Inc. has agreed to sell its professional products
business to an investment group led by the unit's chairman for $315 million. The
sale is part of a plan to help Revlon pay off debt and return to profitability.
</P>
<P>
	   British buyout firm CVC Capital Partners with Carlos Colomer, who is
chairman of Revlon Professional Products Worldwide, and other investors
announced the deal Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Colomer will be chief executive of the new company, which will be known as
the Colomer Group. The business was owned by the Colomer family before Revlon
bought it in 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly all of the 1,500 employees affiliated with the unit being sold will
be transferred to the new company, Revlon said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the deal, the Colomer Group also will sell Revlon products in Spain
and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
	   Revlon, which makes Revlon and Almay makeup, Flex shampoo and Charlie
perfume, will pay the partnership an additional $10 million if certain
contingencies are met.
</P>
<P>
	   The sale, which is subject to regulatory approval, was expected to close
next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Revlon announced plans to sell the professional products unit in November,
when it named Jeffrey M. Nugent its new president and chief executive.
Sixty-percent of the money raised from the sale was to be used to help pay
Revlon's nearly $2 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The company continues to look for a buyer for some of its Latin American
brands.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will continue to cut costs through restructuring. ... Although we still
have some distance to go before we achieve satisfactory levels of performance,
Revlon is on the right course," Nugent said. "In fact, results this far in 2000
appear very encouraging."
</P>
<P>
	   Revlon reported a fourth quarter net loss of $168.7 million, or $3.29 per
share, compared with a loss of $69.1 million, or $1.35 per share, for the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to net savings from restructuring of $45 million to $50
million starting this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales fell 35 percent to $414.4 million during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, Revlon reported a net loss of $371.5 million, or $7.25 per
share, compared with a loss of $143.2 million, or $2.80 a share, for all of
1998. Annual sales were $1.86 billion, down 17 percent.

<HEADLINE> Terror Suspect Freed in Mauritania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) -- Three weeks after his arrest, a Mauritanian
suspected of plotting bomb attacks against the United States has been released.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohamedou Ould Slahi was released by Mauritanian authorities ``for lack of
proof'' on Saturday and returned to his home in Nouakchott, the capital of this
West African nation, the man's brother, Hamoud Ould Slahi, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was interrogated repeatedly but was not mistreated while in custody,
the brother said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mauritanian official speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed Slahi's
release but did not comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi was arrested in Mauritania's capital in late January after reportedly
being held briefly in neighboring Senegal on his way back home.
</P>
<P>
	   The family believed the arrest was part of a ``grand campaign of falsehood
orchestrated by the West without foundation,'' the accused man's brother said
without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi, who had been living in Canada, left there in part because of an
investigation into an alleged bomb plot U.S. authorities say was tied to
millionaire fugitive Osama bin Laden, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service
has said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian who had been living in Canada, was arrested in
Washington state on Dec. 14 in connection with that plot for allegedly trying to
smuggle bomb-making components into the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials accuse bin Laden, a Saudi believed to be living in
Afghanistan, of masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. Those attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans. No specific
evidence has been released linking bin Laden to the latest bomb-smuggling plot.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time of Slahi's arrest, law enforcement officials in Washington said
they wanted to question him but by Sunday it remained unclear whether U.S.
officials had spoken to him during his detention.
</P>
<P>
	   Slahi is reportedly the brother-in-law of one of bin Laden's top
lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
	   American officials had earlier said they were unsure of Slahi's role in the
alleged operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports earlier this month of several other related arrests in Mauritania
have remained unconfirmed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jets Bomb Iraqi Defense Sites  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- U.S. jets bombed an Iraqi air defense system in Iraq's
northern no-fly zone Sunday in response to a missile attack, the U.S. military
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iraqi forces fired multiple surface-to-air missiles at warplanes on
patrol, the Germany-based U.S. European Command said in a statement. Coalition
aircraft responded to the Iraqi attacks with bombs, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   All planes left the area 250 miles north of Baghdad safely, it said. The
planes are based at Incirlik air base in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's Air Defense Command said the warplanes attacked nonmilitary targets.
It told the official Iraqi News Agency that ``enemy warplanes have bombed our
service and civil installations.''
</P>
<P>
	   The agency did not report details on casualties or where the bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, Baghdad said three Iraqi civilians were wounded when U.S.
warplanes bombed the same region during patrols of the no-fly zone. Saturday's
attack was carried out in response to Iraqi artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and British planes have often targeted Iraqi military sites since Iraq
began challenging the patrols in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Baghdad does not recognize the no-fly zones, which were set up after the
1991 Gulf War to protect Shiite Muslims in the south and Kurds in the north from
the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reformists Winning Big in Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A former intelligence minister whose agents were
accused of killing political enemies was among leading hard-liners going down to
defeat Sunday as it became increasingly clear that Iranians want a reform-minded
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   If the returns from Friday's election continue to favor the reformists, as
is likely, it will be the first time the parliament is free of hard-line
domination since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Results had been announced Sunday for 190 of the 290 seats in the Majlis, or
parliament. Winners are listed only by name, not affiliation, but a background
check of the candidates by The Associated Press showed the winners included 137
reformists -- or 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives had taken 44 seats, or 23 percent, and independents had nine
seats, or 5 percent. The Interior Ministry, in charge of the elections, will
announce the final results when they become known later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, four provincial cities were reported calm after election-related
violence Saturday that left eight dead, Kayhan newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper said three teen-agers were killed and 10 injured when police fired
into a crowd that was trying to get into the governor's office in the town of
Dasht-e-Azadegan. The young men were angry that their candidate did not win, the
paper said. It did not give the candidate's affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people were reportedly killed in the town of Shush in clashes with
police. They were protesting the re-election of a candidate they accused of
vote-buying, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Isfahan, Iran's second-largest city, reformists won all five seats. A
big-name hard-line loser there was former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists have suggested that Fallahian should be officially questioned
about rogue Intelligence Ministry agents who murdered five dissidents in 1998.
In 1997, a German court issued a warrant for Fallahian, saying Iran's highest
rulers ordered the 1992 assassination of an Iranian-Kurdish opposition figure in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   A reformist wave has been sweeping Iran since the May 1997 election of
President Mohammad Khatami. The 56-year-old president, a moderate Shiite cleric,
has captured the hearts of the young with his efforts to widen individual
freedoms, free the press and reduce the clergy's interference in the government,
the judiciary and people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami's initiatives had been stymied by hard-liners who controlled the
outgoing Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   With the new parliament convening in June, what remains to be seen is
whether the hard-liners will continue to use their key powers to block the
reformists. The Guardian Council, 12 clerics and lawyers, must approve all bills
passed by Parliament. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has the
final word. He heads the armed forces, judiciary and state-run radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in the conservative camp appeared ready to accept the people's verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has now been confirmed that the Iranians are responsible for their own
affairs,'' the hard-line Tehran Times said. It said Iranians have made clear
that the government must ``immediately address their problems to make the
society healthy and wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such comments came as hard-liners were going down to defeat across the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Ali Zaddsar -- an outspoken hard-liner who was involved in a failed
impeachment bid against Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani -- lost his seat in
Jiroft in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Another conservative stalwart who went down in the voting was Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, an incumbent from Damavand in northern Iran. Rasouli-Nejad played
a role in the 1998 impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri and last
year's bid to impeach Mohajerani. Both Nouri and Mohajerani support Khatami's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Nouri, who is serving a five-year jail sentence on charges that included
religious dissent, was allowed to go home on leave Sunday. Leaves are granted to
Iranian prisoners for definite periods to visit family. Nouri's lasts until
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Water company asks feds to stop use of gasoline additive  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HADDON HEIGHTS, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey's largest water utility is asking
federal officials to stop the use of a controversial gasoline additive after
detecting low levels of the potentially cancer-causing substance in some of its
wells.
<P>
	   The additive - methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE - helps reduce air
pollution by making gasoline burn cleaner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes no sense to protect one medium (air) at the expense of another
(water)," Kevin Dixon, water quality director for New Jersey-American Water Co.,
told the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill for Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey-American has detected MTBE traces ranging from 0.5 to 4.5 parts
per billion in six of the company's 200 wells statewide. Wells in Atlantic,
Burlington and Morris counties have been affected, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the levels are well below the state's safety standard of 70 parts
per billion, the company is concerned that the problem could worsen if MTBE
continues in use.
</P>
<P>
	   It has found an ally in a top-ranking official of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no reason we should subject ourselves to the potential risk of this
groundwater contamination any longer," Robert Perciasepe, an EPA assistant
administrator, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency has been barraged by complaints about MTBE since the CBS
newsmagazine "60 Minutes" did a Jan. 16 segment on it. New Jersey-American
distributed a fact sheet on MTBE concerns to local officials who contacted the
company after the "60 Minutes" report.
</P>
<P>
	   Perciasepe said Congress needs to modify the federal Clean Air Act to allow
for adoption of a replacement fuel formula that will eliminate the need for
MTBE.
</P>
<P>
	   Two New Jersey congressmen - Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley Heights, and Rep.
Frank Pallone Jr., D-Long Branch - have introduced bills that would phase out
the use of MTBE over three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Franks noted that MTBE has been detected in more than 400 private and 65
public wells statewide. He wants the EPA to study methods of removing MTBE from
water supplies. No such technology now exists.
</P>
<P>
	   MTBE started turning up in New Jersey-American's wells as soon as the
company started testing for it three years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Perciasepe said the EPA believes the chemical is seeping into water supplies
mostly from spills during refueling of cars and trucks, lawn mowers and other
equipment with gasoline-powered engines.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate over MTBE is nothing new to Barry Grossman, a Plainsboro resident
who has opposed the use of the additive since the early 1990s and who founded
the group Oxybusters to lobby for its elimination.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been fighting this for seven years, and it's criminal that the EPA is
moving on this only now. It took an expose by '60 Minutes' to make the EPA
listen," he said.

<HEADLINE> China's Rural Labor Force Swells  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's rural labor force is swelling just as farms need
fewer workers, a trend that is likely to force migrants to compete for already
scarce jobs in cities, the official China Daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 10 million rural Chinese are expected to enter the job market every
year during the next five years, bringing China's labor force in the countryside
to 600 million by 2005, the newspaper reported in its Business Weekly edition.
</P>
<P>
	   By 2005, only 168 million Chinese will be needed to work on farms, the
newspaper said, citing a study by a think tank under the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings add to an already dim employment picture in China. Chinese
leaders are worried that frequent protests by unemployed workers across China
could turn into anti-government demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cities, unemployment is already at 6.5 percent as state industries
lay off workers to cope with free-market reforms. Official statistics mask the
extent of the problem by excluding first-time job-seekers and rural migrants.
</P>
<P>
	   China Daily reported that last year only 22 million out of the 70 million
unemployed rural laborers who went to cities found work. Cities will be able to
absorb only as many as 7 million more rural laborers a year over the next five
years, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese government has encouraged the build-up of rural industries to
alleviate pressure on cities. At the same time, many cities have tried to keep
migrants out to protect jobs. Beijing, for one, prohibits about 100 trades from
employing migrants, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Belgians Protest Haider's Inclusion  </HEADLINE>
   By CONSTANT BRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- About 20,000 Belgians, some wearing yellow stars
as a symbol of protest, took to the street Sunday to speak out against a
far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgian leaders, war veterans, sports celebrities and concentration camp
survivors led the crowd in an anti-fascist march that took protesters past the
Austrian embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the latest of dozens of similar marches across Europe since Joerg
Haider's Freedom Party joined the new coalition government in Austria. The
outrage stems from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU expansion, as
well as previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   Belgium has taken a strong stand against Haider's far-right movement.
Concern here is heightened by expectation that Belgium's own far-right Flemish
Bloc party will make big gains in local elections this year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Unfortunately we have such a situation in Europe. Demonstrations do
help,'' Foreign Minister Louis Michel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sunday's protest in the city where the European Union has its headquarters
drew not only Belgians but other Europeans who work at EU institutions anchored
here. Many chanted ``no to fascism in Europe.'' Others walked silently, wearing
yellow stars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is urgent to fight anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia. It is
necessary to fight for a democratic Europe,'' organizers of the march said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   The march marked the end of a weekend of organized anti-Haider protest in
many European capitals. On Saturday, more than 150,000 flag-waving demonstrators
protested the coalition in Vienna and about 9,000 demonstrated in Paris.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview to be published Monday, new Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel said he thinks Europe is being unfair in its treatment of his
government. Schuessel leads the People's Party, a mainstream conservative party
that formed the coalition with the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
	   European countries have a ``dialogue with Russia, despite Chechnya,'' he was
quoted as saying in the conservative French daily Le Figaro. ``Europeans,
therefore, have no right to refuse dialogue within their own family.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I guarantee you that ... my government will betray neither democracy nor
Europe and will always combat racism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that he ``believes that Haider has changed. He has become more
serious, more responsible. ... He will do everything not to wreck this historic
chance.''

<HEADLINE> British Tabloid Bans Stock Dabbling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LONDON (AP) -- Two popular stock tipsters have left The Mirror newspaper and
senior editors have been barred from dabbling in the stock market, the owners of
the mass-market tabloid announced.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's action by Trinity Mirror PLC concluded an internal investigation
which began with reports that The Mirror's editor, Piers Morgan, had made a
quick profit by buying shares which were promoted in the next day's edition of
the paper.
</P>
<P>
	   Morgan has said he was unaware that the shares were being tipped in the
"City Slickers" column, written by Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell. Morgan sold
the shares and donated the profit to a charity, and remains as editor of
Britain's second-largest daily paper.
</P>
<P>
	   Bhoyrul and Hipwell, however, left the paper following "disciplinary
procedures," according to a statement from Trinity Mirror. The tipsters had
admitted promoting shares in companies in which they owned stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinity Mirror said that editors, deputy editors and financial journalists
on its newspapers would not be permitted to own shares -- except for shares in
Trinity Mirror.
</P>
<P>
	   Trinity Mirror also publishes Sunday Mirror and The People, both national
weekend tabloids, and a number of regional newspapers in Britain and Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Man Shoots To Death 7 Relatives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- A former security guard on Sunday shot and
killed seven relatives, including two young children, and then fled, police
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims included the man's wife, her three sisters, a brother-in-law and
two of the man's children, aged 3 and 7.
</P>
<P>
	   All were shot in their heads execution-style. A 13-year-old daughter escaped
the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting spree began around 7 a.m. at a farm near Prince Alfred Hamlet
in Western Cape, police spokesman Anton de Kock said. The name of the suspect, a
former member of the South African Defense Force, was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
	   Louis Milne, who runs the farm, said the 35-year-old gunman had worked as a
security guard on the property until six months ago, when he was fired for
pointing a gun at his nephew. He said he wanted to shoot his family because his
wife wanted a divorce, Milne said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Sunday's attack, the man fled into a gorge taking a citizens band
radio with him, de Kock said.

<HEADLINE> Publishers Clearing House Deal OKd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) -- A federal judge has approved a $30 million
settlement of a class-action lawsuit that accused Publishers Clearing House of
misleading its sweepstakes entrants.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit claimed the company duped people into buying magazines by falsely
leading them to believe it would increase their chances of winning millions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   The settlement had won preliminary approval last June by U.S. District Judge
G. Patrick Murphy. But attorneys general from many states objected, contending
it would prevent further claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy's order, issued Friday, does not stop the states from pursuing their
own legal actions. However, they cannot sue for further restitution. Murphy
concluded the settlement was fair, reasonable and adequate.
</P>
<P>
	   The suit was filed two years ago on behalf of people who received Publishers
Clearing House solicitations between February 1992 and last June. Publishers
Clearing House admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
	   Mailings went out to 42.5 million people who had entered the sweepstakes,
and lawyers estimated as many as 25,000 claims might be processed.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said up to $21 million will be paid out in claims, with each claimant
getting 100 percent of what he or she paid to Publishers Clearing House. He said
the notification process cost the company $8 million and that the total cost of
the settlement is at least $30 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said there were some objections by class members to the $3 million in
attorneys fees Publishers Clearing House must pay, but he approved the fees as
fair and reasonable.

<HEADLINE> Police Say Mayor's Son Made Threats  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The mayor's 21-year-old son was taken into custody
after threatening to shoot up the local high school during an argument with a
bus driver, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   No charges were filed against Dakin Andrews Weekley, the son of Mayor Jimmy
Weekley. He eventually was released and driven home by police after the incident
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bus driver Robert Roberts told authorities that Weekley, a community college
student, had boarded the bus and refused to pay the full fare.
</P>
<P>
	   An argument ensued, and Weekley allegedly said: ``You are messing with a
student, the future of our country. That's OK. I will shoot up the high
school.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a dumb thing for him to have done,'' his father said. ``He made a
smart-aleck remark. It was just an argument with a bus driver.''

<HEADLINE> Player takes hockey fight off the ice and into court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Fights between hockey players usually end with a
trip to the penalty box, but a brawl between members of two college teams has
continued on to federal court.
<P>
	   The personal injury lawsuit by Robert Alfieri of the William Paterson Hockey
Club is unusual, as it arises from a sports event.
</P>
<P>
	   Such claims face a stiff legal standard: reckless disregard for the safety
of another player.
</P>
<P>
	   But Alfieri lawyer Robert B. Woodruff believes this case qualifies,
asserting that his client was assaulted by Wagner College players who left their
bench during a break in play.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is obviously an action taken while the game was not in progress,"
Woodruff said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri is seeking unspecified money damages from the Staten Island, N.Y.,
school, the hockey club coach, and some players, one of whom he accuses of
kicking him after he fell during the fight, slashing his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has an extremely ugly looking forehead for a 21-year-old boy," Woodruff
said, estimating the scar at 2 1/2 inches long.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri, of Wayne, also suffered headaches and "other physical ailments"
from the fight, said the lawsuit, filed this month in U.S. District Court here.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagner lawyer John P. Connors Jr., said the school denies the allegations,
but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wagner coach, Charles Crispino, denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawsuits stemming from participants in sporting events are still rare, but
on the increase, said Freehold lawyer Richard Anslow, chairman of entertainment,
arts and sports law section of the New Jersey State Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
	   To prevail, Alfieri probably will need to show that "things were done over
and above the typical hockey fight," said Anslow, who is not involved in the
case. The player may also need to show that the coach encouraged the fight,
Anslow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri, a senior forward, continues to play hockey for the club of the
Wayne-based school, which could limit the amount of money he could win, Anslow
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the kid's up and playing ... what are the real damages to him?" he
asked. "That's something that the defense attorneys would try to bring out."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court set the standard for sports injury cases in New
Jersey in 1994, ruling that a catcher in a softball game who was hurt during a
home-plate collision had no basis to sue because such collisions were a
foreseeable part of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Heightened recklessness," Justice Alan B. Handler wrote, "recognizes a
commonsense distinction between excessively harmful conduct and the more routine
rough-and-tumble of sports that should occur freely on the playing fields."
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interpretation of that case, a state appellate panel reinstated
a lawsuit in which a golfer struck by a partner's ball claims he is due
compensation because the player did not announce he was taking a second shot
from the tee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We conclude that hitting an unannounced and unexpected mulligan from the
tee after all members of the foursome have teed off creates such an
unanticipated risk to the other members of the foursome, from which they cannot
protect themselves, that it cannot be considered an inherent or integral part of
the game," Judge Leonard N. Arnold wrote last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri's lawsuit stems from a match in Staten Island on Dec. 9. No charges
have been filed, but an investigation is continuing, New York Police Detective
Stephen Grundmann said Friday. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagner led, 4-2, when officials stopped play with less than a minute
remaining to assess penalties for a fight that did not involve Alfieri. Alfieri
skated to the Wagner bench, and words were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was nothing inflammatory," Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Wagner players left the bench, encircled Alfieri, began punching him
and ripped his helmet from his head, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guys from Wagner's side just kept piling on," recalled Paterson team
captain Robert Carnathan.
</P>
<P>
	   "A bunch of them had him on the ground" when Christopher Nahas kicked
Alfieri in the face, opening a cut, Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The next thing you know, Rob was crawling out of this pile and blood was
just pouring out," Carnathan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials stopped the game and declared Wagner the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wagner coach, Crispino, said last week that Alfieri instigated the
fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told my players to stay on bench," and they did, Crispino said.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that Alfieri was outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
	   "From what I gathered, it was just two kids squaring off, and he got cut on
the face, either from being punched or falling on the ice," Crispino said. "He
was not kicked."
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri played and Wagner again won, 8-2, when the teams met Feb. 13, this
time without any fights, Crispino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crispino, 34, said he has played hockey for 20 years and could not recall
such a lawsuit. "You get into a fight and that's the end of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to reach Nahas for comment were not successful.

<HEADLINE> Medicare Cuts Hurting W.Va. Elderly  </HEADLINE>
   By MALIA RULON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. ALBANS, W.Va. (AP) -- Fifty-eight words buried inside the Balanced
Budget Act kept 83-year-old Una Thomas from receiving a series of
stroke-preventing blood tests. For 18 months, she went without the tests, which
cost about $80 each.
</P>
<P>
	   She suffered a stroke in late December. On New Year's Day, she died.
</P>
<P>
	   Her family blames her death on legislation that cut an estimated $206
billion from Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled. The
cuts deemed Thomas and 5,400 other state residents ineligible for home health
care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A lot of these patients have died,'' said Lisa Smith, a state lawmaker who
owns Elite HealthCare Inc., a home health care business.
</P>
<P>
	   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was passed to eliminate the federal deficit
and safeguard Medicare's trust fund beyond 2002. Lawmakers targeted Medicare,
particularly home health care, because of rapidly rising costs and concerns of
fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We had to make those cuts. But in this case, we went too far,'' said Sen.
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which
regulates Medicare.
</P>
<P>
	   In West Virginia, where rural life is the norm for residents struggling with
poor health habits and jobs that don't provide insurance, the cuts have hit
especially hard.
</P>
<P>
	   The state ranks second only to Florida in the percentage of its population
covered by Medicare -- 18 percent compared with 14 percent nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you're that dependent on federal funds, that's what makes the
Balanced Budget Act so critical,'' said Lew Newberry, administrator at Roane
General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 2 1/2 years since the Medicare cuts were enacted, West Virginia's
health care industry has taken a nose-dive.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty home health agencies have closed, Man Appalachian Regional Hospital
is on the brink of closing and a chain of nursing homes has filed for
bankruptcy. Hospitals have also closed rural clinics and skilled nursing
facilities, reduced services, eliminated patient beds and cut staff -- just to
break even.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All the easy cost shifts and management tricks you can make -- they're all
gone,'' said Robert Hammer, chief executive of Davis Memorial Hospital in
Elkins. ``We're to the point now where we don't have anywhere left to cut. So
the next thing is, we start cutting services.''
</P>
<P>
	   The West Virginia Hospital Association estimates the state's 69 hospitals
will lose $525 million over five years. The West Virginia Council of Home Health
Care Agencies says the state's remaining 71 home health companies are each
losing about $180,000 a year. The state's 55 county health departments have
already lost $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond the closings, losses and layoffs are the faces of West Virginia's
elderly. Health care professionals say many patients are discharged from
hospitals too early, then end up in the emergency room because they can't get
the home health services they need to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   In Thomas' case, these 58 words cut off her home treatment:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Venipuncture (drawing of blood for the purpose of obtaining a blood
sample) will be excluded from the eligibility criteria for intermittent skilled
nursing services, under the home health benefit. If venipuncture for the purpose
of obtaining a blood sample is the only skilled service that is needed by the
beneficiary, that individual will not qualify for home health.''
</P>
<P>
	   And so, no nurse visited Thomas at home to monitor the medicine she was
taking to ward off another stroke. Even with her daughter tending to her,
paralysis made trips to a hospital or clinic for the frequent tests an
unrealistic option.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why did they have to do it to the senior citizens, who can't fight for
themselves?'' daughter Ann Blevins asked in November, when her mother was still
alive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They didn't even consider what it would do to the older people,'' she
said. ``It was wrong to a lot of people, and it was wrong to my mother. It was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many others affected by the cuts face long drives on narrow mountain roads
to receive basic medical service that local clinics once offered.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're starting to see re-admissions of these patients increase,'' Hammer
said. ``They are getting into health trouble because they don't have the
services they need, and that is a trend statewide and nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
	   But state lawmakers say they don't have the money to do anything about it.
They say since Congress created the problem, it should create the solution.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What really irritates you is the feds are sitting up there with a surplus
and trying to decide how to spend it and West Virginia is sitting here with a
deficit and trying to decide how to continue programs or which ones have to be
cut,'' said state Sen. Jon Blair Hunter, who is also executive director of the
West Virginia Council of Home Health Care Agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress passed a partial funding fix in November, with legislation to
restore $12.2 billion in cuts. Over a 10-year period, a total of $16.4 billion
will be restored.
</P>
<P>
	   But with roughly $206 billion cut from the coverage, health care advocates
say that's not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're glad that they gave us what they gave us, but it's really just a
drop in the bucket compared to what they took out,'' said Ann Howard of the
American Federation of HomeCare Providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1997, more than 3,000 home health agencies have closed nationwide,
leaving large rural areas of the country with no home health services, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet reports to Congress from the General Accounting Office suggest that
everyone who has a need is being taken care of.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of those (reports) has found any access or quality problems resulting
from the Balanced Budget Act,'' said Chris Peacock, spokesman for the federal
Health Care Financing Administration.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Win Foretold Reform Victory  </HEADLINE>
   By VIJAY JOSHI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's hard-line ruling clergy wanted merely to spice
up the 1997 presidential race when they approved the moderate candidacy of a
relatively unknown mullah named Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Khatami's surprising landslide victory set in motion a reform
juggernaut that, according to weekend results, was sweeping hard-liners out of
Parliament, dealing another blow to their shrinking influence.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform candidates -- who have promised to create a civil society with
individual and political freedoms -- are riding on Khatami's success, popularity
and vision.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's election has been sanctified by the reformist movement. The
coalition that seemed to be winning Friday's election calls itself 2nd of
Khordad, a reference to the date in the Iranian calendar -- equivalent to May
23, 1997 -- when the presidential poll was held.
</P>
<P>
	   As a candidate, Khatami became a magnet for closet liberals and provided
hope to the youth and women groaning under the rigid rules enforced in the name
of Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   To the hard-liners, letting Khatami run was a blunder. To most Iranians it
was a boon. Here, finally, was a cleric who understood their frustrations and
promised something different. He won 20 million of the 29 million votes cast.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, Khatami hasn't let them down. Taking cue from his public statements,
young men and women have been able to mingle without fearing the Baseej
paramilitary forces who used to enforce religious values. Banned satellite
dishes are discreetly appearing on rooftops, the mandatory women's head scarves
are sliding back to show more and more hair.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami, a soft-spoken scholar, does not advocate doing away with the
Islamic system that came with the 1979 revolution, but his moderate
interpretation of the religion has been widely accepted by Iranians, most of
them devout Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   More importantly, Khatami gave Iranians the confidence to criticize the
clergy, which saw itself as the interpreter of God's word and beyond reproach.
Outspoken newspapers have flourished in his rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Until Khatami's election, presidential races in Iran were stage-managed. The
Council of Guardians, a hard-line clique, would nominate the clerical
contestants, usually one heavyweight and other unknowns. People had little
confidence in the elections and turnout was low.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1997 race changed all that. Though an outsider, Khatami, a former
culture minister, was not totally unknown. His main rival, Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri, boasted during the campaign that the challenge was welcome. He even
quoted a Farsi proverb to emphasize his point: It would nice ``to heat up the
furnace a little,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   After Khatami's victory, Nateq-Nouri's boast gave rise to a new joke in
Iran. The punch line was: ``the furnace became so hot that it burned down the
house.''
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-liners fought back. Using the judiciary under their control, they
shut down reformist newspapers. In response, the pro-Khatami Culture Ministry
gave licenses to others. The president's allies were jailed by the judiciary;
the reformist interior minister was impeached by the outgoing hard-line
dominated Parliament; intellectuals and students' groups were attacked by
hard-line vigilantes
</P>
<P>
	   But every hard-line blow only made the reformists more popular. Khatami
became a superhero.
</P>
<P>
	   Khatami's main advantage is that he is not an outsider trying to vanquish
the system but an insider trying to change it.
</P>
<P>
	   As it became clear over the last few months that people are bent on change,
the hard-liners have also started backing down.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative Council of Guardians, which screened all candidates for the
parliamentary elections, allowed hundreds of reformers to run. In previous
elections, it had rejected liberal candidates on specious grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The council, which also vets legislation, is unlikely to block the new
Parliament for fear of angering the people, said Mohammedreza Zohdi, editor of
the independent Arya newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   He said supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, although a hard-liner, will
be loath to resort to extraconstitutional methods. Doing that would allow
reformists to accuse him of violating the sacrosanct ideals of the Islamic
revolution's founder, Ayatollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
	   In a symbol of the changing times, the reformists opened a campaign office
in a former discotheque shut down during the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   Dancing in public is banned.

<HEADLINE> Police use underage drinking raid to find, subpoena dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The task force investigating last month's fatal dorm
fire at Seton Hall University has subpoenaed several students, including one of
three now at the center of the investigation, to testify before an Essex County
grand jury, according to a published report.
<P>
	   Authorities, frustrated by an investigation grown cold, used a raid on
underage drinkers at a popular bar blocks from the university in South Orange to
round up students who are potential witnesses or suspects, according to The
Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of students were arrested during the raid at the New Hall Tavern just
before 1:30 a.m. Friday. Nearly a dozen, whom investigators had expected to be
at the bar, were given subpoenas to testify Tuesday, the newspaper reported for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those present in the bar early Friday has admitted "trashing" the
third-floor lounge in Boland Hall minutes before the 4:30 a.m. fire on Jan. 19,
but he denies starting it, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to confirm or deny anything regarding grand jury subpoenas,"
Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant prosecutor for Essex County, said
Sunday. She also refused to "discuss or make any comment on the fire
investigation."
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said they believe the fire was set, but law enforcement
sources which the newspaper did not identify said their investigation has been
hampered because some students have been withholding information.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're closer to the beginning than the end of the investigation," Essex
County Prosecutor Donald Campolo, who heads the investigation, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   One unnamed law enforcement source told the Star-Ledger that authorities
"have nothing to move ahead on and won't unless something gives."
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze killed three freshmen and injured 62 people. Four students
remained hospitalized Sunday, one of them still in critical condition in the
intensive care unit at Saint Barnabas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The three Seton Hall freshmen on whom the investigation is now focusing
include two Boland Hall residents. All three students were in the bar early
Friday, and one - not the student who trashed the lounge - was given a subpoena,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The three freshmen, who are friends, have all been interviewed once but have
since retained lawyers and have refused to give investigators further
interviews. Grand jury witnesses, however, must answer questions without their
lawyers present, although they can decline to make statements incriminating
themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Sunday that officers uncovered information that the New Hall
Tavern was serving alcohol to minors as a result of their "very comprehensive"
investigation, which has included interviews with many of the dorm's 600
students and other witnesses. She said staff from the prosecutor's office, along
with state troopers, Essex County sheriff's officers and representatives of the
state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control participated in the raid early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers charged 37 people in the tavern with underage drinking. The bar's
owner, John Holland, 56, of Cedar Grove, was charged with serving minors,
possessing an unregistered handgun and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Record of Hackensack reported Saturday that the tavern, known to
students as "The Hall," had its license on a two-year suspension until two
months ago because of similar violations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, some Seton Hall students say they are upset that the people
responsible may still be among them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think if there was an arrest made it would make people feel that much
better," freshman Justin Maker, 19, said last week.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Give Bush a Push  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE MOKRZYCKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   It's all about ideology, at least in the Republican presidential primaries
so far. In his South Carolina rebound, Gov. George W. Bush consolidated the
conservative vote and even gained among moderates, a key bloc for Sen. John
McCain in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's image as a straight-shooting reformer helped steer him to victory
Feb. 1 in New Hampshire and a surprising second a week later in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush countered by saying his record as a second-term Texas governor shows
he's the ``reformer with results'' and that McCain is hypocritical in vowing to
overhaul campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
	   Those tactics succeeded, according to exit polls conducted by Voter News
Service for The Associated Press and the television networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Dramatizing the turnaround: In New Hampshire's GOP primary, 63 percent said
McCain says what he believes and not just what people want to hear; just 31
percent said that of Bush. In South Carolina, 52 percent described Bush that
way, 51 percent said it about McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Among South Carolina conservatives, 61 percent called Bush a
straight-talker; only 43 percent said that about McCain. The split was
especially sharp among those who called themselves ``very conservative.'' But
among moderates and liberals, 63 percent called McCain the straight-talker, 37
percent Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-three percent of South Carolina GOP voters called Bush a ``real
reformer'' while only 55 percent said that of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush appears to have won most of the kinds of voters who supported Steve
Forbes in the Iowa caucuses Jan. 24, New Hampshire and Delaware before the
millionaire publisher abandoned his campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's share of the conservative vote slipped about 5 percentage points
and his backing from moderates held steady from New Hampshire to South Carolina
on Saturday. Conservatives comprised 6 in 10 South Carolina GOP voters, compared
with half in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's share of those who call themselves very conservative rose from 34
percent in Iowa and New Hampshire and 54 percent in Delaware to 74 percent in
South Carolina. Among the ``somewhat conservative,'' Bush went from 36 percent
in New Hampshire to 59 percent Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also won 37 percent of moderates in South Carolina, up from 26 percent
in New Hampshire. Bush won nearly half of such voters in Iowa and Delaware,
where McCain did not compete.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes won 11 percent of moderates, 13 percent of the somewhat conservative
and 21 percent of the very conservative in New Hampshire. He quit after
finishing a distant third in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush gained among the religious right, which made up a third of the
electorate Saturday. He won two-thirds of their vote, compared to about a third
in Iowa and New Hampshire. Here too, Bush seemed to gain from Forbes' exit. He
also cut into Alan Keyes' support among Christian conservatives -- 18 percent
voted for Keyes in New Hampshire, only 8 percent in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a third of South Carolina voters said moral values was the top
issue, and more than half of them backed Bush. He also won 8 in 10 of those who
said the top candidate quality was that he best represents conservative values.
Both measures were sharp improvements for Bush from New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bush rallied the right wing, he won back his party's faithful, an area of
relative weakness for him in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Among self-described Republicans in South Carolina, Bush beat McCain 69
percent to 26 percent. In New Hampshire, Bush only edged McCain 42 percent to 37
percent in that group.
</P>
<P>
	   Compounding the effect in South Carolina: 61 percent of GOP primary voters
there said they usually consider themselves Republican, up from 53 percent in
New Hampshire. South Carolina's GOP primary was open to all voters, regardless
of party registration; New Hampshire's was open only to registered Republicans
or independents.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were based on surveys of 1,700 voters in the Iowa GOP caucuses,
2,240 in the New Hampshire GOP primary, 1,417 in the Delaware Republican contest
and 2,078 in South Carolina. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3.5
percentage points in Delaware, 3 points in Iowa and South Carolina, and 2.5
points in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Democratic race, which is on hold until voting resumes March 7, Vice
President Al Gore cruised to victory in Iowa and to a narrower win over Bill
Bradley in New Hampshire on the perception that he has the right experience to
be president and is a strong leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters concerned about Social Security and Medicare helped propel Gore in
Iowa, while he scored more points in New Hampshire among those most concerned
about the economy and jobs. Bradley's main strength in both states was that he
was seen as standing up for what he believes, is ``not a typical politician''
and has new ideas.

<P>
	   Among areas in which exit polls find that Gov. George W. Bush has gained in
his Republican presidential primary fight against Sen. John McCain, according to
Voter News Service exit polls.
</P>
<P>
	   -- ELECTABILITY: In New Hampshire, GOP primary voters split between Bush and
McCain as most likely to beat the Democratic nominee in November. In South
Carolina on Saturday, 57 percent said Bush is most electable, 38 percent McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   -- BUSH-HEFT: In New Hampshire, 34 percent said Bush lacks the knowledge to
serve effectively as president; that fell to 21 percent in South Carolina. And
while voters remain pretty evenly split over whether issues or the candidates'
personal qualities is more important, 61 percent of issues voters backed Bush on
Saturday, up from just 24 percent in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   -- VETERANS: In both New Hampshire and South Carolina, 1 in 4 voters were
veterans. But despite McCain's strong push for their vote, Bush won 47 percent
of them in South Carolina, up from 28 percent in New Hampshire. And only 4
percent in South Carolina cited McCain's military record -- he was a prisoner of
war for 5 1/2 years in Vietnam -- as the most important candidate quality.
</P>
<P>
	   -- FAVORABILITY: Both candidates had very high favorability ratings in New
Hampshire. But as the campaign headed south, so did its tone -- and McCain's
image took more of a hit as a result. Bush's unfavorable rating was pretty much
unchanged at 26 percent; McCain's doubled to 30 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush Ally King Endorses McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Peter King switched allegiances Sunday and endorsed
Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination, accusing former
ally George W. Bush of displaying a ``willingness to take any road to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
	   King announced his decision in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press, one day after McCain's campaign lost to Bush in South Carolina's GOP
primary. ``It just shows you the feelings I have for the man,'' the New York
Republican said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   King said Bush lost his support during the South Carolina campaign when he
visited Bob Jones University, a hotbed of religious conservatives that critics
say espouses segregation and anti-Catholic views. McCain did not speak at the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the White
House,'' said King, who first signaled that he might defect after McCain won New
Hampshire's leadoff primary Feb. 1 and gained momentum headed into the South
Carolina contest.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor regrets King's decision
``and respects congressman King's right to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other prominent Bush backers privately warned in advance of South Carolina's
election that they might jump ship if Bush lost, prompting the governor to
denounce ``weak-kneed'' allies.
</P>
<P>
	   King said such ``macho talk'' angered him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time somebody equates standing up for their religious convictions as
weak-kneed, that raises questions about their qualifications to serve'' as
president, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   King acknowledged that political considerations drove him to Bush in the
first place. New York Gov. George Pataki urged the state's delegation to rally
behind the front-runner to protect the state's interests, King said. ``It seemed
to me that Bush was so far in front that it wasn't worth disagreeing with the
governor on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly converted King said McCain is better qualified than Bush to be
president, particularly on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had differences with John McCain over the years. He's a strong-minded
guy and we've had a couple of arguments. Having said that, I just think he
really has what it takes to be president,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Player takes hockey fight off the ice and into court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Fights between hockey players usually end with a
trip to the penalty box, but a brawl between members of two college teams has
continued on to federal court.
<P>
	   The personal injury lawsuit by Robert Alfieri of the William Paterson Hockey
Club is unusual, as it arises from a sports event.
</P>
<P>
	   Such claims face a stiff legal standard: reckless disregard for the safety
of another player.
</P>
<P>
	   But Alfieri lawyer Robert B. Woodruff believes this case qualifies,
asserting that his client was assaulted by Wagner College players who left their
bench during a break in play.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is obviously an action taken while the game was not in progress,"
Woodruff said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri is seeking unspecified money damages from the Staten Island, N.Y.,
school, the hockey club coach, and some players, one of whom he accuses of
kicking him after he fell during the fight, slashing his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has an extremely ugly looking forehead for a 21-year-old boy," Woodruff
said, estimating the scar at 2 1/2 inches long.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri, of Wayne, also suffered headaches and "other physical ailments"
from the fight, said the lawsuit, filed this month in U.S. District Court here.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagner lawyer John P. Connors Jr., said the school denies the allegations,
but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wagner coach, Charles Crispino, denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawsuits stemming from participants in sporting events are still rare, but
on the increase, said Freehold lawyer Richard Anslow, chairman of entertainment,
arts and sports law section of the New Jersey State Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
	   To prevail, Alfieri probably will need to show that "things were done over
and above the typical hockey fight," said Anslow, who is not involved in the
case. The player may also need to show that the coach encouraged the fight,
Anslow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri, a senior forward, continues to play hockey for the club of the
Wayne-based school, which could limit the amount of money he could win, Anslow
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the kid's up and playing ... what are the real damages to him?" he
asked. "That's something that the defense attorneys would try to bring out."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court set the standard for sports injury cases in New
Jersey in 1994, ruling that a catcher in a softball game who was hurt during a
home-plate collision had no basis to sue because such collisions were a
foreseeable part of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Heightened recklessness," Justice Alan B. Handler wrote, "recognizes a
commonsense distinction between excessively harmful conduct and the more routine
rough-and-tumble of sports that should occur freely on the playing fields."
</P>
<P>
	   In a recent interpretation of that case, a state appellate panel reinstated
a lawsuit in which a golfer struck by a partner's ball claims he is due
compensation because the player did not announce he was taking a second shot
from the tee.
</P>
<P>
	   "We conclude that hitting an unannounced and unexpected mulligan from the
tee after all members of the foursome have teed off creates such an
unanticipated risk to the other members of the foursome, from which they cannot
protect themselves, that it cannot be considered an inherent or integral part of
the game," Judge Leonard N. Arnold wrote last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri's lawsuit stems from a match in Staten Island on Dec. 9. No charges
have been filed, but an investigation is continuing, New York Police Detective
Stephen Grundmann said Friday. He declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Wagner led, 4-2, when officials stopped play with less than a minute
remaining to assess penalties for a fight that did not involve Alfieri. Alfieri
skated to the Wagner bench, and words were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was nothing inflammatory," Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several Wagner players left the bench, encircled Alfieri, began punching him
and ripped his helmet from his head, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guys from Wagner's side just kept piling on," recalled Paterson team
captain Robert Carnathan.
</P>
<P>
	   "A bunch of them had him on the ground" when Christopher Nahas kicked
Alfieri in the face, opening a cut, Woodruff said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The next thing you know, Rob was crawling out of this pile and blood was
just pouring out," Carnathan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials stopped the game and declared Wagner the winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wagner coach, Crispino, said last week that Alfieri instigated the
fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told my players to stay on bench," and they did, Crispino said.
</P>
<P>
	   He denied that Alfieri was outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
	   "From what I gathered, it was just two kids squaring off, and he got cut on
the face, either from being punched or falling on the ice," Crispino said. "He
was not kicked."
</P>
<P>
	   Alfieri played and Wagner again won, 8-2, when the teams met Feb. 13, this
time without any fights, Crispino said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crispino, 34, said he has played hockey for 20 years and could not recall
such a lawsuit. "You get into a fight and that's the end of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to reach Nahas for comment were not successful.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Ridge, Pa. lawmakers mull action on college fire safety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - Gov. Tom Ridge wants to find out what
Pennsylvania colleges are doing to prevent a tragedy like the dormitory fire at
Seton Hall University that killed three students last month, but he is not
talking about an effort to require sprinklers in dorms.
<P>
	   Ridge "is very concerned about the safety of our students," said spokeswoman
Gretchen Toner. "He looks forward to talking to higher education about their
plans."
</P>
<P>
	   Two state lawmakers have introduced a resolution calling on the state to
look into the cost of installing sprinkler systems in public buildings including
apartments, dormitories and classroom buildings. The state Senate is to consider
the proposal when it reconvenes March 6, staff members said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike Waugh, R-York, and Sen. Lisa Boscola, D-Northampton, said they
first considered the resolution after a 1998 fire in a Bethlehem high-rise
apartment building. But the issue took on new urgency after the Jan. 19 fire at
Seton Hall in South Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   That dorm lacked a sprinkler system, which could have prevented the deaths
according to fire prevention specialists. Since many Pennsylvania college
dormitories do not have sprinkler systems, the lawmakers said the issue needs to
be looked into, although they realize it would be "an extremely expensive
proposition."
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Jack Wagner, D-Allegheny, wants quicker action by the 14 state-owned
universities. He said last week during a budget hearing that, rather than wait
for a study, the State System of Higher Education should seek state money to
retrofit its 155 dormitories with sprinkler systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The system estimates it would cost $25 million to $50 million to do that.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the state wants to embark on a program to put sprinklers in state-owned
buildings, we would be interested in participating," said system spokesman Kenn
Marshall. "And we'd be interested in receiving any state funding that would be
available to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, however, the institutions rather than the state have been
responsible for paying for such projects, Toner said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state-funded University of Pittsburgh, for example, has a five-year plan
to install sprinklers in dorm rooms lacking them. Spokesman Ken Service said the
$15 million needed will come from higher room and board fees as well as other
university sources.
</P>
<P>
	   Pitt decided to install sprinklers eight months before the Seton Hall fire,
but Service said the tragedy "reaffirmed for us we were on the right track."
</P>
<P>
	   A survey of 12 public and private college campuses in central Pennsylvania
done last month by The Patriot-News of Harrisburg showed only 17 of their 220
residential buildings had sprinkler systems. Another 140 duplex homes on Penn
State Harrisburg's campus were also without sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of those colleges reported having smoke detectors in dorm rooms, fire
extinguishers on every floor, and rules designed to prevent fires.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Sprinkler Association of Patterson, N.Y. says that, on average,
one student died in a fire in a dorm or sorority or fraternity house every year
from 1980 to 1996. Association president John Viniello wrote the governors of
every state earlier this month urging them to address concerns about fire safety
of student housing.

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Court N.Y. Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are ``morally blind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' Gore said, his
reference to Saturday's GOP primary drawing laughter from the audience at the
Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the flag, ``that accumulated heritage of injustice,'' he said the
Republican reaction reminded him of those who say racism is gone and that
America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds --
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, campaigning together for the first time this year
in New York where Clinton is making history as the first first lady to seek
public office, had warm words for each other, and a few hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She stands for the best values of New York state,'' Gore said of Clinton,
who is pitted against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race.
``Her voice will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up
for her.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored
by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before Gore
and Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the Apollo
Theatre in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   After some handshaking, Gore took off for New York City where he was meeting
with the editorial board of The Amsterdam News, a major black-oriented
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference brings together hundreds of the state's top black and
Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York
state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998
election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
``for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those attending the service appeared surprised by Gore's address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the first time I've seen Gore really speak with some passion,''
said Joseph Rhodes III, 47, of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Cast members and fans come to terms with impending close of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - There were tears, hugs and even smiles as cast members
and fans alike came to term Sunday with news that "Cats," the longest-running
show in Broadway history, is to close in June after a record-breaking 7,397
performances.
<P>
	   "When we got the news there were tears, sure, and hugs. And believe it or
not there was lots of laughter. Somehow everybody knows in their heart that
nothing goes forever," said Marlene Danielle, who has played the feline
character Bombalurina since the show started in October 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought the show into the new millennium. How much more can you really
expect?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, nearly two decades after it opened at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," which is advertised as "Now and Forever" and has long been a major
tourist attraction, will have been seen by more than 10 million theatergoers in
New York by the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated at more than $380
million. Yet in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling, at
times falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean winter
months after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bound to happen someday. When you look at it, we're running into our
18th year and the houses have been slow. It's a business and they have to make
their money," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although cast members admitted to being sad and disappointed, they said that
knowing the end is near makes the remaining performances even more special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really very exciting to be a member of the last cast," said Lenny
Daniel, 33, who plays the character Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people cherish the performances. Everything sharpens and you focus
on what I can do to do the best and enjoy the time the absolute most. That's the
general feeling. Every moment on that stage now, there's a countdown," Danielle
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the show were saddened by the news but also expressed a feeling of
nostalgia upon learning that the show would not really be "Now and Forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news I was devastated," said uber-fan Hector
Montalvo, a Manhattan computer software salesman who said he has seen the show
670 times.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good things must come to an end,"
Montalvo said, tears streaming down his face as he waited in line for Sunday's
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the tenth time I have seen it and I must admit I'm feeling pretty
sad," said Ernie Puglise, a music teacher from Connecticut who brought his
classes many times over the years to see the show. "I really think it's the best
musical ever written."
</P>
<P>
	   Both performers and fans, however, admitted that despite the shows impending
closing they were optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all trying to leave with the attitude that this is just another door
opening rather than one closing," said performer Lenny Daniel.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all been auditioning for other things because we knew this had to
happen at some point," said Tesha Bess, who has played the character Rumple
Teaser for the last 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An audit found sloppy work, improperly inspected parts
and out-of-date blueprints at the McDonnell Douglas facility where the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed last month was built, the Los Angeles Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Aviation Administration said manufacturing procedures at the
plant were marred by chronic breakdowns, but the deficiencies did not threaten
flight safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-83 that crashed into the Pacific on Jan. 31 was delivered to Alaska
Airlines in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 reported problems with the aircraft's
horizontal stabilizer and were trying to correct them when the plane crashed,
killing all 88 aboard. No official cause of the crash has been determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The Douglas Aircraft Co., where the plane was built, had been struggling
financially at the time of the audit in the early 1990s. The McDonnell Douglas
subsidiary posted a $222 million operating loss for 1989, according to The
Times, and was straining to fill orders for its jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   Supervisors urged employees to improve their work in January 1991, shortly
before a team of federal auditors arrived. A memo to workers warned that
``consequences for failure are heavy fines, and in the extreme, loss of our
production certificate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the FAA audit found problems throughout the production line at the
Long Beach plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 has a strong safety track record, according to FAA data.
Mechanical problems with its horizontal stabilizer, however, have prompted the
FAA to order mandatory inspections five times since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   After the January crash, the FAA ordered the inspection of the horizontal
stabilizer on more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, which
use similar control mechanisms as the jet which crashed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't deliver an airplane unless it meets all of our quality
standards,'' said John Thom, a spokesman for the Boeing Co., which acquired
McDonnell Douglas in 1997. ``We have processes in place, and there are checks
along the way. It is in our own self-interest to produce quality and safe
airplanes.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Ally King Endorses McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Peter King switched allegiances Sunday and endorsed
Sen. John McCain for the Republican presidential nomination, accusing former
ally George W. Bush of displaying a ``willingness to take any road to the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
	   King announced his decision in a telephone interview with The Associated
Press, one day after McCain's campaign lost to Bush in South Carolina's GOP
primary. ``It just shows you the feelings I have for the man,'' the New York
Republican said of McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   King said Bush lost his support during the South Carolina campaign when he
visited Bob Jones University, a hotbed of religious conservatives that critics
say espouses segregation and anti-Catholic views. McCain did not speak at the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the White
House,'' said King, who first signaled that he might defect after McCain won New
Hampshire's leadoff primary Feb. 1 and gained momentum headed into the South
Carolina contest.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor regrets King's decision
``and respects congressman King's right to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain talked with King by cell phone and expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I cannot tell you how honored I am, particularly at this moment,'' he
said. ``You've lifted my spirits my friend and I'm deeply grateful.''
</P>
<P>
	   Other prominent Bush backers privately warned in advance of South Carolina's
election that they might jump ship if Bush lost, prompting the governor to
denounce ``weak-kneed'' allies.
</P>
<P>
	   King said such ``macho talk'' angered him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Any time somebody equates standing up for their religious convictions as
weak-kneed, that raises questions about their qualifications to serve'' as
president, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   King acknowledged that political considerations drove him to Bush in the
first place. New York Gov. George Pataki urged the state's delegation to rally
behind the front-runner to protect the state's interests, King said. ``It seemed
to me that Bush was so far in front that it wasn't worth disagreeing with the
governor on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The newly converted King said McCain is better qualified than Bush to be
president, particularly on foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've had differences with John McCain over the years. He's a strong-minded
guy and we've had a couple of arguments. Having said that, I just think he
really has what it takes to be president,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Police Break Up Sweatshop Protest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Fifty-four anti-sweatshop protesters were arrested
Sunday at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, ending a four-day sit-in in the
chancellor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters, who had been occupying Chancellor David Ward's office since
Wednesday, had listed seven demands, most designed to give manufacturers less
sway in factory monitoring accords that universities agreed to a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Ward agreed Friday to one of the demands -- entering the Workers Rights
Consortium, a factory monitoring group that includes workers and human rights
organizations. The consortium was developed by students.
</P>
<P>
	   Roger Howard, the associate vice chancellor for student services at
Wisconsin, said last week that the WRC is still in the developmental stage and
hasn't yet had a founding convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Sarah Spohn, a member of the anti-sweatshop group, said Ward's support of
the workers consortium was lukewarm and criticized the chancellor for not
negotiating directly with students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The issue had been resolved,'' university spokeswoman Amy Toburen said
following the 54 arrests. ``It had become clear the issue was no longer
sweatshops.''
</P>
<P>
	   Collegiate licensing is a $2.5 billion business nationwide. Some merchandise
has been found to be produced under sweatshop conditions in the United States
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The University of Michigan and Indiana University also joined the factory
monitoring group on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Hillary Clinton at side, courts minority votes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are "morally blind."
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important minority community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina," Gore said to laughter
from the audience at the Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, "They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see."
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the flag, "that accumulated heritage of injustice," Gore said the
Republican reaction reminded him of those who say that racism is gone and that
America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   "They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds -
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to," the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, campaigning for the first time together this year
in New York where Clinton is making history as the first, first lady to seek
public office in a race pitting her against New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, had warm words for each other, and a few hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   "She stands for the best values of New York state," Gore said. "Her voice
will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up for her."
</P>
<P>
	   "No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour church service was part of the annual weekend conference
sponsored by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day
before Gore and Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the
Apollo Theater in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore left the Albany church after about a half-hour of handshaking to fly to
New York City where he was to meet Sunday afternoon with the editorial board of
The Amsterdam News, a major black-oriented newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual Albany conference brings together hundreds of the state's top
black and Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc
in New York state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the
state's 1998 election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
"for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters."
</P>
<P>
	   Many of those attending the church service Sunday appeared surprised and
pleased by how animated the often stiff vice president was.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was the first time I've seen Gore really speak with some passion," said
Joseph Rhodes III, 47, of New York City.
</P>
<P>
	   "Reverend Gore! Reverend Gore!" state Assembly Deputy Speaker Arthur Eve, a
Buffalo Democrat, shouted to the church crowd from the pulpit as Gore stepped
away after his speech. "Wouldn't that be something, to have a preacher in the
White House."
</P>
<P>
	   Eve is the father of Eric Eve, a former White House political aide who
serves as Gore's New York campaign manager.

<HEADLINE> McCain stumble could give boost to Bradley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ST. LOUIS (AP) - Bill Bradley hopes the McCain drain is over.
<P>
	   Relegated to the status of junior reformer for nearly three weeks, Bradley
says Sen. John McCain's loss in South Carolina clears the way for his own
struggling Democratic campaign to renew the pitch to independents and moderate
Democrats who have been moving toward McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's gotten a shot of oxygen which had been drawn out of his campaign by
McCain," said Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University.
"In American politics there can only be one novelty at a time, and McCain has
been the novelty."
</P>
<P>
	   Once Bradley's partner in spreading the message of reform, McCain has been
the focus of attention since his Feb. 1 upset of Gov. George W. Bush in New
Hampshire, where he won support from independents and crossover Democrats - the
same group Bradley had hoped to attract.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, returning from a campaign swing to Seattle, was flying high over
the Dakotas when an aide delivered the news of McCain's loss in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "So we're back, and we're able to make the case that we're out there to get
all the votes," Bradley told cheering supporters a few hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Sunday on ABC's "This Week" about the opportunity created by McCain's
loss, Bradley said, "I think I'm making a strong case to all Americans,
independents and Democrats and even some Republicans to bring them over to our
side, and we're having some success."
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by satellite from St. Louis, where mechanical trouble forced his
plane to land Saturday night, Bradley said the South Carolina results show that
"it's tough for a reformer to win against entrenched power, against the
establishment power. I think I learned that, and I think John McCain learned
that last night."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley lost to Vice President Al Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, and his
current strategy places a premium on Washington state, which holds a nonbinding
primary Feb. 29 - the only Democratic vote in advance of the March 7 contests,
when 16 states hold primaries or caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   But while McCain has gained against Bush in national polls, Bradley has
slumped farther behind Gore - a deficit of about 40 percentage points in the
latest surveys. He trails in the polls in California, the biggest of the March 7
prizes, and in New York, where he played professional basketball for 10 years
before running for Senate in neighboring New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley acknowledges the need to win some of the March 7 contests. He
campaigned in Northeastern states last week and was returning to New York for a
Monday debate with Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're making up ground," Bradley said. "We're moving in Connecticut, Rhode
Island, we're moving in New York, and we're going to have a big contest Feb. 29
in Washington."
</P>
<P>
	   As the spotlight focused on McCain in recent weeks, Bradley made the case
that McCain's "presence in the race actually helps me, because what it does is
it focuses on reform."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley also has taken time to stress distinctions between himself and
McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's against abortion rights, I'm for abortion rights. He's against gun
control, I'm for gun control," Bradley told reporters Friday in Minneapolis, on
his way to Seattle. "He doesn't have thoughts about how to resolve the 44
million people without health insurance in America. I've put out a very specific
program to do that. ... He has an environmental record that's not good. I have
an excellent environmental record."

<HEADLINE> Nine Die in Bus Crash in Andes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- A passenger bus plunged 26 feet into a surging river in
the Andes after the wooden bridge it was crossing partially collapsed,
authorities said Sunday. Nine people were killed, 15 injured and more than 30
were missing, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescue workers continued to search for survivors who were washed away in the
pre-dawn hours Saturday by strong currents in the Carhuacayan River, 80 miles
northeast of Peru's capital, Lima.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to recover victims and survivors were hampered by bone-chilling rain
and frigid waters.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said the driver swerved while crossing the bridge, which had no
safety rails. The bridge partially collapsed when one of the rear tires slipped
off, causing the bus to shift violently to one side.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors said the driver ignored their request to let the 56 passengers off
the bus to lighten the load before crossing the rickety structure. Other
witnesses said the driver had been drinking alcohol before the accident.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers were merchants traveling to La Oroya, a mining town
in the high central Andes, to sell their wares.
</P>
<P>
	   A police spokesman from La Oroya told The Associated Press that nine bodies
had been recovered and 15 injured people were being treated in a regional
hospital. He said the remaining 33 people on the bus were still missing.

<HEADLINE> Delta Raising Ticket Prices  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HOUSTON (AP) -- Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines announced an increase in
ticket prices this weekend, following the lead of Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   Both airlines blamed rising jet fuel costs. Other airlines were expected to
join in the fare hike, but there was no confirmation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The specific increments of Delta's ticket prices were not announced, but the
increases were "similar fare to those of Continental," Delta spokeswoman Jenny
Dervin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very dynamic situation," she said. "The history of this is if an
airline files higher fares, the other airlines will file similar fares," Delta's
Dervin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental's price hikes on base domestic fares took effect Friday, ranging
from $5 to $15 one way.
</P>
<P>
	   The price increase is the second this year; both were prompted by
Continental and blamed on fuel costs pushed higher by tightening supplies.
</P>
<P>
	   In January, Houston-based Continental levied a "fuel surcharge," boosting
domestic fares $10 on one-way fares, or $20 on round trip fares. The move
spurred other airlines to raise prices.

<HEADLINE> Cast members and fans come to terms with impending close of  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - There were tears, hugs and even smiles as cast members
and fans alike came to term Sunday with news that "Cats," the longest-running
show in Broadway history, is to close in June after a record-breaking 7,397
performances.
<P>
	   "When we got the news there were tears, sure, and hugs. And believe it or
not there was lots of laughter. Somehow everybody knows in their heart that
nothing goes forever," said Marlene Danielle, who has played the feline
character Bombalurina since the show started in October 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "We brought the show into the new millennium. How much more can you really
expect?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, nearly two decades after it opened at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," which is advertised as "Now and Forever" and has long been a major
tourist attraction, will have been seen by more than 10 million theatergoers in
New York by the end of the run.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated at more than $380
million. Yet in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling, at
times falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the lean winter
months after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bound to happen someday. When you look at it, we're running into our
18th year and the houses have been slow. It's a business and they have to make
their money," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although cast members admitted to being sad and disappointed, they said that
knowing the end is near makes the remaining performances even more special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really very exciting to be a member of the last cast," said Lenny
Daniel, 33, who plays the character Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people cherish the performances. Everything sharpens and you focus
on what I can do to do the best and enjoy the time the absolute most. That's the
general feeling. Every moment on that stage now, there's a countdown," Danielle
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fans of the show were saddened by the news but also expressed a feeling of
nostalgia upon learning that the show would not really be "Now and Forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news I was devastated," said uber-fan Hector
Montalvo, a Manhattan computer software salesman who said he has seen the show
670 times.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good things must come to an end,"
Montalvo said, tears streaming down his face as he waited in line for Sunday's
performance.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the tenth time I have seen it and I must admit I'm feeling pretty
sad," said Ernie Puglise, a music teacher from Connecticut who brought his
classes many times over the years to see the show. "I really think it's the best
musical ever written."
</P>
<P>
	   Both performers and fans, however, admitted that despite the shows impending
closing they were optimistic about the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are all trying to leave with the attitude that this is just another door
opening rather than one closing," said performer Lenny Daniel.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've all been auditioning for other things because we knew this had to
happen at some point," said Tesha Bess, who has played the character Rumple
Teaser for the last 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Montalvo said that although he was upset he knew that life would go on.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've made friends with a lot of the cast and I look forward to seeing them
in their future projects," he said with a smile.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Critic Arrested Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JENIN, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian police have again detained a professor
who circulated a manifesto holding Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat responsible
for corruption in his government, the detainee's wife said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Two police officers took Abdel Sattar Qassem from his home late Friday night
in the northern West Bank town of Nablus, Amal Qassem said.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian police were not immediately available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The 56-year-old political science professor was among 20 intellectuals and
politicians who signed the petition in November that broke an unspoken rule
against criticizing Arafat directly. Past corruption allegations had focused
only on those around Arafat.
</P>
<P>
	   Several signatories recanted after Arafat jailed some, put others under
house arrest and threatened to lift the legislative immunity of the lawmakers
who signed it. Qassem spent 40 days in jail but was never charged.
</P>
<P>
	   A few days after his release last month, Qassem held a press conference
accusing the Palestinian Authority of stealing from his computer a letter he had
written to Syrian President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
	   Qassem wrote in the letter, which was never sent, that not all Palestinians
agree with Arafat's policies in peace talks with Israel, his wife said.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's critics say hundreds of millions of dollars in Palestinian
Authority income are unaccounted for each budget year, including revenues from
the government's monopoly on the import of cement and fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat's aides have said the manifesto amounted to incitement.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Qassem's wife nor his lawyer have been allowed to see him since his
most recent detention, Amal Qassem said. She said, however, that her husband
called her Saturday from his jail cell in the West Bank town of Jericho and
assured her that he was safe.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan Leader: Elections 'Fair'  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ROTHBART Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JALAL-ABAD, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- The president of Kyrgyzstan on Sunday praised
parliamentary elections as open and fair, even though the exclusion of most
opposition parties sullied the nation's reputation as Central Asia's strongest
democracy.
</P>
<P>
	   Tensions and police presence were high in areas where opposition candidates
were barred from running, but no violence was reported. The Central Election
Commission said voter turnout was 66 percent, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
</P>
<P>
	   International and domestic observers were monitoring the vote, and some
violations were reported. Students at the Jalal-abad University in southern
Kyrgyzstan (pronounced keer-ghi-STON) said they voted up to four times, under
different names, at the urging of teachers pushing the university dean's bid for
a parliamentary seat.
</P>
<P>
	   Out of 27 political parties registered in Kyrgyzstan, only 11 were allowed
to compete in the election. Most main opposition parties were barred from
fielding their strongest candidates because of minor technicalities.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of 545 candidates were competing for 105 seats in the two houses of
parliament. Many were running as independents, preferring to keep their party
affiliations unofficial to get on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, international organizations have sent messages to President
Askar Akayev voicing concerns that the election process was unfairly restricted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have tried to make the elections as open, fair, democratic and
transparent as possible,'' Akayev said after casting his ballot. ``I am certain
that a parliament meeting present-day standards and promoting reform will be
elected.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he added that his former Soviet republic was not yet ready to be ruled
by a strong parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Political and economic reforms are currently in progress in the republic
and a strong authority is necessary at this stage,'' he said, according to
ITAR-Tass.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic Movement of Kyrgyzstan was barred from campaigning after a
court ruled that a party congress to select candidates failed to reach a quorum.
The Poor People's Party was barred because its charter did not state that it
would participate in elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Kyrgyzstan, a poor, mountainous country of 4 million people, had been
considered the most democratic nation to emerge from former Soviet Central Asia.
But Akayev, who has led the country since the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union,
has increasingly cracked down on dissent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Democratic Institute, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe and Vice President Al Gore have sent messages expressing
concern over the restrictions on political activity.
</P>
<P>
	   Results are expected Monday. A second round of voting will be held next
month in those districts where no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the
vote.

<HEADLINE> Police use underage drinking raid to find, subpoena dorm fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The task force investigating last month's fatal dorm
fire at Seton Hall University has subpoenaed several students, including one of
three now at the center of the investigation, to testify before an Essex County
grand jury, according to a published report.
<P>
	   Authorities, frustrated by an investigation grown cold, used a raid on
underage drinkers at a popular bar blocks from the university in South Orange to
round up students who are potential witnesses or suspects, according to The
Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of students were arrested during the raid at the New Hall Tavern just
before 1:30 a.m. Friday. Nearly a dozen, whom investigators had expected to be
at the bar, were given subpoenas to testify Tuesday, the newspaper reported for
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
	   One of those present in the bar early Friday has admitted "trashing" the
third-floor lounge in Boland Hall minutes before the 4:30 a.m. fire on Jan. 19,
but he denies starting it, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not going to confirm or deny anything regarding grand jury subpoenas,"
Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant prosecutor for Essex County, said
Sunday. She also refused to "discuss or make any comment on the fire
investigation."
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement sources, which the newspaper did not identify, have told the
Star-Ledger they believe the fire was set but that the investigation has been
hampered because some students have been withholding information.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're closer to the beginning than the end of the investigation," Essex
County Prosecutor Donald Campolo, who heads the investigation, told the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   One unnamed law enforcement source told the Star-Ledger that authorities
"have nothing to move ahead on and won't unless something gives."
</P>
<P>
	   The blaze killed three freshmen and injured 62 people. Four students
remained hospitalized Sunday, one of them still in critical condition in the
intensive care unit at Saint Barnabas Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The three Seton Hall freshmen on whom the investigation is now focusing
include two Boland Hall residents. All three students were in the bar early
Friday, and one - not the student who trashed the lounge - was given a subpoena,
the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The three freshmen, who are friends, have all been interviewed once but have
since retained lawyers and have refused to give investigators further
interviews. Grand jury witnesses, however, must answer questions without their
lawyers present, although they can decline to make statements incriminating
themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith said Sunday that officers uncovered information that the New Hall
Tavern was serving alcohol to minors as a result of their "very comprehensive"
investigation, which has included interviews with many of the dorm's 600
students and other witnesses. She said staff from the prosecutor's office, along
with state troopers, Essex County sheriff's officers and representatives of the
state Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control participated in the raid early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Officers charged 37 people in the tavern with underage drinking. The bar's
owner, John Holland, 56, of Cedar Grove, was charged with serving minors,
possessing an unregistered handgun and other offenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Record of Hackensack reported Saturday that the tavern, known to
students as "The Hall," had its license on a two-year suspension until two
months ago because of similar violations in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, some Seton Hall students say they are upset that the people
responsible may still be among them.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think if there was an arrest made it would make people feel that much
better," freshman Justin Maker, 19, said last week.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Details Pope's Egypt Trip  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLEN KNICKMEYER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Pilgrims waved a ``Buon Viaggio'' banner in St. Peter's
Square on Sunday, wishing Pope John Paul II well on his upcoming trip to Egypt
-- and to the spot where tradition says God spoke to Moses from a burning bush.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul's trip, which begins Thursday, will be his first to Egypt. It is
the kickoff of the pontiff's 2000 Holy Year pilgrimages to ancient biblical
sites.
</P>
<P>
	   He intends to pray at what tradition says is the Mount Sinai site of the
burning bush, where God commanded Moses to lead the children of Israel out of
Egypt, the Vatican missionary news service Fides said Sunday in a more detailed
but still unofficial outline of the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul made no mention of his upcoming trip during his regular Sunday
appearance before pilgrims in St. Peter's Square. He seemed strong and alert,
waving at cheers from the crowd below.
</P>
<P>
	   The pontiff is to arrive in Cairo on Thursday, greeted by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Catholic bishops, Fides said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cairo, John Paul will visit the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church in
Egypt and the imam, or cleric, of Al-Azhar University, Sheik Mohammed Sayed
Tantawi. He is the highest authority of the world's Sunni Muslims.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The symbolic force of the event is very great. Even if it is a visit of
protocol, it will be much more effective than talking,'' Ali al Samman of the
school's commission for Muslim-Christian dialogue was quoted as telling Fides.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday, the pope will attend a Mass to be celebrated in French, Arab and
Coptic in Cairo's sport stadium. A celebration will follow in a tiny Coptic
cathedral, with all leaders of Egypt's Christian denominations expected to take
part.
</P>
<P>
	   Christians make up an estimated 11 percent of Egypt's 63 million people. The
vast majority of Christians there are Coptic Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, John Paul flies to the 6th-century St. Catherine's monastery at
the foot of Mount Sinai. The pope plans to pray at the site of the burning bush
and preside over a prayer meeting for hundreds of young people in the
monastery's garden, Fides said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope has previously stressed ``the purely religious, not political''
nature of his travels into the heart of Middle East conflicts this year. From
March 20 to 26, he will visit sites in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Cops Probe Netanyahu on Allegations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police questioned former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for six hours Sunday on suspicion he accepted bribes, tried to misuse state
funds and illegally kept gifts worth thousands of dollars, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV said police would recommend indicting Netanyahu on
all three counts. It reported that Netanyahu's wife, Sara, would be charged with
fraud and illegally keeping state gifts given to the couple during Netanyahu's
term.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri would not confirm the report. He said police
would probably conclude the investigation in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu expressed hope that the accusations against him would be cleared
soon, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is suspected of accepting the moving and cleaning services of
contractor Yaakov Amedi for three years without pay. In return, Amedi was
allegedly slated to receive a government contract. Amedi has since turned
state's witness and is cooperating with police in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Media reports say the contractor submitted a $110,000 bill after Netanyahu
was defeated and it became clear Amedi would not get a government contract.
Netanyahu's lawyers said he offered to pay for the work himself, and told his
office not to pay the bill submitted by Amedi.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple also is suspected of keeping dozens of gifts they received during
Netanyahu's 1996-99 term, in violation of Israeli law. The gifts reportedly
included candlesticks, silverware, candelabras, carpets, pictures, scarves and a
gold letter opener that was a gift from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu says he did not intend to keep the gifts, noting that they were
being stored in a government warehouse.

<HEADLINE> Analysts Say Bush Has the Bounce  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When John McCain woke up Sunday in Michigan, the clock
was already ticking on his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   With just 48 hours to prepare for the state's Republican primary, a critical
follow-up to George W. Bush's thumping win in South Carolina, McCain had no time
to spare and few options to explore. And so he mocked Bush's claim to be a
reformer and cost-cutting conservative, hoping to learn from the lessons of
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm more conservative than he is,'' the Arizonan said in a blitz of media
appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   Time and demographics were on Bush's side, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Bush got a huge bounce out of South Carolina on Saturday. He
reclaimed the mantel of front-runner with a vengeance,'' said GOP pollster Whit
Ayres. ``And McCain has few places to turn.''
</P>
<P>
	   He can start with the results in South Carolina:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush won by 11 percentage points, galvanizing religious conservatives and
party regulars to swamp McCain's fragile coalition of independents, Democrats
and Republicans who don't normally vote in GOP primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The Texas governor was supported by seven out of 10 Republican voters.
The same ratio of religious right voters backed him. McCain increased the
participation of non-Republican voters in South Carolina, but learned that he
can't expand the party unless bedrock Republicans join with him.
</P>
<P>
	   -- More voters considered Bush a political reformer than McCain, proof that
the Arizonan's centerpiece issue got lost in a debate over negative advertising
that sprang from McCain's own actions.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking through those numbers, McCain realized he must siphon Michigan
conservatives from Bush and reclaim his self-styled reformist image. Thus, he
accused Bush on Sunday of spending wildly in Texas while paying lip service to
health care and campaign finance reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he still felt that Bush twists the truth like President Clinton, he
replied: ``Well, sure he has.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-pronged message was personified by conservative activist Gary Bauer
and campaign finance reform stalwart Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, both of
whom traveled aboard McCain's bus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's does have to win Michigan,'' Bauer said, acknowledging what McCain
aides say privately: A second-straight loss would be devastating.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Republicans also vote Tuesday, but McCain won't get much credit for
winning his home state. Three states conduct GOP contests a week later on Feb.
29, but McCain won't campaign hard in one of them, Virginia, and the others
won't generate much momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   That makes Michigan his best hope of gaining a head of steam before March 7,
when 13 states conduct GOP contests.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't help that there is little statistical difference between GOP
voters in Michigan and South Carolina. In both states, one in 10 primary voters
are Democrats, three in 10 are independents and the rest are self-identified
Republicans. Michigan, like South Carolina, opens its primaries to all voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The percentage of people who identify with the religious right is slightly
lower in Michigan, but still nearly a third of all GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Republicans do tend to be less affluent, younger and drawn more to
economic issues than GOP voters in South Carolina. In suburban Detroit and
blue-collar cities like Saginaw, Mich., McCain is appealing to economic
conservatives who supported Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan pollster Ed Sarpolus said these are people frustrated by the
political process. Their support helped McCain pull even with Bush in recent
state polls, balancing Bush's 20-point lead among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   But they are fickle voters, and might stay home if Bush looks like a
sure-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Either they vote for McCain or they don't vote at all,'' Sarpolus said.
``The question is, will they come out now'' that McCain lost his momentum in
South Carolina?
</P>
<P>
	   In an appeal to those economic conservatives, McCain has run a TV ad for
weeks promising to cut wasteful spending. He also is airing radio ads promising
he will not engage in negative campaigning and saying he is the candidate to
bring reform to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But he can't forget social conservatives in western Michigan, who will be
told by Bush supporters that McCain is not conservative enough. An anti-McCain
campaign by Bush and his special interest allies helped drive social
conservatives to the voting booths in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's got to take directly (head) on their attack of whether he is pro-life
or not,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say it is too late for McCain to launch an effective ad campaign that
counters the charges or raises questions about Bush's conservatism. Thus he will
rely on the media, an iffy proposition when Monday is a holiday and many voters
will be away from newspapers and TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers were debating whether to announce a new initiative to get
attention. One idea discussed Sunday was a major spending-cut plan, though aides
said all planning was in a flux.
</P>
<P>
	   After South Carolina, McCain advisers pumped more money into telephone
marketing because phone banks are a good way to influence voters on short
notice.
</P>
<P>
	   That strategy shift came into play when Rep. Peter King of New York bolted
from Bush's camp Sunday and blasted the governor for visiting what critics say
is an anti-Catholic university.
</P>
<P>
	   With TV ads and direct-mail out of the question, McCain's advisers plans to
use phone banks to spread news of King's switch to the state's huge population
of Catholic voters, particularly on the McCain-friendly Eastern half of lower
Michigan.

<HEADLINE> Police Use Raids To Find Witnesses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Frustrated by an investigation grown cold, authorities
used a raid on underage drinking at a popular bar to round up potential
witnesses to a deadly dorm fire at Seton Hall University, The Star-Ledger of
Newark reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly a dozen of the students arrested during the raid at the New Hall
Tavern just before 1:30 a.m. Friday were given subpoenas to testify Tuesday
before a grand jury looking into the fire, the newspaper said. Investigators had
expected the group to be at the bar.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 19 blaze killed three freshmen and injured 62 people. Law
enforcement sources, whom the newspaper did not identify, said their
investigation has been hampered because some students have been withholding
information.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the newspaper, investigators believe the fire was deliberately
set and they are focusing on three freshmen. All three were in the bar early
Friday, and at least one was given a subpoena, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to confirm or deny anything regarding grand jury
subpoenas,'' Charlotte Smith, executive assistant prosecutor for Essex County,

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-.N.Y.,
who had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, last night lifted my spirits and my spirits are still high,''
he said after attending Sunday morning church services.
</P>
<P>
	   He added, ``I'm going to continue to talk about how to bring our country
together. I'm going to talk about a better tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also underscored a theme he had used in South Carolina, that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. His remarks had a distinctly Michigan
cast, as he cited the example of Geoffrey Fieger, lawyer for suicide advocate
Jack Kervorkian, who he said had been ``making noises'' about voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans should say to him, 'You're not going to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said of Fieger.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign. A
Bush ad that criticized McCain for questioning his integrity was a response to a
McCain commercial that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   And by the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his
message further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the
guy with the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a run of early primaries, the campaign was going national.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was airing ads in California, Washington, North Dakota, Virginia,
Michigan and Arizona, McCain's home state, which also holds a primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was airing commercials in Michigan, Washington, California and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory Saturday night came as a relief to the front-runner's
campaign, which had struggled to reassure its allies that the New Hampshire
defeat was merely a ``bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   The turn of events meant McCain once again found himself in the position of
battling uphill against a wealthier, better organized rival, and this time with
precious little time to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   That made Michigan, a classic swing state in general election campaigns, a
critical battlefield in the nominating contest, as well.
</P>
<P>
	   As elsewhere, Bush has the overwhelming support of the establishment,
including Gov. John Engler.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has Joe Schwarz, a state senator, who twice mentioned Engler's name
at rallies -- and twice got boos back from the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   King had been flirting with an endorsement for several days, expressing
anger that Bush had campaigned at Bob Jones University in South Carolina, a
school that critics say espouses anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That to me just showed a willingness to take any road to the White
House,'' King said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton comes out in favor of Northeast home heating oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Sunday called for New York
and the Northeast to have its own home heating oil reserve to help blunt any
future shortages or the high prices New Yorkers face now.
<P>
	   "We in the Northeast ... are the most reliant on home heating oil and
therefore pay the highest prices when we have cold snaps," said the Senate
candidate who just moved to New York in January as the coldest weather of the
winter hit. "We'd be able to dip into that reserve without raising the strategic
issues that are raised by going to the reserve that we already have."
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of Northeastern lawmakers, including Democrats and Republicans,
have already called for creation of such a regional reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. The Northeast has been hardest hit
by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's likely Republican Senate opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, has been lambasting President Clinton for refusing to dip into the
nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration says the reserves are only for emergencies and
are not intended as a way to affect market price.
</P>
<P>
	   However, candidate Clinton said she and the president know what New Yorkers
are going through.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take this issue very personally as does the president," said Clinton, who
recently moved into the couple's $1.7 million home in Chappaqua in Westchester
County. "Now that we are homeowners here in New York, our house is heated by
heating oil and it is extremely expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that she and her husband are better able to afford the high
oil prices than most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short term, Clinton said New York's congressional delegation should
support President Clinton's call for $600 million in emergency assistance to
help poor people meet heating-oil costs. The first lady also said she favored
dipping into the strategic reserves with a swap system under which U.S. oil
companies would be able to borrow from the stockpile and make larger donations
back to it later.
</P>
<P>
	   That way, "they would not run into some of the legal and security issues,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she would also support a bill by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
that would require home heating oil companies to keep a larger reserve of their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a mild winter last year, so that the oil companies did not stockpile
enough of an inventory," she said. "So when OPEC began to raise prices, they had
to scramble on the open market and pay more."
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of how serious the situation is in New York, the Pataki
administration last week used a waiver to allow the use of high-sulfur heating
oil at New York City municipal facilities. Sulfur levels in heating oil are
tightly regulated by state environmental regulations to protect air quality in
the metropolitan area. Connecticut and New Hampshire have used sulfur waivers
similar to New York's during the heating oil crunch, the Pataki administration
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also called on the OPEC counties to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
	   That would"enable us to cut prices so that we wouldn't face either higher
prices in the short term in the home heating oil or longer term in gasoline
prices," she said.

<HEADLINE> Broadway's 'Cats' To Close  </HEADLINE>
    By LUKAS I. ALPERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The cast and fans of "Cats" on Sunday coped with the news
that the longest-running show in Broadway history will be closing, sharing
tears, hugs and even a few smiles.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first heard the news, I was devastated," said Hector Montalvo, a
Manhattan computer software salesman who said he has seen the show 670 times. As
he stood in line for another performance Sunday, tears streamed down his face.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is such a sad thing, but I guess all good things must come to an end,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The musical, which has a score by Andrew Lloyd Webber, will bring down the
curtain June 25, nearly two decades after it opened at Broadway's Winter Garden
Theater. There will have been a record-breaking 7,397 performances.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we got the news, there were tears, sure, and hugs. And believe it or
not there was lots of laughter," said Marlene Danielle, who has played the
feline character Bombalurina since the show started in October 1982. "Somehow,
everybody knows in their heart that nothing goes forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "Cats," advertised as "Now and Forever," has long been a major tourist
attraction. By its final night, it will have played to more than 10 million
theatergoers in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's grosses on Broadway alone are estimated at more than $380
million. But in the last two years, its weekly receipts have been dwindling, at
times falling to only 50 percent capacity, particularly in the winter months
after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was bound to happen someday. When you look at it, we're running into our
18th year and the houses have been slow. It's a business and they have to make
their money," Danielle said.
</P>
<P>
	   Several cast members said knowing the end is near makes the remaining
performances even more special.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's really very exciting to be a member of the last cast," said Lenny
Daniel, 33, who plays the character Alonzo.
</P>
<P>
	   "It makes people cherish the performances," added Danielle. "Everything
sharpens, and you focus on what I can do to do the best and enjoy the time the
absolute most."
</P>
<P>
	   "I must admit I'm feeling pretty sad," said Ernie Puglise, a music teacher
from Connecticut who said he brought his classes to the show many times over the
years. "I really think it's the best musical ever written."

<HEADLINE> Serb Socialists Quit Ruling Party  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- The Serb Socialist Party quit the
ruling coalition in the Serb half of Bosnia on Sunday, a move that weakens
pro-Western Premier Milorad Dodik's support in parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialists, Bosnian members of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
party, announced their departure after Dodik fired two party officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the change, Dodik's coalition retains a slim majority in parliament
and his government is in no immediate danger of falling.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Sunday, the Socialists blamed Dodik for the political
turmoil. They said the party would ``independently perform its parliamentary
function'' and would not join other coalitions.
</P>
<P>
	   Dodik, who left on Friday for Germany, was not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Bosnia consists of two regions, the Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat
Federation, with separate governments and parliaments. The Socialist Party has
been part of the moderate coalition in the Bosnian Serb half for more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
	   But last month, Dodik removed Deputy Premier Tihomir Gligoric from his post
because of activities deemed against the interest of the government. Dodik also
fired Socialist Party official Dragutin Ilic, the head of the health insurance
fund, for allegedly failing to inform the government about the fund's business
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Socialist Party leaders recently gave Dodik seven days to withdraw the
firings, but the prime minister said they were final.

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Court N.Y. Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are ``morally blind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' Gore said, his
reference to Saturday's GOP primary drawing laughter from the audience at the
Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the flag, ``that accumulated heritage of injustice,'' he said the
Republican reaction reminded him of those who say racism is gone and that
America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds --
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, campaigning together for the first time this year
in New York where Clinton is making history as the first first lady to seek
public office, had warm words for each other, and a few hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She stands for the best values of New York state,'' Gore said of Clinton,
who is pitted against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race.
``Her voice will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up
for her.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Clinton said she was ``just
honored to help him in any way that I can. I was grateful for the chance to
appear with him because I don't get to see him so often now that he's all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used to work together very closely on a lot of issues ... I'm very fond
of him personally as well as very supportive of him as our next president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored
by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before Gore
and Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the Apollo
Theatre in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   After some handshaking, Gore took off for New York City where he was meeting
with the editorial board of The Amsterdam News, a major black-oriented
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference brings together hundreds of the state's top black and
Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York
state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998
election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
``for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those attending the service appeared surprised by Gore's address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the first time I've seen Gore really speak with some passion,''
said Joseph Rhodes III, 47, of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Mining Co. Pres Cleared of Fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- The president of a mining company who announced a
multibillion-dollar gold find in Bolivia was cleared of violating federal
securities law.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal District Judge Weinshienk, in a ruling issued Friday in Denver, said
Golden Eagle International President Terry Turner might have issued the
announcement prematurely, but he was not reckless.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinshienk said Turner acted reasonably in concluding a well-credentialed
geologist's report of "world-class gold reserves" on the company's mining
properties was accurate. The report later was found to be flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner's announcement on May 22, 1998, triggered an increase in the Salt
Lake City company's penny stock, from 12 cents a share to a high of almost 60
cents before the Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading.
</P>
<P>
	   The SEC alleged Turner knowingly or recklessly issued a false announcement,
which reported Bolivian geologist Guido Paravicini's discovery of an estimated
236 million ounces of gold in a mining region the company controls in Cangalli,
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
	   In a four-day trial, SEC attorneys argued Turner had not even thoroughly
read Paravicini's final report, which was later criticized by other experts as
deeply flawed.
</P>
<P>
	   In September 1998, Golden Eagle reported in SEC filings there was
insufficient basis to claim such staggering reserves. The stock price sank to 25
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   But securities regulators contend Turner continued to mislead investors
because he didn't issue a news release retracting the company's initial claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinshienk said the company's SEC filings gave sufficient notice of the
study's revised figures. But she strongly advised Turner, a mining lawyer, to
either promptly remove the May 1998 press release from the company's Web site or
issue a new one saying the study contained flawed calculations.
</P>
<P>
	   Weinshienk rejected the SEC's recommendations to fine Turner $50,000 and
issue an injunction against him on the basis that he is likely to continue
making exaggerated claims.
</P>
<P>
	   "The court is persuaded that there will not be a problem in the future,"
Weinshienk said. "I'm sure he'll consult with his securities attorneys in the
future."
</P>
<P>
	   Golden Eagle's claim came in the wake of a worldwide slump in gold prices to
less than $300 an ounce and a false report of a similar-sized deposit by
Canadian Bre-X Minerals, whose claims turned into the largest scandal in the
gold industry.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Detected in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A new case of ``mad cow'' disease has been detected in France,
authorities said Sunday -- the seventh since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The cow was part of a herd of 600 near Bourg-en-Bresse, in the Ain region of
southeastern France. The herd was slaughtered and incinerated on Saturday,
officials in the Ain region said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, French authorities discovered 31 cases of mad cow disease, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said that new cases of mad cow disease will break out in
France until 2001, five years after stringent prevention measures were taken
against the disease, which has an average incubation period of five years.
</P>
<P>
	   France outlawed feeds containing animal proteins in 1996 out of fears they
could cause mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
	   French officials have said they would begin tests this month of cattle
destined for human consumption to determine how widespread the disease has
become.
</P>
<P>
	   France has provoked a spat within the European Union by keeping in place its
ban on beef from Britain, where the brain-wasting disease first started an
international scare in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU ruled in August that British beef was again safe for import, but
France has maintained its ban.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest case of ``mad cow'' disease was the 88th in France since the
outbreak began in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Detaines Third Kurdish Mayor  </HEADLINE>
   By SELCAN HACAOGLU Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey on Sunday detained a third Kurdish mayor who
had sought foreign support in a campaign for cultural rights, continuing a crack
down on political leaders amid an easing of Kurdish rebels' 15-year-old
guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests of Feyzullah Karaaslan of Bingol on Sunday and the two other
mayors on Saturday signaled that the government, despite pressure from Europe,
remains extremely wary of granting cultural rights to restive Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey, vying for European Union membership, is likely to face increased
European pressure to lift bans on education and broadcasting in Kurdish --
especially after Abdullah Ocalan's rebels renounced violence in favor of
political means in their struggle for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities are uneasy with the fact that both the legal, pro-Kurdish
People's Democracy Party and Ocalan's illegal Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
demand the same cultural rights for the country's estimated 12 million Kurds.
</P>
<P>
	   Ocalan was captured a year ago and sentenced to death for leading the
15-year guerrilla battle for Kurdish rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What does it matter if our demands overlap with those of the PKK's, as
long as they are justified?'' asked Ahmet Turan Demir, leader of the People's
Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The detentions came shortly after Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit warned the
party against ties with the guerrillas. The party is already facing
court-ordered closure on charges of being a front for the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
	   A government statement Saturday said the mayors have been accused of
carrying out propaganda activities, extorting money from citizens, gathering
conscripts in Europe for the mountain ranks of the group and establishing a
network of communication between rebels and imprisoned comrades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our mayors are being targeted with fictitious accusations in a plot,''
Demir said, denying allegations raised against them by recently captured
suspected Kurdish rebels. He blamed Ecevit for the crackdown and demanded the
mayors' immediate release.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Feridun Celik, the mayor of Diyarbakir, Saturday as he was
returning from a meeting with Canadian diplomats there, reports said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Celik met with Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh, just days
after issuing a statement on the problems of Kurdish communities in the battered
southeast in a meeting in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   The two other mayors, Selim Ozalp of Siirt and Karaaslan, had also attended
the Germany meeting. Ozalp was also detained on Saturday, while authorities
apprehended Karaaslan on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Northeast Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT WASHINGTON, N.H. (AP) -- An avalanche on New England's highest peak
left at least one person dead Sunday, one day after another avalanche killed a
skier in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   A state police dispatcher confirmed that at least one person had been killed
on Mount Washington. No other details were immediately available, and officials
were on their way to the scene late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6,288-foot mountain is known as home to the world's worst weather and
was the site of the highest wind speed ever recorded -- 231 mph on April 12,
1934.
</P>
<P>
	   A recorded message at the Appalachian Mountain Club on Sunday morning warned
that the avalanche danger for the mountain's Tuckerman and Huntington ravines
was high and that traveling on them was not recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   The club said the danger is due, in part, to more than a foot of snow that
fell during Friday night and Saturday and to the high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   With heavy snowfall and rough weather conditions, Mount Washington is one of
the few places in the East where avalanches are a danger. During the last
century, 126 people have died there.
</P>
<P>
	   Anna Porter, a weather observer at the Mount Washington Observatory, said
wind gusts reached 64 mph at the summit Sunday afternoon. Visibility was
one-sixteenth of a mile with blowing snow and freezing fog, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, a rare avalanche in northern New York's Adirondacks killed a
skier and injured five others. The avalanche occurred on the northeast side of
Wright Peak, on the outskirts of Lake Placid.

<HEADLINE> Cops Probe Netanyahu on Allegations  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE COPANS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police questioned former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for six hours Sunday on suspicion he accepted bribes, tried to misuse state
funds and illegally kept gifts worth thousands of dollars, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Channel Two TV said police would recommend indicting Netanyahu on
all three counts. It reported that Netanyahu's wife, Sara, would be charged with
fraud and illegally keeping state gifts given to the couple during Netanyahu's
term.
</P>
<P>
	   Police spokesman Uzi Sanduri would not confirm the report. He said police
would probably conclude the investigation in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   After the questioning, Netanyahu told reporters he hoped the investigation
would end soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am convinced that, when it is finished, it will become clear that there
is nothing to this, and my wife and I will be able to enjoy the time out that we
haven't enjoyed since I left office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple is suspected of accepting the moving and cleaning services of
contractor Yaakov Amedi for three years without pay. In return, Amedi was
allegedly slated to receive a government contract. Amedi has since turned
state's witness and is cooperating with police in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Media reports say the contractor submitted a $110,000 bill after Netanyahu
was defeated and it became clear Amedi would not get a government contract.
Netanyahu's lawyers said he offered to pay for the work himself, and told his
office not to pay the bill submitted by Amedi.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple also is suspected of keeping dozens of gifts they received during
Netanyahu's 1996-99 term, in violation of Israeli law. The gifts reportedly
included candlesticks, silverware, candelabras, carpets, pictures, scarves and a
gold letter opener that was a gift from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Netanyahu says he did not intend to keep the gifts, noting that they were
being stored in a government warehouse.

<HEADLINE> Problems Cited at Airplane Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An audit found sloppy work, improperly inspected parts
and out-of-date blueprints at the McDonnell Douglas facility where the Alaska
Airlines jet that crashed last month was built, the Los Angeles Times reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In its 1991 audit, the Federal Aviation Administration said manufacturing
procedures at the Long Beach plant were marred by chronic breakdowns but the
deficiencies did not threaten flight safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The FAA was trying to locate the audit Sunday. Once found, it could be
turned over to the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency leading the
investigation, said FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't comment until we find it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-83 that crashed into the Pacific Ocean on Jan. 31 was delivered to
Alaska Airlines in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 reported problems with the aircraft's
horizontal stabilizer, and the pilots were trying to correct them when the plane
crashed, killing all 88 people aboard. No official cause of the crash has been
released.
</P>
<P>
	   The Douglas Aircraft Co., where the plane was built, had been struggling
financially at the time of the audit in the early 1990s. The McDonnell Douglas
subsidiary posted a $222 million operating loss for 1989, according to The
Times, and was straining to fill orders for its jetliners.
</P>
<P>
	   However, a spokesman for Boeing, which merged with McDonnell Douglas in
1997, said Sunday that the plane was mechanically sound when it was delivered to
Alaska Airlines and that it would be improper to draw any connection between
plant problems and the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trying to tie the delivery of that airplane to that audit is
irresponsible,'' John Thom said. ``Regardless of whatever regulatory
surveillance the company was under, we did not deliver airplanes that did not
meet quality standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Times, company supervisors urged employees to improve their
work in January 1991, shortly before a team of federal auditors arrived. A memo
to workers warned that ``consequences for failure are heavy fines, and in the
extreme, loss of our production certificate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the FAA audit found problems throughout the production line at the
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Thom said he had not seen the 1991 audit but said McDonnell Douglas would
have addressed whatever deficiencies it uncovered. The plant passed two FAA
inspections last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The audit is ancient history,'' Thom said. ``The audits of the early '90s
are long behind us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 program in Long Beach delivered 1,167 airplanes to domestic and
foreign carriers. Production was discontinued two months ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The MD-80 has a strong safety track record, according to FAA data.
Mechanical problems with its horizontal stabilizer, however, have prompted the
FAA to order mandatory inspections five times since 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   After the January crash, the FAA ordered the inspection of the horizontal
stabilizer on more than 1,100 MD-80, MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes, which
use similar control mechanisms as the jet that crashed.

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Detroit, he jabbed at McCain, saying voters would pick a leader
like himself who is talking about education reforms and strengthening the
military over ``somebody who's trying to cast aspersions on his opponent. I
suspect they're going to pick like they did in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier appearance, he continued to emphasize the positive. ``I'm
going to continue to talk about how to bring our country together. I'm going to
talk about a better tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and several aides also took issue with McCain's concession speech
Saturday night in which he said the campaign was a choice ``between experience
and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the America voters, the people in Michigan, are going to have to
judge how each of us reacts,'' Bush said. ``Now they've had a chance to see each
of us react to victory and each of us react to defat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also underscored a theme he had used in South Carolina, that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. His remarks had a distinctly Michigan
cast as he cited the example of Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat and lawyer for
suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian, who Bush said had been ``making noises'' about
voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans should say to him, 'You're not going to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said of Fieger.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
McCain questioned Bush's integrity, comparing him to President Clinton, in an ad
that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   And by the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his
message further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the
guy with the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''
</P>
<P>
	   After a run of early primaries, the campaign was going national.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush was airing ads in California, Washington, North Dakota, Virginia,
Michigan and Arizona, McCain's home state, which also holds a primary Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was airing commercials in Michigan, Washington, California and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's victory Saturday night came as a relief to the front-runner's
campaign, which had struggled to reassure its allies that the New Hampshire
defeat was merely a ``bump in the road.''
</P>
<P>
	   The turn of events meant McCain once again found himself in the position of
battling uphill against a better financed, better organized rival, and this time
with precious little time to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   That made Michigan, a classic swing state in general election campaigns, a
critical battlefield in the nominating contest, as well.

<HEADLINE> 2 young children killed in Paterson house fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) - Two young children were killed in a fire Sunday
afternoon that heavily damaged a detached, two-family home and left a half-dozen
firefighters with minor injuries.
<P>
	   Both children, 1-year-old Vernon Nicholas and 4-year-old Olijahjuan Hanna,
were found dead "within a couple feet of each other" on the floor in a rear
attic bedroom in the 2 1/2-story house, said Deputy Chief Dennis DiGuglielmo. He
was unsure of the children's sexes.
</P>
<P>
	   DiGuglielmo said the other eight occupants of the house on East 27th Street
had escaped when firefighters arrived. Firefighters tried to rescue the
children, "but there was extremely heavy fire and smoke."
</P>
<P>
	   One firefighter was taken to St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center here
with a back injury, DiGuglielmo said. Several others were treated at the scene
for smoke inhalation and exhaustion, and a couple more were treated at the scene
for face and ear burns.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 firefighters battled the blaze, which was reported just before
2 p.m. and was under control within 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It started on the first floor and rapidly spread to the second and third
floors, " DiGuglielmo said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said fire officials were investigating the cause of the blaze.
</P>
<P>
	   DiGuglielmo said two adults and five children lived on the second floor and
attic of the house, and three other adults lived on the first floor. It was
unclear what relationship the two dead children had to the adults, but he said
the three adults living on the first floor all have the last name Hanna.

<HEADLINE> Nun: Cuban Grandma Wanted To Defect  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A nun involved in a meeting between Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban grandmothers decided the 6-year-old should remain in the United States
after she was told one of the grandmothers wanted to defect, her spokeswoman
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with the grandmothers last month at her home in Miami Beach,
Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, said she was
abandoning her neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was influenced to change her position by several things she had
been told about the case by people she trusted, Michele Morris, a spokeswoman
for Barry, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin didn't want to divulge the information to the media after the
reunion because she heard it secondhand, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald reported that one of the grandmothers told O'Laughlin
directly that she wanted to defect. But O'Laughlin said Sunday in a prepared
statement that ``unfortunately the article had some misinformation. I never met
with the grandmothers alone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``While some of the specifics noted in the Herald contributed to my
decision, it is untrue that I heard any of that from the grandmothers. Any
information attributed to them came from other sources,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day off the
Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling with him in an effort to flee
Cuba drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was told by people she trusted that Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and his family knew about the voyage to Florida 10 days before the
boat left Cuba, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald quoted the nun as saying she learned that Elian's father had been
physically abusive to the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This talk of defecting got me to thinking; if one of the adults wanted
out, perhaps it was not a good place for the child,'' she told the Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from Elian's family in Cuba or from the
Cuban government. O'Laughlin has been maligned by Cuban media since saying Elian
should stay with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   When O'Laughlin first told reporters she had changed her mind about
remaining neutral, she said she believed Elian had bonded with his 21-year-old
cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. She also said she sensed fear emanating from the
grandmothers, which she believed was caused by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is currently staying with relatives in Miami. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his return to Cuba and to his
father, but Elian's U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami judge will hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court has
jurisdiction in the case.

<HEADLINE> Barak Renews Vow to Leave Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By BARAK BARFI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will find itself in a conflict that could last five
or 10 years if it withdraws unilaterally from Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the bleak prediction, Barak renewed his vow to pull out by July with
or without an agreement with Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting in a border zone Israel occupies in south Lebanon has escalated
since Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month, an indication of how
difficult a withdrawal could be without Syria's agreement. Seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed since Jan. 25, and Israel bombed Lebanese power
stations on Feb. 8, causing severe power rationing throughout Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak called ending Israel's 15-year presence in Lebanon ``a national and
moral obligation'' best fulfilled through peace treaties with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Without these types of treaties, we will find ourselves in a conflict,
even if it takes five or ten years,'' he told activists from Meimad, a religious
party in his One Israel bloc. ``And the youth who will have to fight in this
battle have the right to know that Israeli governments tried all avenues to
reach an agreement so that this would not happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak added that a unilateral withdrawal would cost Israeli lives.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel occupies the border zone to protect its northern towns and fears that
Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon will carry out cross-border attacks if
Israel withdraws. It seeks Syrian guarantees of quiet, but peace talks are
stalled over a Syrian demand for an upfront agreement to return the strategic
Golan Heights, captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has refused preconditions and says it first wants to know what kind
of normalization and security arrangements Syria will offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has suggested that, if an agreement seems impossible by April or May,
he will order a unilateral withdrawal. Public pressure to withdraw has been
mounting.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Sunday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy warned that withdrawing
now, in the midst of Israeli losses to Hezbollah, would encourage Hezbollah to
strike Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Withdrawal now, in effect, does not mean withdrawal. It means a rout,
panic-stricken flight ... which will place us in the future .... in a very
critical situation,'' Levy told Israel's army radio.

<HEADLINE> Guard Missing After Plane Hijacked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A convicted murderer who was being flown across
Colombia managed to pull a knife, hijack the plane and force it to land at a
remote airstrip, where he fled with a guard as his hostage, police said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were hunting for Hernando Prada, who had been serving a 50-year
sentence for murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of an armed escort of two prison guards, Prada drew a
knife eight minutes after the Beechcraft 1900 biplane took off from Bucaramanga
airport in northwestern Santander state on Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was headed for the town of Cucuta, but Prada forced the pilot to
land at a small airstrip at El Tornillo, 240 miles north of Bogota. There, he
forced one of the guards to flee with him.
</P>
<P>
	   Police did not immediately explain how Prada had smuggled the knife onboard
or why he was being transferred to Cucuta.
</P>
<P>
	   The Aerotaca plane returned to Bucaramanga, where after a change of crew, it
continued its scheduled flight to Cucuta in Norte de Santander state.

<HEADLINE> Fall landslides make for dangerous trails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) - Skiers call them the slides - swaths of
mountain smoothed by the wrath of Tropical Storm Floyd and other major storms.
They provide for speedy descents in some of the most picturesque regions of the
Adirondacks.
<P>
	   But Saturday's death of 27-year-old Toma Jacob Vracarich at Wright Peak now
serves as a reminder of the dangers inherent in the snow-laden mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Adirondacks can be a dangerous place," said John Sheehan of the
Adirondack Council, an environmental advocacy group. "People lose their lives in
the back country every year."
</P>
<P>
	   Vracarich, of Lake Placid, was one of six skiers out on Saturday
telemarking, a Norwegian-born sport that combines the arts of downhill and
cross-country skiing in places off the beaten track.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Department of Environmental Conservation Spokeswoman Jennifer
Post, the slope they chose was on the exact side of Wright Peak that had been
denuded by a mudslide following Tropical Storm Floyd last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bared by the winds of trees and vegetation, the mountainside was no more
than smooth rock. Skiers familiar with the area said that Friday's powdery snow
made for a type of skiing usually associated with the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
	   But at about 1 p.m., an avalanche brought snow smashing over the trail,
burying both Vracarich and 29-year-old Lauren Konowitz of Keene. Konowitz was
rescued when other skiers in the party spotted her hat on the snow and dug down
to her face. She was listed in serious condition at Adirondack Medical Center
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   It took rangers and volunteers nearly five hours to find Vracarich's body.
</P>
<P>
	   The others in the party - Lauren's 45-year-old husband Ronald, 26-year-old
Dean Cook of Saranac Lake, Christina Ford of Lake Placid, and Rohan Roy of
Chateaugay escaped with minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   "A fracture line opened below me and one above me," Roy said, "it rumbled,
there was a powder clouds...it was like being strained through the woods, just
like a little pinball being pushed through the woods by a 100-mph force," Roy
said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was fortuitous, Post said, that DEC rangers were in the area scouting for
avalanche conditions when the tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   After someone on the mountainside with a cell phone reported the avalanche,
rangers were able to reach the site within an hour and arrange helicopter
transport for the injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangers, volunteers, and others searched for Vracarich in armpit-deep snow,
using "avalanche poles" to poke in search of him.
</P>
<P>
	   Because northeastern mountains are relatively low and are less steep than
mountains in western parts of the nation, avalanches are rare here. They are
most common in the Mount Washington area of New Hampshire, where an avalanche
Sunday killed at least one person. During the last century, 126 people have died
in this area.
</P>
<P>
	   But conditions in recent weeks have increased the likelihood here. Last
week, officials in Vermont posted avalanche warnings in Smugglers' Notch,
popular among skiers, as well as on Vermont 108, a state highway.
</P>
<P>
	   "In my 13 years I have never seen anything like this. There are fracture
lines (for avalanches) all over the place," said Sgt. Butch Patch of the Vermont
Army National Guard's Mountain Warfare School.
</P>
<P>
	   New York officials were not limiting trail access Sunday, but were
continuing to advise people of known areas of risk.
</P>
<P>
	   Rangers had warned the very party caught in the avalanche that the trail
they planned to ski was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
	   "We advise people to avoid areas with steep open slopes with heavy snow
loads," Post said. "Where the snow slide occurred was the exact same spot that
we had a landslide in this summer. The avalanche essentially mirrored the
landslide."
</P>
<P>
	   Cook, one of the skiers, described the avalanche as "freak."
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to talk about what went wrong and what went right is useless," he
said. "Somebody died up there."

<HEADLINE> Former Mexican Gov. May Surrender  </HEADLINE>
   By AMPARO TREJO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY -- After nearly a year on the run, a former Mexican governor
facing drug trafficking charges has apparently grown weary, offering hints that
he might surrender.
</P>
<P>
	   Mario Villanueva said in an interview by the magazine Milenio that he would
consider turning himself in if there was agreement not to bring charges against
his family and to return some $5 million and other property seized from him. He
denied drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   And three sources with direct knowledge of the investigation, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that interview has led to contacts between
Villanueva and prominent political figures, though details remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorney general's office has not commented on possible negotiations
with Villanueva, the only sitting governor known to have been under a formal
investigation of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Villanueva disappeared on March 28, 1999, two weeks before the end of his
term as governor of Quintana Roo, the state that includes Cancun and one where
drug trafficking has been growing. Officials have confirmed he faces charges of
trafficking and money laundering, with evidence linking him with the powerful
Juarez drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
	   The international police organization Interpol has been seeking him abroad
while the federal attorney general's office has hunted him in Mexico, where the
agency has four open cases against him on suspicion of money laundering and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege he allowed cocaine shipments to be moved along the
Caribbean coast in return for bribes. The international police organization
Interpol has been seeking Villanueva abroad, and the federal attorney general's
office has hunted him in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The sources said surrender negotiations began after Milenio published the
interview Feb. 13. The interview was granted to free-lance journalist Isabel
Arvide, noted for extensive contacts among political and military figures. She
had known Villanueva for 22 years. She quoted him as saying he was the victim of
a political offensive because he had rebelled against the wishes of President
Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the magazine, Villanueva expressed feelings of betrayal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I did my part, I made all the party's candidates win. I gave them money, I
ran campaigns for them. I controlled the state,'' he said. Mexican law bans
public officials from giving money to candidates or interfering in elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Villanueva was quoted as saying he escaped from an office loaned him by the
governor of neighboring Yucatan state, Victor Cervera Pacheco. He said the
office had two doors. While police waited at one, he walked out the other.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said that Diodoro Carrasco, who months later would become interior
secretary, advised him to flee. Carrasco denied any such advice or agreement
with Villanueva.

<HEADLINE> Russians Target Key Mountain Gorge  </HEADLINE>
   By ELMIRA KOZHAYEVA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops are encircling Chechen rebels in a
strategic, snowy gorge, trying to prevent the militants from escaping and
ambushing federal-held areas, the Russian defense minister said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Chechnya's capital, Grozny, meanwhile, Russian riot troops picking
through bombed-out ruins clashed sporadically Sunday with the few rebels left in
the city. Sappers defused mines that riddle roads, bridges and Grozny's few
remaining buildings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have occupied most of the breakaway republic after months of
fighting. They seized Grozny after most rebels fled earlier this month and have
squeezed the rebels into a few regions in Chechnya's rugged south. But the
militants still have about 7,000 fighters based in the southern mountains, and
bands of rebels mount occasional attacks on Russian-held towns.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal air and artillery fire is being concentrated on suspected rebel
strongholds in the Argun and Vedeno gorges, said Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian warplanes and helicopter gunships flew more than 100 missions over
the past 24 hours, mainly in the two gorges, the military command for North
Caucasus told Interfax on Sunday. Militants holed up in the gorges -- which cut
south through the mountains to Georgia and are a main supply route for the
rebels -- were resisting fiercely but suffering heavy losses in the Russian
bombardment, the military said.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel attacks are ``significantly less often than a month ago,''
Chechnya military commandant Lt. Gen. Ivan Babichev said Sunday, according to
the ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The end of a 1994-96 war with Russian forces left Chechnya with de facto
independence. But Russia sent troops into the territory again last September,
after Chechnya-based militants invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. The
Chechens also are blamed for four apartment bombings in Russia in September that
killed 300 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels held out for months in Grozny. But most of them abandoned the
capital last month and retreated to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   In Grozny, almost no civilians are visible on the streets. The military has
sealed the city and forbidden all nonmilitary traffic inside until at least
March 1. Russian officials say the capital must be closed to thwart possible
rebel attempts to sneak back in and to give sappers time to defuse mines.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers from Russia's Emergencies Ministry have been burying bodies
retrieved from Grozny basements, where most civilians hid during the five months
of Russian bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Thank you, Emergency Ministry. They gave me food. And they helped to bury
my relatives,'' 33-year-old Grozny resident Ada Sviridova said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Sunday, pro-Moscow Chechen leader Bislan Gantamirov claimed that
Radio Liberty correspondent Andrei Babitsky was in the Chechen town of Duba-Yurt
and should be turned over to a pro-Moscow militia soon, Russian news reports
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gantamirov, whose previous claims have often proven false, did not give
details.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials had criticized Babitsky for reporting from the rebels'
side in the Chechen fighting. They detained him last month, then said they
turned him over to rebels at his request. He has not been heard from since, and
his colleagues fear he could be dead.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Expect Peace Outline by May  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel and the Palestinians will likely reach a framework
agreement for a final peace treaty in May -- three months past the original
deadline, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an agreement would ultimately dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza
Strip, a senior minister in Barak's Cabinet said, the latest sign that the
government is preparing its public for uprooting settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement was to have been reached last week, but negotiations are
stalled over the location of an interim withdrawal from the West Bank. In
addition to settlements, the accord is to tackle tough issues like the status of
Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told his Cabinet on Sunday that the framework accord would likely be
ready in three months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I won't be shocked if we reach a framework agreement in May,'' his office
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak blamed the Palestinians, in part, for the delay, saying that they
refused an offer to hold 20 days of intensive negotiations in January. The
Palestinians suspended talks earlier this month after they learned that Barak
refused to give them three Arab suburbs of Jerusalem as part of an interim West
Bank troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians say the framework agreement, which was Barak's idea, should
be skipped in favor of direct negotiations over the treaty itself, due by
September.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We no longer need the framework agreement,'' Palestinian Speaker of
Parliament Ahmed Qureia said. He blamed the deadlock on Israel's ``impossible
positions.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was to arrive in the region Monday to mediate
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, meanwhile, said ``there is no doubt'' that
Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip would have to be dismantled as part of a
final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin told Israel's army radio that Gaza settlements were not historically
justified and were impractical, because Jews would always be a tiny minority
among a huge Palestinian majority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not the (Biblical) Land of Israel. It is the most crowded place in
the world, and I don't think there is any justification for leaving settlements
there,'' Beilin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin's comments, though not an official government position, were
consistent with other statements and leaks from officials close to Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   In another sign that the government was laying the groundwork for evacuating
settlements, army radio quoted unnamed senior defense officials as saying that
they had prepared a map showing 21 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza that
would be dismantled in a permanent peace agreement and 16 whose status was in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Barak told his Cabinet that ``no such map exists and no one has
asked the army to prepare such a map,'' his office said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the reported map is consistent with promises by Israeli officials
that the Palestinians would ultimately control a contiguous block of West Bank
land, a crucial underpinning to the state Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat hopes
to declare by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians maintain that all 144 Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and the Gaza Strip are illegal and must be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak himself has not explicitly said he would evacuate settlements, a
position that would encounter fierce opposition from about half of the political
spectrum, including two coalition partners. Beilin's statements and other leaks
are likely efforts to test public opinion on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Approaching Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The desert nation of Mozambique, still recovering
from recent devastating and deadly rains, is bracing for another watery
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
	   A tropical storm is heading to the country and expected to bring heavy rains
and high winds, the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria said Sunday. It was
uncertain when the system would hit land.
</P>
<P>
	   The Mozambican floods are reported to have killed 150 people and left
hundreds of thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   Vast areas of agricultural land have been destroyed in the floods, leading
to acute hunger, Radio Mozambique reported Saturday. But President Joaquim
Chissano, who inspected flood damages by air Saturday in southern Mozambique,
said this year's harvest in the Limpopo Valley did not have to be totally
ruined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everything would depend on an efficient supply of seeds to farmers for
second sowings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crews from South African Defense Forces, in Mozambique to aid the rescue
effort, have saved about 3,000 people from trees, rooftops and the water in the
past week, spokesman Maj. Louis Kirstein said Sunday.
</P>
<P>

burst its banks after officials on Saturday were forced to open the sluice gates
of the country's largest storage dam because of torrential rains and flash

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Former Republican state Sen. Kenneth L. Maddy, who

Valley: farm labor, water and land use, and other agricultural issues.
Paul Manasseh
</P>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Paul Manasseh, a pioneer in the field of college
sports public relations and longtime sports information director at Louisiana
State University, died Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been hospitalized in declining health since Jan. 14, when the car he
was driving went out of control and crashed into a tree.
</P>
<P>
	   Manasseh spent more than 40 years in professional and college athletics,
including 12 as the sports information director at LSU and four as the first
public relations director of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
	   Manasseh was a pacesetter in sports media relations, making LSU one of the
first to use highlight films to publicize its sports teams. Manasseh was
recognized nationally for his work and in 1978 was voted into the College Sports
Information Directors of America Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include two sons.
Sam Robbins
</P>
<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Sam Robbins, a bird-watcher who claimed to have
spotted more than 100 species of birds in each of Wisconsin's 72 counties, died
Saturday of renal failure. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbins observed more than 300 of the 400 bird species known to inhabit the
state, said his wife, Shirley Robbins.
</P>
<P>
	   Robbins, a retired pastor with the United Church of Christ, published his
lifework, ``Wisconsin Birdlife,'' in 1991. He held numerous positions with the
Wisconsin Society for Ornithology and wrote a weekly column for Country Today.
He also appeared frequently on Wisconsin Public Radio.
Jeanne Hurley Simon
</P>
<P>
	   MAKANDA, Ill. (AP) -- Jeanne Hurley Simon, the wife of former Sen. Paul
Simon who carved out her own career in the public eye, died Sunday from brain
cancer. She was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Although best known as the wife of a respected former senator and
presidential candidate, Simon had her own career, lobbying on behalf of
educational and library issues. Before getting married, she served as an
assistant Cook County state's attorney and a state representative from the area
around Wilmette.
</P>
<P>
	   Simon was one of the state's only female representatives in 1956 when she
met her future husband, a fellow lawmaker, at the state capitol. She left the
state House in 1960 after two terms to marry him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I always say to Paul, 'When I met you and married, you were a mere state
representative, and see what I've done for you,''' she Simon said in a 1989
television interview.
</P>
<P>
	   They worked together through several campaigns, including the senator's
unsuccessful presidential race in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   After leaving government, she went on to become an advocate for educational
issues and was named chairwoman of the National Commission on Libraries and
Information Science in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   When her husband retired from the Senate in 1997, she accepted an adjunct
professorship at Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said her primary role was in helping her husband carry out his
agenda at the university's Public Policy Institute, which she helped found.
</P>
<P>
	   She also wrote a book, ``Codename: Scarlett,'' detailing her experiences on
the campaign trail during her husband's presidential bid.
Anatoly Sobchak
</P>
<P>
	   ST. PETERSBURG (AP) -- Anatoly Sobchak, a prominent reformer who as mayor
transformed Soviet-era Leningrad into democratic St. Petersburg, died Sunday. He
was 62.
</P>
<P>
	   Sobchak, who also served as a mentor to acting President Vladimir Putin,
died of an apparent heart attack, his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sobchak was an outspoken leader of Mikhail Gorbachev's campaign to reform
the Soviet Union in the late 1980s, and was elected by a landslide as mayor of
Russia's second-largest city a few months before the Soviet collapse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   Sobchak's democratic credentials were stained by an investigation into
allegations of bribery and abuse of power. During his tenure as mayor, the city
that symbolizes Russia's pre-revolutionary splendor and rich literary history
became known as one of the country's most crime-ridden and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
	   He lost the mayor's office in 1996, and fled to France in November 1997
after suffering a heart attack while undergoing police questioning. Sobchak
returned to Russia last summer, and the investigation was later dropped -- after
his protege, Putin, was named prime minister.
Goran Tunstrom
</P>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Popular Swedish writer Goran Tunstrom died on Feb.
5. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
	   The award-winning author of several poetry collections, novels, dramas and
travel stories died from sudden heart failure during a dinner with several
friends, according to Swedish media reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Tunstrom published his first poetry collection in 1958, but his work did not
gain wide public acclaim until 1983 with his epic novel ``Christmas Oratorio,''
which was later made into a film. The story spans three generations, starting in
the 1930s in his home county Sunne in northern Sweden and ending in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no writing without pain,'' said Tunstrom, who in recent years was
plagued by a heart attack, stroke, lung cancer and three car accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   Survivors include his wife and son.

Republican Hopefuls Take on Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls John McCain and
George W. Bush pushed through the first days of a campaign in Michigan, trying
to sway voters their way for Tuesday's primary. "We won round one," McCain said,
referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Feb. 1.
"Governor Bush won round two," a lopsided win in South Carolina. "Now we go to
round three," he said. One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated
Michigan a toss-up.

Barak Predicts Conflict in Lebanon
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel will find itself in a conflict that could last five
or 10 years if it withdraws unilaterally from Lebanon, Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak said Sunday. Despite the bleak prediction, Barak renewed his vow to
pull out by July with or without an agreement with Syria, the main power broker
in Lebanon. Fighting in a border zone Israel occupies in south Lebanon has
escalated since Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down last month, an indication
of how difficult a withdrawal could be without Syria's agreement. Seven Israeli
soldiers have been killed since Jan. 25, and Israel bombed Lebanese power
stations on Feb. 8, causing severe power rationing throughout Lebanon.

Turkey Detains Third Kurdish Mayor
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey on Sunday detained a third Kurdish mayor who
had sought foreign support in a campaign for cultural rights, continuing a crack
down on political leaders amid an easing of Kurdish rebels' 15-year-old
guerrilla war. The arrests of Feyzullah Karaaslan of Bingol on Sunday and the
two other mayors on Saturday signaled that the government, despite pressure from
Europe, remains extremely wary of granting cultural rights to restive Kurds.
Turkey, vying for European Union membership, is likely to face increased
European pressure to lift bans on education and broadcasting in Kurdish.

Microsoft Moves to Ban Long Temps
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is limiting its temporary workers to
one year of employment at a time, with 100-day intervals in between -- a move
that will force up to 1,500 of its long-term contract workers to find new jobs
or seek permanent positions with the company. Microsoft's policy change,
announced Friday, follows pressure from litigation and union organizers to bar
use of so-called "permatemps" -- temporary workers who stay in the same job for
years, but without the benefits offered permanent workers. The software giant
began informing temp agencies early last week of the new policy, which goes into
effect July 1.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Well-Financed  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain outraised George W. Bush last month, even as the
Texas governor set records for total fund-raising and spending. And McCain
continued to narrow the financial gap between himself and Bush in February, at
least in advance of Saturday's South Carolina primary in which he was soundly
defeated by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley reported that he had $8.9 million in the bank as of Jan. 31, while
Gore reported $8.1 million. Bradley was expecting an additional $6.9 million in
federal funds, bringing his total to $15.8 million. Gore expected $7.5 million
in federal funds, bringing his total to $15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator, who lost to Gore in both Iowa and New
Hampshire, needs a strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries March 7,
including both New York and California.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaign chairman Douglas Berman said the senator intended to use
his bank account to challenge Gore from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This race is a contest between a candidate who has strongly and
consistently supported Democratic Party principles such as a woman's right to
choose, common sense handgun control, and health care access for all, and a
candidate who has not,'' Berman said. ``We will take that case directly to the
voters between now and March 7 and will have the funds available to do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign officials noted that Bradley spent more money on television
advertising than the vice president in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and lost
both contests. Bradley reported spending $1.8 million on TV while Gore reported
spending $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Bradley spent $5 million, bringing his total to $24.4 million,
while Gore spent $3.8 million, bringing his total to $27 million. Candidates who
accept federal funds are limited to spending around $40 million, plus certain
legal and accounting expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore's campaign won more and spent less than Bill Bradley in 2000,''
Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho said. ``Voters clearly see that Al Gore has
the most experience and the best ideas to fight for working families. Bill
Bradley may outspend us on TV advertising, but Al Gore's message resonates
better with voters. We have the resources to carry that message across the
nation and win the Democratic nomination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised $1.3 million in January -- bringing his total for the
campaign to $29.2 million -- and received $4.2 million in federal funds. The
federal government matches the first $250 of each individual contribution up to
$250 for candidates who agree to limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Actress Marsha Mason contributed $1,000 to Bradley, as did Sherwood
Schwartz, the creator and producer of Gilligan's Island and the Brady Bunch.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore raised just $588,630 during the month, bringing his total to $29.6
million, plus $5.5 million in federal funds. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and wife Vickie each gave $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush raised $2 million in January, bringing his
record-setting total to $70.7 million. He also spent $12.8 million -- more than
$3 million a month -- to win the Iowa caucuses and finish second behind McCain
in New Hampshire. Bush has spent at least $50.1 million -- more than any other
presidential candidate ever. He entered February with $20.5 million in the bank
-- more than McCain raised through Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of our strong, grassroots support from so many individuals in all
50 states, Americans are hearing and responding to my message as a reformer with
results,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain actually outraised Bush in January, taking in around $2.5 million, to
bring his total to more than $18 million, including $2 million transferred from
his Senate account. He spent around $6.7 million, bringing his overall total to
around $21 million. He had $3.1 million in the bank as of Jan. 31, including
$2.8 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For months, people would tell us, 'I really like John McCain but there's
no way he can win,''' spokesman Dan Schnur said. ``Over the last couple of
months, they started changing their minds. When the polls started moving in New
Hampshire, our fund raising started increasing dramatically. But after we won,
it has exploded.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since his victory in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, McCain has raised an
additional $8 million, including $3.5 million via the Internet, a senior
campaign official said. Including expected federal matching funds, McCain now
has $8 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing to spend at the rate of $3 million a week, Bush is below the $20
million mark, and campaign aides said last week that he would begin raising
money again to replenish his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   The third Republican in the race, Alan Keyes, raised $655,842 in January,
bringing his total to $5.1 million. He also borrowed $380,000 and received
$616,629 in federal funds. Keyes, who finished third in Iowa, spent $1.9
million, bringing his campaign total to $5.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Rival developers spread cash to sway opinion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Rival developers in the proposed Long Wharf mall
have spent more than $1.3 million on lobbying and $500,000 in federal and state
campaign contributions since 1997.
<P>
	   Each side has "played to its own strengths," said state Republican Chairman
Chris DePino.
</P>
<P>
	   A New Haven lawmaker who strongly supports the $500 million mall project,
DePino admitted mall opponents have done a good job in what he calls "hardball
politics at the highest level."
</P>
<P>
	   The mall's developers, New England Development and Fusco Corp., have
contributed some $61,000 to recent state campaigns - nearly two-thirds of that
to Republican Gov. John G. Rowland's re-election effort. Another $260,000 has
been spent on lobbying, according to federal and state election records obtained
by the New Haven Register.
</P>
<P>
	   Westfield America, which is seeking to kill the New Haven project in defense
of its own suburban Connecticut malls, has given at least $425,000 in "soft
money" to national and congressional party organizations. Westfield also has
spent more than $1 million on a lobbying and advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Politicians for and against the mall insist the money hasn't influenced
their positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean Pagani, Rowland's chief spokesman, said the governor's support for
urban projects like the Long Wharf mall has been known since he was first
elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's much bigger than campaign contributions," Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   But mall critics say the developers' contributions have helped the project
escape serious consideration of potential environmental, traffic and economic
problems. Supporters say Westfield's funds have bogged down an economic boon.
</P>
<P>
	   Some say the battle illustrates the need for limits on the power of big
money over government and politics.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is politics today, and I don't like it any better than any other
American citizen," said John Isaacs, a downtown New Haven merchant opposed to
the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   The next two months are likely to be crucial to the outcome of this costly
contest. The U.S. Postal Service board of governors is scheduled to vote March 7
on the proposal to move its New Haven facility to make way for the mall.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials expect to make a final decision within 60 days on the
release of some $28 million in state funding.

<HEADLINE> Administration Welcomes Iran Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Iranian voters indicated they wanted a reform-minded
parliament, the State Department on Sunday welcomed the preliminary returns as a
clear signal of a growing trend toward greater freedom and openness in the
Persian Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
	   In a warm statement, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
Iranian people had unmistakably demonstrated with their ballots that ``they want
policies of openness and engagement with the rest of the world'' and greater
freedom at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Mindful of ongoing tensions between moderates, represented by President
Mohammad Khatami, and conservative fundamentalists, Rubin said ``we hope the
clear desires of the Iranian people can be translated into reality by their
elected representatives, and we hope this trend will be reflected in a new
approach in Iran's relationship with the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. relations with Iran were broken off after religious zealots took
control of a revolution that had overthrown the Shah, seized the U.S. Embassy in
1979 and held Americans captive until January 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   The election of Khatami in May 1997 was considered an expression of
dissatisfaction with the strictures of the regime, and the Clinton
administration undertook a mostly unsuccessful effort to engage Tehran in a
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Administration officials stressed that while it would have no preconditions,
any dialogue would include U.S. complaints that Iran promotes terrorism, was
developing an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction and was trying to sabotage
Arab-Israeli peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
	   The absence of a response suggested the moderates were not in the
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
	   But as results of the balloting on Friday started to become clear on Sunday,
the State Department found new grounds for optimism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although the reports of the results are not yet final, all indications are
that this election is an event of historic proportion,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Iranian people have demonstrated unmistakably that they want policies
of openness and engagement with the rest of the world, while making clear their
preference for international policies that allow them greater freedom in Iran,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Mayne Focuses on Hitting  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- He has played baseball, by his estimation, for 25
years. Now nearly 32 and with his hair betraying shoots of gray along the sides,
Brent Mayne feels he has finally unlocked the secrets to hitting.
</P>
<P>
	   The numbers support him.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayne is a career .265 hitter who has had a .288 average in the past three
seasons, including a career-high .301 with San Francisco in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   A left-handed-hitting catcher, Mayne agreed in December to a $4.15 million,
two-year contract with Colorado, where he hopes to continue to refine his
stroke.
</P>
<P>
	   He figures to be the Rockies' everyday catcher, to be spelled by veteran
Scott Servais when necessary. Mayne and Servais also shared catching duties in
San Francisco last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayne is expected to hold the fort until 22-year-old Ben Petrick, one of the
franchise's top prospects, is ready for the majors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last three years have been big years for me as far as learning what I
was doing and figuring out the swing and just becoming a better hitter,'' Mayne
said Sunday. ``Plus, I'm getting more at-bats as time goes on. I'm getting to
play more and more, and that helps. But I think the biggest thing is I'm
learning how to swing the bat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if it was unusual for a hitter to suddenly become proficient in his
30s, Mayne said, ``Yeah, isn't that weird? I've been playing for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You could go up and down his clubhouse and ask guys what they know about
hitting, and I guarantee you 99 percent of them in the big leagues don't know
what they're doing. They may have gotten here because they're physically strong
or they've just always hit a certain way that's been successful. But if you ask
them to break it down and tell you exactly what they're doing, I doubt that many
can tell you.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think I can. I've got a real good idea of what I need to do and want
to do. When I look at myself on videotape, I can tell where I'm going wrong or
what's going right. It's really very basic stuff, just being in a balanced
position throughout the rotation of the swing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mayne has set some personal goals this season, but declines to reveal them
other than to say he wants to ``improve my power numbers.''
</P>
<P>
	   In 322 at-bats last season, he had only two homers and 39 RBIs. He did,
however, have 32 doubles, an unusually high number compared to his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
	   He is, of course, fully aware that playing half of his games in
hitter-friendly Coors Field should help boost his output.
</P>
<P>
	   That was only one of several factors that caused him to sign with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I received a good contract offer and an opportunity to play, and just
remaining close to the West Coast was big for me,'' said Mayne, a native
Californian and avid surfer.
</P>
<P>
	   With 10 new pitchers on the Rockies' 40-man roster, Mayne and Servais know
they have precious little time to learn the preferences and peculiarities of
each hurler.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a little more difficult because of all the new guys,'' Mayne
admitted. ``But that's the way it is for a lot of teams nowadays.''

</P>
<P>
	   Elisa Aguilar added 20 points for GW to lead four players in double figures.
The Colonials, who won their 19th straight game at home, snapped Xavier's
11-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   After scoring six straight points early in the second half to help erase the
Musketeers' 10-point halftime lead, Alexander was clutch at the foul line late
in the game. The Colonials led 65-63 with just under two minutes left when she
sank two free throws to create a four-point margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Amy Waugh scored to pull the Musketeers within two points. But Alexander hit
both ends of a one-in-one for a 69-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Waugh then sank a 3-pointer with 3.4 seconds left, and GW's Petra
Dubovcovato was fouled with 1.7 seconds to play. She made the first shot but
missed the second one. The rebound went to Xavier's Kim Hotz, whose heave from
three-quarters court bounced off the backboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Waugh led Xavier with 20 points.

<HEADLINE> Bird Interested in Buying Celtics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BOSTON (AP) -- Larry Bird, one of the greatest Celtics of all time, now says
he may be interested in owning the team.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he'd ever buy the Boston Celtics, Bird said he thinks he could make
it happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "I could get people together to buy the team in a day," Bird said. "I could
get it done tomorrow. Let's get the ball rolling."
</P>
<P>
	   Celtics team owner Paul Gaston has said publicly that the team is not for
sale.
</P>
<P>
	   Bird, whose three-year coaching commitment with the Indiana Pacers ends this
season, has been offered an executive position in the Pacers' front office.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bird said the move wasn't right for him. He plans to return to his home
in Florida after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Bird, who worked as a Celtics consultant for five years after he retired
from playing, said he wouldn't return to work for the team under the team's
current ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   But he told The Boston Globe that if he were to own the Celtics, he would be
an active owner, like Michael Jordan of the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   Gaston told The Globe last week that his objective was to make the Celtics
competitive, while still running the team like a business.
</P>
<P>
	   Bird responded, "I always thought that the owner of the Celtics wanted to
win a championship, not just be competitive. Tell him I'm ready to buy."

<HEADLINE> Child Goes Home Without Transplant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Eighteen-month-old Akari Saino, who was to become
the first Japanese citizen to receive a heart-lung transplant, will not undergo
the procedure because her doctors here don't think she could survive it.
</P>
<P>
	   The toddler was born with only one heart ventricle instead of the normal
two, which makes it difficult for her to take oxygen into her lungs. Without the
operation, doctors say she won't live much longer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This was our only hope,'' her parents, Ryosuke and Mayumi Saino, said
through a doctor who translated.
</P>
<P>
	   They plan to fly their little girl home to Sapporo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Akari came to Lucile Salter Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford
University in late January to be put on a waiting list for a donated heart and
lungs. Then her doctors discovered she also would need a liver transplant to
survive. Only 10 heart-lung-liver transplants have been performed worldwide, all
on adults.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Akari is pretty ill and her strength is (ebbing),'' Dr. Bruce Reitz,
chairman of cardiac surgery, told the San Jose Mercury News. ``We wanted to do
everything we could for her, but it didn't seem like the right use of donor
organs.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Sainos worked for a year to bring their only child to the United States
for the transplant. To cover the estimated costs for travel and the transplant,
ranging from $200,000 to $500,000, the Sainos formed the Save Akari Foundation,
which raised nearly $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Akari's case gained media attention in Japan, where a strong cultural bias
exists against organ transplants. Until recently, certain transplant procedures
were illegal.
</P>
<P>
	   Heart or lung transplants are legal only under certain conditions -- and if
the patient is older than 15. A spokesman for Sapporo Medical College said there
have been no simultaneous transplants of a heart and lungs on a Japanese
patient.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's not another developed country that is as opposed to
(transplantation),'' MacGill University medical anthropologist Margaret Lock
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sainos said they will try to make their daughter's last few months as
happy as possible, and they will continue to work in Japan to heighten awareness
about transplantation and childhood diseases.

<HEADLINE> College Sports PR Pioneer Dies  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Paul Manasseh, a pioneer in the field of college
sports public relations and longtime sports information director at LSU, died
Sunday. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
	He had been hospitalized in declining health since Jan. 14, when the car he was
driving went out of control and crashed into a tree.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh spent more than 40 years in professional and college athletics,
including 12 as the SID at LSU and four as the first public relations director
of the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh was a pacesetter in sports media relations, making LSU one of the
first to use highlight films to publicize its sports teams. Manasseh was
recognized nationally for his work and in 1978 was voted into the College Sports
Information Directors of America Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
	Considered a master of promoting athletes for all-star honors, he spearheaded
the campaigns of 13 athletes to All-America status at LSU.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh was referred to as the only man who could make a second-team
quarterback a first-team All-American, referring to Tigers star Bert Jones, who
played in a two-quarterback system at LSU in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	``He helped a lot of young people,'' former LSU football coach Charles
McClendon said. ``He helped a lot of young and old people, as a matter of fact,
including me. We laughed together and cried together. He was a great person.''
</P>
<P>
	Former LSU basketball coach Dale Brown remembered Manasseh for special
promotions that helped build the basketball program at a football-crazed school.
</P>
<P>
	Under Manasseh's direction, LSU won numerous awards for its media publications
during the 1970s, once claiming nine national awards in one year.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh also was known for tutoring numerous students who went on to
successful careers in sports journalism and media relations.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh attended LSU from 1937-39 and worked for the Shreveport Journal from
1939-42 prior to entering the Army during World War II. He served at the Army's
public information office in New Orleans and the Counter Intelligence Corps in
Philadelphia and New York.
</P>
<P>
	After the war, Manasseh returned to the Journal in 1946 and served as editor of
the Bossier Tribune for one year before becoming sports director of KWKH radio
in Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
	In the 1950s he was general manager for the Monroe Sports of the Cotton States
Baseball League and director of public relations for minor league baseball teams
in Shreveport, Denver, and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	He also was the original director of public relations for the Broncos of the
AFL from 1960-63 and assistant general manager for the Broncos until 1966.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh moved to the Dallas Cowboys as special assistant for kicking tryout
camps in 1967, a position which led to his becoming SID at Louisiana Tech in
1968.
</P>
<P>
	He moved to LSU the next year, was promoted to SID in 1971 and held that
position for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
	Following retirement in 1983, Manasseh joined the Memphis Showboats of the USFL
as director of public relations, then was hired by the New Orleans Breakers of
the USFL prior to that team's first game in the spring of 1984.
</P>
<P>
	When the Breakers moved to Portland, Manasseh became executive director of the
Independence Bowl. In 1989 he retired from the Independence Bowl and worked as a
freelance columnist and media relations staffer with the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	Manasseh is survived by two sons, John and James, both of Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
	Funeral services will be held at 10 a.m. Thursday at Rabenhorst Funeral Home in
Baton Rouge. Burial will follow at Greenoaks Cemetery in Baton Rouge.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Protesters Free Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters have freed the 65 policemen they
captured during a clash over control of a teachers' college, according to news
reports Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Several police and protesters were injured during the weekend protest in the
Hidalgo state town of Tepatepec, 50 miles north of Mexico City, the reports
said. Protesters also burned more than a dozen police cars.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials and town leaders met briefly Sunday to discuss the conflict
over the Tepatepec's teachers college, but there was no word on an agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school
early Saturday morning to end a seven-week student takeover. Dozens of students
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   The raid prompted hundreds of angered students and supporters to converge on
the school. Most of the policemen managed to leave, but at least 65 were
surrounded by the crowd, stripped of their shirts, and marched to the town
plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   The policemen were finally freed late Saturday night after about 12 hours,
when state officials released the detained students.
</P>
<P>
	   The school has long been a hotbed of leftist political activism, and many
town residents apparently supported the students' demands for more scholarships
and the removal of a few school administrators they accused of corruption.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials had tried to break the power of student organizations they
said were virtually controlling the school, the Mexico City newspaper Reforma
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence that resulted from the police action was a marked contrast to
the peaceful police raid that ended a nine-month student occupation of the
National Autonomous University in Mexico City a week earlier.

<HEADLINE> Nun: Cuban Grandma Wanted To Defect  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A nun involved in a meeting between Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban grandmothers decided the 6-year-old should remain in the United States
after she was told one of the grandmothers wanted to defect, her spokeswoman
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with the grandmothers last month at her home in Miami Beach,
Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, said she was
abandoning her neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was influenced to change her position by several things she had
been told about the case by people she trusted, Michele Morris, a spokeswoman
for Barry, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin didn't want to divulge the information to the media after the
reunion because she heard it secondhand, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald reported that one of the grandmothers told O'Laughlin
directly that she wanted to defect. But O'Laughlin said Sunday in a statement
that ``unfortunately the article had some misinformation. I never met with the
grandmothers alone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``While some of the specifics noted in the Herald contributed to my
decision, it is untrue that I heard any of that from the grandmothers. Any
information attributed to them came from other sources,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald's executive editor, Martin Baron, said in a statement Sunday:
``We can say without hesitation that our story was an accurate account of what
Sister Jeanne told us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day off the
Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling with him in an effort to flee
Cuba drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was told by people she trusted that Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and his family knew about the voyage to Florida 10 days before the
boat left Cuba, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald quoted the nun as saying she learned that Elian's father had been
physically abusive to the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This talk of defecting got me to thinking; if one of the adults wanted
out, perhaps it was not a good place for the child,'' she told the Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from Elian's family in Cuba or from the
Cuban government. O'Laughlin has been maligned by Cuban media since saying Elian
should stay with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   When O'Laughlin first told reporters she had changed her mind about
remaining neutral, she said she believed Elian had bonded with his 21-year-old
cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. She also said she sensed fear emanating from the
grandmothers, which she believed was caused by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is currently staying with relatives in Miami. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his return to Cuba and to his
father, but Elian's U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami judge will hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court has
jurisdiction in the case.

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina, including his visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs a ``conservative who will not yield to
the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is Mr. King suggesting I have an anti-Catholic bias because I went to a
university,'' Bush asked at one stop. ``I go to universities all the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So with all due respect to Congressman King, he can make any decision he
wants to make, but he should not ascribe anything to my heart because my record
is a lot different from what he thinks it might be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, recently coverted
to Catholicism after being married a Catholic woman for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Detroit, he jabbed at McCain, saying voters would pick a leader
like himself who is talking about education reforms and strengthening the
military over ``somebody who's trying to cast aspersions on his opponent. I
suspect they're going to pick like they did in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier appearance, he continued to emphasize the positive. ``I'm
going to continue to talk about how to bring our country together. I'm going to
talk about a better tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and several aides also took issue with McCain's concession speech
Saturday night in which he said the campaign was a choice ``between experience
and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the America voters, the people in Michigan, are going to have to
judge how each of us reacts,'' Bush said. ``Now they've had a chance to see each
of us react to victory and each of us react to defat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also underscored a theme he had used in South Carolina, that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. His remarks had a distinctly Michigan
cast as he cited the example of Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat and lawyer for
suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian, who Bush said had been ``making noises'' about
voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans should say to him, 'You're not going to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said of Fieger.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
McCain questioned Bush's integrity, comparing him to President Clinton, in an ad
that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush vetoed the original HMO bill because
it gave a blanket exemption for the state's largest HMOs and that he
subsequently issued patients' rights regulations treating all the same. He said
the governor allowed the second bill to become law without his signature as a
way of signaling trial lawyers not to abuse a provision that allows HMOs to be
sued after an independent review.
</P>
<P>
	   As to spending, Fleischer said spending increased only 2 percent under Bush
when adjusted for inflation and a growing population. He added that Bush cut the
rate of spending growth in half -- again adjusted for inflation and
demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his message
further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the guy with
the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''

<HEADLINE> GM, Ford Interested in Daewoo  </HEADLINE>
    By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- For most of the 1990s, the Daewoo conglomerate
spread its wings, opening factories in Asia, the Middle East and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   The rapid expansion fit with the company's name -- "big universe" in Korean.
But then Asia's economic crisis hit, Daewoo's sales plunged and it was crushed
by a mountain of debt, leading some English-speaking Koreans to dub it
"Dae-woe."
</P>
<P>
	   Now the struggling conglomerate is being broken up by its creditors, and
potential buyers are paying particular attention to Daewoo's automotive
operation and its access to Asia's markets, which are starting to recover from
their slump.
</P>
<P>
	   "These markets are going to grow. They're good opportunities if you run your
business well. We need to get position in these markets," G. Richard Wagoner
Jr., president and CEO designate of General Motors Corp., told reporters
recently.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to recover at least some of the $82 billion owed by the
conglomerate, banks are planning to auction off Daewoo's 22 affiliates, which
produce cars, trucks, ships, textiles and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo Motor, South Korea's second biggest automaker and the main engine for
the conglomerate's global expansion, was put on the block last week.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, which already has a foothold in Asia with partial ownership of Subaru,
Isuzu and Suzuki, confirmed it would bid. Ford Motor Co., which controls Mazda's
operations, is considering the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
	   South Korean media said DaimlerChrysler, Fiat and Volkswagen also were
interested, and Hyundai Motor, which has 70 percent of the South Korean car
market with its sister Kia Motor, expressed interest in finding a foreign
partner to make a joint bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford CEO Jac Nasser, in a meeting with journalists before the banks formally
solicited bids, said his company would take a serious look at Daewoo, but would
not buy just to block GM.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not motivated to any great extent by what our competitors do. I
certainly wouldn't try to fit into our strategy an action that's a spoiler
action," Nasser said. "The questions are: 'Is the business equation right? Are
the cultures right?"'
</P>
<P>
	   If Ford won the bidding for Daewoo, it could challenge GM for world
leadership in automaking. GM now sells more than 8 million vehicles around the
world each year, while Ford's sales are just under 7 million. Daewoo Motor's 17
factories produced 758,500 cars and trucks in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   On the surface, Daewoo Motor doesn't seem a good buy -- its debt stands at
$16.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   But acquiring it would give access to the closed auto market in South Korea,
where buying a domestic car is often synonymous with patriotism. Only about
2,300 imported cars were among the 910,000 automobiles bought here last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Daewoo assembly lines on South Korea's west coast also are the country's
most modern and cost-efficient, and would provide a foreign owner with a
stepping stone into China's big market.
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo Motor has factories in China, too, and a dozen other countries,
including India, Vietnam, Iran, Uzbekistan, Poland and Romania. It sold 187,039
cars and trucks in Poland last year, surpassing Fiat to become the No. 1
carmaker there.
</P>
<P>
	   The dismantling of the Daewoo conglomerate marks a shift for South Korea, a
poor agrarian country that developed one of the world's biggest economies by
nurturing a few core industries with cheap credit and protection against foreign
competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Those policies encouraged Daewoo on its fateful overexpansion into
developing countries and former communist states, paying for it mostly with
borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
	   The corporate empire all but collapsed after Asia's currency crisis began in
July 1997, causing slides in consumer buying across the region and leaving
Daewoo short of cash to pay off short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
	   Creditor banks say they will select one or two bidders for Daewoo Motor by
May and hope to close a deal two to three months later.

	   Whatever the outcome, South Korea's car market is being opened up to foreign
participation. The French carmaker Renault already is negotiating to take over
Samsung Motors, which is in court receivership, and President Kim Dae-jung says
foreign investment is the only way to sustain the economy's rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Many consumers are welcoming the changes, hoping domestic automakers will be
pressured into bringing prices down and improving their products.

	   "Now it's time for them to face and survive the real competition, and for us
to have new choices," said Kim Bae-ho, one of Seoul's 70,000 taxi drivers.

Republican Race Heads to Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The race for the Republican presidential
nomination quickened as Arizona Sen. John McCain and George W. Bush moved their
campaigns to Michigan in order to ready for Tuesday's primary. Bush strategists
were hoping South Carolina would give their man the momentum. McCain countered
with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who had supported Bush but
said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South Carolina. One poll, taken
before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up.

Barak Plans Peace Framework by May
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced today that
Israel and the Palestinians will likely reach a framework for a final peace
treaty in May, three months after the original deadline. Such an agreement would
ultimately dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, a senior minister in
Barak's Cabinet said, the latest sign that the government is preparing its
public for uprooting settlements. The agreement was to have been reached last
week, but negotiations are stalled over the location of an interim withdrawal
from the West Bank. In addition to settlements, the accord is to tackle tough
issues like the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed today with the Federal Election Commission. Meanwhile, Sen. John
McCain outraised George W. Bush last month, even as the Texas governor set
records for total fund-raising and spending. And McCain continued to narrow the
financial gap between himself and Bush in February, at least in advance of
Saturday's South Carolina primary in which he was soundly defeated by Bush.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The desert nation of Mozambique, still recovering

heavy rains and high winds, the South African Weather Bureau in Pretoria said
Sunday. It was uncertain when the system would hit land. Crews from South
African Defense Forces, in Mozambique to aid the rescue effort, have saved about
3,000 people from trees, rooftops and the water in the past week, officials

Grim Fate Awaits Earth Far in Future
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Earth is destined to dry up, burn up or freeze,
scientists studying the planet's ultimate fate say. Don't worry about making
final plans just yet: These catastrophic scenarios are at least 500 million
years into the future. James F. Kasting, professor of geosciences at
Pennsylvania State University said the sun gradually is getting brighter and
hotter. Eventually it will raise the Earth's temperature. At that temperature,
the Earth's atmosphere becomes 10 percent to 20 percent water, he said, and
water vapor rises into the stratosphere and breaks down chemically into oxygen
and hydrogen. The hydrogen escapes to space, and the water is lost.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Northeast Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
   By J.M. HIRSCH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- An avalanche on New England's highest peak smothered a
skier Sunday, one day after a different avalanche killed a skier in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   David McPhedran of Kents Hill, Maine, and a friend were skiing in an area of
Mount Washington called the Gulf of Slides when the avalanche hit about 1 p.m.
Only Aimee Reiter survived, said Col. Ron Alie of the New Hampshire Fish and
Game Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They decided to climb up one of the gullies to ski down it and caused the
avalanche, which swept them down the gully,'' Alie said. ``She was buried
waist-deep, but David was buried face down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reiter, also of Kents Hill, climbed out and uncovered McPhedran, 42, but was
unable to save him, Alie said.
</P>
<P>
	   With heavy snowfall and rough weather conditions, Mount Washington is one of
the few places in the East where avalanches are a danger. During the last
century, 126 people have died there.
</P>
<P>
	   Anna Porter, a weather observer at the Mount Washington Observatory, said
wind gusts reached 64 mph at the summit Sunday afternoon. Visibility was
one-sixteenth of a mile with blowing snow and freezing fog, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6,288-foot mountain is known as home to some of the world's worst
weather and was the site of the highest wind speed ever recorded -- 231 mph on
April 12, 1934.
</P>
<P>
	   A recorded message at the Appalachian Mountain Club on Sunday morning warned
that the avalanche danger for the mountain's Tuckerman and Huntington ravines
was high and that traveling on them was not recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   The club said the danger is due, in part, to more than a foot of snow that
fell Friday night and Saturday and to the high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, a rare avalanche in northern New York's Adirondacks killed Toma
Jacob Vracarich, 27, of Lake Placid, N.Y., and injured five other skiers. The
avalanche occurred off-trail on the northeast side of Wright Peak, on the
outskirts of Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
	   One skier in the group described seeing fracture lines opening in the snow
and then hearing a rumble as the skiers were swept down the slope.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like being strained through the woods, just like a little pinball
being pushed through the woods by a 100-mph force,'' said Rohan Roy of
Chateaugay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in Vermont posted avalanche warnings last week at Smugglers'
Notch, popular among skiers, and on Vermont 108, a state highway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my 13 years I have never seen anything like this. There are fracture
lines all over the place,'' said Sgt. Butch Patch of the Vermont Army National
Guard.

<HEADLINE> Fallen WWII British Airmen Honored  </HEADLINE>
   By KELLY KURT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOYERS, Okla. (AP) -- The strains of ``God Save the Queen'' rolled from the
southeastern Oklahoma hills Sunday in honor of a memory awakened by a group of
rural school boys and preserved by their aluminum cans.
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings of four British airmen who died when their planes crashed here
exactly 57 years ago watched solemnly as the boys unveiled their tribute -- a
granite slab ensuring the memory lives on among the forest of pines where the
planes fell.
</P>
<P>
	   A 21-gun salute, a wreath presentation by a British dignitary and the fading
of ``Taps'' brought an end to what started as an ordinary class project at
Rattan Elementary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is good,'' Rattan sixth-grader Chris Cochran said simply when the
ceremony was over.
</P>
<P>
	   After getting the suggestion from a friend at the Library of Congress,
Rattan teacher Beth Lawless asked her boys' reading classes two years ago to
research the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The class scoured old newspapers, sought out official records and made
contact oversees in their effort to find out what happened when the planes went
down Feb. 20, 1943.
</P>
<P>
	   They learned the two Royal Air Force AT6s were based in Terrell, Texas, and
were on a training mission in preparation for World War II when they crashed in
foggy weather. A third plane made a safe emergency landing in a nearby field.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's sixth graders tracked down the victims' families and collected
aluminum cans to help pay for the monument. They collected around $1,000 from
the cans and donations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You will never really know what your story development means to these
families,'' Henry Madgwick, Terrell mayor and a former RAF cadet, told them in a
trembling voice. ``We will always be very grateful to you.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pam Thomas of England made her first trip to the site where her brother,
Michael John Minty Hosier, died at age 19.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We never really knew what happened,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sight where his plane nosed into the ground is marked by a large turned
up boulder that locals call ``the natural tombstone.'' The new monument listing
the pilots' names sits next to it, about 4 feet high and a foot and a half wide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It kind of rounds it off,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   With the passage of World War II and time, the story began to fade from
local memory.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of Lawless' sixth-grade students had never heard about the crash, which
took place about 20 miles northwest of their tiny town of 250.
</P>
<P>
	   Working 45 minutes every school day, the students began the tedious process
of piecing together the story. Besides old newspaper clippings, they sought out
residents who remembered the crash, made contacts in Terrell, wrote letters and
took a field trip to see an AT6.
</P>
<P>
	   This school year, Lawless' sixth graders picked up the project and decided
to erect the monument. They went about finding and contacting the family members
of the fallen airmen. After school, they picked up the cans to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
	   British Airways donated travel to the siblings of the fallen pilots --
Hosier, Vincent Henry Cockman, Frank R.W. Frostick and Maurice Leslie Jensen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) -- Latin American and European nations hold three
days of meetings this week, sessions that are expected to bring the two regions
closer to a free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said that the European Union foreign ministers will push their
Latin counterparts to increase regional economic ties, a key element to an
eventual free trade pact.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks begin Tuesday with the EU meeting with half a dozen Central
American nations. During a meeting with Mexican officials Wednesday, the EU is
expected to urge Mexico to take on a greater political leadership role in
Central America.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU on Wednesday will discuss trade prospects with Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile -- South America's best economic performers.
</P>
<P>
	   The free trade talks face no formal deadline since their fate depends on the
evolution of global trade talks through the World Trade Organization, now at an
impasse.
</P>
<P>
	   EU efforts to forge a new ties with Latin America coincide with a U.S. bid
to craft a pan-American free trade area by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 87, 76ers 84  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRIS SHERIDAN AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Kobe Bryant held Allen Iverson scoreless in the second
half and scored his team's final six points to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to
their seventh straight win Sunday, 87-84 over the Philadelphia 76ers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal each blocked shots by Iverson in the final 3.3
seconds, contributing to his 0-for-11 second half. Bryant finished with 18
points, seven assists and five blocks, while O'Neal nearly had the second
triple-double of his career with 22 points, 16 rebounds and nine assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Glen Rice contributed 18 points for the Lakers, who improved to 4-0 on their
current six-game Eastern road trip with games upcoming against New Jersey and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lakers scored 11 of the game's final 14 points as an increasingly
frustrated Iverson kept driving the lane, shooting against double-teams and
looking for foul calls that never came.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Sixers trailing by one and the clock ticking inside 10 seconds, he
drove the right side of the lane and had a runner cleanly blocked by Bryant.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryant made two free throws with 1.7 left for a three-point cushion, and
Iverson's 3-point attempt at the buzzer was swatted away by O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
	   Theo Ratliff led Philadelphia with 20 points, Iverson had 16 and Eric Snow
10. Toni Kukoc, playing his second game with the Sixers since being acquired in
a trade with Chicago, had nine points, five rebounds and four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal, whose loone career triple-double came in 1993, had a chance for his
10th assist when he fed a wide-open Brian Shaw with 51 seconds left. But Shaw
missed an 18-footer.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Neal grabbed his 10th rebound with 4:47 remaining in the third quarter and
turned it into a three-point play to give Los Angeles a 60-57 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc then hit a runner, fed Tyrone Hill for a give-and-go layup and hit a
pull-up jumper as part of a 7-0 run that put Philadelphia ahead 66-63, but he
then missed a layup and airballed a 3-pointer as the Lakers closed the quarter
with a 5-0 run to take a 68-66 lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratliff scored Philadelphia's first six points of the fourth quarter and 10
of the Sixers' first 13, and a follow slam by Hill gave the Sixers an 81-76 lead
with 4:10 left.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Lakers scored the next nine points -- including four from O'Neal on
a put back and a dunk and four from Bryant on a pair of closely contested
jumpers, to take an 85-81 lead into the final minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Snow hit a 3-pointer with 35 seconds left to make it a one-point game. After
A.C. Green misfired on a jumper with 11 seconds left, Iverson had his drive
rejected by Bryant.
</P>
<P>
	   Kukoc had four turnovers and just five points at halftime, with the Sixers'
offensive flow often coming to a halt when he had the ball in his hands.
</P>
<P>
	   He did hit a 3-pointer off a pass from Iverson with 1:52 left before
halftime to tie it at 39-all, but the Lakers were up 48-44 at intermission
behind 13 points from Rice on 5-for-6 shooting and 10 points, nine rebounds and
seven assists from O'Neal.

<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN DIEGO (AP) -- In a major upset, Canada eliminated Mexico from the
CONCACAF Gold Cup, winning their quarterfinal 2-1 Sunday when Richard Hastings
scored in the third minute of overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   Mexico, which won the previous three editions of the tournament in 1993,
1996 and 1998, went ahead in the 35th minute when Ramon Ramirez split the
defence and beat goalkeeper Craig Forrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada, which hasn't even qualified for a World Cup since 1986, tied the
score in the 83rd minute on a close-range goal by Carlo Corazzin, who also
scored Canada's two goals in the first round.
</P>
<P>
	   Hastings then got the winner off a cross from Martin Nash, shooting from
near the left corner of the penalty area. Nash is the younger brother of Dallas
Mavericks guard Steve Nash.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada, which advanced out of the first round by winning a coin flip with
South Korea, extended its unbeaten streak to nine games. In 20 previous games
against Mexico, Canada had a 2-13-5 record, getting outscored 51-12.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada had played Mexico twice before in the Gold Cup, losing 8-0 in 1993
and 3-1 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   In the semifinals, Peru plays Colombia on Wednesday at San Diego and Canada
plays Trinidad and Tobago on Thursday at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   The tournament, played biennially, is the championship of soccer's North and
Central American and Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
	   In the opener of the doubleheader, Mickey Trotman scored in the 11th minute
of overtime to lift Trinidad and Tobago over Costa Rica 2-1 despite the absence
of star forward Dwight Yorke.
</P>
<P>
	   William Sunsig scored for Costa Rica with one minute left in regulation.
Following a corner kick, Sunsig put a bouncing shot past goalkeeper Clayton Ince
from the top of the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
	   Trotman got the game-winning on a shot from the top of the penalty area that
beat goalkeeper Hermido Barrantes. Arnold Dwarika had scored Trinidad's first
goal in the 26th minute.
</P>
<P>
	   Yorke, who had a goal and two assists in Tuesday's 4-2 win over Guatemala,
went back to England to play in Manchester United's 1-0 win over Leeds on Sunday
in the Premier League.

<HEADLINE> Bucs Hire Steckel As OC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Former Minnesota Vikings coach Les Steckel, an assistant
with the Tennessee franchise the past five seasons, was the surprise choice
Sunday night as the new offensive coordinator of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians, who has played a major role in
the development of Peyton Manning, was believed to be the frontrunner to succeed
Mike Shula, who was fired after the Bucs failed to score a touchdown in an 11-6
loss to the St. Louis in the NFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   Steckel emerged as a candidate for the position late in the search,
interviewing after Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy talked to Arians, Denver Broncos
receivers coach Mike Heimerdinger, Carolina running backs coach Chick Harris and
Bucs quarterbacks coach Clyde Christensen about the job.
</P>
<P>
	   The 53-year-old assistant was the Oilers' offensive coordinator the past
three seasons and helped Tennessee reach the Super Bowl with an offensive style
much like the run-oriented Bucs used under Shula.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Tampa Bay ranked 30th in passing and 28th overall, Steckel's
offense finished 13th and averaged 4.7 yards per carry rushing. The Titans
averaged 24.5 points -- up from 20.6 the year before -- en route to compiling a
13-3 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
	   Steckel, then 37, followed Bud Grant as coach of the Vikings in 1984 and
compiled a 3-13 record in his only season as a head coach. During 17 seasons as
a pro assistant, he has worked for the 49ers, Vikings, Patriots, Broncos, in
addition to the Oilers/Titans, who hired him as receivers coach in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Kirk Triplett Wins Nissan Open  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- After 11 years of grinding on the PGA Tour, after 266
tournaments wondering whether this would finally be his week to win, Kirk
Triplett anticipated a wild wave of emotions and errant shots down the stretch
in the Nissan Open.
</P>
<P>
	   That's just what he got Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   His lead fluctuated between three shots and one shot in a matter of holes.
His mind drifted from a victory speech to trying to get up-and-down from the lip
of a bunker. His eyes couldn't avoid the hot pink pants worn by Jesper Parnevik.
</P>
<P>
	   "He looked like the Pepto-Bismol man," Triplett said. "That was great,
because I was feeling a little queasy."
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett survived it all, including bursts of rain that fell from gloomy
skies over Riviera Country Club, and got his first career tour victory with a
4-foot par putt on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
	   He thrust his fist high in the air and smiled wide under his bucket hat for
a victory that was a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm so thrilled," he said. "I'm relieved in a sense. It's not as good of a
career if you don't win."
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett took care of that on one of the most storied courses on tour. They
won't rename Riviera "Triplett's Alley," but the 37-year-old player who once
toiled on the "minniest of mini-tours" must have felt like Ben Hogan for at
least a day.
</P>
<P>
	   With birdies on five of the first 10 holes to build a lead he refused to
give away, Triplett closed with a 4-under 67 for a 272 total and earned $558,000
-- more than he earned in all but two previous seasons on tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik birdied two of the last three holes for a 68 that left him one
stroke behind. Robin Freeman, who provided the stiffest challenge to Triplett
until a three-putt bogey on the 17th, was another stroke back after a 68.
</P>
<P>
	   A week after the end of The Streak, Tiger Woods failed to record a top-10
finish in a stroke-play tournament for the first time since he tied for 18th in
the MCI Classic on April 18, a stretch of 13 PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods got within two shots of the lead at one point early in the round, but
closed with a 1-over 72 and finished in a tie for 19th. It was only the fifth
time in his last 36 rounds on the PGA Tour that he failed to break par, dating
to the British Open at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a bad round," Woods said. "I didn't really have it going this
entire week. If I would have putted a little better, I would have been right
there. But you can't have everything."
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett wasn't asking for everything, just a victory to show for his labor
-- on mini-tours, in Australia, Asia, Canada and anywhere else he could make a
buck.
</P>
<P>
	   Even his first win didn't come easily.
</P>
<P>
	   With a two-stroke lead going to the 18th, he hit his drive into the left
rough on the famed, 451-yard closing hole and had to lay up 61 yards short of
the pin. Parnevik applied even more heat by lacing his approach into 25 feet
below the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew it was going to be rocky coming in, and it was," Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, he answered the challenge with a lofted chip that settled 4 feet
behind the hole, which must have looked like a mile after Parnevik rammed home
his birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if the putt got longer," Triplett said, "but the hole sure got
smaller."
</P>
<P>
	   Parnevik found himself cheering Triplett on, despite another voice in his
head reminding him that a miss would result in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "Anyone who knows him, he's just a nice guy," Parnevik said. "This must be a
huge relief. I'm very happy for him."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory comes one week too late for Triplett, who was No. 66 in the
world ranking and just missed getting in the Match Play Championship that starts
Wednesday at La Costa.
</P>
<P>
	   But he should move up high enough to crack the top 50 and stay there for two
weeks, which would bring him only his second Masters invitation.
</P>
<P>
	   David Sutherland, who took a one-stroke lead into the final round with
nearly three dozen players jammed behind him, struggled from the start and
finished with a 74. No one else managed to make a charge, a combination of rain,
swirling winds and greens that gave everyone fits all week.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods and David Duval played in the same group for the first time in a final
round and both were poised to make a run, starting the gloomy day only three
strokes out of the lead.
</P>
<P>
	   It was hardly the performance expected out of the top two players in the
world, particularly from Woods, whose streak of six straight tour victories
ended last week in a runner-up finish to Phil Mickelson in the Buick
Invitational.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods made a 12-foot birdie putt on the third hole and followed that with a
35-footer that banged into the back of the cup, only to lip out and send Woods
to his knees in anguish. He was finally undone by three straight bogeys,
starting on No. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval had a 74.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both of us didn't play too well," Woods said. "But maybe it will be under
different circumstance, preferable next week on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
	   Triplett won't be at La Costa, but a a far greater reward awaits the first
weekend in April -- another trip to Augusta National.

<HEADLINE> Clinton comes out in favor of Northeast home heating oil reserve  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Calling on New Yorkers to "reject the politics of
division, revenge and retribution," Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
asked more than 1,000 blacks and Hispanics on Sunday to support her campaign.
<P>
	   Without mentioning her Republican rival, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, by name, Clinton warned against the politics of "insulting people and
demeaning people."
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to be the kind of leader who lifts people up, not pushes them down,"
an impassioned Clinton told the annual dinner hosted by the state Legislature's
Black and Puerto Rican Caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   "This must be one New York," the first lady said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, Clinton called for New York and the Northeast to have
its own home heating oil reserve to help blunt any future shortages or the high
prices New Yorkers face now.
</P>
<P>
	   "We in the Northeast ... are the most reliant on home heating oil and
therefore pay the highest prices when we have cold snaps," said the Senate
candidate who just moved to New York in January as the coldest weather of the
winter hit. "We'd be able to dip into that reserve without raising the strategic
issues that are raised by going to the reserve that we already have."
</P>
<P>
	   A coalition of Northeastern lawmakers, including Democrats and Republicans,
have already called for creation of such a regional reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   With OPEC countries limiting production, the cost of home heating oil in New
York has risen from a statewide average of 90.6 cents a gallon in February of
last year to $2.01 a gallon as of last week. The Northeast has been hardest hit
by the price increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Giuliani has been lambasting President Clinton for refusing to
dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves to ease the price crunch on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration says the reserves are only for emergencies and
are not intended as a way to affect market price.
</P>
<P>
	   However, candidate Clinton said she and the president know what New Yorkers
are going through.
</P>
<P>
	   "I take this issue very personally as does the president," said Clinton, who
recently moved into the couple's $1.7 million home in Chappaqua in Westchester
County. "Now that we are homeowners here in New York, our house is heated by
heating oil and it is extremely expensive."
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton noted that she and her husband are better able to afford the high
oil prices than most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   For the short term, Clinton said New York's congressional delegation should
support President Clinton's call for $600 million in emergency assistance to
help poor people meet heating-oil costs. The first lady also said she favored
dipping into the strategic reserves with a swap system under which U.S. oil
companies would be able to borrow from the stockpile and make larger donations
back to it later.
</P>
<P>
	   That way, "they would not run into some of the legal and security issues,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said she would also support a bill by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
that would require home heating oil companies to keep a larger reserve of their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had a mild winter last year, so that the oil companies did not stockpile
enough of an inventory," she said. "So when OPEC began to raise prices, they had
to scramble on the open market and pay more."
</P>
<P>
	   In a sign of how serious the situation is in New York, the Pataki
administration last week used a waiver to allow the use of high-sulfur heating
oil at New York City municipal facilities. Sulfur levels in heating oil are
tightly regulated by state environmental regulations to protect air quality in
the metropolitan area. Connecticut and New Hampshire have used sulfur waivers
similar to New York's during the heating oil crunch, the Pataki administration
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton also called on the OPEC counties to increase oil production.
</P>
<P>
	   That would"enable us to cut prices so that we wouldn't face either higher
prices in the short term in the home heating oil or longer term in gasoline
prices," she said.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Arrives in Reds Camp  </HEADLINE>
    By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The morning workout was long over and nearly all of the Cincinnati Reds had
gone. And then, for the first time, Ken Griffey Jr. came walking into the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey slipped unannounced into the Reds' spring training complex Sunday to
unpack his things and start the next phase of his baseball career, a day before
his formal introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't even know what I'm supposed to wear,'' he said in Sarasota, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   On the floor was a box of equipment from Seattle; a blue Mariners cap poked
out from a jumble of cleats. He picked through the box to see what would go with
his new ensemble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a little different,'' he said. ``Everything I've had for the last
couple of years is blue, and now it's red.''
</P>
<P>
	   A red No. 30 jersey already was hanging in one of Griffey's two dressing
cubicles. A six-inch stack of mail was piled in one corner, soon to be towered
over by boxes of shoes and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Outfielder Michael Tucker was the only teammate in the clubhouse Griffey
drove in with his wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's definitely exciting,'' said first baseman Sean Casey, whose cubicle
is next to Griffey's. ``It's going to be awesome to see him play every day.
That's going to be awesome. It's also going to be nice to get to know him as a
person. I've heard good things about him.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Griffey will answer questions at Ed Smith Stadium -- he'll sit
atop the same dugout where Michael Jordan held a news conference with the
Chicago White Sox in 1994. It was not certain, however, when Junior would work
out for the first time with the Reds
</P>
<P>
	   Griffey was sent from Seattle to Cincinnati in a 4-for-1 trade Feb. 10.
Asked if it has sunk in yet that he's part of his hometown team, Griffey thought
for a second and said, ``Yeah and no. No, because I haven't run out on the field
yet. Yeah, because I know where I'm going to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   A little farther south in Fort Myers, Fla., Boston ace Pedro Martinez missed
the first spring training workout for the second straight year. For the second
straight year, Red Sox manager Jimy Williams shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a big deal,'' Williams said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   So while 24 pitchers, including Pedro's brother, Ramon, hustled on a hot day
fielding grounders and covering first base during a two-hour practice,
baseball's best pitcher was in his native Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Sox voluntary reporting date for pitchers and catchers was Saturday,
with the first workout Sunday. But the mandatory reporting date under the
collective bargaining agreement is March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The AL Cy Young winner had personal business to take care of, but will be in
camp Monday, Ramon said. Williams said he learned Saturday night that Pedro
wouldn't report Sunday but hadn't spoken with the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason for his absence was unclear. Williams said he'd let Pedro discuss
it when he arrives. But Sunday was Pedro's father's birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Pedro reported two days after the reporting date for pitchers and
catchers so he could be home for his father's birthday. Then, he went out and
had one of the best seasons of any pitcher in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Montreal Expos, meanwhile, want to know whether pitcher Hideki Irabu is
having a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   Irabu, acquired in the offseason from the New York Yankees, may have elbow
chips in his right elbow and could need arthroscopic surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   Irabu had an MRI Saturday. The Expos said Sunday the test indicated the
possibility of a bone chip or chips, but none could actually be seen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be a bone chip in there, maybe not,'' Irabu said through his
interpreter. ``They haven't found anything. Why open it up if there's nothing
there?''
</P>
<P>
	   Said Expos general manager Jim Beattie: ``He could pitch tomorrow, but not
if it's a risk to himself. We may stay concerned all season. He could have
arthroscopic surgery at the end of the year, maybe sooner, maybe never.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Tucson, Ariz., Diamondbacks reliever Dan Plesac says his 15th major
league season almost certainly will be his last.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would take a minor miracle'' to bring him back, he said after a
workout. ``I can walk away with my head held high. There aren't very many guys
who can say they've played 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona manager Buck Showalter remains unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't hold him to that,'' Showalter said. ``We'll see what the end of
the year brings us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Plesac, who just turned 38, was traded from Toronto to Arizona last season.
In 34 appearances with the Diamondbacks, the lefty was 2-1 with a 3.32 ERA.

Bush, McCain Campaign in Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Republican Presidential hopefuls Arizona Senator
John McCain and Texas Governor George W. Bush hoped to sway voters their way
today as they campaigned through Michigan days before the presidential primary.
Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the momentum.
McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who had
supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina, including his visit to Bob Jones University. One poll, taken before
South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up.

Nun: Cuban Grandma Wanted To Defect
</SUBHEAD>

	   MIAMI (AP) -- A nun involved in a meeting between Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban grandmothers decided the 6-year-old should remain in the United States
after she was told one of the grandmothers wanted to defect, her spokeswoman
said today. After meeting with the grandmothers last month at her home in Miami
Beach, Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, said she was
abandoning her neutral stance. There was no immediate reaction from Elian's
family in Cuba or from the Cuban government. O'Laughlin has been maligned by
Cuban media since saying Elian should stay with his relatives in Miami.

Barak Plans Peace Framework by May
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced today that
Israel and the Palestinians will likely reach a framework for a final peace
treaty in May, three months after the original deadline. Such an agreement would
ultimately dismantle Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, a senior minister in
Barak's Cabinet said, the latest sign that the government is preparing its
public for uprooting settlements. The agreement was to have been reached last
week, but negotiations are stalled over the location of an interim withdrawal
from the West Bank. In addition to settlements, the accord is to tackle tough
issues like the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

	   MOUNT WASHINGTON, N.H. (AP) -- An avalanche on New England's highest peak
left at least one person dead today, one day after another avalanche killed a
skier in New York. A state police dispatcher confirmed that at least one person
had been killed on Mount Washington. No other details were immediately
available, and officials were on their way to the scene late today. With heavy
snowfall and rough weather conditions, Mount Washington is one of the few places
in the East where avalanches are a danger. During the last century, 126 people

protest in the Hidalgo state town of Tepatepec, 50 miles north of Mexico City,
the reports said. Protesters also burned more than a dozen police cars. The
latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school early

Grim Fate Awaits Earth Far in Future
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Earth is destined to dry up, burn up or freeze,
scientists studying the planet's ultimate fate say. Don't worry about making
final plans just yet: These catastrophic scenarios are at least 500 million
years into the future. James F. Kasting, professor of geosciences at
Pennsylvania State University said the sun gradually is getting brighter and
hotter. Eventually it will raise the Earth's temperature. At that temperature,
the Earth's atmosphere becomes 10 percent to 20 percent water, he said, and
water vapor rises into the stratosphere and breaks down chemically into oxygen
and hydrogen. The hydrogen escapes to space, and the water is lost.

   By The Associated Press Canada's First Indo-Canadian Premier Elected 
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- British Columbia Attorney General Ujjal
Dosanjh's first ballot win Sunday at the NDP convention will make him Canada's
first Indo-Canadian premier.
</P>
<P>
	   A beaming Dosanjh, wearing a white rose in his lapel, took the platform and
hugged the other candidates, including Agriculture Minister Corky Evans, his
closest competitor, who smiled behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh, 52, who is expected to be sworn in as premier this week, quickly
made it plain a provincial election was not his first order of business.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have until June of 2001 to deal with that matter,'' he said in his
first scrum as premier-elect.
</P>
<P>
	   He also acknowledged the NDP's ``shortcomings'' and promised to provide
government ``you can respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dosanjh, who got 769 votes to Evans's 549, said he wants a throne speech and
a new budget delivered by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadership convention was forced after the resignation of former premier
Glen Clark, who stepped down after becoming embroiled in a casino gambling
scandal.

Gasoline Spill on Ferry To Be Investigated
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A semi-trailer truck ruptured a tank and
spilled its cargo of gasoline onto the deck of a Gulf Island ferry and into the
ocean Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill of 5,400 litres is considered major, said Betty Nicholson, a
spokeswoman for British Columbia Ferries.
</P>
<P>
	   The coast guard was called to the scene at Sturdies Bay on Galiano Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The semi-trailer was traveling on a dangerous cargo ferry, which is not part
of the regular passenger and car service.
</P>
<P>
	   The cleanup was completed by Sunday afternoon, said Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
	   British Columbia Ferries is working with Environment Canada, the Department
of Fisheries and Oceans and the provincial Ministry of Environment to assess the
spill's impact on fish and wildlife, said Nicholson.

Farm Aid Advocate Praised

<P>
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- He's an unlikely Canadian hero riding a wave of
farm discontent across the country at 20 kilometers per hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Just 10 years ago, Nick Parsons was plowing fields in southern England -- an
ocean away from the land that would soon become his adopted home.

	   Today, the determined little man with the salt-and-pepper beard, baseball
cap, thick-rimmed glasses and well-worn coveralls is inching his big red combine
toward Ottawa on a one-man crusade to save Canada's family farms.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 1, Parsons fired up his massive harvester -- the Prairie Belle --
and set out from his farm in Dawson Creek, British Columbia
</P>
<P>
	   He expects to be in the nation's capital by mid-March where he hopes to make
a personal plea to Prime Minister Jean Chretien for aid on behalf of western
grain farmers struggling with rock-bottom commodity prices.

Sunshine Girl Image Questioned
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Should she stay or should she go?
</P>
<P>
	   That's the question being asked these days about the Sun newspaper chain's
popular Sunshine Girl amid a class-action lawsuit alleging a veteran
photographer behaved improperly while clicking pictures of his subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate about the future of the feature which shows scantily dressed
women has intensified in light of the lawsuit, insiders say.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement of claim was filed Friday in an Ontario court against the Sun
Media Corp., which owns papers in Toronto, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Edmonton and
Calgary.
</P>
<P>
	   The $20-million lawsuit accuses former Toronto Sun photographer Norm Betts
of ``inappropriate contact, behavior, conduct and remarks'' during photography
sessions in incidents that began in the 1970s and continued right up until 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Betts handed in his resignation shortly after the allegations came to light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are lots of people within the organization who would like to see it
removed and there are some other people who don't, but it's a corporate
decision,'' said Gary Bartlett, photo editor at the Edmonton Sun.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Knight, publisher of the Toronto Sun, has said there's no plans to put
the Sunshine Girl to pasture in light of the Betts scandal.

Navy Abandons Sound-Muffling System on Frigates
</P>
<P>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The navy is abandoning a sound-muffling system
on its high-tech frigates after nine years of headaches, newly released
documents show.
</P>
<P>
	   Tests have shown the system, which bleeds tiny air bubbles around the hull
to suppress noise, was ineffective and a nightmare to maintain.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the navy is spending $3 million on other technology to suppress
noise from the propellers and machinery. And military brass are considering
whether to pay another $31 million to coat the frigate hulls with
noise-retarding rubber tiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavily censored records from a secretive noise-evaluation team were
obtained under the Access to Information Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The frigates, designed to be stealthy hunters of submarines, proved to be
far noisier than expected when the first vessel -- HMCS Halifax -- was delivered
in June 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   The noise given off by the propellers and hull could alert enemy submarines
to a frigate's presence. It could also trigger torpedoes and mines that target
sounds.

<HEADLINE> Twins' Radke Arrives in Camp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) -- The sun had nearly set over the Gulf of Mexico by
the time Minnesota Twins pitcher Brad Radke reported Sunday to the team's
training facility without a new contract.
</P>
<P>
	   With Sunday being the deadline imposed by Radke and agent Ron Simon to reach
an agreement, his status was up in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I've got no news to report, fellas,'' Radke said as he unloaded his gear
in front of his locker. ``Today's the 20th, right? I mean a deadline's a
deadline you know, but I'm sure we'll talk sometime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As of right now I just want to get things started and keep my mind on
baseball, and that's what the deadline was for. I'm sure my teammates don't want
to be bothered with all this stuff either.''
</P>
<P>
	   The holdup involves a trade clause Radke and Simon want included after the
first year of the new deal, worth a reported $21 million over three years. The
right-hander wants to be able to demand a trade after the 2001 season, and Twins
general manager Terry Ryan and the team won't agree to that.
</P>
<P>
	   Radke, who said he didn't want to discuss specifics of the deal, did
indicate that he thought the option for a trade would be after two years. But
with his agent handling the negotiations, Radke reiterated that he didn't feel
comfortable talking specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Ron said it was after one year then it's one,'' Radke said. ``See I
don't know, so I don't want to comment on that until Ron and Terry sit down and
talk again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Radke, who was 12-14 and had a 3.75 ERA last season, has been the Twins'
opening day starter the past three seasons. He has made it clear that he wants
to be part of a winning ballclub. Whether or not that is with Minnesota, he's
content going out onto the mound and doing his job. He did say that he believes
an agreement will be reached at some point.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Contract or no contract, I just want to go out and have a good year,''
Radke said. ``Our pitching staff has gotten considerably better, I mean with the
type of year (Eric) Milton had last year. We just need to get more run support,
which every pitcher wants.''
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota will hold its first workout Monday morning. Radke and the rest of
the pitchers and catchers will practice, as will some of the position players
who have already reported.

<HEADLINE> Judge in Elian Case Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling the case of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was hospitalized Sunday and may have suffered a stroke, two of the
judge's colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
	   One colleague of U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler who has been in

Hoeveler had been taken, could not confirm the judge was there or give his

<HEADLINE> Shea Wins Gold at Goodwill Games  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE PLACID, N.Y. (AP) -- Jim Shea did it the hard way. He won gold Sunday in
men's skeleton at the Winter Goodwill Games -- without a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
	But when your grandfather is the oldest living American gold medalist from the
1932 Lake Placid Winter Olympics and the whole town is rooting for you, Shea had
what money couldn't buy and easily beat his teammate, Chris Soule.
</P>
<P>
	``The support really made a difference for me,'' said Shea, whose 89-year-old
grandfather, Jack, won two speedskating golds nearly seven decades ago and was
there at snowy Mount Van Hoevenberg to soak in the moment. ``It feels real good,
but it's bittersweet. We still don't have a sponsor.''
</P>
<P>
	Shea entered the final two runs with a lead of more than a second over Snorre
Pedersen of Norway and Soule. He won with a time of 4 minutes, 1.12 seconds,
nearly three seconds faster than Soule.
</P>
<P>
	``I got lucky,'' said Shea, who won the World Championship last season.
``Anything can happen in any race. It's up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Koshi Kazuhiro slid past Pedersen for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
	``We're strong sliders and it's great to have the heated competition,'' said
Soule, who finished second this season on the World Cup tour. ``We're just
trying to put it together. We're looking forward to 2002. That's what we're
building up to.''
</P>
<P>
	The building already has begun. The Americans found out after the race that two
Internet companies -- Ultimate Bid and MilestonesNetwork.com -- had signed on as
team sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	The race for gold in the two-man bobsled was won by Latvian star Sandis Prusis,
who finished in 3:49.13. That was 22 hundredths of a second faster than
Germany-1, piloted by Andre Lange, the current world champion in four-man.
</P>
<P>
	Brian Shimer, who crashed twice in practice earlier in the week, turned in a
gutsy performance for the United States, shaking off leg and rib injuries.
</P>
<P>
	``I feel in my heart if I was healthy we could have won this race,'' said
Shimer, who was limping noticeably. ``In the third heat I had a great run going,
went into the big Shady curve, and then my ribs just exploded (from the
pressure). It felt like somebody stuck me with a sword. I almost crashed.''
</P>
<P>
	He didn't, and collected bronze for the United States, which led the final
medal count with 34 -- 11 gold, 10 silver and 13 bronze. Canada was second with
15 medals, eight of them gold, and Germany and Norway tied for third with nine
medals.
</P>
<P>
	The most exciting race of the day was staged in the 15-kilometer cross-country
sprint relay. The American team of Justin Wadsworth of Bend, Ore., and Marcus
Nash edged Brynjar Skjaerli and Ola Rygg of Norway for the gold.
</P>
<P>
	The teletimer camera at the finish pegged the margin of victory at eight
thousandths of a second -- about the tip of Nash's boot.
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal at the beginning of the race was to just stay in contact with the
leaders,'' said Nash. ``It's a five-lap race for each man, so there's no point
in leading if you're going to lose it at the end.
</P>
<P>
	Nash went out in third on the last lap and took the lead before the final
uphill, but as he approached the finish line he didn't realize he suddenly had a
race on his hands.
</P>
<P>
	``I thought once I rounded the final bend the race was over,'' Nash said. ``But
for some reason I chose the middle lane instead of the shortest route to the
finish and he took advantage of that.
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `OK, I'm not going to lose it here.' I dug a little deeper.
Fortunately, I'm pretty flexible. I was able to outstretch him.''
</P>
<P>
	Rygg tried in vain to reach ahead with his right foot and stumbled just past
the finish line as the American twosome won despite a fall by Wadsworth on the
seventh lap.
</P>
<P>
	The final day was not without controversy. In the men's snowboard cross at
Whiteface Mountain, a faulty starting gate left Ryan Neptune stuck at the top as
his American teammate Seth Wescott sped to an easy victory.
</P>
<P>
	Neptune protested and the race jury upheld it, nullifying Wescott's win. In the
rerun, Neptune accidentally took out Wescott early in the race and Scott Gaffney
of Canada won gold.
</P>
<P>
	``That's the first time we've had that happen,'' said a disappointed Wescott,
who finished fourth. ``Usually they're on it and the stuff's done days ahead of
time. It (the gate) just didn't have time to harden in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
	American Ann Battelle, beaten Saturday by Norwegian Kari Traa for the gold in
women's moguls, came back to win the dual moguls. After Traa fell in the
semifinals, Battelle easily defeated Aiko Uemura for the gold when the Japanese
star caught a ski tip and missed her second jump on the steep Whiteface Mountain
course.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved,'' said Battelle, of nearby Williston, Vt. ``It's great to be
able to pull it out. I saw Aiko mess up at the bottom. If you try to slow up,
you're not going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
	The only injuries requiring hospitalization in the four days of competition
occurred in separate accidents Sunday and involved two Canadians.
</P>
<P>
	At Mount Van Hoevenberg, bobsledder Pierre Lueders crashed on his third run in
the two-man, and snowboarder Kim Dunn of Calgary suffered a concussion when she
fell during training for the cross event at Whiteface Mountain. Both athletes
were taken to Saranac Lake for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	Dunn underwent a CAT scan and was in stable condition, according to Dr. William
Smith. Precautionary X-rays were done on Lueders, who was pinned under his sled
after it flipped near the bottom of the course.

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina, including his visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs a ``conservative who will not yield to
the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is Mr. King suggesting I have an anti-Catholic bias because I went to a
university,'' Bush asked at one stop. ``I go to universities all the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So with all due respect to Congressman King, he can make any decision he
wants to make, but he should not ascribe anything to my heart because my record
is a lot different from what he thinks it might be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, recently coverted
to Catholicism after being married a Catholic woman for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Detroit, he jabbed at McCain, saying voters would pick a leader
like himself who is talking about education reforms and strengthening the
military over ``somebody who's trying to cast aspersions on his opponent. I
suspect they're going to pick like they did in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier appearance, he continued to emphasize the positive. ``I'm
going to continue to talk about how to bring our country together. I'm going to
talk about a better tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and several aides also took issue with McCain's concession speech
Saturday night in which he said the campaign was a choice ``between experience
and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the America voters, the people in Michigan, are going to have to
judge how each of us reacts,'' Bush said. ``Now they've had a chance to see each
of us react to victory and each of us react to defat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also underscored a theme he had used in South Carolina, that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. His remarks had a distinctly Michigan
cast as he cited the example of Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat and lawyer for
suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian, who Bush said had been ``making noises'' about
voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans should say to him, 'You're not going to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said of Fieger.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
McCain questioned Bush's integrity, comparing him to President Clinton, in an ad
that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush vetoed the original HMO bill because
it gave a blanket exemption for the state's largest HMOs and that he
subsequently issued patients' rights regulations treating all the same. He said
the governor allowed the second bill to become law without his signature as a
way of signaling trial lawyers not to abuse a provision that allows HMOs to be
sued after an independent review.
</P>
<P>
	   As to spending, Fleischer said spending increased only 2 percent under Bush
when adjusted for inflation and a growing population. He added that Bush cut the
rate of spending growth in half -- again adjusted for inflation and
demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his message
further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the guy with
the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Judge in Elian Case Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA WALEWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling the case of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was hospitalized Sunday and may have suffered a stroke, two of the
judge's colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
	   One colleague of U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler who has been in
touch with Hoeveler's family said the situation was not as grave as it initially
appeared. Both colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman at Doctors' Hospital of Coral Gables, where colleagues said
Hoeveler had been taken, could not confirm the judge was there or give his
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge had been scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the
court has jurisdiction in Elian's case. The boy is at the center of a custody
battle involving his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba, who wants him
returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said Sunday night that he saw no
reason why the hearing should be postponed. Davis would not elaborate, but
according to attorneys and federal judges, another judge could step in to hear
the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, who also presided over the trial of former Panamanian dictator
Manuel Noriega, was assigned the Elian case after Judge James Lawrence King
withdrew from the case last month.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign OT Tony Jones  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Offensive tackle Tony Jones and the Denver Broncos have
finalized terms on a seven-year contract extension worth $34.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm very thrilled," Jones told the Rocky Mountain News on Saturday. "I'm
glad to finish my career there, glad the organization put its trust in me to
give me that kind of deal."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' future with the Broncos was uncertain as the franchise wrestles with
the salary cap. Shannon Sharpe signed with Baltimore last week after failing to
reach an agreement with Denver, while defensive ends Neil Smith and Alfred
Williams were cut.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones was due a $1.5 million roster bonus last week as part of his old
contract, which was in its last year. The new agreement will give the Broncos
some room under the salary cap, and Jones will get a signing bonus spread over
the length of the contract.
</P>
<P>
	   "I helped their cap situation. They gave me the money I wanted," Jones said.
"It puts me right up there with the other top left tackles in the league and I
feel I'm one of the best."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones, 33, was acquired from Baltimore in 1997. He is entering his 13th year
in the NFL.

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Court N.Y. Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are ``morally blind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' Gore said, his
reference to Saturday's GOP primary drawing laughter from the audience at the
Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the flag, ``that accumulated heritage of injustice,'' he said the
Republican reaction reminded him of those who say racism is gone and that
America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds --
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, campaigning together for the first time this year
in New York where Clinton is making history as the first first lady to seek
public office, had warm words for each other, and a few hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She stands for the best values of New York state,'' Gore said of Clinton,
who is pitted against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race.
``Her voice will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up
for her.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Clinton said she was ``just
honored to help him in any way that I can. I was grateful for the chance to
appear with him because I don't get to see him so often now that he's all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used to work together very closely on a lot of issues ... I'm very fond
of him personally as well as very supportive of him as our next president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored
by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before Gore
and Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the Apollo
Theatre in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   After some handshaking, Gore took off for New York City where he was meeting
with the editorial board of The Amsterdam News, a major black-oriented
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference brings together hundreds of the state's top black and
Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York
state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998
election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
``for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those attending the service appeared surprised by Gore's address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the first time I've seen Gore really speak with some passion,''
said Joseph Rhodes III, 47, of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Bucs Hire Steckel As OC  </HEADLINE>
    By FRED GOODALL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are changing offenses, but not
philosophies.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Tony Dungy still wants a run-oriented, ball-control attack and made
former Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Les Steckel the surprise choice
Sunday night to install a system that could wind up reminding fans a lot of the
one the Bucs are dropping.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know how to throw the football," said Steckel, the one-time coach of the
Minnesota Vikings who spent the past five seasons an assistant with the Oilers
and Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I believe also that we're confident in knowing the common denominator
of football is it's a tough, physical game. We're going to make sure we continue
to do just that."
</P>
<P>
	   Indianapolis quarterbacks coach Bruce Arians, who has played a major role in
the development of Peyton Manning, had been believed to be the frontrunner to
succeed Mike Shula, who was fired as offensive coordinator after the Bucs failed
to score a touchdown in an 11-6 loss to the St. Louis in the NFC championship
game.
</P>
<P>
	   Steckel, 53, emerged as a candidate late in the search, interviewing after
Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy talked to Arians, Denver Broncos receivers coach Mike
Heimerdinger, Carolina running backs coach Chick Harris and Bucs quarterbacks
coach Clyde Christensen about the job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It took a while, but we wanted to make sure we got the right person," Dungy
said, adding that he and Steckel think alike on and off the field, though
they've never worked with one another.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do have a lot of the same philosophies," the coach said, adding that he
was also attracted to Steckel's track record of working with young quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
	   Steckel was the Oilers' offensive coordinator the past three seasons and
helped Tennessee reach the Super Bowl with an offensive style much like the
run-oriented Bucs used under Shula.
</P>
<P>
	   But while Tampa Bay ranked 30th in passing and 28th overall, Steckel's
offense finished 13th and averaged 4.7 yards per carry rushing. The Titans
averaged 24.5 points -- up from 20.6 the year before -- en route to compiling a
13-3 regular-season record.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not about statistics, it's not about style. It's about winning," Dungy
said. "If you look at his track record, the places he's been they've taken care
of the ball and been very efficient."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs failed to score an offensive touchdown in five games last season,
including the NFC title game in which the Rams scored a late touchdown to
advance to the Super Bowl, where St. Louis defeated Tennessee 23-16.
</P>
<P>
	   Eddie George ran for 1,304 yards and Steve McNair and Neil O'Donnell threw
23 touchdown passes in Steckel's offense, which was 13th in the NFL in rushing
and tied for 13th in passing.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay didn't have a 1,000-yard runner or receiver in 1999, however
Steckel inherits plenty of talent to work with.
</P>
<P>
	   Quarterback Shaun King was 5-2 as a starter after replacing the injured
Trent Dilfer in November. Warrick Dunn and Mike Alstott give the Bucs the
potential to have one of the league's better running attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "He will do it his way," Dungy said of how much input Steckel will have in
changing the offense. "You can win any way -- running the ball, throwing the
ball ... The important thing is everybody has to believe in what you're doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Steckel, then 37, followed Bud Grant as coach of the Vikings in 1984 and
compiled a 3-13 record in his only season as a head coach. During 17 seasons as
a pro assistant, he has worked for the 49ers, Vikings, Patriots, Broncos and
Oilers/Titans, who hired him as receivers coach in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Pelt Peacekeepers With Rock  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A crowd of angry Serbs pelted
American and German peacekeepers with rocks and bricks Sunday during a massive
house-to-house search for illegal weapons in this tense, ethnically divided
Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
	   The weapons search was a bid to halt a spiral of violence that has been
building since Feb. 2, when two Serbs died in a rocket attack on a U.N. bus.
Nine people have been killed and dozens arrested in violence since in Kosovska
Mitrovica, which is divided into predominantly Serb and predominantly ethnic
Albanian sides of town.
</P>
<P>
	   French Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, a spokesman for the NATO-led peacekeeping
force, said soldiers from a dozen countries found no weapons in the southern
section, where mostly ethnic Albanians live.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Serb northern part, where the Americans and some Germans came under
attack from an angry crowd, he said soldiers found plastic explosives, 15 rifles
and handguns, one grenade, one machine gun and loads of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was arrested. Those injured included two American peacekeepers,
one with a broken nose and one with a chipped tooth, and three Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,300 troops, including French, Americans, Germans and Canadians, set
out shortly after dawn to conduct the major search operation on both sides of
the Ibar River, which divides the town, said Lt. Cmdr. Philip Anido, a NATO
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   Peacekeepers' helicopters circled above Kosovska Mitrovica, dropping
leaflets that read: ``Attention! Attention! KFOR (Kosovo Force) soldiers are
here to search for weapons. Hand over your weapons when asked to do so by KFOR
soldiers. Do not impede KFOR operations. KFOR soldiers will treat you with
dignity and respect.''
</P>
<P>
	   The troops went from house to house and building to building, searching
through areas where the peacekeepers suspect there may be weapons and criminal
activity, Anido said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Americans, who were searching in the Serb north of the city, met with an
increasingly hostile crowd that began throwing snowballs at their armored
vehicles. Later, the crowd hurled stones and broken bricks. The hail of rock
continued as the Americans drove south toward the ethnic Albanian section of
town hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb officials bitterly complained about alleged acts of violence and
intimidation committed by the Americans. Defying the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. town
curfew, about 200 Serbs stood in protest for an hour Sunday evening on their
side of the river, next to the main bridge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Americans were smashing doors, destroying furniture. There was no reason
for such behavior,'' said Oliver Ivanovic, a local Serb leader. Earlier in the
day, Ivanovic said the Americans had broken all the doors in a student dormitory
and also searched for weapons in the north side's children's hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   But U.S. spokesman Capt. Russel Berg called the troops and the U.N. military
police who assisted them ``very disciplined.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was no action on the part of the American soldiers'' that would have
incited a confrontation with the Serbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against separatists here.
After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to withdraw last spring, ethnic
Albanians began attacking Serbs as revenge.
</P>
<P>
	   With so many Serbs and ethnic Albanians living in the same community,
Kosovska Mitrovica is the most ethnically mixed city in the province -- and the
most violence-prone. Chanliau said the weapons searches would continue until
Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, the German commander of the peacekeeping force, is
satisified that the job has been done.

<HEADLINE> 2 Die in Northeast Avalanches  </HEADLINE>
   By J.M. HIRSCH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- An avalanche on New England's highest peak smothered a
skier Sunday, one day after a different avalanche killed a skier in upstate New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   David McPhedran of Kents Hill, Maine, and a friend were skiing in an area of
Mount Washington called the Gulf of Slides when the avalanche hit about 1 p.m.
Only Aimee Reiter survived, said Col. Ron Alie of the New Hampshire Fish and
Game Department.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They decided to climb up one of the gullies to ski down it and caused the
avalanche, which swept them down the gully,'' Alie said. ``She was buried
waist-deep, but David was buried face down.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reiter, also of Kents Hill, climbed out and uncovered McPhedran, 42, but was
unable to save him, Alie said.
</P>
<P>
	   With heavy snowfall and rough weather conditions, Mount Washington is one of
the few places in the East where avalanches are a danger. During the last
century, 126 people have died there.
</P>
<P>
	   Anna Porter, a weather observer at the Mount Washington Observatory, said
wind gusts reached 64 mph at the summit Sunday afternoon. Visibility was
one-sixteenth of a mile with blowing snow and freezing fog, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6,288-foot mountain is known as home to some of the world's worst
weather and was the site of the highest wind speed ever recorded -- 231 mph on
April 12, 1934.
</P>
<P>
	   A recorded message at the Appalachian Mountain Club on Sunday morning warned
that the avalanche danger for the mountain's Tuckerman and Huntington ravines
was high and that traveling on them was not recommended.
</P>
<P>
	   The club said the danger is due, in part, to more than a foot of snow that
fell Friday night and Saturday and to the high winds.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, a rare avalanche in northern New York's Adirondacks killed Toma
Jacob Vracarich, 27, of Lake Placid, N.Y., and injured five other skiers. The
avalanche occurred off-trail on the northeast side of Wright Peak, on the
outskirts of Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
	   One skier in the group described seeing fracture lines opening in the snow
and then hearing a rumble as the skiers were swept down the slope.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like being strained through the woods, just like a little pinball
being pushed through the woods by a 100-mph force,'' said Rohan Roy of
Chateaugay, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in Vermont posted avalanche warnings last week at Smugglers'
Notch, popular among skiers, and on Vermont 108, a state highway.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my 13 years I have never seen anything like this. There are fracture
lines all over the place,'' said Sgt. Butch Patch of the Vermont Army National
Guard.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Several large rolls of newsprint caught fire at the
Lexington Herald-Leader Sunday evening, sparking a blaze that caused at least
$72,000 worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The newsprint rolls, weighing about 2,000 pounds each, caught fire shortly
before 7 p.m. Firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, which started in the
paper warehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire Department Maj. Jim Wells did not know what caused the fire, which was
held in check by automatic sprinklers until firefighters arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   The printing press and other areas of the four-story newspaper building were
not damaged, although the building was evacuated for about an hour. About 120
rolls of the newsprint, worth about $600 each, were burned or damaged by water
used to extinguish the fire, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   Herald-Leader officials did not expect a significant delay in the production
or delivery of Monday's paper.

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina, including his visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs a ``conservative who will not yield to
the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is Mr. King suggesting I have an anti-Catholic bias because I went to a
university,'' Bush asked at one stop. ``I go to universities all the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So with all due respect to Congressman King, he can make any decision he
wants to make, but he should not ascribe anything to my heart because my record
is a lot different from what he thinks it might be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, recently coverted
to Catholicism after being married a Catholic woman for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Detroit, he jabbed at McCain, saying voters would pick a leader
like himself who is talking about education reforms and strengthening the
military over ``somebody who's trying to cast aspersions on his opponent. I
suspect they're going to pick like they did in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier appearance, he continued to emphasize the positive. ``I'm
going to continue to talk about how to bring our country together. I'm going to
talk about a better tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and several aides also took issue with McCain's concession speech
Saturday night in which he said the campaign was a choice ``between experience
and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the America voters, the people in Michigan, are going to have to
judge how each of us reacts,'' Bush said. ``Now they've had a chance to see each
of us react to victory and each of us react to defat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also underscored a theme he had used in South Carolina, that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. His remarks had a distinctly Michigan
cast as he cited the example of Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat and lawyer for
suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian, who Bush said had been ``making noises'' about
voting.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans should say to him, 'You're not going to pick the Republican
nominee,'' Bush said of Fieger.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
McCain questioned Bush's integrity, comparing him to President Clinton, in an ad
that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush vetoed the original HMO bill because
it gave a blanket exemption for the state's largest HMOs and that he
subsequently issued patients' rights regulations treating all the same. He said
the governor allowed the second bill to become law without his signature as a
way of signaling trial lawyers not to abuse a provision that allows HMOs to be
sued after an independent review.
</P>
<P>
	   As to spending, Fleischer said spending increased only 2 percent under Bush
when adjusted for inflation and a growing population. He added that Bush cut the
rate of spending growth in half -- again adjusted for inflation and
demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his message
further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the guy with
the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, First Lady Court N.Y. Voters  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Standing at a pulpit once used by Martin Luther King
Jr., Al Gore on Sunday said the Republicans who are trying to keep him from the
White House are ``morally blind.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president, with Senate candidate and first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at his side, was campaigning for support among New York's increasingly
politically important community.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sometimes impassioned speech to more than 800 people at a largely black
church, Gore accused the Republican challengers for the White House of being
blind to racism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are those who have 20/20 vision who are morally blind ... some of
those individuals just left the state of South Carolina,'' Gore said, his
reference to Saturday's GOP primary drawing laughter from the audience at the
Wilborn Temple First Church of God in Christ.
</P>
<P>
	   Mentioning the Confederate battle flag that flies over the South Carolina
state Capitol, Gore paraphrased a Bob Dylan song and said, ``They looked at that
flag and they turned their heads and pretended that they just didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the flag, ``that accumulated heritage of injustice,'' he said the
Republican reaction reminded him of those who say racism is gone and that
America has become color blind.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They use their color blind the way duck hunters use their duck blinds --
they hide behind it and hope the ducks won't know what they're up to,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore and the first lady, campaigning together for the first time this year
in New York where Clinton is making history as the first first lady to seek
public office, had warm words for each other, and a few hugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She stands for the best values of New York state,'' Gore said of Clinton,
who is pitted against New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the Senate race.
``Her voice will be heard. Her vision will make a difference ... I will stand up
for her.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a brief interview with The Associated Press, Clinton said she was ``just
honored to help him in any way that I can. I was grateful for the chance to
appear with him because I don't get to see him so often now that he's all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We used to work together very closely on a lot of issues ... I'm very fond
of him personally as well as very supportive of him as our next president,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-hour service was part of the annual weekend conference sponsored
by the state Legislature's black and Hispanic caucus. It came a day before Gore
and Democratic presidential rival Bill Bradley were to debate at the Apollo
Theatre in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   After some handshaking, Gore took off for New York City where he was meeting
with the editorial board of The Amsterdam News, a major black-oriented
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   The conference brings together hundreds of the state's top black and
Hispanic leaders, who represent an increasingly powerful voting bloc in New York
state. Blacks and Hispanics made up 15 percent of voters in the state's 1998
election for governor and U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   A big test of that minority voting power will come in the March 7 primary,
which is considered a major showdown for Gore and Bradley, a former New York
Knicks basketball star. Both have made major appeals to minorities in their bids
for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   While there has been speculation that Gore and the first lady didn't want to
be seen together as they work to escape the long shadow of President Clinton,
aides to both have denied that is true.
</P>
<P>
	   One Gore adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said last week that
``for the next 19 days, she helps us tremendously. Her numbers are just off the
charts with Democratic primary voters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some of those attending the service appeared surprised by Gore's address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was the first time I've seen Gore really speak with some passion,''
said Joseph Rhodes III, 47, of New York City.

	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Governor
George W. Bush kicked off their campaigns in Michigan today, two days before the
state's primary. "We won round one," McCain said, referring to his landslide in
New Hampshire's presidential primary on Feb. 1. "Governor Bush won round two," a

center of a custody battle involving his relatives in Miami and his father in
Cuba, who wants him returned. Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said
today that he saw no reason why the hearing should be postponed. Davis would not

Belgians Protest Haider's Inclusion

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Thousands of Belgians took to the streets Sunday
to protest against a far-right party's inclusion in the Austrian government. It
was the latest of dozens of similar marches across Europe since Joerg Haider's
Freedom Party joined the new coalition government in Austria. The outrage stems
from Haider's opposition to immigration and rapid EU expansion, as well as
previous statements praising some Nazi policies. He has since apologized. The
march marked the end of a weekend of organized anti-Haider protest in many
European capitals.

Chinese Leader Orders Smuggle Crackdown

<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- China's premier has ordered customs agents to step up their
efforts in an 18-month-old smuggling crackdown that has already uncovered the
biggest corruption scandal in 50 years of communist rule. A state-run
newspaper's Web site reported last month that nearly $10 billion in smuggled
goods flowed through Xiamen and that 159 people were involved. The crackdown
early on netted China's top police official in charge of combatting smuggling.
Among those under arrest are China's top immigration officer, two city deputy
party secretaries, a vice mayor and police officials, the Guangzhou Daily's Web
site reported. Chinese leaders have remained virtually silent about the scandal
and have ordered a news blackout until the investigation is finished.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Temple 77, No. 1 Cincy 69  </HEADLINE>
    By TERRY KINNEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Temple beat No. 1 Cincinnati in all the unconventional
ways Sunday, stopping the nation's longest winning streak and confusing Bearcats
coach Bob Huggins.
</P>
<P>
	   "We did everything you're not supposed to be able to do against Temple,"
Huggins said after the No. 15 Owls beat Cincinnati 77-69. "But they made the
shots."
</P>
<P>
	   Huggins looked at the statistics in amazement. Cincinnati had 24 points in
the paint to 12 for Temple; the Bearcats had twice as many points off turnovers
and second-chance points.
</P>
<P>
	   But Temple also did something nobody had done against Cincinnati in 63
games. The Owls shot 52 percent from the field. Nobody had shot 50 percent
against Cincinnati since Alabama-Birmingham did it March 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were a lot of big shots that broke our hearts," said freshman DerMarr
Johnson, who led Cincinnati with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mark Karcher scoring 22 of his 28 points in the second half, Temple
made the most of its usually gritty defense and rallied after Cincinnati took a
seven-point lead, its biggest of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coach told me to slow down and take what they gave me," Karcher said.
</P>
<P>
	   "He has a tendency to come off screens and just shoot it. But today he was a
little more patient," said Temple coach John Chaney.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can hit that mid-range jumper. We had to do that to keep it out of the
middle and away from the big guy."
</P>
<P>
	   The "big guy" -- Kenyon Martin had 13 points and 10 rebounds for Cincinnati
(24-2). Pete Mickeal had 14 and Kenny Satterfield 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Quincy Wadley added 16 points for Temple (20-4), and Lynn Greer had 15, all
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati had won 16 in a row -- tops in Division I -- and its home winning
streak was at 42 before Temple took command. The Owls have won 11 in a row, the
most since the 1993-94 season.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're good," Huggins said. "They beat us today. But if we play them
again, I don't know if they beat us again."
</P>
<P>
	   Chaney said beating Cincinnati might have been good for both teams.
</P>
<P>
	   "They can walk away knowing they lost a very close game and knowing they can
win a game like this," Chaney said. "I don't think this is the worst thing that
could have happened to them."
</P>
<P>
	   Huggins wasn't buying that.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody keeps trying to convince me losses are good. I'm having a hard
time with that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple's tight, matchup zone bothered Cincinnati all afternoon as the Owls
delivered yet another blow to the Bearcats. It was Temple that knocked
Cincinnati out of the NCAA tournament in the second round last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati was unable to generate any perimeter offense in the early going.
Temple, however, had no problems from outside.
</P>
<P>
	   Greer, who averages 12 points and has been shooting 36 percent from long
range, came off the bench to go 5-of-5 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   "Greer has been instant offense for us," Chaney said. "He and Quincy -- they
have been taking turns."
</P>
<P>
	   Temple led most of the first half, with Cincinnati's first lead coming with
1:25 left when Johnson hit the second of consecutive 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats led 34-33 at halftime and cranked up its defense -- briefly --
at the start of the second half. That produced a 9-0 run in which Logan hit two
3-pointers. His second gave Cincinnati a 53-46 lead at 10:31.
</P>
<P>
	   But Cincinnati was not able to contain Karcher, who scored 13 points during
a 16-8 run by Temple. From that point, Wadley took over, scoring eight points in
the final three minutes.

<HEADLINE> LA's Dreifort Hopes For Good Season  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Darren Dreifort can't think about last season, or
for that matter, his last two Septembers. There's no reason for the Los Angeles
Dodgers pitcher to dwell on the past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd love to be able to finish the season, but you never know until it's
over,'' Dreifort said Sunday. ``It's happened to me the last two years. I'm
feeling great all along, and all of a sudden, something comes up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dreifort's injury didn't show up on an MRI, so he blamed it on fatigue. Had
the Dodgers been in the pennant race either of the years, he might have toughed
it out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been, take a week off, rehab and then it's fine,'' he said. ``But by
that point, we're 10 games out, and we've got guys we've called up, and there's
no point in pushing it. There's no point getting back on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
	   After last season, in which Dreifort went 13-13 with a 4.79 ERA in 29
starts, he didn't throw again until December.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first season as a starter, Dreifort went 8-12 with a 4.00 ERA in 26
starts in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It takes time when you've been the kind of pitcher he's been in relief,
and all of a sudden, you become a starter,'' Dodger pitching coach Claude Osteen
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You don't just build up to 250 innings in one year,'' he said. ``You're
going from being a reliever at a very early age and being a power reliever where
they expect you to come in and throw the ball hard. You're trying to put the
fire out. So the change is a golden opportunity for him to learn what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
	   Osteen expects Dreifort to be better this season because he's learned about
starting, about what he can do and what he can't. Where he fits in the rotation
is less a worry -- at No. 2 behind Kevin Brown or at No. 3 behind Chan Ho Park.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Last year, Dreif pitched better than Chan Ho, but that doesn't mean that
much,'' Osteen said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a confidence factor, but it means both of them are capable of
pitching well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is also confident in Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expect him to pick up where he left off in the first half last season,''
Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Workers Exposed to Nerve Agent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOOELE, Utah (AP) -- Two workers repairing equipment at a chemical weapons
incinerator were exposed to a deadly nerve agent Sunday when it leaked into a
room where they were working.
</P>
<P>
	   The nerve agent did not show up in blood tests taken from the workers
immediately after the leak was discovered, and the workers showed no symptoms of
sarin exposure, said Deseret Chemical Depot spokesman Jon Pettebone.
</P>
<P>
	   When inhaled, sarin constricts the lungs and can halt breathing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were exposed, but they weren't affected,'' Pettebone said. ``There
was agent in the room.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pettebone said the sarin vapors were confined to the area and posed no
danger to the surrounding communities or environment.
</P>
<P>
	   The two workers were in a room at the Tooele Chemical Demilitarization
Facility repairing a conveyor belt that carries metal out of a decontamination
furnace used to destroy traces of the nerve agent from metal, such as large
containers.
</P>
<P>
	   The furnace had been turned off and allowed to cool before the workers
entered the area. They were in the room and unprotected when a sarin-detection
alarm went off, Pettebone said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They had their masks with them, but they did not have their masks on. The
alarm went off, and that's when they got out quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tooele incinerator, about 50 miles west of Salt Lake City, has been
operating since 1996. It was built to destroy nerve and blistering agents
stockpiled at the Army's Deseret Chemical Depot since World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   The plant's safety has been questioned by a former permit manager who last
month alleged that officials at the incinerator had rigged tests and misled
state regulators to conceal the plant's inability to safely destroy nerve
agents.
</P>
<P>
	   The former permit manager, Gary Harris, also said officials at the
incinerator knew residue from sarin remained on weapons parts sent to a Denver
scrap metal business between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials with the Army and EG&AMP;G Defense Systems Inc., the contractor that
runs the plant, say the incinerator is safe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army is investigating the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Republican Fight Shifts to Michigan  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Fresh from a South Carolina triumph, George W.
Bush said Sunday he was campaigning to ``bring our country together.'' John
McCain called his Republican rival a big-spender, then taunted, ``if he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both men moved through the first day of a tightly compressed campaign in
Michigan as the pace of the Republican presidential nomination battle quickened.
It fell to McCain, the underdog in uncontested need of a win, to outline the
stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We won round one,'' he said, referring to his landslide in New Hampshire's
presidential primary on Feb. 1. ``Governor Bush won round two,'' a lopsided win
in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now we go to round three,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the
momentum. McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who
had supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina, including his visit to Bob Jones University.
</P>
<P>
	   King, a Catholic, said America needs a ``conservative who will not yield to
the temptation of pandering in ways that support bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is Mr. King suggesting I have an anti-Catholic bias because I went to a
university,'' Bush asked at one stop. ``I go to universities all the time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So with all due respect to Congressman King, he can make any decision he
wants to make, but he should not ascribe anything to my heart because my record
is a lot different from what he thinks it might be.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that his brother Jeb, the governor of Florida, recently coverted
to Catholicism after being married a Catholic woman for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   One poll, taken before South Carolina voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. It
had Bush ahead in the GOP strongholds and McCain running stronger in the areas
where independent voters and blue collar, Reagan-style Democrats reside.
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary set for Tuesday, there was no time for either campaign to
make new television commercials, or even purchase additional time on the state's
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, flew in Saturday night and headed straight for the
Republican strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in Detroit, he jabbed at McCain, saying voters would pick a leader
like himself who is talking about education reforms and strengthening the
military over ``somebody who's trying to cast aspersions on his opponent. I
suspect they're going to pick like they did in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   At an earlier appearance, he continued to emphasize the positive. ``I'm
going to continue to talk about how to bring our country together. I'm going to
talk about a better tomorrow,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and several aides also took issue with McCain's concession speech
Saturday night in which he said the campaign was a choice ``between experience
and pretense.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the America voters, the people in Michigan, are going to have to
judge how each of us reacts,'' Bush said. ``Now they've had a chance to see each
of us react to victory and each of us react to defeat.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Mccain sharpened his rhetoric thoughout the day. In his last
appearance, in Grand Rapids, he criticized Bush's economic plan, saying it would
shortchange Social Security and Medicare while providing large tax cuts tilted
toward the wealthy. ``That's not conservative and that's not even grown up,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's claim to be a ``reformer
with results'' had connected, and also that voters believed McCain, more than
his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   That left McCain with a tricky task of trying to underscore his conservative
credentials at the same time he was angling to undercut Bush's claim of being a
reformer -- all the while upholding his pledge to run a positive campaign.
McCain questioned Bush's integrity, comparing him to President Clinton, in an ad
that aired in South Carolina but was not shown to Michigan voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain said Bush's record on spending
compared unfavorably with Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spending in Texas has almost doubled, while spending under Clinton has
been increased by 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At a rally in Livonia, he added that Bush had been a supporter of last
year's omnibus spending bill in Congress, a measure he said contained the ``most
outrageous pork barreling spending.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I voted against it,'' said McCain, who represents Arizona in the Senate.
``Governor Bush said he'd support it and sign it.''
</P>
<P>
	   To renew his appeal to independents, McCain criticized Bush's record on
campaign finance reform in scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Governor Bush is the governor of a state that has the most liberal
campaign contribution laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also said Bush takes credit for HMO reform in his state, when in fact,
``he vetoed the bill once and allowed it to become law without his signature.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said Bush vetoed the original HMO bill because
it gave a blanket exemption for the state's largest HMOs and that he
subsequently issued patients' rights regulations treating all the same. He said
the governor allowed the second bill to become law without his signature as a
way of signaling trial lawyers not to abuse a provision that allows HMOs to be
sued after an independent review.
</P>
<P>
	   As to spending, Fleischer said spending increased only 2 percent under Bush
when adjusted for inflation and a growing population. He added that Bush cut the
rate of spending growth in half -- again adjusted for inflation and
demographics.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time of his arrival in East Lansing, McCain had sharpened his message
further, saying, ``who do you want, a big spender, non-reformer, or the guy with
the record.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite his drubbing in South Carolina, McCain appeared upbeat throughout
the day. Sitting in cramped quarters aboard his campaign bus, he joked that the
lucky shoes he wears every day have a new name: ``unlucky shoes.''

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Ready for Final Push  </HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN D. SALANT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain outraised George W. Bush last month, even as the
Texas governor set records for total fund-raising and spending. And McCain
continued to narrow the financial gap between himself and Bush in February, at
least in advance of Saturday's South Carolina primary in which he was soundly
defeated by Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley reported that he had $8.9 million in the bank as of Jan. 31, while
Gore reported $8.1 million. Bradley was expecting an additional $6.9 million in
federal funds, bringing his total to $15.8 million. Gore expected $7.5 million
in federal funds, bringing his total to $15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The former New Jersey senator, who lost to Gore in both Iowa and New
Hampshire, needs a strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries March 7,
including both New York and California.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaign chairman Douglas Berman said the senator intended to use
his bank account to challenge Gore from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This race is a contest between a candidate who has strongly and
consistently supported Democratic Party principles such as a woman's right to
choose, common sense handgun control, and health care access for all, and a
candidate who has not,'' Berman said. ``We will take that case directly to the
voters between now and March 7 and will have the funds available to do so.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign officials noted that Bradley spent more money on television
advertising than the vice president in both Iowa and New Hampshire, and lost
both contests. Bradley reported spending $1.8 million on TV while Gore reported
spending $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, Bradley spent $5 million, bringing his total to $24.4 million,
while Gore spent $3.8 million, bringing his total to $27 million. Candidates who
accept federal funds are limited to spending around $40 million, plus certain
legal and accounting expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Al Gore's campaign won more and spent less than Bill Bradley in 2000,''
Gore campaign chairman Tony Coelho said. ``Voters clearly see that Al Gore has
the most experience and the best ideas to fight for working families. Bill
Bradley may outspend us on TV advertising, but Al Gore's message resonates
better with voters. We have the resources to carry that message across the
nation and win the Democratic nomination.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley raised $1.3 million in January -- bringing his total for the
campaign to $29.2 million -- and received $4.2 million in federal funds. The
federal government matches the first $250 of each individual contribution up to
$250 for candidates who agree to limit their spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Actress Marsha Mason contributed $1,000 to Bradley, as did Sherwood
Schwartz, the creator and producer of Gilligan's Island and the Brady Bunch.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore raised just $588,630 during the month, bringing his total to $29.6
million, plus $5.5 million in federal funds. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and wife Vickie each gave $1,000.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Republican side, Bush raised $2 million in January, bringing his
record-setting total to $70.7 million. He also spent $12.8 million -- more than
$3 million a week -- to win the Iowa caucuses and finish second behind McCain in
New Hampshire. Bush has spent at least $50.1 million -- more than any other
presidential candidate ever. He entered February with $20.5 million in the bank
-- more than McCain raised through Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of our strong, grassroots support from so many individuals in all
50 states, Americans are hearing and responding to my message as a reformer with
results,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain actually outraised Bush in January, taking in $2.5 million, to bring
his total to $18.2 million, including $2 million transferred from his Senate
account. He also borrowed $1 million against future federal funds. He spent $6.8
million, bringing his overall total to $21 million. McCain had $3.1 million in
the bank as of Jan. 31, including $2.8 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For months, people would tell us, 'I really like John McCain but there's
no way he can win,''' spokesman Dan Schnur said. ``Over the last couple of
months, they started changing their minds. When the polls started moving in New
Hampshire, our fund raising started increasing dramatically. But after we won,
it has exploded.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since his victory in the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary, McCain has raised an
additional $8 million, including $3.5 million via the Internet, a senior
campaign official said. Including expected federal matching funds, McCain now
has $8 million in the bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Continuing to spend at the rate of $3 million a week, Bush is below the $20
million mark, and campaign aides said last week that he would begin raising
money again to replenish his campaign coffers.
</P>
<P>
	   The third Republican in the race, Alan Keyes, raised $655,842 in January,
bringing his total to $5.1 million. He also borrowed $380,000 and received
$616,629 in federal funds. Keyes, who finished third in Iowa, spent $1.9
million, bringing his campaign total to $5.6 million.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Killed After Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Paramilitary gunmen killed a convicted murderer who
had hijacked a domestic flight at knifepoint and forced it to land, authorities
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The body Hernando Prada, convicted of five murders and serving a 50-year
jail sentence, was found with several gunshot wounds, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The strange event began Saturday as two armed guards escorted Prada aboard a
plane at Bucaramanga airport in northwestern Colombia, with plans to transfer
him to a prison in Cucuta, officials said. Seventeen other passengers were on
the Beechcraft 1900 propellor craft.
</P>
<P>
	   Prada drew a knife eight minutes into the flight, held the guards at bay and
forced the pilot to land at a remote airstrip near El Tornillo, 240 miles north
of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said he took one of his guards hostage as he fled on foot. But a
right-wing paramilitary squad spotted the plane as it landed, and quickly caught
Prada, said Ivan Dario Zapata, regional director of the National Penitentiary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Zapata said the militiamen handed over the prison guard to authorities and
confessed to killing Prada. But Zapata said they didn't explain themselves
further.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal paramilitary groups are present in much of rural Colombia, where
they battle for local control against leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were unable to explain how Prada had smuggled the knife onboard the
flight. Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Gomez Mendez said Sunday that his office would
investigate how a dangerous prisoner was allowed to travel on a passenger flight
with no handcuffs.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 3, Rangers 2  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- John LeClair scored his 30th goal midway through the third
period Sunday night to rally Philadelphia to a 3-2 victory over the New York
Rangers in the Flyers' first game without coach Roger Neilson.
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson, 65, has multiple myeloma -- a rare form of bone marrow cancer --
and will be away from the team for the remainder of the regular season and at
least through one round of playoffs while undergoing treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   LeClair became just the third Flyers player to record five straight 30-goal
seasons when he put Philadelphia ahead 7:41 into the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Jones passed to LeClair at the right of Rangers goalie Kirk McLean and
LeClair knocked it in.
</P>
<P>
	   The goal came just 3:34 after Philadelphia tied it.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, clinging to the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference, is
in an 0-4-1 stretch. The Rangers, one point ahead of ninth-place Buffalo, are
1-5-2 since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers, who own the league's top power play, are 0-for-20 -- including
0-for-3 Sunday -- with the man-advantage spanning five games.
</P>
<P>
	   But Philadelphia got the tying goal 4:07 into the third, 12 seconds after a
penalty to Petr Nedved expired. Valeri Zelepukin waited behind the Rangers net
and found an opening to get the puck to Mikael Renberg, who tipped in his eighth
goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Flyers goalie John Vanbiesbrouck had shut out the Rangers in two previous
meetings this season, but New York finally solved him.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanbiesbrouck, who has lost his grip as the Flyers No. 1 goalie and been
criticized for allowing soft goals, gave up another one that gave the Rangers a
2-1 lead. Rookie Mike York skated in and, as Vanbiesbrouck hugged the left post,
slipped a shot past the goalie's left pad at 13:56.
</P>
<P>
	   York leads NHL rookies with 19 goals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Flyers grabbed a 1-0 lead in the first on Daymond Langkow's 13th goal at
11:30. Langkow has scored in three of Philadelphia's last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Radek Dvorak tied it on a spectacular short-handed breakaway, started by
Nedved, at 7:59 of the second.
</P>
<P>
	   From behind his own net, Nedved lifted the puck down the ice. Dvorak gained
control in the Philadelphia zone along the right boards, stick-handled deftly
around defenseman Chris Therien and deked to beat Vanbiesbrouck between the
pads.
</P>
<P>
	   Dvorak, who has 14 goals, has scored twice and set up five others in six
games.
</P>
<P>
	   The score stopped a scoreless drought of 127:59 the Rangers had against
Philadelphia and Vanbiesbrouck this season.
</P>
<P>
	   McLean made 28 saves in place of Mike Richter, who missed his fourth game
since injuring his knee during All-Star weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanbiesbrouck stopped 30 shots, including a few in the last 30 seconds after
McLean was pulled for an extra skater.

   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- A former intelligence minister whose agents were
accused of killing political enemies was among leading hard-liners going down to
defeat Sunday as it became increasingly clear that Iranians want a reform-minded
parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   If the returns from Friday's election continue to favor the reformists, as
is likely, it will be the first time the parliament is free of hard-line
domination since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
	   Results had been announced Sunday for 190 of the 290 seats in the Majlis, or
parliament. Winners are listed only by name, not affiliation, but a background
check of the candidates by The Associated Press showed the winners included 137
reformists -- or 72 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservatives had taken 44 seats, or 23 percent, and independents had nine
seats, or 5 percent. The Interior Ministry, in charge of the elections, will
announce the final results when they become known later this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, four provincial cities were reported calm after election-related
violence Saturday that left eight dead, Kayhan newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper said three teen-agers were killed and 10 injured when police fired
into a crowd that was trying to get into the governor's office in the town of
Dasht-e-Azadegan. The young men were angry that their candidate did not win, the
paper said. It did not give the candidate's affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   Five people were reportedly killed in the town of Shush in clashes with
police. They were protesting the re-election of a candidate they accused of
vote-buying, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
	   In Isfahan, Iran's second-largest city, reformists won all five seats. A
big-name hard-line loser there was former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian.
</P>
<P>
	   Reformists have suggested that Fallahian should be officially questioned
about rogue Intelligence Ministry agents who murdered five dissidents in 1998.
In 1997, a German court issued a warrant for Fallahian, saying Iran's highest
rulers ordered the 1992 assassination of an Iranian-Kurdish opposition figure in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   A reformist wave has been sweeping Iran since the May 1997 election of
President Mohammad Khatami. The 56-year-old president, a moderate Shiite cleric,
has captured the hearts of the young with his efforts to widen individual
freedoms, free the press and reduce the clergy's interference in the government,
the judiciary and people's lives.
</P>
<P>
	   But Khatami's initiatives had been stymied by hard-liners who controlled the
outgoing Majlis.
</P>
<P>
	   With the new parliament convening in June, what remains to be seen is
whether the hard-liners will continue to use their key powers to block the
reformists. The Guardian Council, 12 clerics and lawyers, must approve all bills
passed by Parliament. And Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has the
final word. He heads the armed forces, judiciary and state-run radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration called the early returns as a clear signal of a
growing trend toward greater freedom. ``They (Iranians) want policies of
openness and engagement with the rest of the world'' and greater freedom at
home, said State Department spokesman James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. relations with Iran were broken off after religious zealots took
control of a revolution that had overthrown the Shah, seized the U.S. Embassy in
1979 and held Americans captive until January 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   After Khatami was elected, the Clinton administration undertook a mostly
unsuccessful effort to engage Tehran in a dialogue.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in the conservative camp appeared ready to accept the people's verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It has now been confirmed that the Iranians are responsible for their own
affairs,'' the hard-line Tehran Times said. It said Iranians have made clear
that the government must ``immediately address their problems to make the
society healthy and wealthy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such comments came as hard-liners were going down to defeat across the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Ali Zaddsar -- an outspoken hard-liner who was involved in a failed
impeachment bid against Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani -- lost his seat in
Jiroft in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
	   Another conservative stalwart who went down in the voting was Ahmed
Rasouli-Nejad, an incumbent from Damavand in northern Iran. Rasouli-Nejad played
a role in the 1998 impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri and last
year's bid to impeach Mohajerani. Both Nouri and Mohajerani support Khatami's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Nouri, who is serving a five-year jail sentence on charges that included
religious dissent, was allowed to go home on leave Sunday. Leaves are granted to
Iranian prisoners for definite periods to visit family. Nouri's lasts until
Wednesday.

Republican Hopefuls Head To Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- The Republican Presidential race relocated to
Michigan today as Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Governor George W. Bush
readied for the state's Tuesday primary. One poll, taken before South Carolina
voted, rated Michigan a toss-up. Exit polls in South Carolina showed that Bush's
claim to be a "reformer with results" had connected, and also that voters
believed McCain, more than his rival, had engaged in unfair attacks. For his
part, Mccain sharpened his rhetoric throughout the day. In his last appearance,
in Grand Rapids, he criticized Bush's economic plan, saying it would shortchange
Social Security and Medicare while providing large tax cuts tilted toward the
wealthy.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed today with the Federal Election Commission. Bradley reported that
he had $8.9 million in the bank as of Jan. 31, while Gore reported $8.1 million.
Bradley was expecting an additional $6.9 million in federal funds, bringing his
total to $15.8 million. Gore expected $7.5 million in federal funds, bringing
his total to $15.6 million.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling the case of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was hospitalized today and may have suffered a stroke, two of the
judge's colleagues said. The judge had been scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday
to decide whether the court has jurisdiction in Elian's case. The boy is at the
center of a custody battle involving his relatives in Miami and his father in
Cuba, who wants him returned. Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said
today that he saw no reason why the hearing should be postponed. Davis would not
elaborate, but according to attorneys and federal judges, another judge could
step in to hear the case.

2 Workers Exposed to Nerve Agent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TOOELE, Utah (AP) -- Two workers repairing equipment at a chemical weapons
incinerator were exposed to a deadly nerve agent today when it leaked into a
room where they were working. The nerve agent did not show up in blood tests
taken from the workers immediately after the leak was discovered, and the
workers showed no symptoms of sarin exposure, said Deseret Chemical Depot
spokesman Jon Pettebone. When inhaled, sarin constricts the lungs and can halt
breathing. The Tooele incinerator, about 50 miles west of Salt Lake City, has
been operating since 1996. It was built to destroy nerve and blistering agents
stockpiled at the Army's Deseret Chemical Depot since World War II.

captured during a clash over control of a teachers' college, according to news
reports today. Several police and protesters were injured during the weekend
protest in the Hidalgo state town of Tepatepec, 50 miles north of Mexico City,
the reports said. Protesters also burned more than a dozen police cars. The
latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school early
Saturday morning to end a seven-week student takeover.

NASA Shuttle Gathers More Map Data

	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Endeavour's astronauts squeezed
in one last day of Earth mapping today, giving scientists more radar data than
they had expected a week ago. By the time the astronauts pull in their 197-foot
radar mast Monday morning, they will have surveyed three-quarters of the world's
terrain. The Defense Department will use the maps to improve its aim of missiles
and its deployment of troops. Most everyone else will have to settle for less
precise data because of national security issues, but the information still will
be far superior to what is currently available.

No. 15 Temple 77, No. 1 Cincy 69
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Temple stopped the nation's longest winning streak today,
beating No. 1 Cincinnati 77-69 on a court where the Bearcats usually rule. With
Mark Karcher scoring 22 of his 28 points in the second half, No. 15 Temple made
the most of a gritty defense. Cincinnati had won 16 in a row -- tops in Division
I -- and its home-court winning streak was at 42 before Temple took command. The
Owls have won 11 in a row, the most since the 1993-94 season. Temple's tight,
matchup zone bothered Cincinnati all afternoon. The Owls delivered yet another
blow to the Bearcats, having knocked Cincinnati out of the NCAA tournament in
the second round last year.

<HEADLINE> Prisoner Killed After Hijacking  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Paramilitary gunmen killed a convicted murderer who
had hijacked a domestic flight at knifepoint and forced it to land, authorities
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   The body of Hernando Prada, convicted of five murders and serving a 50-year
jail sentence, was found with several gunshot wounds, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   The strange event began Saturday as two armed guards escorted Prada aboard a
plane at Bucaramanga airport in northwestern Colombia, with plans to transfer
him to a prison in Cucuta, officials said. Seventeen other passengers were on
the Beechcraft 1900 propellor craft.
</P>
<P>
	   Prada drew a knife eight minutes into the flight, held the guards at bay and
forced the pilot to land at a remote airstrip near El Tornillo, 240 miles north
of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said he took one of his guards hostage as he fled on foot. But a
right-wing paramilitary squad spotted the plane as it landed, and quickly caught
Prada, said Ivan Dario Zapata, regional director of the National Penitentiary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   Zapata said the militiamen handed over the prison guard to authorities and
confessed to killing Prada. But Zapata said they didn't explain themselves
further.
</P>
<P>
	   Illegal paramilitary groups are present in much of rural Colombia, where
they battle for local control against leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   Police were unable to explain how Prada had smuggled the knife onboard the
flight. Chief Prosecutor Alfonso Gomez Mendez said Sunday that his office would
investigate how a dangerous prisoner was allowed to travel on a passenger flight
with no handcuffs.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. dollar inched down against the yen Monday morning in
quiet trading because of a market holiday in the United States. Japanese stocks
fell.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 110.65 yen at late morning, down 0.09 from late Friday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 110.96 yen on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 162.85 points, or 0.82
percent, to 19,626.18 at the end of the morning session. On Friday, the average
closed down 2.37 points, or 0.01 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar traded in a narrow range in Asian trading
Monday morning partly because U.S. financial markets were to be closed Monday
for the Presidents' Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar slightly reversed its recent course.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past few weeks, the dollar has been moving higher against the yen,
thanks to favorable prospects for U.S. economic growth coupled with low
inflation and slightly higher interest rates -- all positive factors for the
greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the yen has been vulnerable to selling pressure after American
ratings agency Moody's Investors Services said last week it would review Japan's
local currency debt rating for possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 109.20 yen, down from 109.42 yen
late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, the Nikkei average moved lower on investor concerns the
U.S. economy could slow with future interest rate hikes. A weaker U.S. economy
would hurt Japanese companies that sell products there.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 295.05 points, or 2.8
percent, to close at 10,219.52 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 26.67 points, or 1.55 percent, to 1,693.10. The TOPIX closed up
2.66 points, or 0.15 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8000
percent from Friday's finish of 1.8200 percent. Its price rose 0.17 point to
99.14. (km-dj)

<HEADLINE> Peck Makes Final Stage Performance  </HEADLINE>
    By BRAD CAIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- He sounded like the Gregory Peck of old Sunday night,
but the 83-year-old veteran actor moved slowly and with a cane as he made his
final stage performance.
</P>
<P>
	   After charming audiences with a one-man show about his life for the past
five years, the screen legend performed his last "A Conversation with Mr.
Gregory Peck" in the historic Elsinore Theater, regaling the audience with
anecdotes from his 52-year film career with a blend of film clips, readings and
stories.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the end of my first farewell tour," Peck said, joking before the
show. He said he was through with major roles but "I'm available for a smashing
cameo."
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Malins, a spokeswoman for the Theater, said Peck told her: "I just
want to stop now."
</P>
<P>
	   During Sunday's two-hour show, the Oscar-winning actor recounted a
near-disaster on the set of "Moby Dick" (1956), called "Roman Holiday" (1953)
co-star Audrey Hepburn one of his favorites and said Atticus Finch from "To Kill
a Mockingbird" (1962) was the character he identified with most.
</P>
<P>
	   Peck said he jumped at the chance to play Finch, the Depression-era country
lawyer who defends a black man falsely accused of rape, and he made it clear
that "To Kill a Mockingbird" was the highlight of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just felt I could be on the same wavelength as Atticus Finch," Peck said.
"It was the closest thing to the real me."
</P>

	   Peck also talked about floating alone and thinking he was lost at sea during
the filming of "Moby Dick." As Captain Ahab, he was strapped to a large rubber
whale for what was supposed to be the movie's climactic duel with the great
white whale.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of using a stunt double for the scene, he said, "I wanted people to
recognize me on the back of that rubber whale. I almost bought the farm. The tow
line broke, and I got lost in a fog bank."
</P>
<P>
	   Peck said he was urged to share memories of his career by another film
giant, the late Cary Grant, who performed on a similar tour that Peck has now
outdone by giving nearly 70 performances of his stage show in the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Peck's last major role was in "Old Gringo" in 1989.

    OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jason Caffey scored 25 points and matched his career
high with 16 rebounds Sunday night, leading the Golden State Warriors to a
112-103 victory over the Washington Wizards.
</P>
<P>
	   Billy Owens had 18 points and 12 rebounds and Larry Hughes added 16 points.
The Warriors have won both games since acquiring Owens and Hughes in a
three-team trade last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Jahidi White scored a season-high 23 points and had 14 rebounds for the
Wizards, who lost their seventh in a row. Washington dropped its 15th
consecutive road game, and hasn't won away from the MCI Center since beating
Detroit 97-83 on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   White scored 12 in the third quarter as the Wizards tried to come back from
a 16-point deficit. Strickland scored late in the period to bring Washington
within eight, but Mookie Blaylock responded with a basket at the buzzer for the
Warriors.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitch Richmond, the Wizards' leading scorer, was ejected late in the first
half after being assessed two technical fouls by referee Bennie Adams.
</P>
<P>
	   Richmond was driving toward the basket when Blaylock came from behind to
knock the ball loose. The ball caromed off Richmond's knee and out of bounds,
and Golden State got possession.
</P>
<P>
	   Wizards coach Darrell Walker wanted a foul call, and received a technical
for his efforts. Richmond continued the argument and was whistled for two quick
technical fouls.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaylock made two of the three free throws to help the Warriors take a 61-47
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wizards led by as many as seven points in the early going, but Golden
State went on a 15-2 run to close out the first quarter and take a 29-23 lead.
Washington was held scoreless the final 3:14 of the period.

<HEADLINE> Judge in Elian Case Hospitalized  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA WALEWSKI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling the case of 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez was hospitalized Sunday after suffering stroke-like symptoms, his wife
and doctor said.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, had been scheduled to
hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court has jurisdiction in Elian's
case. Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said he will preside over the
hearing and that the case eventually will be reassigned to another judge. The
boy is at the center of a custody battle involving his relatives in Miami and
his father in Cuba, who wants him sent home.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, 77, was taken to the hospital by ambulance with slurred speech and
was unable to move his right leg and arm, said Dr. James Stewart, a neurologist
at HealthSouth Doctors' Hospital of Coral Gables.
</P>
<P>
	   The symptoms, described by Stewart as a brain attack, appeared to be the
beginnings of a stroke. A stroke is when those symptoms last for 24 hours, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The improvement we've seen so far is what we want to see,'' Stewart told
The Miami Herald. ``We always want to see more.''
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Griffin Hoeveler, told the paper: ``He's responding beautifully.
He's talking now and his color is good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the 77-year-old judge complained of ``heart racing,'' she said. A
doctor had suggested he go to the hospital for tests, but Hoeveler declined.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman at the hospital could not confirm the judge was at the
hospital or give his condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Hoeveler, who presided over the trial of former Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega, was assigned the Elian case after Judge James Lawrence King withdrew
last month.

    HOUSTON (AP) -- Tim Duncan scored 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter
and overtime to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a 113-111 victory over the Houston
Rockets on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, who had just eight points and seven rebounds through three quarters,
fueled an 11-2 run in the fourth for the Spurs.

27 and scored 21 points and had nine rebounds as the Rockets' five-game home
winning streak was stopped. Cuttino Mobley added 20 points, and Steve Francis 19
points and 12 assists for Houston.
</P>
<P>
	   In the overtime, Duncan made his first shot, then converted two free throws
with 35 seconds left to give San Antonio a 109-107 lead. He then made a key
steal with 22 seconds to play. Terry Porter and Elie each hit a pair of free
throws in the final 20 seconds to seal the victory.

<HEADLINE> Nun: Cuban Grandma Wanted To Defect  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A nun involved in a meeting between Elian Gonzalez and his
Cuban grandmothers decided the 6-year-old should remain in the United States
after she was told one of the grandmothers wanted to defect, her spokeswoman
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   After meeting with the grandmothers last month at her home in Miami Beach,
Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the president of Barry University, said she was
abandoning her neutral stance.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was influenced to change her position by several things she had
been told about the case by people she trusted, Michele Morris, a spokeswoman
for Barry, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin didn't want to divulge the information to the media after the
reunion because she heard it secondhand, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald reported that one of the grandmothers told O'Laughlin
directly that she wanted to defect. But O'Laughlin said Sunday in a statement
that ``unfortunately the article had some misinformation. I never met with the
grandmothers alone.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``While some of the specifics noted in the Herald contributed to my
decision, it is untrue that I heard any of that from the grandmothers. Any
information attributed to them came from other sources,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald's executive editor, Martin Baron, said in a statement Sunday:
``We can say without hesitation that our story was an accurate account of what
Sister Jeanne told us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube on Thanksgiving Day off the
Florida coast. His mother and 10 others traveling with him in an effort to flee
Cuba drowned.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Laughlin was told by people she trusted that Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, and his family knew about the voyage to Florida 10 days before the
boat left Cuba, Morris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Herald quoted the nun as saying she learned that Elian's father had been
physically abusive to the boy's mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This talk of defecting got me to thinking; if one of the adults wanted
out, perhaps it was not a good place for the child,'' she told the Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from Elian's family in Cuba or from the
Cuban government. O'Laughlin has been maligned by Cuban media since saying Elian
should stay with his relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   When O'Laughlin first told reporters she had changed her mind about
remaining neutral, she said she believed Elian had bonded with his 21-year-old
cousin Marisleysis Gonzalez. She also said she sensed fear emanating from the
grandmothers, which she believed was caused by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is currently staying with relatives in Miami. The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service has ruled in favor of his return to Cuba and to his
father, but Elian's U.S. relatives are challenging that decision in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
	   A Miami judge will hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court has
jurisdiction in the case. The judge, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler,
was hospitalized Sunday and Chief U.S. District Judge Edward B. Davis said he
will preside over the hearing.

Bush, McCain Move on to Michigan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Arizona Senator John McCain and Texas Governor
George W. Bush kicked off their campaigns in Michigan Sunday, two days before
the state's primary. "We won round one," McCain said, referring to his landslide
in New Hampshire's presidential primary on Feb. 1. "Governor Bush won round
two," a lopsided win in South Carolina. "Now we go to round three," he said.
Bush strategists were hoping South Carolina would give their man the momentum.
McCain countered with an endorsement from Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who had
supported Bush but said he was put off by the candidate's appeal in South
Carolina as well as his visit to Bob Jones University.

	   MIAMI (AP) -- The federal judge handling Elian Gonzalez's case was
hospitalized Sunday and may have suffered a stroke, two of the judge's
colleagues said. One colleague of U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler who
has been in touch with Hoeveler's family said the situation was not as grave as
it initially appeared. Both colleagues spoke on condition of anonymity. The
judge had been scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday to decide whether the court
has jurisdiction in Elian's case. The boy is at the center of a custody battle
involving his relatives in Miami and his father in Cuba, who wants him returned.
Officials said there is no reason for the hearing to be postponed.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and Bill Bradley had about the same amount of
money to spend in the five weeks leading up to the March 7 primaries that likely
will determine the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to
reports filed Sunday with the Federal Election Commission. Meanwhile, Sen. John
McCain outraised George W. Bush last month, even as the Texas governor set
records for total fund-raising and spending. And McCain continued to narrow the
financial gap between himself and Bush in February, at least in advance of
Saturday's South Carolina primary in which he was soundly defeated by Bush.

latest violence began as hundreds of state police raided the school early

Microsoft Moves to Ban Long Temps
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is limiting its temporary workers to
one year of employment at a time, with 100-day intervals in between -- a move
that will force up to 1,500 of its long-term contract workers to find new jobs
or seek permanent positions with the company. Microsoft's policy change,
announced Friday, follows pressure from litigation and union organizers to bar
use of so-called "permatemps" -- temporary workers who stay in the same job for
years, but without the benefits offered permanent workers. Microsoft began
informing temp agencies early last week of the new policy, which goes into
effect July 1.

Prisoner Killed After Hijacking

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Paramilitary gunmen killed Hernando Prada Sunday, a
convicted murderer who had hijacked a domestic flight at knifepoint. Prada,
convicted of five murders, was serving a 50-year jail sentence. The strange
event began Saturday as two armed guards escorted Prada aboard a plane at
Bucaramanga airport in northwestern Colombia, with plans to transfer him to a
prison in Cucuta. Prada drew a knife eight minutes into the flight, held the
guards at bay and forced the pilot to land at a remote airstrip near El
Tornillo, 240 miles north of Bogota. Officials said he took one of his guards
hostage as he fled on foot. A right-wing paramilitary squad spotted the plane as
it landed, and quickly caught Prada.

multiple myeloma -- a rare form of bone marrow cancer -- and will be away from
the team for the remainder of the regular season and at least through one round
of playoffs while undergoing treatment. LeClair became just the third Flyers
player to record five straight 30-goal seasons when he put Philadelphia ahead
7:41 into the final period.
